'''Astrolinguistics''' is a field of [[linguistics]] connected with the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).

== Early Soviet experiments ==

Arguably the first attempt to construct a language for interplanetary communication was made by the anarchist philosopher Wolf Gordin (brother of [[Abba Gordin]]) in his books ''Grammar of the Language of the Mankind AO'' (1920) and ''Grammar of the Language AO'' (1923)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dumka.be/sites/default/files/files/files/volf_gordin_-_grammatika_yazyka_ao_-_1923.pdf Wolf Gordin. Grammar of the Language AO (1923) (Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;. The ''AO'' language was presented at the First international exhibition of interplanetary machines and mechanisms (dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the Russian Revolution and the 70th anniversary of the birth of [[Tsiolkovsky]]) in Moscow, 1927 as a language for interplanetary travels&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Smith. Rockets and Revolution: A Cultural History of Early Spaceflight. University of Nebraska Press, 2014. P. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;. The declared goal of Gordin was to construct a language which would be non-"fetishizing", non-"sociomorphic", non-gender based and non-[[Class discrimination|classist]]. The design of the language was inspired by the [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futuristic poetry]], brothers Gordins' pan-anarchist philosophy and early Tsiolkovsky's remarks on possible cosmic messaging (which were in accord with later Freudenthal's insights)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/doc/hel_0750-8069_1995_num_17_2_2419 Kuznecov S. Linguistica cosmica: La naissance du paradigme cosmique // Une familière étrangeté: La linguistique russe et soviétique. Paris, 1995 (Histoire Épistémologie Langage. 17/11 (Tome XVII - fascicule 2)), p. 211-234.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Freudenthal's LINCOS==
{{main|Lincos (artificial language)}}
An integral part of the SETI project in general is research in the field of the construction of messages for extraterrestrial intelligence, possibly to be transmitted into space from Earth. As far as such messages are based on linguistic principles, the research can be considered to belong to astrolinguistics. The first proposal in this field was put forward by the mathematician [[Hans Freudenthal]] at the [[University of Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]], in 1960 – around the time of the first SETI effort at Greenbank in the US. Freudenthal conceived a complete Lingua Cosmica. His book ''[[Lincos (artificial language)|LINCOS: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse]]'' seems at first sight non-linguistic, because mathematical concepts are the core of the language.  The concepts are, however, introduced in conversations between persons (''Homo sapiens''), de facto by linguistic means. This is witnessed by the innovative examples presented. The book set a landmark in astrolinguistics. This was witnessed by Bruno Bassi's review years later. Bassi noted: “LINCOS is there. In spite of its somewhat ephimeral 'cosmic intercourse' purpose it remains a fascinating linguistic and educational construction, deserving existence as another Toy of Man's Designing”.

==Ollongren's LINCOS==
The concept astrolinguistics in scientific research was coined as such, also with a view towards message construction for ETI, in 2013 in the monograph  ''Astrolinguistics: Design of a Linguistic System for Interstellar Communication Based on Logic'', written by the astronomer and computer scientist [[Alexander Ollongren]], [[University of Leiden]], The Netherlands. This book presents a new Lingua Cosmica totally different from Freudenthal's design. It describes the way the logic of situations in human societies can be formulated in the lingua, also named LINCOS. This astrolinguistic system, also designed for use in interstellar communication, is based on modern constructive logic – which assures that all expressions are verifiable. At a deeper, more fundamental level, however, astrolinguistics is concerned with the question whether linguistic universalia can be identified which are potentially useful in communication across interstellar distances between intelligence species. In the view of the new LINCOS these might be certain logic descriptions of specific situations and relations (possibly in an Aristotelian sense). Kadri Tinn's (Astronomy for Humans) review of Ollongren's book recognised that aspect – she wrote:

{{Quote|Astrolinguistics is the study of interstellar languages and possibility of communication using an artificially created language that is self-contained and wouldn't include some of the aspects of natural languages. … new Lingua Cosmica is a language system based on applied logic, the understanding of which might be expected from a civilization that has developed technology advanced enough to receive radio emissions.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1980">'''Bite, snack and meal''' is a content writing and editing strategy. First put forth by Leslie O'Flahavan in 1997 during her web writing courses, but popularized in the 2001 Inc. article &lt;ref&gt;E-Write. The Bite, Snack and the Meal. Inc. Magazine. 29 June 2001. http://www.inc.com/articles/2001/06/23143.html&lt;/ref&gt; she co-wrote under the E-Write LLC by-line with Marilynne Rudick, her former partner in the business.

A method of [[chunking (writing)|chunking]] [[content (media)|content]] for the web, the bite, snack and meal approach entails [[writing]] for the appetite of a variety of web visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie O'Flahavan. The Bite, The Snack, And The Meal: How To Feed Content-Hungry Site Visitors. http://www.ewriteonline.com/bite-snack-and-meal-how-to-feed-content-hungry-site-visitors/

==Key Concepts==
* '''Bite''' - a [[headline]] with a message

"Wash a car without leaving streaks - research shows special technique works best"

When the option is available, the bite links to the content.
* '''Snack''' - a concise [[Abridgement|summary]] that provides enough information for a content overview&lt;ref&gt;Ginny Redish. Letting Go of the Words. Elsevier: 2012. Chapter 7, Section 3, p.134-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Wash your car the right way and you'll avoid annoying streaks, while saving water. Research from the Car Washing Institute of America's new study shows that starting at the top washing your way down works best. Avoid streaks, reduce damage from grit and reduce water use by 50% when you start at the top."

The snack then links to the content.
* '''Meal''' - the full, original content
Example: a lengthy article on washing a car.

'''Code-mixing''' is the mixing of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|language varieties]] in speech.{{efn|Although this article uses the terms ''speech'' and ''speaking'' following common practice in linguistics, these descriptions apply equally to [[Sign language|signed languages]].}}

Some scholars use the terms "code-mixing" and "[[code-switching]]" interchangeably, especially in studies of [[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and other [[Formalism (philosophy)|formal]] aspects of language.&lt;ref name="Muysken2000"&gt;Muysken, Pieter. 2000. ''Bilingual Speech: A Typology of Code-mixing''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-77168-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bokamba&gt;Bokamba, Eyamba G. 1989. Are there syntactic constraints on code-mixing? World Englishes, 8(3), 277-292.&lt;/ref&gt; Others assume more specific definitions of code-mixing, but these specific definitions may be different in different subfields of [[linguistics]], [[education theory]], [[Communications#Communication as academic discipline|communications]] etc.

Code-mixing is similar to the use or creation of [[pidgin]]s; but while a pidgin is created across groups that do not share a common language, code-mixing may occur within a [[multilingual]] setting where speakers share more than one language.

==As code-switching==
{{main|Code-switching}}
Some linguists use the terms code-mixing and code-switching more or less interchangeably. Especially in formal studies of syntax, morphology, etc., both terms are used to refer to [[utterance]]s that draw from elements of two or more [[Grammar|grammatical systems]].&lt;ref name="Muysken2000"/&gt; These studies are often interested in the alignment of elements from distinct systems, or on constraints that limit switching. 

Some work defines code-mixing as the placing or mixing of various linguistic units (affixes, words, phrases, clauses) from two different grammatical systems within the same sentence and speech context, while code-switching is the placing or mixing of units (words, phrases, sentences) from two codes within the same speech context. The structural difference between code-switching and code-mixing is the position of the altered elements—for code-switching, the modification of the codes occurs intersententially, while for code-mixing, it occurs intrasententially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BOKAMBA|first1=Eyamba G.|title=CODE-MIXING, LANGUAGE VARIATION, AND LINGUISTIC THEORY: Evidence from Bantu Languages|journal=Lingua|date=February 1988|volume=76, Issue 1|pages=21-62|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024384188900174|accessdate=10 October 2017|doi=10.1016/0024-3841(88)90017-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other work the term code-switching emphasizes a multilingual speaker's movement from one grammatical system to another, while the term code-mixing suggests a hybrid form, drawing from distinct grammars. In other words, ''code-mixing'' emphasizes the formal aspects of language structures or [[linguistic competence]], while ''code-switching'' emphasizes [[linguistic performance]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

While many linguists have worked to describe the difference between code-switching and [[Loanword|borrowing]] of words or phrases, the term code-mixing may be used to encompass both types of language behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2001|first=Shana|last=Poplack|title=Code switching (linguistic)|editors=N. J. Smelser &amp; B. Baltes|encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages=2062-2065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sociolinguistics==
While linguists who are primarily interested in the structure or form of code-mixing may have relatively little interest to separate code-mixing from code-switching, some sociolinguists have gone to great lengths to differentiate the two phenomena. For these scholars, code-switching is associated with particular [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] effects, [[discourse]] functions, or associations with group [[Identity (social science)|identity]].{{efn|See especially [[Code-switching#Social motivations|Social motivations for code-switching]].}} In this tradition, the terms ''code-mixing'' or ''language alternation'' are used to describe more stable situations in which multiple languages are used without such pragmatic effects. See also [[#As fused lect|Code-mixing as fused lect]], below.

==In language acquisition==
In studies of bilingual [[language acquisition]], ''code-mixing'' refers to a developmental stage during which children mix elements of more than one language. Nearly all bilingual children go through a period in which they move from one language to another without apparent discrimination.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;King, Kendall A. 2006. "Child language acquisition." In R. Fasold and J. Connor-Linton (eds.) ''An Introduction to Language and Linguistics''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 205-224.&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from code-switching, which is understood as the socially and grammatically appropriate use of multiple varieties.

Beginning at the [[babbling]] stage, young children in bilingual or multilingual environments produce utterances that combine elements of both (or all) of their developing languages. Some linguists suggest that this code-mixing reflects a lack of control or ability to differentiate the languages. Others argue that it is a product of limited vocabulary; very young children may know a word in one language but not in another. More recent studies argue that this early code-mixing is a demonstration of a developing ability to code-switch in socially appropriate ways.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;

For young bilingual children, code-mixing may be dependent on the linguistic context, cognitive task demands, and interlocutor. Code-mixing may also function to fill gaps in their lexical knowledge. Some forms of code-mixing by young children may indicate risk for [[Language disorder|language impairment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=Kai J |author2=Elizabeth D Peña |author3=Lisa M Bedore|title=Lexical choice and language selection in bilingual preschoolers|journal=Child Language Teaching and Therapy|year=2012|volume=29|issue=1|pages=27–39|doi=10.1177/0265659012459743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology and psycholinguistics==
In [[psychology]] and in [[psycholinguistics]] the label ''code-mixing'' is used in theories that draw on studies of language alternation or code-switching to describe the cognitive structures underlying bilingualism. During the 1950s and 1960s, psychologists and linguists treated bilingual speakers as, in Grosjean's term, "two monolinguals in one person".&lt;ref name="Grosjean"&gt;Grosjean, Francois. 1989. Neurolinguists, beware! The bilingual is not two monolinguals in one person. Brain language 36(1):3-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This "fractional view" supposed that a bilingual speaker carried two separate mental grammars that were more or less identical to the mental grammars of monolinguals and that were ideally kept separate and used separately. Studies since the 1970s, however, have shown that bilinguals regularly combine elements from "separate" languages. These findings have led to studies of code-mixing in psychology and psycholinguistics.&lt;ref name="Sridhar"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sridhar | first1 = S.N. | last2 = Sridhar | first2 = Kamal K. | year = 1980 | title = The syntax and psycholinguistics of bilingual code-mixing | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 407–416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sridhar and Sridhar define code-mixing as "the transition from using linguistic units (words, phrases, clauses, etc.) of one language to using those of another within a single sentence".&lt;ref name="Sridhar"/&gt; They note that this is distinct from code-switching in that it occurs in a single sentence (sometimes known as ''intrasentential switching'') and in that it does not fulfill the pragmatic or discourse-oriented functions described by sociolinguists. (See [[#In sociolinguistics|Code-mixing in sociolinguistics]], above.) The practice of code-mixing, which draws from competence in two languages at the same time suggests that these competences are not stored or processed separately. Code-mixing among bilinguals is therefore studied in order to explore the mental structures underlying language abilities.

==As fused lect== &lt;!-- [[Code-switching]] links here --&gt;
A ''[[mixed language]]'' or a ''fused lect'' is a relatively stable mixture of two or more languages. What some linguists have described as "codeswitching as unmarked choice"&lt;ref name="Scotton1993"&gt;Myers-Scotton, Carol. 1993. ''Social Motivations of Codeswitching''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or "frequent codeswitching"&lt;ref name="Poplack1979"&gt;Poplack, Shana. 1979. Sometimes I'll start a sentence in Spanish y termino en espanol: toward a typology of code-switching. Linguistics 18(233-234): 581-618.&lt;/ref&gt; has more recently been described as "language mixing", or in the case of the most strictly [[Grammaticalisation|grammaticalized]] forms as "fused lects".&lt;ref name="Auer1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Auer | first1 = Peter | year = 1999 | title = From code-switching via language mixing to fused lects: toward a dynamic typology of bilingual speech | url = | journal = International Journal of Bilingualism | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 309–332 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas where code-switching among two or more languages is very common, it may become normal for words from both languages to be used together in everyday speech. Unlike code-switching, where a switch tends to occur at [[Semantics|semantically]] or [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistically]] meaningful junctures,{{efn|See also [[Contextualization (sociolinguistics)]].}} this code-mixing has no specific meaning in the local context. A fused lect is identical to a mixed language in terms of semantics and pragmatics, but fused lects allow less variation since they are fully grammaticalized. In other words, there are grammatical structures of the fused lect that determine which source-language elements may occur.&lt;ref name="Auer1999"/&gt;

A mixed language is different from a [[creole language]]. Creoles are thought to develop from pidgins as they become [[Nativization|nativized]].&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald. 2002. "Pidgins and Creoles." In ''An Introduction to Sociolinguistics'' (fourth ed.). Blackwell. pp. 57–86&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed languages develop from situations of code-switching. (See the distinction between code-mixing and pidgin above.)

===Local names===
There are many names for specific mixed languages or fused lects. These names are often used facetiously or carry a [[pejorative]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;Romaine, Suzanne and Braj Kachru. 1992.

Greenwood, 2011. page 86. {{ISBN|978-0-313-37930-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The delays and disorders can range from simple sound substitution to the inability to understand or use one's native language.&lt;ref name="Berko, 2001"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gleason, Jean Berko |title=The development of language |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-205-31636-0 |oclc=43694441 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Disorders and tendencies included and excluded under the category of communication disorders may vary by source.  For example, the definitions offered by the [[American Speech–Language–Hearing Association]] differ from that of the [[DSM-IV|Diagnostic Statistical Manual 4th edition]] (DSM-IV).

Gleanson (2001) defines a communication disorder as a [[Speech and language impairment|speech and language disorder]] which refers to problems in communication and in related areas such as oral motor function. The delays and disorders can range from simple sound substitution to the inability to understand or use one's native language.&lt;ref name="Berko, 2001"/&gt; In general, communication disorders commonly refer to problems in speech (comprehension and/or expression) that significantly interfere with an individual’s achievement and/or quality of life.  Knowing the operational definition of the agency performing an assessment or giving a diagnosis may help.

Persons who speak more than one language or are considered to have an accent in their location of residence do not have a speech disorder if they are speaking in a manner consistent with their home environment or that is a blending of their home and foreign environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=
Speech sound disorders |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/speechsounddisorders.htm|work=
Information for the Public| publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DSM-IV ===
According to the [[DSM-IV-TR]], communication disorders are usually first diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, though they are not limited as childhood disorders and may persist into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;DSM IV-TR, Rapoport DSM-IV Training Guide for Diagnosis of Childhood Disorders&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2014}}  They may also occur with other disorders.

Diagnosis involves testing and evaluation during which it is determined if the scores/performance are "substantially below" developmental expectations and if they "significantly" interfere with academic achievement, social interactions, and daily living.  This assessment may also determine if the characteristic is deviant or delayed.  Therefore, it may be possible for an individual to have communication challenges but not meet the criteria of being "substantially below" criteria of the DSM IV-TR.

It should also be noted that the DSM diagnoses do not comprise a complete list of all communication disorders, for example, [[auditory processing disorder]] is not classified under the DSM or ICD-10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cirrie.buffalo.edu/encyclopedia/en/article/249/ |last1=Banai |first1=K |last2=Yifat |first2=R |title=Communication Disorders: Auditory Processing Disorders| year=2010| work=International Encyclopedia of Rehabilitation |editors= JH Stone, M Blouin | publisher=Center for International Rehabilitation Research Information and Exchange (CIRRIE) |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following diagnoses are included as communication disorders:
* [[Expressive language disorder]] – characterized by difficulty expressing oneself beyond simple sentences and a limited vocabulary. Individuals can better understand than use language; they may have a lot to say, but have more difficulty organizing and retrieving the words than expected for their developmental stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =Morales  | first =Sarah  | title = Expressive Language Disorder - ICD 315.31 | url = http://www.childspeech.net/u_iv_h.html | publisher =Children's Speech Care Center  | date =  | accessdate = 8 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder]] – problems comprehending the commands of others.
* [[Stuttering]] – a speech disorder characterized by a break in fluency, where sounds, syllables, or words may be repeated or prolonged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Stuttering  | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002400/ |work=Children and stuttering; Speech disfluency; Stammering| publisher =U.S. National Library of Medicine - PubMed Health  | date = 2012 | accessdate = 8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phonological disorder]] – a speech sound disorder characterized by problems in making patterns of sound errors (e.g., "dat" for "that").
* Communication disorder NOS (not otherwise specified) – the DSM-IV diagnosis in which disorders that do not meet the specific criteria for the disorder listed above may be classified.

=== DSM-5 ===

The [[DSM-5]] diagnoses for communication disorders completely rework the ones stated above. The diagnoses are made more general in order to capture the various aspects of communications disorders in a way that emphasizes their childhood onset and differentiate these communications disorders from those associated with other disorders (i.e., [[autism spectrum disorders]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fung|first=Lawrence K.|last2=Hardan|first2=Antonio Y.|title=Autism in DSM-5 under the microscope: Implications to patients, families, clinicians, and researchers|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1876201814001981)|journal=Asian Journal of Psychiatry|volume=11|pages=93–97|doi=10.1016/j.ajp.2014.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Language disorder]] – the important characteristics of a language disorder are difficulties in learning and using language, which is caused by problems with vocabulary, with grammar, and with putting sentences together in a proper manner. Problems can both be receptive (understanding language) and expressive ([[Language production|producing language]]).&lt;ref name=DSM-5&gt;{{Cite book| last= American Psychiatric Association| year= 2013| title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=Fifth| publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing| location=Arlington, VA| pages= 41–49| isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8| oclc= 845233998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Speech sound disorder]] – previously called phonological disorder, for those with problems with pronunciation and articulation of their native language.&lt;ref name=DSM-5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee ASY, Gibbon FE. Non-speech oral motor treatment for children with developmental speech sound disorders. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2015, Issue 3. Art. No.: CD009383. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009383.pub2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder ([[Stuttering]]) - standard fluency and rhythm of speech is interrupted, often causing the repetition of whole words and syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|first1=Susan|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=2 Penn Plaza, New York, NY 10121|isbn=978-0-07-803538-8|page=301|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt; May also include the prolongation of words and syllables; pauses within a word; and/or the avoidance of pronouncing difficult words and replacing them with easier words that the individual is better able to pronounce.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;American Psychiatric Association. "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition". Page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This disorder causes many communication problems for the individual and may interfere with social communication and performance in work and/or school settings where communication is essential.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* [[Pragmatic language impairment|Social (pragmatic) communication disorder]] – this diagnosis described difficulties in the social uses of verbal and nonverbal communication in naturalistic contexts, which affects the development of social relationships and discourse comprehension. The difference between this diagnosis and autism spectrum disorder is that in the latter there is also a restricted or repetitive pattern of behavior.&lt;ref name=DSM-5/&gt;
*[[Unspecified communication disorder]] – for those who have symptoms of a communication disorder but who do not meet all criteria, and whose symptoms cause distress or impairment.&lt;ref name=DSM-5/&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of disorders that may include or create challenges in language and communication and/or may co-occur with the above disorders:
* [[autism spectrum disorder]] - [[autistic disorder]] (also called "classic" autism), [[pervasive developmental disorder]], and [[Asperger syndrome]] – developmental disorders that affect the brain's normal development of social and communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1=Kennison | first1=Shelia M. | title=Introduction to language development | date =2013-07-30  | publisher=SAGE Publications  | location=Los Angeles  | isbn=978-1-4129-9606-8 | oclc=830837502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[expressive language disorder]] – affects speaking and understanding where there is no delay in non-verbal intelligence.
* [[mixed receptive-expressive language disorder]] – affects speaking, understanding, reading and writing where there is no delay in non-verbal intelligence.
* [[specific language impairment]] – a language disorder that delays the mastery of language skills in children who have no hearing loss or other developmental delays. SLI is also called developmental language disorder, language delay, or developmental dysphasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/pages/specific-language-impairment.aspx |title=Specific Language Impairment |format= | publisher=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensory impairments===
* [[Blindness]] – A link between communication skills and visual impairment with children who are blind is currently being investigated.&lt;ref name="James Stojanovik 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=D. M.|last2=Stojanovik|first2=V.|title=Communication skills in blind children: a preliminary investigation|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development| volume=33| issue=1| year=2007| pages=4–10 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00621.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Deafness]]/frequent [[Otitis media|ear infections]] – Trouble with hearing during language acquisition may lead to spoken language problems.  Children who suffer from frequent ear infections may temporarily develop problems pronouncing words correctly.  It should also be noted that some of the above communication disorders can occur with people who use sign language.  The inability to hear is not in itself a communication disorder.

===Aphasia===
[[Aphasia]] is loss of the ability to produce or comprehend [[language]]. There are acute aphasias which result from stroke or brain injury, and primary progressive aphasias caused by progressive illnesses such as dementia.
*Acute aphasias
**[[Expressive aphasia]] also known as Broca's aphasia, expressive aphasia is a non-fluent aphasia that is characterized by damage to the frontal lobe region of the brain. A person with expressive aphasia usually speaks in short sentences that make sense but take great effort to produce. Also, a person with expressive aphasia understands another person's speech but has trouble responding quickly.&lt;ref name="Sinanović, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sinanović O, Mrkonjić Z, Zukić S, Vidović M, Imamović K |title=Post-stroke language disorders |journal=Acta Clin Croat |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=79–94 |date=March 2011 |pmid=22034787 |doi= |url=|last2=Mrkonjić |last3=Zukić |last4=Vidović |last5=Imamović }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Receptive aphasia]] also known as Wernicke's aphasia, receptive aphasia is a fluent aphasia that is categorized by damage to the temporal lobe region of the brain. A person with receptive aphasia usually speaks in long sentences that have no meaning or content. People with this type of aphasia often have trouble understanding other's speech and generally do not realize that they are not making any sense.&lt;ref name="Sinanović, 2011"/&gt;
**[[Conduction aphasia]]&lt;ref name="Sinanović, 2011"/&gt;
**[[Anomic aphasia]]&lt;ref name="Sinanović, 2011"/&gt;
**[[Global aphasia]]&lt;ref name="Sinanović, 2011"/&gt;
*Primary progressive aphasias
** [[Progressive nonfluent aphasia]]&lt;ref name="Harciarek, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harciarek M, Kertesz A |title=Primary progressive aphasias and their contribution to the contemporary knowledge about the brain-language relationship |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=271–87 |date=September 2011 |pmid=21809067 |pmc=3158975 |doi=10.1007/s11065-011-9175-9 |url=|last2=Kertesz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning disability===
* [[Dyscalculia]] – a defect of the systems used in communicating [[number]]s
* [[Dyslexia]] – a defect of the systems used in [[Reading (activity)|reading]]
* [[Dysgraphia]] – a defect in the systems used in writing

===Speech disorders===
*[[cluttering]] - a syndrome characterized by a speech delivery rate which is either abnormally fast, irregular, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| first1=Kenneth O.| last1=Louis| first2=Lawrence J.| last2=Raphael| first3=Florence L.| last3=Myers| first4=Klaas| last4=Bakker| title=Cluttering Updated| url=http://www.asha.org/Publications/leader/2003/031118/f031118a.htm| archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718180144/http://www.asha.org/Publications/leader/2003/031118/f031118a.htm| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2012-07-18| work=ASHA Leader| publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)| date=2013| accessdate=8 December 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[dysarthria]] - a condition that occurs when problems with the muscles that helps a person to talk make it difficult to pronounce words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Dysarthria  | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004947/ | work=Impairment of speech; Slurred speech; Speech disorders - dysarthria| publisher =U.S. National Library of Medicine - PubMed Health  | date = 2012 | accessdate = 8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[esophageal voice]] - involves the patient injecting or swallowing air into the esophagus. Usually learnt and used by patients who cannot use their larynges to speak. Once the patient has forced the air into their esophagus, the air vibrates a muscle and creates esophageal voice. Esophageal voice tends to be difficult to learn and patients are often only able to talk in short phrases with a quiet voice.
*[[lisp]] - a speech impediment that is also known as sigmatism.
*[[speech sound disorder]] - Speech-sound disorders (SSD) involve impairments in speech-sound production and range from mild articulation issues involving a limited number of speech sounds to more severe phonologic disorders involving multiple errors in speech-sound production and reduced intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sices L, Taylor HG, Freebairn L, Hansen A, Lewis B |title=Relationship between speech-sound disorders and early literacy skills in preschool-age children: impact of comorbid language impairment |journal=J Dev Behav Pediatr |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=438–47 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18091088 |pmc=2755217 |doi=10.1097/DBP.0b013e31811ff8ca |url=|last2=Taylor |last3=Freebairn |last4=Hansen |last5=Lewis }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[stuttering]] - a speech disorder in which sounds, syllables, or words are repeated or last longer than normal. These problems cause a break in the flow of speech (called disfluency).

[[File:Spencerian example.jpg|thumb|Example of classic American business cursive handwriting known as [[Spencerian script]] from 1884]]

'''Cursive''' (also known as '''script''' or '''longhand''', among other names{{efn|Also known as '''handwriting''', '''looped writing''', '''joint writing''', '''joined-up writing''', or '''running writing'''}}) is any style of [[penmanship]] in which some characters are written joined together in a flowing manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. Formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. The writing style can be further divided as "looped", "[[Italic script|italic]]" or "connected".

The cursive method is used with a number of alphabets due to its improved writing speed and infrequent pen lifting. In some alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke.

== Descriptions ==
Cursive is a style of penmanship in which the symbols of the language are written in a [[wikt:conjoin|conjoin]]ed and/or ''flowing'' manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. This writing style is distinct from "printscript" using [[block letters]], in which the letters of a word are unconnected and in Roman/Gothic letterform rather than joined-up script. Not all cursive [[copybook (education)|copybook]]s join all letters: formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. In the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Latin script|Latin]], and [[Cyrillic (script)|Cyrillic]] alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke. In [[cursive Hebrew|Hebrew cursive]] and [[Roman cursive]], the letters are not connected. In Maharashtra there is a version of Cursive called [[Modi alphabet|'Modi']]

=== Subclasses ===

==== Ligature ====
Ligature is writing the letters of words with lines connecting the letters so that one does not have to pick up the pen or pencil between letters.  Commonly some of the letters are written in a looped manner to facilitate the connections. In common printed Greek texts, the modern small letter fonts are called "cursive" (as opposed to uncial) though the letters do not connect.

==== Looped ====
[[file:Looped cursive sample.jpg|thumb|alt=The first verse of "Good King Wenceslas" in cursive|Looped cursive as taught in Britain in mid-20th century]]
In ''looped cursive'' penmanship, some [[ascender (typography)|ascender]]s and [[descender]]s have loops which provide for joins.  This is generally what people refer to when they say "cursive".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Italic ====
''[[italic script|Cursive italic]]'' penmanship—derived from [[chancery cursive]]—uses non-looped joins or no joins. In italic cursive, there are no joins from g, j, q or y, and a few other joins are discouraged.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518 |title=How Handwriting Boosts the Brain |first=Gwendolyn |last=Bounds |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 5, 2010 |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company|Dow Jones]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0099-9660 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} Italic penmanship became popular in the 15th-century Italian Renaissance. The term "italic" as it relates to handwriting is not to be confused with [[italic type]]d letters that slant forward. Many, but not all, letters in the handwriting of the Renaissance were joined, as most are today in cursive italic.

== Origin ==
The origins of the cursive method are associated with practical advantages of writing speed and infrequent pen-lifting to accommodate the limitations of the [[quill]]. Quills are fragile, easily broken, and will spatter unless used properly. Steel [[dip pen]]s followed quills; they were sturdier, but still had some limitations. The individuality of the provenance of a document (see [[Signature]]) was a factor also, as opposed to machine [[font]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Jean (1997). ''Writing: The Story of Alphabets and Scripts'', London: Thames and Hudson Ltd. ['[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series]&lt;/ref&gt;
Cursive was also favored because the writing tool was rarely taken off the paper.
The term ''cursive'' derives from the 18th century [[Italian language|Italian]] ''corsivo'' from [[Medieval Latin]] ''cursivus'', which literally means ''running''. This term in turn derives from [[Latin]] ''currere'' ("to run, hasten").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=cursive|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cursive|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(also known in Bengali as "professional writing"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}) the letters are more likely to be more curvy in appearance than in standard Bengali handwriting. Also, the horizontal supporting bar on each letter ([[Bengali alphabet#The matra|''matra'']]) runs continuously through the entire word, unlike in standard handwriting. This cursive handwriting often used by literature experts differs in appearance from the [[Bengali script|standard Bengali alphabet]] as it is free hand writing, where sometimes the alphabets are complex and appear different from the standard handwriting.

{{Main|Roman cursive}}
[[File:Hocgracili.jpg|thumb|right|Example of old Roman cursive]]
''Roman cursive'' is a form of handwriting (or a [[script (styles of handwriting)|script]]) used in [[ancient Rome]] and to some extent into the [[Middle Ages]]. It is customarily divided into old (or ancient) cursive, and new cursive. Old Roman cursive, also called [[majuscule]] cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the [[Latin alphabet]], and even by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] issuing commands. New Roman, also called [[minuscule cursive]] or later cursive, developed from old cursive. It was used from approximately the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letter forms that are more recognizable to modern eyes; "a", "b", "d", and "e" have taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters are proportionate to each other rather than varying wildly in size and placement on a line.

{{Main|History of the Greek alphabet}}
[[File:Greek manuscript cursive 6th century.png|thumb|right|Ancient Greek cursive script, 6th century A.D.]]

The [[Greek alphabet]] has had several cursive forms in the course of its development. In antiquity, a cursive form of handwriting was used in writing on [[papyrus]]. It employed slanted and partly connected letter forms as well as many [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s. Some features of this handwriting were later adopted into Greek minuscule, the dominant form of handwriting in the medieval and early modern era. In the 19th and 20th centuries, an entirely new form of cursive Greek, more similar to contemporary Western European cursive scripts, was developed.

== Western Europe ==
During the Middle Ages, the flowing, connected cursive script of the Arabic language inspired Western Christian scholars to develop similar cursive scripts for Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Eastern Mysteries: An Encyclopedic Guide to the Sacred Languages &amp; Magickal Systems of the World (Key of It All) |author=Hulse, David Allen | publisher=Llewellyn Publications | year=2002 | isbn=978-1567184280 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWHjIxkvXYEC | page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scripts then became the basis for all of the Latin-based cursive scripts used in Europe.

[[File:Shakespeare-Testament.jpg|thumb|[[William Shakespeare]]'s will, written in ''secretary hand''&lt;ref&gt;''Cardenio, Or, the Second Maiden's Tragedy'', pp. 131-3: By William Shakespeare, [[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]], John Fletcher (Glenbridge Publishing Ltd., 1994) {{ISBN|0-944435-24-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cursive writing was used in English before the [[Norman conquest]]. [[Anglo-Saxon Charters]] typically include a boundary clause written in [[Old English]] in a cursive script. A cursive handwriting style—[[secretary hand]]—was widely used for both personal correspondence and official documents in England from early in the 16th century.

Cursive handwriting developed into something approximating its current form from the 17th century, but its use was neither uniform, nor standardized either in England itself or elsewhere in the [[British Empire]]. In the English colonies of the early 17th century, most of the letters are clearly separated in the handwriting of [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]], though a few were joined as in a cursive hand. In England itself, Edward Cocker had begun to introduce a version of the French ''[[Ronde script (calligraphy)|ronde]]''&lt;!-- sic --&gt; style, which was then further developed and popularized throughout the [[British Empire]] in the 17th and 18th centuries as [[round hand]] by John Ayers and William Banson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whalley|first=Joyce Irene|title=The Art of Calligraphy, Western Europe &amp; America|year=1980|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=0-906223-64-4|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the American colonies, on the eve of their independence from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], it is notable that [[Thomas Jefferson]] joined most, but not all the letters when drafting the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. However, a few days later, [[Timothy Matlack]] professionally re-wrote the presentation copy of the Declaration in a fully joined, cursive hand. Eighty-seven years later, in the middle of the 19th century, [[Abraham Lincoln]] drafted the [[Gettysburg Address]] in a cursive hand that would not look out of place today.

Note that not all such cursive, then or now, joined all of the letters within a word.

[[File:HandwritingOfOneJohnJay(NotTheFamousOne).jpg|thumb|right|Cursive handwriting from the 19th-century USA.]]
In both the British Empire and the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, before the typewriter, professionals used cursive for their correspondence. This was called a "fair hand", meaning it looked good, and firms trained their clerks to write in exactly the same script.

In the early days{{when|date=June 2017}} of the [[post office]], letters were written in cursive&amp;nbsp;– and to fit more text on a single sheet, the text was continued in lines [[Crossed letter|crossing at 90 degrees from the original text]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Arrow of Chaos: Romanticism and Postmodernity|last = Livingston|first = Ira|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 1997|isbn = 0816627959|location = |pages = 143|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ySwihw-VVP4C&amp;pg=PT143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter = The Romantic Double-Cross: Keats's Letters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block letters were not suitable for this.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Although women's handwriting had noticeably different particulars from men's, the general forms were not prone to rapid change. In the mid-19th century, most children were taught the contemporary cursive; in the United States, this usually occurred in second or third grade (around ages seven to nine). Few simplifications appeared as the middle of the 20th century approached.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

After the 1960s, a movement originally begun by [[Paul Standard]] in the 1930s to replace looped cursive with cursive italic penmanship resurfaced. It was motivated by the claim that cursive instruction was more difficult than it needed to be: that conventional (looped) cursive was unnecessary, and it was easier to write in cursive italic. Because of this, a number of various new forms of cursive italic appeared, including [[Getty-Dubay]], and [[Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting]]. In the 21st century, some of the surviving cursive writing styles are [[Spencerian script|Spencerian]], [[Palmer Method]], [[D'Nealian]], and Zaner-Bloser script.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/from-punishing-to-pleasurable-how-cursive-writing-is-looping-back-into-our-hearts/2018/08/31/aa180b9c-aa06-11e8-a8d7-0f63ab8b1370_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.88491996752d] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest forms of new technology that caused the decline of handwriting was the invention of the [[ballpoint pen]], patented in 1888 by John Loud. Two brothers, László and György Bíró, further developed the pen by changing the design and using different ink that dried quickly. With their design, it was guaranteed that the ink would not smudge, as it would with the earlier design of pen, and it no longer required the careful penmanship one would use with the older design of pen. After World War II, the ballpoint pen was mass-produced and sold for a cheap price, changing the way people wrote. Over time the emphasis of using the style of cursive to write slowly declined{{quantify|date=August 2017}}, only to be later impacted by other technologies such as the phone, computer, and keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How The Ballpoint Pen Killed Cursive|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/08/ballpoint-pens-object-lesson-history-handwriting/402205/|website = The Atlantic|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Decline of Handwriting|last = Enstrom|first = E.A.|date = 1965|journal = The Elementary School Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cursive has been in decline throughout the 21st century due to its perceived lack of necessity. The Fairfax Education Association, the largest teachers' union in Fairfax County, Virginia, has called cursive a "dying art". Many consider cursive too tedious to learn and believe that it is not a useful skill.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Cursive handwriting is disappearing from public schools|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/cursive-handwriting-disappearing-from-public-schools/2013/04/04/215862e0-7d23-11e2-a044-676856536b40_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date = 2013-04-04|access-date = 2015-10-30|issn = 0190-8286|first = T.

On the 2006 [[SAT]], a United States post-secondary education entrance exam, only 15 percent of the students wrote their essay answers in cursive.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Handwriting Is on the Wall |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=11 October 2006 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/10/AR2006101001475_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, students might be discouraged from using cursive on standardized tests due to exams written in hard to read handwriting receive less marks, and some graders may have difficulties reading cursive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/22/exam-markers-complain-about-students-blue-ink-scribbles|title=Poor handwriting 'may hinder students' chances of exam success'|first=Richard|last=Adams|date=21 August 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 survey of 200 teachers of first through third grades in all 50 American states, 90 percent of respondents said their schools required the teaching of cursive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schools debate: Is cursive writing worth teaching? |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |date=23 January 2009 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-01-23-cursive-handwriting_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 nationwide survey found elementary school teachers lacking formal training in teaching handwriting to students. Only 12 percent of teachers reported having taken a course in how to teach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Steve|author2=Harris, Karen R. |author3=Mason, Linda |author4=Fink-Chorzempa, Barbara |author5=Moran, Susan |author6=Saddler, Bruce |title=How do primary grade teachers teach handwriting?

In 2012, the American states of [[Indiana]] and [[Hawaii]] announced that their schools will no longer be required to teach cursive (but will still be permitted to), and instead will be required to teach "keyboard proficiency". Since the nationwide proposal of the [[Common Core State Standards]] in 2009, which do not include instruction in cursive, the standards have been adopted by 44 states as of July 2011, all of which have debated whether to augment them with cursive.&lt;ref name="TIME Newsfeed"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/07/06/typing-beats-scribbling-indiana-schools-can-stop-teaching-cursive/?iid=nfmostpopular |title=Typing Beats Scribbling: Indiana Schools Can Stop Teaching Cursive |first=Kayla  |last=Webley |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=6 July 2011|accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/01/hawaii-no-longer-requires_n_915402.html "Hawaii No Longer Requires Teaching Cursive In Schools"].

==== Conservation efforts and cognitive benefits ====
Many historical documents, such as the United States Constitution, are written in cursive—the inability to read cursive therefore precludes one from being able to fully appreciate such documents in their original format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Five Reasons Kids Should Still Learn Cursive Writing|url = http://time.com/2820780/five-reasons-kids-should-still-learn-cursive-writing/|website = TIME.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|first = Katy|last = Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the decline in the day-to-day use of cursive, it is being reintroduced to the curriculum of schools in the United States. States such as California, Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Jersey, and Tennessee have already mandated cursive in schools as a part of the Back to Basics program designed to maintain the integrity of cursive handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is cursive handwriting slowly dying out in America?|url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/long-held-tradition-cursive-handwriting-slowly-dying-america/|website = PBS NewsHour|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cursive instruction is required by grade 5 in Illinois, starting with the 2018-2019 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An act concerning education|url = http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=100-0548|website = ILGA.gov|accessdate = 2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some{{who|date=December 2015}} argue that cursive is not worth teaching in schools and "in the 1960s cursive was implemented because of preference and not an educational basis; Hawaii and Indiana have replaced cursive instruction with 'keyboard proficiency' and 44 other states are currently weighing similar measures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is Cursive Handwriting Going Extinct?|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/is-cursive-handwriting-going-extinct-734564/|website = Smithsonian|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{attribution needed|date=December 2015}}

With the widespread use of computers, researchers set out to test the effectiveness of both mediums. In a study done by Pam Mueller which compared scores of students who took notes by hand and via laptop computer showed that students who took notes by hand showed advantages in both factual and conceptual learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand Over Laptop Note Taking|last = Mueller|first = Pam|date = 2014|journal = Psychological Science|doi = 10.1177/0956797614524581|pmid = 24760141|access-date =|volume=25|pages=1159–1168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study done by Anne Mangen showed that children showed an acceleration in learning new words when they wrote them by hand rather than on a computer screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Handwriting versus Keyboard Writing: Effect on Word Recall|last = Mangen|first = Anne|date = 2015|journal = Journal of Writing Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning to write in cursive is alleged (by its practitioners) to be a stepping stone to developing neat handwriting, and, in a third study conducted by Florida International University, professor Laura Dinehart concluded that students with neater handwriting tend to develop better reading and writing skills, though it is difficult to conclude causation from such an association.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"/&gt; Aside from these cognitive benefits, students with dyslexia, who have difficulty learning to read because their brains have difficulty associating sounds and letter combinations efficiently, have found that cursive can help them with the decoding process because it integrates hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills and other brain and memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How cursive can help students with dyslexia connect the dots|url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/connecting-dots-role-cursive-dyslexia-therapy/|website = PBS NewsHour|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, students with dysgraphia may be badly served, even substantially hindered, by demands for cursive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Myths and Fact...Dysgraphia|url = https://www.nursingcenter.com/journalarticle?Article_ID=789157|website = NURSING Magazine|accessdate = 2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German ===
Up to the 19th century, [[Kurrent]] (also known as ''German cursive'') was used in German language longhand. Kurrent was not used exclusively, but in parallel to modern cursive (which is the same as English cursive). Writers used both cursive styles: location, contents and context of the text determined which style to use. A successor of Kurrent, [[Sütterlin]], was widely used in the period 1911-1941 until the Nazi Party banned it, and German speakers brought up with Sütterlin continued to use it well into the post-war period.

Today, three different styles of cursive writing are taught in German schools, the {{ill|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|de|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (introduced in 1953), the {{ill|Schulausgangsschrift|de|Schulausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (1968), and the {{ill|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|de|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grundschrift-schreibschrift.de|title=Grundschrift-Schreibschrift|work=grundschrift-schreibschrift.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German National Primary Schoolteachers' Union has proposed replacing all three with [[Grundschrift]], a simplified form of non-cursive handwriting adopted by [[Hamburg]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/29/germany-teachers-handwriting-schools-schreibschrift|title=German teachers campaign to simplify handwriting in schools|author=Helen Pidd|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian ==
[[File:Russian Cursive Cyrillic.svg|thumb|right|The standard modern Russian Cyrillic cursive alphabet with uppercase and lowercase letters, used in school education.]]
{{main|Russian cursive}}
The ''Russian Cursive [[Cyrillic]]'' alphabet is used (instead of [[Russian alphabet|the block letters]]) when handwriting the modern [[Russian language]]. While several letters resemble Latin counterparts, many of them represent different sounds. Most handwritten Russian, especially personal letters and schoolwork, uses the cursive Russian (Cyrillic) alphabet. Most children in Russian schools are taught in the 1st grade how to write using this Russian script.

== Chinese ==
Cursive forms of [[Chinese written language|Chinese characters]] are used in calligraphy; "running script" is the [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] form and [[Cursive script (East Asia)|"rough script"]] (mistakenly called "grass script" due to misinterpretation) is the cursive. The running aspect of this script has more to do with the formation and connectedness of strokes ''within'' an individual character than with connections between characters as in Western connected cursive. The latter are rare in [[hanzi]] and in the derived Japanese [[kanji]] characters which are usually well separated by the writer.

Darbar is a Persian-derived term (from Persian: دربار - darbār) meaning the court or place of discussion of king, Prince, ruler or noble court. It was later used in [[Pakistan]], India and [[Nepal]] for a ruler's court or feudal levee as the latter came to be ruled and later administered by foreigners. A darbar may be either a [[feudal]] state council for administering the affairs of a princely state, or a [[Muslim]] [[shrine]] like [[Data Darbar|data darbar]] in [[Lahore]].

A '''definite description''' is a [[denotation|denoting]] [[phrase]] in the form of "the X" where X is a noun-phrase or a singular common [[noun]]. The definite description is ''proper'' if X applies to a unique individual or object.  For example: "[[Yuri Gagarin|the first person in space]]" and "[[Bill Clinton|the 42nd President of the United States of America]]", are proper. The definite descriptions "the person in space" and "the Senator from Ohio" are ''improper'' because the noun phrase X applies to more than one thing, and the definite descriptions "the first man on Mars" and "the Senator from some Country" are ''improper'' because X applies to nothing. Improper descriptions raise some difficult questions about the [[law of excluded middle]], [[denotation]], [[Linguistic modality|modality]], and [[mental content]].

==Russell's analysis==
{{main|Theory of descriptions}}
As [[France]] is [[French Fifth Republic|currently a republic]], it has no king. [[Bertrand Russell]] pointed out that this raises a puzzle about the truth value of the sentence "The present King of France is bald."

The sentence does not seem to be true: if we consider all the bald things, the present King of France isn't among them, since there is [[List of French monarchs|no present King of France]]. But if it is false, then one would expect that the [[negation]] of this statement, that is, "It is not the case that the present King of France is bald," or its [[logical equivalence|logical equivalent]], "The present King of France is not bald," is true. But this sentence doesn't seem to be true either: the present King of France is no more among the things that fail to be bald than among the things that are bald.  We therefore seem to have a violation of the [[Law of Excluded Middle]].

Is it meaningless, then?  One might suppose so (and some philosophers have; see below) since "the present King of France" certainly does [[Failure to refer|fail to refer]]. But on the other hand, the sentence "The present King of France is bald" (as well as its negation) seem perfectly intelligible, suggesting that "the Present King of France" can't be meaningless.

Russell proposed to resolve this puzzle via his [[theory of descriptions]].  A definite description like "the present King of France", he suggested, isn't a [[reference|referring]] expression, as we might naively suppose, but rather an "incomplete symbol" that introduces [[Quantifier (logic)|quantificational]] structure into sentences in which it occurs. The sentence "the present King of France is bald", for example, is analyzed as a conjunction of the following three [[Quantifier (logic)|quantified]] statements:

# there is an x such that x is currently King of France: &lt;math&gt;\exists xKx&lt;/math&gt; (using 'Kx' for 'x is currently King of France')
# for any x and y, if x is currently King of France and y is currently King of France, then x=y (i.e. there is at most one thing which is currently King of France): &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y ((Kx \land Ky) \rightarrow x=y)&lt;/math&gt;
# for every x that is currently King of France, x is bald: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (Kx \rightarrow Bx)&lt;/math&gt; (using 'B' for 'bald')

More briefly put, the claim is that "The present King of France is bald" says that some x is such that x is currently King of France, and that any y is currently King of France only if y = x, and that x is bald: 

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x((Kx \land \forall y(Ky \rightarrow y =x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;

This is ''false'', since it is ''not'' the case that some x is currently King of France.

The negation of this sentence, i.e. "The present King of France is not bald", is ambiguous.  It could mean one of two things, depending on where we place the negation 'not'.  On one reading, it could mean that there is no one who is currently King of France and bald:

:&lt;math&gt;\lnot \exists x ((Kx \land \forall y (Ky \rightarrow y = x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;

On this disambiguation, the sentence is ''true'' (since there is indeed no x that is currently King of France).

On a second reading, the negation could be construed as attaching directly to 'bald', so that the sentence means that there is currently a King of France, but that this King fails to be bald:

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x ((Kx \land \forall y (Ky \rightarrow y = x)) \land \lnot Bx)&lt;/math&gt;

On this disambiguation, the sentence is ''false'' (since there is no x that is currently King of France).

Thus, whether "the present King of France is not bald" is true or false depends on how it is interpreted at the level of [[logical form]]: if the [[negation]] is construed as taking wide scope (as in the first of the above)), it is true, whereas if the negation is construed as taking narrow scope (as in the second of the above]), it is false. In neither case does it lack a truth value.

So we do ''not'' have a failure of the [[Law of Excluded Middle]]: "the present King of France is bald" (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\exists x((Kx \land \forall y(Ky \rightarrow y =x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;) is false, because there is no present King of France.  The negation of this statement is the one in which 'not' takes wide scope: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \exists x ((Kx \land \forall y (Ky \rightarrow y = x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;.  This statement is ''true'' because there does not exist anything which is currently King of France.

== Generalized quantifier analysis ==

[[Stephen Neale]], among others, has defended Russell's theory, and incorporated it into the theory of [[generalized quantifier]]s.  On this view, 'the' is a quantificational determiner like 'some', 'every', 'most' etc. The definite description 'the' has the following denotation (using [[lambda calculus|lambda]] notation):

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda f. \lambda g.\exists x(f(x)=1 \land \forall y(f(y)=1 \rightarrow y=x) \land g(x) = 1)&lt;/math&gt;

(That is, the definite article 'the' denotes a function which takes a pair of [[property|properties]] f and g to truth [[if and only if|if, and only if]] there exists something that has the property f, only one thing has the property f, and that thing also has the property g.) Given the denotation of the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] 'present King of France' (again K for short) and 'bald' (B for short)

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.Kx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda x.Bx&lt;/math&gt;

we then get the Russellian truth conditions via two steps of [[function application]]: 'The present King of France is bald' is true if, and only if &lt;math&gt;\exists x((Kx \land \forall y(Ky \rightarrow y =x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;.  On this view, definite descriptions like 'the present King of France' do have a denotation (specifically, definite descriptions denote a function from properties to truth values—they are in that sense not [[syncategorematic]], or "incomplete symbols"); but the view retains the essentials of the Russellian analysis, yielding exactly the truth conditions Russell argued for.

==Fregean analysis==

The Fregean analysis of definite descriptions, implicit in the work of [[Frege]] and later defended by [[P. F. Strawson|Strawson]] (1950) among others, represents the primary alternative to the Russellian theory. On the Fregean analysis, definite descriptions are construed as [[referring expression]]s rather than [[Quantifier (logic)|quantificational expressions]].  Existence and uniqueness are understood as a [[presupposition]] of a sentence containing a definite description, rather than part of the content asserted by such a sentence.  The sentence 'The present King of France is bald', for example, isn't used to claim that there exists a unique present King of France who is bald; instead, that there is a unique present King of France is part of what this sentence ''presupposes'', and what it ''says'' is that this individual is bald.  If the presupposition fails, the definite description [[empty name|fails to refer]], and the sentence as a whole fails to express a [[proposition]].

The Fregean view is thus committed to the kind of [[truth value]] gaps (and failures of the [[Law of Excluded Middle]]) that the Russellian analysis is designed to avoid.  Since there is currently no King of France, the sentence 'The present King of France is bald' fails to express a proposition, and therefore fails to have a truth value, as does its [[negation]], 'The present King of France is not bald'.  The Fregean will account for the fact that these sentences are nevertheless ''meaningful'' by relying on speakers' knowledge of the conditions under which either of these sentences ''could'' be used to express a true proposition.  The Fregean can also hold on to a restricted version of the Law of Excluded Middle: for any sentence whose presuppositions are met (and thus expresses a proposition), either that sentence or its negation is true.

On the Fregean view, the definite article 'the' has the following denotation (using [[lambda calculus|lambda]] notation):

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda f: \exists x(f(x)=1 \land \forall y(f(y)=1 \rightarrow y=x)).&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; [The unique z such that &lt;math&gt;f(z)=1&lt;/math&gt;]

(That is, 'the' denotes a function which takes a property f and yields the unique object z that has property f, if there is such a z, and is undefined otherwise.)  The presuppositional character of the existence and uniqueness conditions is here reflected in the fact that the definite article denotes a [[partial function]] on the set of properties: it is only defined for those properties f which are true of exactly one object.  It is thus undefined on the denotation of the predicate 'currently King of France', since the property of currently being King of France is true of no object; it is similarly undefined on the denotation of the predicate 'Senator of the US', since the property of being a US Senator is true of more than one object.

== Mathematical logic ==
{{main|Uniqueness quantification}}
Following the example of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', it is customary to use a definite description operator symbolized using the "turned" (rotated) Greek lower case iota character "℩". The notation ℩&lt;math&gt;x(\phi x)&lt;/math&gt; means "the unique &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi x&lt;/math&gt;", and

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(&lt;/math&gt;℩&lt;math&gt;x(\phi x))&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to "There is exactly one &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and it has the property
&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;":

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x (\forall y (\phi(y) \iff y=x) \land \psi(x))&lt;/math&gt;

The '''''Etymologicum Genuinum''''' (standard abbreviation '''''E Gen''''') is the conventional modern title given to a [[Lexicography|lexical]] [[encyclopedia]] compiled at [[Constantinople]] in the mid ninth century. The anonymous compiler drew on the works of numerous earlier lexicographers and [[scholiasts]], both ancient and recent, including [[Aelius Herodianus]], [[Georgius Choeroboscus]], [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Methodius]], [[Orion of Thebes]], [[Oros of Alexandria]] and  [[Theognostus the Grammarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 1-69; Alpers (1969) 3-24; Alpers (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' was possibly a product of the intellectual circle around [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]. It was an important source for the subsequent Byzantine lexicographical tradition, including the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'', ''[[Etymologicum Gudianum]]'' and ''[[Etymologicum Symeonis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1972); Rance (2007) 201-206&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship discovered the ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' only in the nineteenth century. It is preserved in two tenth-century [[manuscripts]], ''Codex Vaticanus Graecus'' 1818 (= A) and ''Codex Laurentianus Sancti Marci'' 304 (= B; AD 994). Neither contains the earliest [[recension]] nor the complete text, but rather two different abridgements. The manuscript evidence and citations in later works suggest that the original title was simply τὸ Ἐτυμολογικόν and later τὸ μέγα Ἐτυμολογικόν. Its modern name was coined in 1897 by [[Richard Reitzenstein]], who was the first to edit a sample section.&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 11-44&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' remains for the most part unpublished except for specimen glosses.&lt;ref&gt;Colonna (1967); Alpers (1969); Berger (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Two editions are in long-term preparation, one begun by [[Ada Adler]] and continued by [[Klaus Alpers]],&lt;ref&gt;Alpers (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; the other by [[François Lasserre]] and [[Nikolaos Livadaras]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasserre and Livadaras (1976- )&lt;/ref&gt; The latter edition is published under the title ''Etymologicum Magnum Genuinum'', but this designation is not widely used and is a potential source of confusion with the twelfth-century lexical compendium conventionally titled the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.

A '''false statement''' is a statement that is not true. Although the word ''[[fallacy]]'' is sometimes used as a synonym for ''false statement'', that is not how the word is used in philosophy, mathematics, logic and most formal contexts.

A false statement need not be a [[lie]]. A lie is a statement that is known to be untrue and is used to mislead. A false statement is a statement that is untrue but not necessarily told to mislead, as a statement given by someone who does not know it is untrue.

==Examples of false statements==
;Misleading statement (lie)
John told his little brother that [[sea otters]] aren't mammals, but fish, even though John himself was a [[marine biologist]] and knew otherwise. John simply wanted to see his little brother fail his class report, in order to teach him to begin projects early, which help him develop skills necessary to succeed in life.

;Statement made out of ignorance
James, John's brother, stated in his class report that sea otters were fish. James got an F after his teacher pointed out why that statement was false. James did not know that sea otters were in fact mammals because he heard that sea otters were fish from his older brother John, a marine biologist.

==In law==
In some [[jurisdiction]]s, false statement is a [[crime]] similar to [[perjury]].

===United States===
{{main|Making false statements}}

In U.S. law, a "false statement" generally refers to United States federal false statements statute, contained in {{USC|18|1001}}. Most commonly, prosecutors use this statute to reach cover-up crimes such as [[perjury]], false declarations, and [[obstruction of justice]] and government [[fraud]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Strader | first= Kelly J. | title= Understanding White Collar Crime | edition= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its earliest progenitor was the [[False Claims Act]] of 1863,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubbard v. United States]], {{ussc|514|695|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1934 the [[element (criminal law)|requirement]] of an [[mens rea|intent]] to defraud was eliminated to enforce the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] of 1933 (NIRA) against producers of "hot oil", oil produced in violation of production restrictions established pursuant to the NIRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants= [[:wikisource:United States v.

The statute criminalizes a government official who "knowingly and willfully":&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|1001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact;&lt;br /&gt;(2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or&lt;br /&gt;(3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Figurae''' (singular, ''figura'') are the non-signifying constituents of signifiers ([[Sign (semiotics)|signs]]). For example, letters of the alphabet are the figurae that comprise a written word (signifier).  In the [[semiotic]] language of [[Louis Hjelmslev]], the coiner of this term, figurae serve only to distinguish elements (e.g. words) of the expression plane from each other, independently from the content plane.   That is, the letter B, in the written word expression "bat", distinguishes "bat" from the word  "sat", but neither B nor S bears meaning on its own.  On the other hand, the constituents "foot" and "ball" both bear their own individual meanings, such that in the word "football", they cannot be considered figurae, although their individual letters can.  Hjelmslev states that in a given language a "legion of signs" can be constructed with a "handful of figurae" through ever new arrangements of them.&lt;ref name="Hjelmslev"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists often use the terms [[phonemes]] and [[morphemes]] to refer, respectively, to the figurae and the signifiers of human languages.

The division of the stream of speech into meaningful morphemes plus their further subdivision into meaningless elements is known as the [[double articulation]].  This [[duality of patterning]] of language is one of the few facts of language which most schools of linguistics can agree on.   Occasionally, two morphemes can combine in an arbitrary way into a new morpheme, as in double names such as ''Mary-Alice, John-Paul'', and ''Sarah-Jean,'' creating a kind of triple articulation.  English speakers recognize ''Mary'' and ''Alice'' as parts of the name ''Mary-Alice,'' yet they understand that a woman of that name is in no way a combination of two other women.   But neither are double given names typical of English, nor are surnames meaningless, since surnames usually identify a family relationship.   As far as the combination of meaningful elements is concerned, there is much less agreement on what constitutes a [[syntagm]] (e.g. ''foot-ball, I-am'') and whether any such syntax is universal.

In theory, any sign could be composed of figurae, but care must be taken in distinguishing between the control-number-like function of figurae (as in the individual digits of a telephone extension) and the syntax-like function of meaning constituents (as in the area code of a full telephone number).   For example, the symbols for the lines of the New York City subway system are composed of very elementary parts, e.g., letters or numbers and colors.   While the assignment of letters to trains is arbitrary, and colors are arbitrarily assigned to various avenues in Manhattan,  the combination of a letter or number and color is not arbitrary.  That is, the symbol for the A Train has to be blue, since it runs along Eighth Avenue and all other Eighth Avenue train symbols are blue.   Therefore, these colors cannot be considered figurae.   

On the other hand, the flags of a dozen countries consist of three horizontal bars, distinguished by their colors.   It can be said that the colors and bars form a system of signifiers, consisting of the color figurae in a vertical order.  For example, the flag of Russia is made up of a white, a blue, and a red bar, from top to bottom, whereas the flag of Estonia consists of a blue, a black and a white bar.  From the point of view of a [[vexillologist]], the colors have no meaning until they are grouped together and form the national symbol.   Although white, blue and red may be "national colors" of Russia, combined in a different order they form the flag of Luxembourg.

In reality, most national flags do not conform to the three-horizontal-band pattern.  Furthermore, national flags vary somewhat in their horizontal and vertical proportions, and shades of colors can differ.  Nevertheless, this logical analysis of flags into horizontal-color-bar figurae, though not exact, would probably be arrived at by almost anyone comparing these 12 national symbols.  But it is also possible to over-analyze signs.  For example, a television picture of a flag would consist of thousands of meaningless pixels.   A recording of speech could be digitalized on a CD into millions of meaningless bits.  Neither of these mechanical divisions could be considered figurae.  It would seem, then, that since signs are defined as entities recognized by sentient beings (including many animal species), the constituents of signs, figurae, must also be easily recognizable as entities, even though they have no meaning in themselves.   It probably requires lot of specialization or intelligence to mentally process figurae, since it demands not only the disassociation of the characteristics of a symbol with those of its referent, but this disassociation has to be repeated for each figura that comprises the arbitrary symbol.   Figurae have not yet been recognized in any non-human natural communication system.  Although the honeybee [[waggle dance]] may involve some arbitrary symbols, they are combined with non-arbitrary ones, much like the subway line symbols.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="751">'''Flight hours''' is a term meaning the hours or time spent in the [[sky]] on an [[aircraft]]. Usually, it is meant to show the experience of pilots, with the more flight hours a [[Aircraft pilot|pilot]] has, the more experience.

A '''genus–differentia [[definition]]''' is a type of [[Extensional and intensional definitions#Intensional definition|intensional definition]], and it is composed of two parts:

# '''a [[Genus_(philosophy)|genus]]''' (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus.
# '''the [[differentia]]''': The portion of the definition that is not provided by the genus.
For example, consider these two definitions:
* ''a [[triangle]]'': A plane figure that has 3 straight bounding sides.
* ''a [[quadrilateral]]'': A plane figure that has 4 straight bounding sides.
Those definitions can be expressed as one genus and two ''differentiae'':
# ''one genus'':
#* ''the genus for both a triangle and a quadrilateral'': "A plane figure"
# ''two differentiae'':
#* ''the differentia for a triangle'': "that has 3 straight bounding sides."
#* ''the differentia for a quadrilateral'': "that has 4 straight bounding sides."

== Differentiation and Abstraction ==

The process of producing new definitions by ''extending'' existing definitions is commonly known as '''differentiation''' (and also as '''derivation'''). The reverse process, by which just part of an existing definition is used itself as a new definition, is called '''[[abstraction]]'''; the new definition is called ''an&amp;nbsp;abstraction'' and it is said to have been ''abstracted away from'' the existing definition.

For instance, consider the following:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles, and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.
A part of that definition may be singled out (using parentheses here):
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': (&lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles&lt;/span&gt;), and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.
and with that part, an abstraction may be formed:
* &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;''a [[rectangle]]'': a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles.&lt;/span&gt;
Then, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt; that has bounding sides which all have the same length.

Similarly, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be rearranged and another portion singled out:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': (&lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length&lt;/span&gt;), and that has interior angles which are all right angles.
leading to the following abstraction:
* &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;''a [[rhombus]]'': a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length.&lt;/span&gt;
Then, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt; that has interior angles which are all right angles.

In fact, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be recast in terms of both of the abstractions, where one acts as the genus and the other acts as the differentia:
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt; that is &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt;.
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt; that is &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt;.
Hence, abstraction is crucial in simplifying definitions.

== Multiplicity ==

When multiple definitions could serve equally well, then all such definitions apply simultaneously. Thus, ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' is a member of both the genus ''&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;&amp;#91;a&amp;#93; rectangle&lt;/span&gt;'' and the genus ''&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;&amp;#91;a&amp;#93; rhombus&lt;/span&gt;''. In such a case, it is notationally convenient to consolidate the definitions into one definition that is expressed with multiple genera (and possibly no differentia, as in the following):
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt;.
or completely equivalently:
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt;.

More generally, a collection of &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; equivalent definitions (each of which is expressed with one unique genus) can be recast as one definition that is expressed with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; genera. Thus, the following:
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* &amp;hellip;
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
could be recast as:
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a&amp;hellip; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.

== Structure ==

A genus of a definition provides a means by which to specify an ''[[is-a|is-a relationship]]'':
* A square is a rectangle, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a rhombus, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a&amp;hellip;
The non-genus portion of the differentia of a definition provides a means by which to specify a ''[[has-a|has-a relationship]]'':
* A square has an interior angle that is a right angle.
* A square has a straight bounding side.
* A square has a&amp;hellip;

When a system of definitions is constructed with genera and differentiae, the definitions can be thought of as nodes forming a [[hierarchy]] or—more generally—a [[directed acyclic graph]]; a node that has no [[Directed graph|predecessor]] is ''a&amp;nbsp;most general definition''; each node along a directed path is ''more '''differentiated''''' (or ''more '''derived''''') than any one of its predecessors, and a node with no [[Directed graph|successor]] is ''a&amp;nbsp;most differentiated'' (or ''a&amp;nbsp;most derived'') definition.

When a definition, ''S'', is the [[Directed graph|tail]] of each of its successors (that is, ''S'' has at least one successor and each [[Directed graph|direct successor]] of ''S'' is a most differentiated definition), then ''S'' is often called &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''the '''[[species]]'''''&lt;/span&gt; of each of its successors, and each direct successor of ''S'' is often called &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''an '''[[individual]]'''''&lt;/span&gt; (or &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''an '''[[entity]]'''''&lt;/span&gt;) of the species ''S''; that is, the genus of an individual is synonymously called ''the&amp;nbsp;species'' of that individual. Furthermore, the differentia of an individual is synonymously called &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''the [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]''&lt;/span&gt; of that individual. For instance, consider the following definition:
* ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'': a human that has the name 'John&amp;nbsp;Smith'.
In this case:
* The whole definition is ''an&amp;nbsp;individual''; that is, ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is an individual.
* The genus of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' (which is "a&amp;nbsp;human") may be called synonymously ''the&amp;nbsp;species'' of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith''; that is, ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is an individual of the species ''&amp;#91;a&amp;#93; human''.
* The differentia of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' (which is "that has the name 'John&amp;nbsp;Smith'") may be called synonymously ''the&amp;nbsp;identity'' of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith''; that is, ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is identified among other individuals of the same species by the fact that ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is the one "that has the name 'John Smith'".

As in that example, the identity itself (or some part of it) is often used to refer to the entire individual, a phenomenon that is known in [[linguistics]] as a ''[[pars pro toto|pars&amp;nbsp;pro&amp;nbsp;toto]] [[synecdoche]]''.

==Overview ==

Indications are that the [[prevalence]] of upper back and neck pain has increased dramatically in the decade leading up to 2016.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Hoy DG, Protani M, De R, Buchbinder R. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21665126"The epidemiology of neck pain.’'], ''Best Practice &amp; Research: Clinical rheumatology.'', 2010 Dec;24(6):783-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Amy Cuddy, ''Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges'', Little, Brown and Company, December 2015: 226-8. {{ISBN|9780316256575}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase has been attributed to the corresponding widespread adoption of laptop computers, tablets, smartphones and other small portable digital devices.

Because their screens do not separate from their keyboards these small devices cannot be set up [[ergonomically]] correctly (unless an extra screen or extra keyboard is added). They are unlike personal desk top computers (PCs) in this respect. Most commonly, the user hunches to operate them, often for many hours a day.&lt;ref name="simplyhealth1"&gt;[http://newsroom.simplyhealth.co.uk/iposture-generation-facing-a-lifetime-of-back-pain"iPosture generation facing a lifetime of back pain.’'], ''Simply Health.'', 2 October 2013, Retrieved 13 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunching increases the effective load on the neck up to several times more than does erect posture, due to increasing moment arm.&lt;ref&gt;KK Hansraj, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393825"Assessment of stresses in the cervical spine caused by posture and position of the head."],''Surgery Technology International.'', Nov 25, 2014:277-9&lt;/ref&gt; Local pain, [[cervicogenic headache]] and [[referred pain]] extending down the arms can arise from the sustained muscle strain, cervical [[facet joint]] (or apophyseal, or zygapophyseal joint) compression and diminution of the [[Intervertebral disc|cervical]] foraminal nerve exits.

A hunched posture also sends out a body language message of submission and lower self-confidence, with some research indicating it can actually promote these in the person holding it. A comprehensive view of the research and concepts is found in Dr [[Amy Cuddy]]’s book ‘Presence’ (2015).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Treatment may include analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory medications, regular breaks while using the small devices, muscle strengthening and stretching, massage, spinal manipulation and mobilsation, posture instruction and spinal fulcrums. Biomechanical analysis suggests a combination of approaches is best and gives more lasting results.

== Signs and Symptoms ==

In a neck with perfect posture (as seen for instance in young children) the head is balanced above the shoulders. In this position the load on each [[vertebra]] of the cervical spine is spread evenly between the two facet (apophyseal) joints at the back and the [[intervertebral disc]] and vertebral body at the front.

The iHunch is characterised by a posture with the head sitting somewhat forward of the shoulders (i.e., the ear lobe is anterior to a vertical line through the point of the shoulder (acromion process)). This can be very marked, with the back of the skull positioned anterior to the breastbone (sternum). The chin is poked forward.

When the patient is asked to look up at the ceiling, the hunched-forward upper thoracic curve does not change as viewed from the side. Rather, the lower cervical spine ‘hinges’ backward at C5/6/7, a movement pattern known as ‘swan-necking'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eorthopod.com/news/swan-neck-deformity-of-the-cervical-spine/ "Swan Neck Deformity of the Cervical Spine"],''eOrthopod'', Retrieved 24 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

This indicates that the upper back vertebrae have frozen in their habitual flexed positions, with the surrounding collagen of the ligaments, joint capsules and fascia shortening to reinforce this hypomobility. (This is the dowager’s hump of the elderly of earlier generations, now observable in modern (2016) late teenagers.&lt;ref name="medicinenet1"/&gt;)

Symptoms include overuse muscle pain and fatigue along the back of the neck and reaching down to the mid-back, often starting with the upper [[trapezius]] muscle bellies between the shoulders and neck. Cervicogenic headache from the joints and muscle attachments at the top of the neck is common.&lt;ref&gt;Bogduk N, Govind J.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19747657/ "Cervicogenic headache: an assessment of the evidence on clinical diagnosis, invasive tests, and treatment."],''Lancet Neurol.'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phil Page [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3201065/ "Cervicogenic Headaches: An Evidence-led Approach to Clinical Management"],''International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy.'', Volume 6(3); Sept 2011:254–266&lt;/ref&gt;

The compressive load on the cervical facet joints predisposes to acute joint locking episodes, with pain and movement loss.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Vangindertael ed. [http://www.physio-pedia.com/Facet_Joint_Syndrome "Facet Joint Syndrome"],''Physiopedia'', June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In older patients with already diminished cervical foramina spaces and/or [[osteophytes]], nerve root irritation and impingement can trigger referred pain down the arm(s).&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Jackson [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881998/"The Classic: The Cervical Syndrome"],'' Clinical Orthopeadics and Related Research'', v.468(7); 2010 Jul: 1739–1745&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

The human spine is well suited to erect upright posture, with the increased heart rate from movement shunting a good blood supply to the muscles. This is clearly not the
case for vast numbers of sedentary humans spending many hours daily bent over laptops, tablets, smartphones and similar. A biomechanical assessment of thoracic hunching shows the abnormal spinal loading and other effects which plausibly account for the recent steep rise in thoracic and cervical pain in step with the ubiquitous adoption of the small IT devices.

Hunching has always caused problems, for instance in occupational groups like dentists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dentaleconomics.com/articles/print/volume-98/issue-7/columns/preventing-pain-in-dentistry/trapezius-myalgia-making-dentistry-a-pain-in-the-neck-mdash-or-head.html/"Trapezius myalgia: making dentistry a pain in the neck — or head''], "Dental Economics, vol 98, issue 8; 2008&lt;/ref&gt; surgeons,&lt;ref&gt;Soueid A1, Oudit D, Thiagarajah S, Laitung G.

What has changed is the amount of hunching in society generally, and especially with the technologically adept young.

The first [[laptop]] was produced in 1981 but it took more than a decade of development for the designs to approach current (2016) levels of portability and capacity, and hence uptake. Apple produced the first smartphone (the [[iPhone]]) in 2007 and the first tablet (the [[iPad]]) in 2010. In 2015 there were 4.43 billion [[mobile phone]] (cellphone) users in the world, of which 2.6 billion had smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Piejko [https://deviceatlas.com/blog/16-mobile-market-statistics-you-should-know-2016"16 mobile market statistics you should know in 2016"],''Device Atlas'', 12 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, 45% owned a [[tablet computer]] in 2014 and 92% owned a mobile phone; for younger adults aged 18–29, only 2% didn’t own a mobile phone and 50% had tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Monica Anderson [http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/technology-device-ownership-2015/"Technology Device Ownership: 2015"],''Pew Research Centre: Internet, Science and Tech.'', 29 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A large Finnish cross-sectional study on school-age adolescents published in 2012 concluded that more than two hours a day spent on computers was associated with a moderate/severe increase in musculoskeletal pain.&lt;ref&gt;Paula T Hakala, Lea A Saarni, Raija-Leena Punamäki, Marjut A Wallenius, Clas-Håkan Nygård and Arja H Rimpelä [http://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2474-13-41"Musculoskeletal symptoms and computer use among Finnish adolescents - pain intensity and inconvenience to everyday life: a cross-sectional study’'], ''BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders'', 22 March 2012: {{doi|10.1186/1471-2474-13-41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, the average UK 18-24 year-old spent 8.83 hours a day in front of a PC, laptop or tablet.&lt;ref name="simplyhealth1"/&gt; Neck pain per se has been a large problem for a long time, and surveyed repeatedly.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; A composite review of studies with good methodology by Fejer et al published in 2006 found that point [[prevalence]] (in pain right now) of neck pain in the adult (15–75 years) population ranged from 5.9% to 22.2%, with one study of the elderly (65+ years) finding 38.7% were in pain when surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;Fejer R1, Kyvik KO, Hartvigsen J [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15999284"The prevalence of neck pain in the world population: a systematic critical review of the literature."],''European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society'', 2006 Jun;15(6)):834-48&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, more urban populations had more neck pain, e.g. 22.2% of a large 1998 Canadian study had neck pain when surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;Côté P, Cassidy JD, Carroll L. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9704377"The prevalence of neck pain and related disability in Saskatchewan adults"],''Spine'',1998 Aug 1;23(15):1689-98&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on these surveys of neck pain prevalence, and adding to them the prevalence of thoracic pain and cervicogenic headache, it is reasonable to estimate that around one adult in six (15%) probably has pain in any, some or all of those areas right now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healingartsce.com/ebpneckpain.html “Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain”],''Healing Arts Continuing Education'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However the published [[epidemiological]] papers draw on raw data from surveys done at least 10 years ago, and there are indications that the numbers have been rising dramatically since then – as rapidly as the adoption of laptops, tablets and smartphones. This is reflected in the recent rise in the number of popular articles, news items and media discussions about the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=11531042"Smartphone addiction creating generation of teenage hunchbacks”],''New Zealand Herald'', Sunday Oct 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alyssa Navarro [http://www.techtimes.com/articles/115913/20151215/blame-your-iphone-for-ruining-your-posture-and-your-mood.htm"Blame Your iPhone For Ruining Your Posture And Your Mood”],''TECHTIMES'', 15 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen August [http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/saturday/audio/2576611/steve-august-the-ihunch"Steve August: the iHunch”],''Saturday Morning: Radio New Zealand'', 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathogenesis ==

The iHunch is a multi-factorial problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodystance.co.nz/ihunch.php “The iHunch analysed”], Retrieved 24 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

* Thoracic hunching requires flexing of the thoracic facet joints. After sufficient time and load, they can freeze and lock in this position. The [[collagen]] of the surrounding [[ligaments]], [[fascia]] and [[joint capsules]] will shorten down around the immobile joints, reinforcing the hunched hypomobile section of spine.
* The middle back support muscles ([[erector spinae]], [[rhomboid muscles|rhomboids]], middle and lower trapezius fibres, etc.) become stretched out and weak.
* The cantilevered (poked forward) head position loads the spine up to several times more than erect posture, because of the increased moment arm.&lt;ref&gt;Hansraj KK. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393825"Assessment of stresses in the cervical spine caused by posture and position of the head”],''Surgical Technology International'', 2014 Nov;25::277-9&lt;/ref&gt; So the posterior neck muscles (especially the upper fibres of trapezius) holding the head in its forward position, often sustained for many hours, can strain, producing individual [[myofibril]] and cell damage. Repair of this microtrauma involves the laying down of adhesive [[fibrosis]], as a normal part of the [[inflammatory response]]. Adhesive fibrosis is relatively non-elastic, so after sufficient repeated [[microtrauma]] from muscle strain, the posterior neck muscles become strained, shortened and less elastic.
* In this same cantilevered head position, the [[longus colli]] muscles and other deep neck flexors around the front of the neck are hardly being used, so they become weak, allowing the chin to poke out.
* The combined effect of all the above in the cantilevered head position, with the chin poked out, is to compress every facet joint in the cervical spine. This predisposes to acute locking episodes. At the top of the cervical spine, this often manifests as cervicogenic headache, with pain referring over the head from the C0/1, C1/2, and/or C2/3 joints, and from the insertion of the upper trapezius fibres onto the [[nuchal line]] of the [[occiput]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogduk N, Govind J.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19747657"Cervicogenic headache: an assessment of the evidence on clinical diagnosis, invasive tests, and treatment.”], ''The Lancet. Neurology'', 2009 Oct;8(10):959-68&lt;/ref&gt; In older patients, especially with osteophytes and/or where the [[intervertebral foramina]] are already diminished, this compression and further reduction of the foraminal spaces can result in irritation and impingement of the nerve roots, referring pain some distance down the arm(s).

== Treatment ==

[[Neck pain]] generally has been treated with a profusion of approaches and modalities, including [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen; pain relief medications ([[analgesics]]) such as acetaminophen; low dose tricyclic [[antidepressants]] such as amytriptyline for chronic problems; [[Physical therapy]] (a.k.a. physiotherapy in British-derived cultures) which utilises a wide range of techniques and modalities; spinal manipulation from [[osteopaths]], [[chiropractors]], manipulating physiotherapists and doctors; massage; muscle strengthening programmes including gyms and [[Pilates]]; postural approaches such as the [[Feldenkrais Method]] and the [[Alexander Technique]]; stretching approaches such as [[yoga]]; ergonomic approaches including setting up desk top computers correctly and frequent breaks; [[acupuncture]]; and surgery for severe structural problems such as osteophytic impingement on the cervical nerve roots and [[cervical disc herniation]].

A biomechanical analysis of the iHunch indicates its standard, logical development from much flexed activity and its multi-factorial character. (See '''Pathogenesis''')

A composite approach which covers each component of the problem is therefore likely to be most successful and lasting. Most of the general treatment approaches to neck pain cover only one aspect. A logical response should include as a minimum:

* Strengthening, especially of (1) the middle and lower back support muscles and scapula retractors, and (2) the longus colli and the deep neck flexor muscles.&lt;ref name="healingartsce1"&gt;[http://healingartsce.com/massageneckpainpg3.html “Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain”], ‘’Healing Arts Continuing Education’’, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stretching, especially of the upper fibres of the trapezius muscle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healingartsce.com/massageneckpainpg3.htmll “Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain”], ‘’Healing Arts Continuing Education’’, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Massage, to loosen adhesive fibrotic tethering of the posterior neck and upper trapezius muscles.&lt;ref name="healingartsce1"/&gt;
* Unlocking of the hypomobile (frozen) facet joints of the thoracic spine and stretching of the shortened collagen reinforcing the excessive kyphosis (hunch). A sufficiently tight patch of thoracic spine cannot be freed up solely by patient exercises, stretches or movements. This is due to leverage – with any general exercise, the segments of the spine that are moving well will tend to move more, reducing the leverage on the hypomobile segments. A sufficiently localised external force is then necessary, such as specific hands-on spinal mobilisation or manipulation. A randomized clinical trial by Cleland et al showed manipulation of the thoracic spine reduced neck pain immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland JA, Childs JD, McRae M, Palmer JA, Stowell T. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15922233"Immediate effects of thoracic manipulation in patients with neck pain: a randomized clinical trial.”], ''Manual Therapy'', 2005 May;10(2):127-35&lt;/ref&gt;
* However unless the surrounding shortened collagen also receives sufficient stretching, collagen rebound will tend to freeze up the facet joint again rapidly. Collagen is stronger by weight than steel wire and is best stretched by a sufficiently long, strong, localised, passive stretch.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew A Fisher [http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Ce-Co/Collagen.html"Chemistry Explained Collagen”], ''Chemistry Encyclopedia'', Retrieved 24 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In practical terms this may be achieved by the hunched patient lying back on a spinal fulcrum device, which uses the upper body weight to provide the external force, localised over the fulcrum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12342">{{About|the English personal pronoun|other uses|I (disambiguation)}}
The pronoun '''''I''''' {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is the [[grammatical person|first-person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[nominative case]] [[personal pronoun]] in [[Modern English]].  It is used to refer to one's [[self]] and is [[capitalization|capitalized]], although other pronouns, such as ''he'' or ''she'', are not capitalized.

The grammatical variants of ''I'' are ''me'', ''my'', ''mine'', and ''myself''.

==Etymology==
{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2015}}
{{Further|Old English pronouns|Proto-Germanic pronouns|Proto-Indo-European pronouns}}
English ''I'' originates from [[Old English]] (OE) ''ic''. Its predecessor ''ic'' had in turn originated from the continuation of [[Proto-Germanic]] *''ik'', and ''ek''; the asterisk denotes an unattested form, ''ek'' was attested in the [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions (in some cases notably showing the variant ''eka''; see also [[ek erilaz]]). Linguists assume ''ik'' to have developed from the unstressed variant of ''ek''. Variants of ''ic'' were used in various English dialects up until the 1600s.{{sfn| OED online}}

Germanic cognates are: [[Old Frisian]] ''ik'', [[Old Norse]] ''ek'' ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''jeg'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''jag'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ég), [[Old High German]] ''ih'' ([[German language|German]] ''[[:wikt:ich|ich]]'') and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''ik'' and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] also "ik".

The Proto-Germanic root came, in turn, from the [[Proto Indo-European language]] (PIE). The reconstructed PIE pronoun is *''egō, egóm'', with cognates including
[[Sanskrit]] ''aham'', [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''uk'', [[Latin]] ''ego'', [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐγώ}} ''egō'', [[Common Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] ''azъ'' and [[Alviri-Vidari language|Alviri-Vidari]] (an Iranian language) {{lang|fa|اَز}} ''az''.

The oblique forms are formed from a stem  ''*me-'' (English ''me''), the plural from ''*wei-'' (English ''we''), the oblique plurals from ''*ns-'' (English ''us'') and from Proto-Germanic ''*unseraz'', PIE ''*no-s-ero-'' (''our, ours'').

== Capitalization ==
''I'' (and only this form of the pronoun) is the only pronoun that is always capitalized in English.{{Efn-lr|Other pronouns may be capitalized when referring to the Deity ("God's in His heaven") and, of course, when beginning a sentence. The capitalization of the first person pronoun is distinctive of English, although it is common in other languages to capitalize a second person pronoun, for example ''Sie'' in German.}} This practice became established in the late 15th century, though lowercase ''i'' was sometimes found as late as the 17th century.{{Sfn|Fowler|2015}}

== Case forms ==
{{See also|Objective case#English}}
Like the  other [[English personal pronouns]] ''we'' (''us''), ''he'' (''him''), ''she'' (''her''), and ''they'' (''them''), the pronoun ''I'' has several singular case forms.{{efn-lr |name=Terminology|Terminological note: &lt;br/&gt;Authorities use different terms for the inflectional ([[grammatical case|case]]) forms of the personal pronouns, such as the [[oblique case|oblique-case]] form ''me'', which is used as a direct object, indirect object, or object of a preposition, as well as other uses. For instance, one standard work on English grammar, ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'', uses the term ''objective case'', while another, ''[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]]'', uses the term ''accusative'' case. Similarly, some use the term ''nominative'' for the form ''I'', while others use the term ''subjective''. Some authorities use the term ''genitive'' for forms such as ''my'' where others use the term ''possessive''. Some grammars refer to ''my'' and ''mine'', respectively, as the ''dependent genitive'' and the ''independent genitive'', while others call ''my'' a ''possessive adjective'' and ''mine'' a ''possessive pronoun''.}}
These are:{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=458}} 
* ''I'', the nominative (or subjective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form 
* ''me'', the accusative (or objective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form
* ''my'', the dependent genitive (or possessive adjective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form
* ''mine'', the independent genitive case form (or possessive pronoun{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}})

=== Use of ''I'' and ''me'' ===
There are some situations in which only the nominative form (''I'')  is grammatically correct and others in which only the accusative form (''me'')  is correct. There are also situations in which one form is used in informal style (and was often considered ungrammatical by older prescriptive grammars) and the other form is preferred in formal style.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=458}}

====Exclusive use of nominative ''I''====
In all varieties of standard English, the nominative form ''I'' is used exclusively when it is the whole{{efn-lr|name=Non-coordinative|Not part of a  coordinative construction with ''and'', for instance.}} subject of an ''explicit'' verb,{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=458-459}} e.g. 
* "I did it."
not 
* * "Me did it."{{efn-lr|name=Asterisk|The asterisk preceding this example indicates that the utterance is not acceptable in standard English. For an explanation of this linguistic convention, see [[Asterisk#Linguistics]]}}
With other pronouns, such as ''we'' (strictly speaking when used as a personal determiner), there may be exceptions to this in some varieties of English.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}

====Exclusive use of accusative ''me''====
In all varieties of standard English, the accusative form ''me'' is used exclusively when it is the whole{{efn-lr|name=Non-coordinative}} direct or indirect object{{efn-lr|including the subject of a non-finite clause introduced by ''for'', e.g. "For me to do that would be more than a crime."}} of a verb or preposition.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}  The accusative ''me'' is also required in a number of constructions such as "Silly me!"{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=461–462}}

====Alternative use of nominative and accusative====
In many situations, both the nominative ''I'' and the accusative ''me'' are encountered.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=459–461}}

When the pronoun is used as a subjective predicative complement, the nominative ''I'' is sometimes encountered in (very)  formal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=459–461}}
* "It is I."
But this is often seen as hypercorrect and may be unacceptable, as in:
* * "This one [photograph] is I as a baby.{{efn-lr|name=Asterisk}}
''Me'' is usually preferred as a subjective predicate, especially in informal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}
* "This is me as a baby." 
* "It's me!"
The nominative ''I'' is more common in this role when it is followed by a relative clause:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}
* "It is I she loves." 
* "It is I who love you." 
though even here ''me'' is more common in non-formal style:
* "It's me she loves." 
* "It's me who loves you."

Following ''as'' or ''than'' (without a following explicit verb),  the accusative form is common:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=460}}
* "She is older than me."
However, where it is possible to think of the pronoun as the subject of an implicit verb and ''than'' or ''as'' as a conjunction, the nominative ''I'' is found in formal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=460}}
* "She is older than I [am]."

In [[Australian English]], [[British English]] and [[Irish English]], many speakers have an unstressed form of ''my'' that is identical to ''me'' (see [[English personal pronouns#Archaic and non-standard forms|archaic and non-standard forms of English personal pronouns]]).

=====Coordinative constructions=====
The above applies when the pronoun stands alone as the subject or object.
In some  varieties  English (particularly formal English), those rules also apply in coordinative constructions such as "you and I".{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462–463}} So the correct form is 
* "My husband and I wish you a merry Christmas."
* "Between you and me ..."

In some varieties of non-standard informal English, the accusative is sometimes used when the pronoun is part of a coordinative ''subject'' construction,{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462–463}} as in
* "Phil and me wish you a merry Christmas."
This is highly stigmatized.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462-463}}

On the other hand, the use of the nominative ''I'' in coordinative constructions like "you and I"where ''me'' would be used in a non-coordinative object is less stigmatized – and in some cases so widespread as to be considered a variety of standard English:{{sfn |Huddleston |Pullum |2002 |p=463}} 
* "President Bush graciously invited Michelle and I to meet with him ..."
* "All debts are cleared between you and I".

'''Invective''' (from [[Middle English]] ''invectif'', or [[Old French]] and [[Late Latin]] ''invectus'') is abusive, reproachful, or venomous language used to express blame or censure; or, a form of rude expression or discourse intended to offend or hurt;&lt;ref&gt;"in·vec·tive."

== The genre of invective ==
The "genre of invective" or "invective (genre)" or "''vituperatio''" in Latin is a form of classical libel used in [[Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Latin literature|Roman]] polemical verse as well as in prose, but its primary context is rhetoric.

The rhetorical genre of ''vituperatio'' belongs to the ''genus demonstrativum'', which is composed by the praise and blame.

During the Roman Republic, personal invectives and character assassination were widely used during the forensic speeches as well as orations. Cicero made a large use of the invectives against his political foes such as Clodius, Catilina (Catilinarian speeches) or Mark Antony (Philippics). The commonly charges are avarice, cupidity, cowardice, effeminacy, drunkenness, low writing and speaking skills, luxury, disapproved sexual habits, tyrannical behaviour, etc.

Between 44 BC and 30 BC, the invective became a tool during the propaganda war between Octavian and Mark Antony&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le conflit propagandiste entre Octavien et Marc Antoine. De l'usage politique de la uituperatio entre 44 et 30 a. C. n.|last=Borgies|first=Loïc|publisher=Latomus|year=2016|isbn=978-90-429-3459-7|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Among many other slanders, Mark Antony was accused to have married a foreign queen Cleopatra, to be the submissive subject of her and to have lose his Roman identity. According to this propaganda, Cleopatra would plan to invade Italia. This propaganda before the battle of Actium in 31 BC permits to Octavian to present his campaign as a legitimate war for the safe of the Roman Republic.

The preferred literary term for invective of the [[Renaissance]] is [[Libel (poetry)|libel]].

The ancient and original form did not include the words, "a sinner", which were added later.&lt;ref name=Ware &gt;''On the Prayer of Jesus'' by Ignatius Brianchaninov, Kallistos Ware 2006 {{ISBN|1-59030-278-8}} pages xxiii–xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathewes-Green2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederica Mathewes-Green|title=The Jesus Prayer: The Ancient Desert Prayer that Tunes the Heart to God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hHIG2hFP8QYC&amp;pg=PA76|year=2009|publisher=Paraclete Press|isbn=978-1-55725-659-1|page=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often repeated continually as a part of personal [[ascetic]] practice, its use being an integral part of the [[eremitic]] tradition of [[prayer]] known as [[Hesychasm]].{{efn|{{lang-grc|ἡσυχάζω}}, ''isycházo'', "to keep stillness".}} The prayer is particularly esteemed by the spiritual fathers of this tradition (see ''[[Philokalia]]'') as a method of opening up the heart (''kardia'') and bringing about the '''Prayer of the Heart''' ({{lang|el|Καρδιακή Προσευχή}}). The Prayer of The Heart is considered to be the Unceasing Prayer that the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] advocates in the New Testament.&lt;ref name="OrthodoxWiki"/&gt; [[Theophan the Recluse]] regarded the ''Jesus Prayer'' stronger than all other prayers by virtue of the power of the [[Holy Name of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Ware /&gt;

As distinct from the prayer itself, the Eastern Orthodox theology of the Jesus Prayer enunciated in the 14th century by [[Gregory Palamas]] was generally rejected by Latin Catholic theologians until the 20th century, but Pope John Paul II called Gregory Palamas a saint,&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1979/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19791130_turkey-efeso_fr.html Pope John Paul II, Homily at Ephesus, 30 November 1979]&lt;/ref&gt; cited him as a great writer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1997/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_12111997_en.html Pope John Paul II, General Audience, 12 November 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; and an authority on theology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19901114en.html Pope John Paul II, General Audience, 14 November 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1997/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_12111997_it.html Pope John Paul II, General Audience, 19 November 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2000/apr-jun/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20000525_jubilee-science_en.html Pope John Paul II, Jubilee of Scientists]&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke with appreciation of Palamas's intent "to emphasize the concrete possibility that man is given to unite himself with the Triune God in the intimacy of his heart".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope John Paul II]]'s [http://www.catholicculture.org/library/view.cfm?recnum=5660 Angelus Message], 11 August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Jesus Prayer can be seen the Eastern counterpart of the [[rosary]], which has developed to hold a similar place in the Christian West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosarium Virginis Mariae]] [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20021016_rosarium-virginis-mariae_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The prayer's origin is most likely the [[Thebaid|Egyptian desert]], which was settled by the monastic [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] in the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Guillaumont reports the finding of an inscription containing the Jesus Prayer in the ruins of a cell in the Egyptian desert dated roughly to the period being discussed&amp;nbsp;– Antoine Guillaumont, ''Une inscription coe sur la prière de Jesus'' in ''Aux origines du monachisme chrétien, Pour une phénoménologie du monachisme'', pp. 168–83. In ''Spiritualité orientale et vie monastique'', No 30. Bégrolles en Mauges (Maine &amp; Loire), France: Abbaye de Bellefontaine.&lt;/ref&gt;

A formula similar to the standard form of the Jesus Prayer is found in a letter attributed to [[John Chrysostom]], who died in AD&amp;nbsp;407. This "Letter to an Abbot" speaks of "Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy" and "Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on us" being used as ceaseless prayer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/pgm/PG_Migne/John%20Chrysostom_PG%2047-64/Epistula%20ad%20abbatem.pdf ''Epistula ad abbatem'', p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some consider this letter dubious or spurious and attribute it to an unknown writer of unknown date.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolopoulos, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

What may be the earliest explicit reference to the Jesus Prayer in a form that is similar to that used today is in ''Discourse on Abba Philimon'' from the ''[[Philokalia]]''. Philimon lived around AD&amp;nbsp;600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McGinn, Bernard |title=The essential writings of Christian mysticism |publisher=Modern Library |location=New York |year=2006 |page=125 |isbn=0-8129-7421-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKkJs-KHCakC&amp;pg=PA125}}&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The version cited by Philimon is, "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me," which is apparently the earliest source to cite this standard version.&lt;ref name="Philokalia507"&gt;{{cite book |author=Palmer, G.E.H. |title=The Philokalia, Volume 2 |publisher=Faber |location=London |year= |page=507 |isbn=|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=aBkJAARHyoMC&amp;pg=PA507}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the prayer itself was in use by that time, [[John S. Romanides]] writes that "We are still searching the Fathers for the term 'Jesus prayer.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.00.en.some_underlying_positions_of_this_website.htm John S. Romanides, ''Some Underlying Positions of This Website'', 11, note]&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar idea is recommended in the ''[[Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' of [[John Climacus]] (circa 523–606), who recommends the regular practice of a ''monologistos'', or one-worded "Jesus Prayer".&lt;ref name="Mathewes-Green2009" /&gt; The use of the Jesus Prayer according to the tradition of the ''Philokalia'' is the subject of the 19th century anonymous Russian spiritual classic ''[[The Way of a Pilgrim]]'', also in the original form, without the addition of the words "a sinner".&lt;ref name="wayofpilgrim" /&gt;

Though the Jesus Prayer has been practiced through the centuries as part of the Eastern tradition, in the 20th century, it also began to be used in some Western churches, including some Latin Catholic and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches.

==Theology==
{{see also|Eastern Orthodox theology}}

The [[hesychasm|hesychastic]] practice of the Jesus Prayer is founded on the biblical view by which God's name is conceived as the place of his presence.&lt;ref name="raduca-2006"&gt;{{Ro icon}} Vasile Răducă, ''Ghidul creştinului ortodox de azi'' (''Guide for the contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christian''), second edition, [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas Ed.]], [[Bucharest]], 2006, p. 81, {{ISBN|978-973-50-1161-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox mysticism has no images or representations. The mystical practice (the prayer and the meditation) doesn't lead to perceiving representations of God (see below [[#Palamism, the underlying theology|Palamism]]). Thus, the most important means of a life consecrated to praying is the invoked ''name of God'', as it is emphasized since the 5th century by the [[Thebaid]] [[hermit|anchorites]], or by the later [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] [[Hesychasm|hesychasts]]. For the Orthodox the power of the Jesus Prayer comes not only from its content, but from the very invocation of Jesus name.&lt;ref name="bulgakov-orthodoxy"&gt;{{Ro icon}} [[Sergei Bulgakov]], ''Ortodoxia'' (''The Orthodoxy''), translation from [[French language|French]], Paideia Ed., [[Bucharest]], 1997, pp. 161, 162-163, {{ISBN|973-9131-26-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scriptural roots===
Theologically, the Jesus Prayer is considered to be the response of the Holy Tradition to the lesson taught by the parable of [[Pharisee and the Publican|the Publican and the Pharisee]], in which the Pharisee demonstrates the improper way to pray by exclaiming: "Thank you Lord that I am not like the Publican", whereas the Publican prays correctly in humility, saying "Lord have mercy on me, a sinner" ({{bibleverse||Luke|18:10-14|KJV}}).&lt;ref name="goarch-jp"&gt;Steven Peter Tsichlis, [http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article7104.asp The Jesus Prayer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207085923/http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article7104.asp |date=2005-02-07 }}, [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]. Retrieved March 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palamism, the underlying theology===

{{main article|Tabor Light|World (theology)}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The [[essence–energies distinction]], a central principle in Orthodox theology, was first formulated by [[Gregory of Nyssa]] and developed by [[Gregory Palamas]] in the 14th century in support of the mystical practices of [[Hesychasm]] and against [[Barlaam of Seminara]]. It stands that God's ''essence'' ({{Lang-grc|Οὐσία}}, ''[[ousia]]'') is distinct from God's ''energies'', or manifestations in the world, by which men can experience the Divine. The energies are "unbegotten" or "uncreated". They were revealed in various episodes of the [[Bible]]: the [[burning bush]] seen by [[Moses]], the [[Tabor Light|Light]] on [[Mount Tabor]] at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].

[[Apophatic theology|Apophatism]]&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Orthodox theology doesn't stand [[Thomas Aquinas]]' interpretation to the ''Mystycal theology'' of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (''modo sublimiori'' and ''modo significandi'', by which Aquinas unites positive and negative theologies, transforming the negative one into a correction of the positive one). Like pseudo-Denys, the Eastern Church remarks the [[antinomy]] between the two ways of talking about God and acknowledges the superiority of apophatism. Cf. Vladimir Lossky, op. cit., p. 55, [[Dumitru Stăniloae]], op. cit., pp. 261–262.&lt;/ref&gt; (negative theology) is the main characteristic of the Eastern theological tradition. [[wikt:incognoscible|Incognoscibility]] is not conceived as [[agnosticism]] or refusal to know God, because the Eastern theology is not concerned with abstract concepts; it is contemplative, with a discourse on things above rational understanding. Therefore, dogmas are often expressed antinomically.&lt;ref name="lossky"&gt;{{Ro icon}} [[Vladimir Lossky]], ''Teologia mistică a Bisericii de Răsărit'' (''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church''), translation from [[French language|French]], Anastasia Ed., [[Bucharest]], 1993, pp. 36–37, 47–48, 55, 71. {{ISBN|973-95777-3-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of contemplation, is experience of God, [[lighting|illumination]] called the Vision of God or in Greek [[theoria]].&lt;ref&gt;The Vision of God by [[Vladimir Lossky]] SVS Press, 1997. ({{ISBN|0-913836-19-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Eastern Orthodox the knowledge or {{lang|el|[[noesis]]}} of the uncreated energies is usually linked to apophatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [[Dumitru Stăniloae|Fr. Dumitru Stăniloae]], ''Ascetica şi mistica Biserici Ortodoxe'' (''Ascetics and Mystics of the Eastern Orthodox Church''), Institutul Biblic şi de Misiune al BOR ([[Romanian Orthodox Church]] Publishing House), 2002, p. 268, {{ISBN|0-913836-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Philokalia, Vol. 4 {{ISBN|0-571-19382-X}} Palmer, G.E.H; Sherrard, Philip; Ware, Kallistos (Timothy) On the Inner Nature of Things and on the Purification of the Intellect: One Hundred Texts [[Nikitas Stithatos]] (Nikitas Stethatos)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repentance in Eastern Orthodoxy===
{{see also|Eastern Orthodox view of sin}}
The Eastern Orthodox Church holds a non-juridical view of sin, by contrast to the [[atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction view]] of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for sin as articulated in the [[Western Christianity|West]], firstly by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (as debt of honor){{Request quotation|date=August 2012}}) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (as a moral debt).{{Request quotation|date=August 2012}}  The terms used in the East are less legalistic (''grace'', ''punishment''), and more medical (''sickness'', ''healing'') with less exacting precision. Sin, therefore, does not carry with it the guilt for breaking a rule, but rather the impetus to become something more than what men usually are. One repents not because one is or isn't virtuous, but because human nature can change. Repentance ({{Lang-grc|μετάνοια}}, ''[[metanoia (theology)|metanoia]]'', "changing one's mind") isn't remorse, justification, or punishment, but a continual enactment of one's freedom, deriving from renewed choice and leading to restoration (the return to man's [[Fall of Man|original state]]).&lt;ref name="goarch-repentance"&gt;John Chryssavgis, [http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article8493.asp Repentance and Confession - Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317005146/http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article8493.asp |date=2008-03-17 }}, [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]. Retrieved 21 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the [[Sacred Mystery|Mystery]] of [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] for which, not being limited to a mere confession of sins and presupposing recommendations or penalties, it is primarily that the priest acts in his capacity of spiritual father.&lt;ref name="raduca-2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="russ-catechism"&gt;[http://orthodoxeurope.org/page/10/1.aspx An Online Orthodox Catechism], [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Retrieved 21 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mystery of Confession is linked to the spiritual development of the individual, and relates to the practice of choosing an elder to trust as his or her spiritual guide, turning to him for advice on the personal spiritual development, confessing sins, and asking advice.

As stated at the local Council of Constantinople in 1157, Christ brought his redemptive sacrifice not to the [[God the Father|Father]] alone, but to the [[Trinity]] as a whole. In the Eastern Orthodox theology redemption isn't seen as ''ransom''. It is the ''reconciliation'' of God with man, the manifestation of God’s love for humanity. Thus, it is not the anger of God the Father but His love that lies behind the sacrificial death of his son on the cross.&lt;ref name="russ-catechism" /&gt;

The redemption of man is not considered to have taken place only in the past, but continues to this day through [[theosis (Eastern Christian theology)|theosis]]. The initiative belongs to God, but presupposes man's active acceptance (not an action only, but an attitude), which is a way of perpetually receiving God.&lt;ref name="goarch-repentance" /&gt;

===Distinctiveness from analogues in other religions===
The practice of contemplative or meditative chanting is known in several religions including [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]] (e.g. [[japa]], [[zikr]]). The form of internal contemplation involving profound inner transformations affecting all the levels of the self is common to the traditions that posit the ontological value of personhood.&lt;ref&gt;Olga Louchakova, ''Ontopoiesis and Union in the Jesus Prayer: Contributions to Psychotherapy and Learning'', in ''Logos pf Phenomenology and Phenomenology of Logos. Book Four&amp;nbsp;– The Logos of Scientific Interrogation. Participating in Nature-Life-Sharing in Life'', [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Ed.]], 2006, p. 292, {{ISBN|1-4020-3736-8}}. [[Google Scholar]]: [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=exqlzPD9KGMC].&lt;/ref&gt; The history of these practices, including their possible spread from one religion to another, is not well understood. Such parallels (like between unusual psycho-spiritual experiences, breathing practices, postures, spiritual guidances of elders, peril warnings) might easily have arisen independently of one another, and in any case must be considered within their particular religious frameworks.

Although some aspects of the Jesus Prayer may resemble some aspects of other traditions, its Christian character is central rather than mere "local color". The aim of the Christian practicing it is not limited to attaining humility, love, or purification of sinful thoughts, but rather it is becoming holy and seeking union with God (''theosis''), which subsumes all the aforementioned virtues. Thus, for the Eastern Orthodox:&lt;ref name="panagiotis-ro"&gt;{{Ro icon}} Hristofor Panaghiotis, ''Rugăciunea lui Iisus. Unirea minţii cu inima şi a omului cu Dumnezeu'' (''Jesus prayer. Uniting the mind with the heart and man with God by Panagiotis K. Christou''), translation from [[Greek language|Greek]], second edition, Panaghia Ed., Rarău Monastery, [[Vatra Dornei]], pp. 6, 12-15, 130, {{ISBN|978-973-88218-6-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The Jesus Prayer is, first of all, a prayer addressed to God. It's not a means of self-deifying or self-deliverance, but a counterexample to [[Fall of Man|Adam's pride]], repairing the breach it produced between man and God.
:* The aim is not to be dissolved or absorbed into nothingness or into God, or reach another state of mind, but to (re)unite{{efn|''Unite'' if referring to one person; ''reunite'' if talking at an anthropological level.}} with God (which by itself is a process) while remaining a distinct person.
:* It is an invocation of Jesus' name, because [[Christian anthropology]] and [[soteriology]] are strongly linked to [[Christology]] in Orthodox monasticism.
:* In a modern context the continuing repetition is regarded by some as a form of [[meditation]], the prayer functioning as a kind of [[mantra]]. However, Orthodox users of the Jesus Prayer emphasize the ''invocation'' of the name of Jesus Christ that Hesychios describes in ''Pros Theodoulon'' which would be [[contemplation]] on the Triune God rather than simply emptying the mind.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
:* Acknowledging "a sinner" is to lead firstly to a state of humbleness and repentance, recognizing one's own sinfulness.
:* Practicing the Jesus Prayer is strongly linked to mastering passions of both soul and body, e.g. by [[Eastern Orthodoxy#Fasting|fasting]]. For the Eastern Orthodox not the body is wicked, but "the bodily way of thinking" is; therefore [[salvation]] also regards the body.
:* Unlike "seed syllables" in particular traditions of chanting [[mantra]]s, the Jesus Prayer may be translated into whatever language the pray-er customarily uses. The emphasis is on the meaning, not on the mere utterance of certain sounds.
:* There is no emphasis on the psychosomatic techniques, which are merely seen as helpers for uniting the mind with the heart, not as prerequisites.

A magistral way of meeting God for the Orthodox,&lt;ref name="kallistos-ware"&gt;{{Ro icon}} ''Puterea Numelui sau despre Rugăciunea lui Iisus'' (''The Power of the Name. The Jesus Prayer in Orthodox Spirituality'') in [[Kallistos Ware]], ''Rugăciune şi tăcere în spiritualitatea ortodoxă'' (''Prayer and silence in the Orthodox spirituality''), translation from [[English language|English]], Christiana Ed., [[Bucharest]], 2003, p. 23, 26, {{ISBN|973-8125-42-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Jesus Prayer does not harbor any secrets in itself, nor does its practice reveal any esoteric truths.&lt;ref name="ioan-rarau"&gt;{{Ro icon}} Fr. Ioan de la Rarău, ''Rugăciunea lui Iisus. Întrebări şi răspunsuri'' (''Jesus Prayer. Questions and answers''), Panaghia Ed., Rarău Monastery, [[Vatra Dornei]], p. 97. {{ISBN|978-973-88218-6-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, as a [[hesychasm|hesychastic]] practice, it demands setting the mind apart from rational activities and ignoring the physical senses for the experiential knowledge of God. It stands along with the regular expected actions of the believer (prayer, almsgiving, repentance, fasting etc.) as the response of the Orthodox Tradition to [[Paul the Apostle]]'s challenge to "pray without ceasing" ({{bibleverse|1|Thess|5:17}}).&lt;ref name="goarch-jp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="panagiotis-ro" /&gt; It is also linked to the [[Song of Solomon]]'s passage from the [[Old Testament]]: "I sleep, but my heart is awake" (Song of Solomon 5:2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=song%20of%20songs%205:2;&amp;version=50; |title=Song of songs 5:2;&amp;nbsp;– Passage Lookup&amp;nbsp;— New King James Version |publisher=BibleGateway.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analogy being that as a lover is always conscious to his or her beloved, people can also achieve a state of "constant prayer" where they are always conscious of God's presence in their lives.

==Practice==
The practice of the Jesus Prayer is integrated into the mental [[asceticism|ascesis]] undertaken by the Orthodox [[monasticism|monastic]] in the practice of [[hesychasm]]. Yet the Jesus Prayer is not limited only to monastic life or to clergy. Anyone may practice this prayer, laypeople and clergy, men, women and children.

[[Image:Eastern-Orthodox-prayer-rope 2006-06-02.jpg|thumb|left|Eastern Orthodox [[prayer rope]]]]
[[Image:Rublev's saviour.jpg|thumb|left|[[Christ the Redeemer (icon)|Christ the Redeemer]] by [[Andrei Rublev]] ({{circa|1410}}, [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]])]]
In the Eastern tradition the prayer is said or prayed repeatedly, often with the aid of a [[prayer rope]] ({{lang-ru|chotki}}; {{lang-el|komvoskini}}), which is a cord, usually woolen, tied with many knots. The person saying the prayer says one repetition for each knot. It may be accompanied by [[poklon|prostrations]] and the [[sign of the cross]], signaled by beads strung along the prayer rope at intervals.
The prayer rope is "a tool of prayer" and an aid to beginners or those who face difficulties practicing the Prayer.

The Jesus Prayer may be practiced under the guidance and supervision of a spiritual guide (pneumatikos, {{lang|el|πνευματικός}}), and or [[Starets]], especially when psychosomatic techniques (like rhythmical breath) are incorporated. A person that acts as a spiritual "father" and advisor may be an official certified by the Church [[Confessor]] (Pneumatikos Exolmologitis) or sometimes a spiritually experienced monk (called in [[Greek language|Greek]] Gerontas ([[Elder (Christianity)|Elder]]) or in Russian [[Starets]]). It is possible for that person to be a layperson, usually a "practical theologician" (i.e. a person well versed in Orthodox theology but without official credentials, certificates, diplomas etc.).

===Techniques===
There are no fixed rules for those who pray, "the way there is no mechanical, physical or mental technique which can force God to show his presence" ([[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Kallistos Ware]]).&lt;ref name="kallistos-ware" /&gt;

In ''[[The Way of a Pilgrim]]'', the pilgrim advises, "as you draw your breath in, say, or imagine yourself saying, 'Lord Jesus Christ,' and as you breathe again, 'have mercy on me.'"&lt;ref name="wayofpilgrim"&gt;{{cite book |last=French |first1=R. M. |url=http://desertfathers.webs.com/thewayofthepilgrim.htm |title=The Way of a Pilgrim |editor-last=French |editor-first=R. M. |publisher= Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge |year=1930 |accessdate=2016-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another option is to say (orally or mentally) the whole prayer while breathing in and again the whole prayer while breathing out and yet another, to breathe in recite the whole prayer, breathe out while reciting the whole prayer again. One can also hold the breath for a few seconds between breathing in and out.

Monks may pray this prayer many hundreds of times each night as part of their private cell vigil ("cell rule"). Under the guidance of an Elder (Russian ''[[Starets]]''; Greek ''Gerondas''), the monk aims to internalize the prayer, so that he is praying unceasingly. Diadochos of Photiki refers in ''On Spiritual Knowledge and Discrimination'' to the automatic repetition of the Jesus Prayer, under the influence of the [[Holy Spirit]], even in sleep. This state is regarded as the accomplishment of Paul the Apostle's exhortation to the Thessalonians to "pray without ceasing" ({{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:17|KJV}}).

The Jesus Prayer can be used for a kind of "psychological" self-analysis. According to the ''Way of the Pilgrim'' account and Mount Athos practitioners of the Jesus Prayer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailygreece.com/2008/03/post_246.php |title=greek news: Οι τρόποι της ευχής |publisher=Dailygreece.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; "one can have some insight on his or her current psychological situation by observing the intonation of the words of the prayer, as they are recited. Which word is stressed most. This self-analysis could reveal to the praying person things about their inner state and feelings, maybe not yet realised, of their unconsciousness."&lt;ref name="byethost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prayercraft.byethost8.com/JesusPrayer.htm |title=On the Jesus Prayer |publisher=Prayercraft.byethost8.com |date=2004-11-27 |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"While praying the Jesus Prayer, one might notice that sometimes the word 'Lord' is pronounced louder, more stressed, than the others, like: ''Lord'' Jesus Christ, (Son of God), have mercy on me, (a/the sinner). In this case, they say, it means that our inner self is currently more aware of the fact that Jesus is the Lord, maybe because we need reassurance that he is in control of everything (and our lives too). Other times, the stressed word is 'Jesus': Lord ''Jesus'' Christ, (Son of God), have mercy on me, (a/the sinner). In that case, they say, we feel the need to personally appeal more to his human nature, the one that is more likely to understands our human problems and shortcomings, maybe because we are going through tough personal situations. Likewise if the word 'Christ' is stressed it could be that we need to appeal to Jesus as Messiah and Mediator, between humans and God the Father, and so on. When the word 'Son' is stressed maybe we recognise more Jesus' relationship with the Father. If 'of God' is stressed then we could realise more Jesus' unity with the Father. A stressed 'have mercy on me' shows a specific, or urgent, need for mercy. A stressed 'a sinner' (or 'the sinner') could mean that there is a particular current realisation of the sinful human nature or a particular need for forgiveness.

"In order to do this kind of self-analysis one should better start reciting the prayer relaxed and naturally for a few minutes{{spaced ndash}} so the observation won't be consciously 'forced', and then to start paying attention to the intonation as described above.

Also, a person might want to consciously stress one of the words of the prayer in particular when one wants to express a conscious feeling of situation. So in times of need stressing the 'have mercy' part can be more comforting or more appropriate. In times of failures, the 'a sinner' part, etc....)."&lt;ref name="byethost1"/&gt;

===Levels of the prayer===
[[Image:StJohnClimacus.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Icon of ''[[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' (the steps toward theosis as described by [[John Climacus]]) showing monks ascending (and falling from) the ladder to Jesus]]
[[Paul Nicolaevich Evdokimov|Paul Evdokimov]], a 20th-century [[Russia]]n philosopher and theologian, writes&lt;ref name="evdokimov-prayer"&gt;{{Ro icon}} [[Paul Evdokimov]], ''Rugăciunea în Biserica de Răsărit'' (''Prayer in the Church of the East''), translation from [[French language|French]], Polirom Ed., [[Bucharest]], 1996, pp. 29-31, {{ISBN|973-9248-15-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; about beginner's way of praying: initially, the prayer is excited because the man is emotive and a flow of psychic contents is expressed. In his view this condition comes, for the modern men, from the separation of the mind from the heart: "The prattle spreads the soul, while the silence is drawing it together." Old fathers condemned elaborate phraseologies, for one word was enough for the publican, and one word saved the thief on the cross. They only uttered Jesus' name by which they were contemplating God. For Evdokimov the acting faith denies any formalism which quickly installs in the external prayer or in the life duties; he quotes [[Seraphim of Sarov]]: "The prayer is not thorough if the man is self-conscious and he is aware he's praying."

"Because the prayer is a living reality, a deeply personal encounter with the living God, it is not to be confined to any given classification or rigid analysis"&lt;ref name="goarch-jp" /&gt; an on-line catechism reads. As general guidelines for the practitioner, different number of levels (3, 7 or 9) in the practice of the prayer are distinguished by Orthodox fathers. They are to be seen as being purely informative, because the practice of the Prayer of the Heart is learned under personal spiritual guidance in Eastern Orthodoxy which emphasizes the perils of temptations when it's done by one's own. Thus, [[Theophan the Recluse]], a 19th-century [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] spiritual writer, talks about three stages:&lt;ref name="goarch-jp" /&gt;
# The oral prayer (the prayer of the lips) is a simple recitation, still external to the practitioner.
# The focused prayer, when "the mind is focused upon the words" of the prayer, "speaking them as if they were our own."
# The prayer of the heart itself, when the prayer is no longer something we do but who we are.
Once this is achieved the Jesus Prayer is said to become "self-active" ({{lang|el|αυτενεργούμενη}}). It is repeated automatically and unconsciously by the mind, becoming an internal habit like a (beneficial) [[Earworm]]. Body, through the uttering of the prayer, mind, through the mental repetition of the prayer, are thus unified with "the heart" (spirit) and the prayer becomes constant, ceaselessly "playing" in the background of the mind, like a background music, without hindering the normal everyday activities of the person.&lt;ref name="byethost1"/&gt;

Others, like Father [[Archimandrite]] Ilie Cleopa, one of the most representative spiritual fathers of contemporary [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] monastic spirituality,&lt;ref name="cleopa-dict"&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://biserica.org/WhosWho/DTR/I/IlieCleopa.html Ilie Cleopa] in ''Dicţionarul teologilor români'' (''Dictionary of Romanian Theologians''), electronic version, Univers Enciclopedic Ed., Bucharest, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; talk about nine levels (see [[#External links|External links]]). They are the same path to [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], more slenderly differentiated:
# The prayer of the lips.
# The prayer of the mouth.
# The prayer of the tongue.
# The prayer of the voice.
# The prayer of the mind.
# The prayer of the heart.
# The active prayer.
# The all-seeing prayer.
# The contemplative prayer.

In its more advanced use, the monk aims to attain to a sober practice of the Jesus Prayer in the heart free of images. It is from this condition, called by [[John Climacus]] and Hesychios the "guard of the mind", that the monk is raised by the [[divine grace]] to contemplation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Variants of repetitive formulas==
A number of different repetitive prayer formulas have been attested in the history of Eastern Orthodox monasticism: the Prayer of St. Ioannikios the Great (754–846): "My hope is the Father, my refuge is the Son, my shelter is the Holy Ghost, O Holy Trinity, Glory unto You," the repetitive use of which is described in his ''Life''; or the more recent practice of [[Nikolaj Velimirović]].

Similarly to the flexibility of the practice of the Jesus Prayer, there is no imposed standardization of its form. The prayer can be from as short as "Lord, have mercy" ([[Kyrie eleison]]), "Have mercy on me" ("Have mercy upon us"), or even "Jesus", to its longer most common form. It can also contain a call to the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary), or to the saints. The single essential and invariable element is Jesus' name.&lt;ref name="kallistos-ware" /&gt;

:* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner. (a very common form) (Sometimes "{{lang|el|τον αμαρτωλόν}}" is translated "a sinner" but in Greek the article "{{lang|el|τον}}" is a definite article, so it could be translated "the sinner".)
:* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me.&lt;ref name="OrthodoxWiki"/&gt; (a very common form in the Greek tradition)
:* Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me. (common variant on [[Mount Athos]])[http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b01.en.a_night_in_the_desert_of_the_holy_mountain.05.htm]
:* Jesus, have mercy.&lt;ref&gt;"The Gurus, the Young Man, and Elder Paisios" by Dionysios Farasiotis&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saintjonah.org/services/stpachomius.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Prayer_Trinity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
The Jesus Prayer is a core part of the plot in [[J.&amp;nbsp;D. Salinger]]'s pair of stories ''[[Franny and Zooey]]''. Its use in that book is itself referenced in [[Jeffrey Eugenides]]'s novel, [[The Marriage Plot]].
The prayer is also a central theme of the 2006 Russian film ''[[Ostrov (film)|Ostrov]]''.

==Catholic Church==
Part four of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], which is dedicated to Christian prayer, devotes paragraphs 2665 to 2669 to prayer to Jesus.

{{quote|To pray "Jesus" is to invoke him and to call him within us. His name is the only one that contains the presence it signifies. Jesus is the Risen One, and whoever invokes the name of Jesus is welcoming the Son of God who loved him and who gave himself up for him. This simple invocation of faith developed in the tradition of prayer under many forms in East and West. The most usual formulation, transmitted by the spiritual writers of the Sinai, Syria, and Mt. Athos, is the invocation, "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us sinners." It combines the Christological hymn of {{bibleverse||Philippians|2:6-11|ESV}} with the cry of the publican and the blind men begging for light. By it the heart is opened to human wretchedness and the Savior's mercy. The invocation of the holy name of Jesus is the simplest way of praying always. When the holy name is repeated often by a humbly attentive heart, the prayer is not lost by heaping up empty phrases, but holds fast to the word and "brings forth fruit with patience." This prayer is possible "at all times" because it is not one occupation among others but the only occupation: that of loving God, which animates and transfigures every action in Christ Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P9F.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2666-2668 |publisher=Catholic Church |date= |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his poem ''The Book of the Twelve Béguines'', [[John of Ruysbroeck]], a 14th-century [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[mysticism|mystic]] [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope Pius X]] in 1908, wrote of "the uncreated Light, which is not God, but is the intermediary between Him and the 'seeing thought'" as illuminating the contemplative not in the highest mode of contemplation, but in the second of the four ascending modes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bookoftwelvebg00janvuoft#page/40/mode/2up John Francis's translation of Jan van Ruysbroeck, ''The Book of the Twelve Béguines'' (John M. Watkins 1913), p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar methods of prayer in use in the Catholic Church are recitation, as recommended by [[John Cassian]], of "O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me" or other verses of Scripture; repetition of a single monosyllabic word, as suggested by the [[Cloud of Unknowing]]; the method used in [[Centering Prayer]]; the method used by [[World Community for Christian Meditation|The World Community for Christian Meditation]], based on the Aramaic invocation ''[[Maranatha]]''; the use of [[Lectio Divina]]; etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monasticdialog.com/a.php?id=332 Thomas Keating, ''Centering Prayer and the Christian Contemplative Tradition'' (Monastic Interreligious Dialogue, Bulletin 40, January 1991)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310163401/http://www.monasticdialog.com/a.php?id=332 |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] says:
{{quote|The name of Jesus is at the heart of Christian prayer. All liturgical prayers conclude with the words "through our Lord Jesus Christ". The [[Hail Mary]] reaches its high point in the words "blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus". The Eastern prayer of the heart, the Jesus Prayer, says: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner." Many Christians, such as [[Joan of Arc]], have died with the one word "Jesus" on their lips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1E.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 435]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Use by other Christians==
In addition to Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, many Christians of other traditions also use the Jesus Prayer, primarily as a centering prayer or for contemplative prayer. The prayer is sometimes used with the [[Anglican rosary]]. The structure and content of the Jesus Prayer also bears a resemblance to the "[[Sinner's Prayer]]" used by many [[evangelical Protestant]]s.

[[File:US Army 52300 "Tell Me A Story" promotes academic, emotional connections.jpg|thumb|right|alt= A parent and child engage in joint attention.|A parent and child engage in joint attention]]
'''Joint attention''' or '''shared attention''' is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object by means of [[eye gaze|eye-gazing]], [[pointing]] or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to an object and then returns their gaze to the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a [[cross-sectional]] description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed it was possible for an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's [[attention]] using eye gaze.&lt;ref name="Moore&amp;Dunham"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=C.|last2=Dunham |first2=P |title= Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1995 |isbn=0-8058-1437-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research demonstrates that two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying [[intention]]. The ability to share gaze with another individual is an important skill in establishing [[reference]]. The ability to identify intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of [[language development]] including [[language comprehension|comprehension]], [[Language production|production]] and [[Vocabulary development|word learning]]. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development and the ability to take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by [[deafness]], [[blindness]], and developmental disorders such as [[autism]].

Other animals such as [[great ape]]s, [[orangutan]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[dog]]s, and [[horse]]s also show some elements of joint attention.

== Humans ==

=== Levels of joint attention ===
Defining levels of joint attention is important in determining if children are engaging in age-appropriate joint attention. There are three levels of joint attention: triadic, dyadic, and shared gaze.

Triadic joint attention is the highest level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that there is an element of shared attention.&lt;ref name="Reddy" /&gt; For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other.&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hobson |first1=R.P. |editor-first=J |editor-last=Roessler |title=Joint attention: Communication and other minds |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |pages=185–204|isbn=0-19-924563-0 |chapter=What puts the jointness in joint attention?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Triadic attention is marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.

Dyadic joint attention is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in. This is especially true for human adults and infants, who engage in this behavior starting at two months of age.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Adults and infants take turns exchanging facial expressions, noises, and in the case of the adult, speech.

Shared gaze occurs when two individuals are simply looking at an object.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okamoto-Barth |first1=S.|last2=Tomonaga |first2=M. |editor-first=M. |editor-last=Tanaka |title= Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2006 |pages=155–171|isbn=4-431-30246-8 |chapter=Development of Joint Attention in Infant Chimpanzees}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shared gaze is the lowest level of joint attention.

Individuals who engage in triadic joint attention must understand both gaze and intention to establish common reference. Gaze refers to a child's understanding of the link between mental activity and the physical act of seeing. Intention refers to the child's ability to understand the goal of another person's mental processes.

=== Gaze ===
[[File:Click Here. No, Here.jpg|thumb|right|alt= A parent and child engage in joint attention through pointing.|A parent and child engage in joint attention through [[List of gestures#Single hand gestures|pointing]]]]
For an individual to engage in joint attention they must establish [[reference]].&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; Following the gaze or directive actions (such as pointing) of others is a common way of establishing reference.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; For an individual to understand that following gaze establishes reference the individual must display:
* Recognition that looking is intentional behavior directed to external objects and events. Following gaze serves the purpose of establishing reference.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"&gt;D'Entremont, B., Yazbeck, A., Morgan, A. &amp; MacAulay, S. (2007). Early gaze-following and the understanding of others. In R. Flomm, K. Lee &amp; D. Muir (Eds.), ''Gaze-Following: Its Development and Significance'' (pp. 77–94). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-19-924563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An understanding that looking results in the mental experience of seeing an object or event.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt;
* Recognition that eyes are responsible for seeing.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt;
* Recognition that others share in the capacity to see things.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt;
* An understanding that voice direction helps determine whether the speaker is talking to them and what he or she is referring to or focused on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rossano|first=Federico |author2=Malinda Carpenter |author3=Michael Tomasello|title=One-Year-Old Infants Follow Others’ Voice Direction|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012|pages=1298–1302|doi=10.1177/0956797612450032|volume=23|pmid=23070306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaze becomes more complex with age and practice.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt; As gaze increases in complexity, individuals are better able to discriminate what others are referring to.&lt;ref name="Heal2005" /&gt; Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn.&lt;ref name="MacPherson"/&gt; Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.&lt;ref name="MacPherson"/&gt;

=== Intention ===
The ability to identify [[intention]] is critical to joint attention. When individuals understand that others have goals, intentions, and attentional states, they are able to enter into and direct another's attention.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; Joint attention promotes and maintains dyadic exchanges and learning about the nature of social partners.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; The ability to engage in joint attention is crucial for language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tomasello | first1 = M. | last2 = Farrar | first2 = J. | year = 1986 | title = Joint attention and early language | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 1454–1463 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1986.tb00470.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, D.A.

Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who are intentional in their actions display regularity in their behavior.&lt;ref name="Mumme"/&gt; Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, and then use hands to make contact with and manipulate the object.&lt;ref name= "Mumme"&gt;Mumme, D., Bushnell, E., DiCorcia, J. &amp; Lariviere, L.

Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-4750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object.&lt;ref name="Mumme"/&gt; Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness.&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.&lt;ref name="Reddy"&gt;Reddy, V. (2005). Before the third element: Understanding attention to self. In N. Eilan, C. Hoerl, T. McCormack &amp; J. Roessler (Eds.), ''Joint attention: Communication and other minds'' (pp. 85–109). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.{{ISBN|0-19-924563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joint attention plays an important role in the development of [[theory of mind]]. Theory of mind and joint attention are important precursors to a fully developed grasp of another individual's mental activity.&lt;ref name="Heal2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heal |first1=J. |editor-first=J |editor-last=Roessler |title=Joint attention: Communication and other minds |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |pages=34–44|chapter=Joint attention and understanding the mind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language comprehension ===

The ability of children to extract information from their environment rests on understandings of [[Attention seeking|attentional behaviors]] such as [[List of gestures#Single hand gestures|pointing]].&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; Episodes of joint attention provide children with a great deal of information about objects by establishing reference and intention.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, A. (2005). Infants' understanding of the actions involved in joint attention. In N. Eilan, C. Hoerl, T. McCormack &amp; J. Roessler (Eds.), ''Joint attention: Communication and other minds'' (pp. 110–128). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.{{ISBN|0-19-924563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint attention occurs within particular environments. The items and events in that environment provide a context that enables the child to associate meaning with a particular utterance.&lt;ref name="Bruner"&gt;Bruner, J. (1983). ''Child's talk: Learning to use language.'' (pp. 67–88). New York, NY: W.W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Joint attention makes relevant aspects of the context salient, helping children comprehend what is taking place.

===Language production===
An infant's social environment relates to his or her later language development.&lt;ref name=Rollins&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rollins | first1 = P. R. | year = 2003 | title = Caregivers' contingent comments to 9-month-old infants: Relationships with later language | url = | journal = Applied Psycholinguistics | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 221–234 | doi = 10.1017/S0142716403000110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson&gt;Oates J, &amp; Grayson A.

Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|1-4051-1045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Infants are more likely to engage in joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in [[Vocabulary development|word learning]], a crucial aspect of language development.&lt;ref name=Hirotani&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirotani | first1 = M. | last2 = Stets | first2 = M. | last3 = Striano | first3 = T. | last4 = Friederic | first4 = A.D. | year = 2009 | title = Joint attention helps infants learn new words: event-related potential evidence | url = | journal = Developmental Neuroscience | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 600–605 | doi = 10.1097/WNR.0b013e32832a0a7c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to [[Social-emotional development in childhood|socio-emotional development]]===
Joint attention and the ability to attend to an aspect of one's environment are fundamental to normal [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] that rely on the sharing of [[experience]] and [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name= "MacPherson"&gt;MacPherson, A. C. &amp; Moore, C. (2007). Attentional control by gaze cues in infancy. In R. Flomm, K. Lee &amp; D. Muir (Eds.), ''Gaze-Following: Its Development and Significance'' (pp. 53–76). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Infants are highly motivated to share experience. An infant's [[motivation]] to engage in joint attention is strong enough that infants voluntarily turn away from interesting sights to engage in joint attention with others.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;Carpenter, M. (2011). Social Cognition and Social Motivations in Infancy. In U. Goswami (Eds.), ''The Wiley-Blackwell handbook of childhood cognitive development'' (pp. 106–128). West Sussex, UK: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.{{ISBN|1-4051-9116-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in [[attachment theory]], infants need to develop a relationship with a [[primary caregiver]] to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to [[language development]], joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Hecke | first1 = Amy Vaughan | last2 = Mundy | first2 = Peter C. | last3 = Acra | first3 = C.Franciose | last4 = Block | first4 = Jessica J. | last5 = Delgado | first5 = Christine E.F. | last6 = Parlade | first6 = Meaghan V. | last7 = Myers | first7 = Jessica A. | last8 = Neal | first8 = A.

===Developmental markers in infancy===
At the age of 2 months, children engage in dyadic joint attention and conversation-like exchanges with adults during which each is the focus of the other's attention and they take turns exchanging looks, noises and mouth movements.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; At age 3 months, children display joint attention skills by calling to a caregiver when they are not perceivable.&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; When caregiver does not respond in a similar manner, child exhibits a series of responses that were first studied in early 1970s by [[Edward Tronick]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ellen-galinsky/trusting-relationships-ar_b_1123524.html Trusting Relationships Are Central to Children's Learning -- Lessons From Edward Tronick], Huffington Post, 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton at the time when the latter was creating the [[Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale]]. At age 6 months, infants display joint attentional skills by:
*Orienting themselves in the same general direction (in their visual field) as another person.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; Infants also cease to focus on the first interesting (salient) object they encounter.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt;
*Following outward directed gaze of adults.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt;
*Extending more sophisticated behaviors, such as gaze checking, when initial gaze following is not successful.&lt;ref name="Heal2005" /&gt;
*Paying more attention to eyes, responding to shifts in eye gaze direction, and directing their own attention based on another's gaze.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

At age 8 months, infants demonstrate joint attention through proto-declarative pointing, particularly in girls.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"&gt;Goswami, Usha (2008)''Cognitive Development: The Learning Brain''. New York, NY:Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; At 9 months of age, infants begin to display triadic joint attention.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Infants also will display joint attention activities, such as communicative gestures, social referencing, and using the behavior of others to guide response to novel things.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt;

At one year of age, joint attention is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; At age 15 months, children [[theory of mind|recognize the minds of others]].&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; At this age, children also recognize the importance of eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] experience of seeing and the role of eyes&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well.&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; Two-year-olds are also capable of [[Mental representation|representational thought]] or [[Information processing|increased memory]].&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt;

=== Individuals with disabilities ===
Several studies have shown that problems with joint attention are associated with developmental processes.&lt;ref name= Bhat&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhat | first1 = AN | last2 = Galloway | first2 = JC | last3 = Landa | first3 = RJ | year = | title = Social and non-social visual attention patterns and associative learning in infants at risk for autism | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 9| pages = 989–997 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02262.x | pmc = 3653974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. [[Autism spectrum|Autism spectrum disorders]]).&lt;ref name= Bhat/&gt; A core deficit noted in [[autism]] is eye gaze.&lt;ref name="Bruinsma"/&gt; Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object.&lt;ref name="Bruinsma"/&gt; This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention.&lt;ref name="Bruinsma"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bruinsma | first1 = Y. | last2 = Koegel | first2 = R. | last3 = Koegel | first3 = L. | year = 2004 | title = Joint attention and children with autism: A review of the literature | url = | journal = Mental Retardation and Development Disabilities | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 169–175 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20036 | pmid=15611988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of [[social competence]].&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nowakowski | first1 = Matlida E. | last2 = Tasker | first2 = Susan L. | last3 = Schmidt | first3 = Louis A. | year = 2009 | title = Establishment of joint attention in dyads involving hearing mothers of deaf and hearing children and its relation to adaptive social behavior | url = | journal = American Annals of the Deaf | volume = 154 | issue = 1| pages = 15–29 | doi=10.1353/aad.0.0071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.&lt;ref name=Bigelow&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bigelow | first1 = A. E. | year = 2003 | title = The development of joint attention in blind infants | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 259–275 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579403000142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other animals ==

=== Definitions in non-human animals ===
Triadic joint attention is the highest level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that there is an element of shared attention.&lt;ref name="Reddy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Triadic attention is marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face.&lt;ref name="3OkamotoBarth2006"&gt;Social Cognition Development in First 2 Years. In T. Matsuzawa M. Tomonaga &amp; M. Tanaka (Eds.), ''Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees'' (pp.182-197). Tokyo: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

=== Dyadic joint attention ===
Infant and parent chimpanzees show dyadic joint attention in an affectionate manner by looking at each other's eyes&lt;ref name="2OkamotoBarth2006"&gt;Evolutionary Origins of Mother-Infant Relationship. In T. Matsuzawa M. Tomonaga &amp; M. Tanaka (Eds.), ''Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees'' (pp.127-141). Tokyo: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-human animals such as Japanese monkeys, baboons, and other Old World monkeys seldom engage in dyadic joint attention.&lt;ref name="2OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; For these animals, the eye contact involved in dyadic joint attention is deemed threatening.&lt;ref name="2OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

=== Shared gaze ===
Gaze following, or shared gaze, can be found in a number of [[primate]]s.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006"/&gt;{{rp|155–71}} Domesticated animals such as dogs and horses also demonstrate shared gaze.&lt;ref name="Ikatura"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Itakura |first1=S. |title=Gaze Following and Joint Visual Attention in Nonhuman Animals |journal=Japanese Psychological Research |year=2004 |pages=216–226 |volume=46 |issue=3 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-5584.2004.00253.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of joint attention is important for animals because gaze shifts serve as indicators alerting the animal to the location of predators, mates, or food.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

Chimpanzees are capable of actively locating objects that are the focus of another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others.&lt;ref name="Tomasello_et_al.&amp;_Emery_et_al."&gt;Tomasello et al. &amp; Emery et al. as cited in (2006). Development of Joint Attention in Infant Chimpanzees. In T. Matsuzawa M. Tomonaga &amp; M. Tanaka (Eds.), ''Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees'' (pp.155–171). Tokyo: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view.&lt;ref name="Tomasello_et_al.&amp;_Emery_et_al."/&gt; They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

'''Language''' is a system that consists of the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of complex systems of [[communication]], particularly the [[human]] ability to do so&lt;!--Do not remove the qualifier "human" without first reading the article or consulting the discussions about this issue.--&gt;; and '''a language''' is any specific example of such a system.

The scientific study of language is called [[linguistics]]. Questions concerning the [[philosophy of language]], such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] in [[ancient Greece]]. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] have argued that language originated from [[emotion]]s while others like [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].

Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and [[dialect]]s. [[Natural language]]s are [[speech|spoken]] or [[sign language|signed]], but any language can be [[Encoding (semiotics)|encoded]] into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]&amp;nbsp;– for example, in [[Whistled language|whistling]], [[sign language|signed]], or [[braille]]. This is because human language is [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]-independent. Depending on [[philosophy of language|philosophical perspectives]] regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the [[cognitive]] ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of [[semiosis]] to relate [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] to particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. [[Oral language|Oral]], [[sign language|manual]] and tactile languages contain a [[phonology|phonological]] system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or [[morpheme]]s, and a [[syntax|syntactic]] system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.

Human language has the properties of [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of [[animal communication]]. Language is thought to have originated when early [[hominin]]s started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a [[Theory of mind|theory of other minds]] and a shared [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Chomsky|Fitch|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the [[human brain]], but especially in [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s. Humans [[language acquisition|acquire]] language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human [[culture]]. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[social stratification]], as well as [[social grooming]] and [[entertainment]].

Languages [[language change|evolve]] and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]] by [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparing]] modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a [[language family]]. The [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]] is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hindi]]; the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]] includes [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]] and the other [[Chinese language]]s, and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]; the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic family]] includes [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Somali language|Somali]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the [[Bantu languages]] include [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout [[Africa]]; and the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] include [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the [[Pacific]]. The languages of the [[Dravidian language|Dravidian family]], spoken mostly in Southern India, include [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].  Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become [[Language death|extinct]] by the year 2100.

== Definitions ==
{{main|Philosophy of language}}
The English word ''language'' derives ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s}}'' "tongue, speech, language" through [[Latin]] ''lingua'', "language; tongue", and [[Old French]] ''[[wikt:language#Old French|language]]''.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=language |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=3rd|year=1992|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is sometimes used to refer to [[code]]s, [[cipher]]s, and other kinds of [[constructed language|artificially constructed communication systems]] such as formally defined computer languages used for [[programming language|computer programming]]. Unlike conventional human languages, a [[formal language]] in this sense is a [[system]] of [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] for [[encoding]] and decoding [[information]]. This article specifically concerns the properties of [[Natural language|natural human language]] as it is studied in the discipline of [[linguistics]].

As an object of linguistic study, "language" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. "[[French language|French]]". The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word ''langage'' for language as a concept, ''[[langue and parole|langue]]'' as a specific instance of a language system, and ''parole'' for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.&lt;ref name="Lyons2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="LyonsIntro"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.&lt;ref name="TraskLanguage"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pages=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.{{sfn|Bett|2010}}

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world&amp;nbsp;– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the [[linguistic turn]] and philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.{{sfn|Devitt|Sterelny|1999}}

===Mental faculty, organ or instinct===
One definition sees language primarily as the [[mind|mental faculty]] that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the [[human brain]]. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, [[creole languages]] and spontaneously developed sign languages such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]]. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely [[innatism|innate]], for example, in [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory of [[Universal Grammar]], or American philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]]'s extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a [[cognitive science]] framework and in [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Fitch|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal symbolic system===
Another definition sees language as a [[formal system]] of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed [[structural linguistics|structural systems]] consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=93}} This [[structuralism|structuralist]] view of language was first introduced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]],&lt;ref name="Saussure"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Saussure|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is [[Noam Chomsky]], the originator of the [[generative linguistics|generative theory of grammar]], who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=130}} Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Chomsky|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in [[formal logic]], in [[formal grammar|formal]] [[theoretical linguistics|theories of grammar]], and in applied [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=93, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|1998|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and other [[formal logic]]ians.

===Tool for communication===
[[File:ASL family.jpg|right|thumb|A conversation in [[American Sign Language]]]]
Yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. [[Functional theories of grammar]] explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was "tailored" to serve the communicative needs of its users.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Van Valin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of language is associated with the study of language in [[pragmatics|pragmatic]], [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]], and interactive frameworks, as well as in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]]. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of [[linguistic typology]], or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of [[grammaticalization]] tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as [[J.L. Austin]], [[Paul Grice]], [[John Searle]], and [[Willard van Orman Quine|W.O. Quine]].{{sfn|Nerlich|2010|p=192}}

===Unique status of human language===
{{main|Animal language|Great ape language}}

A number of features, many of which were described by [[Charles Hockett]] and called [[Hockett's design features|design features]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |title=The Problem of Universals in Language |last=Hockett |first=Charles F. |date=1966 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110023354/http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |archive-date=10 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2013-05-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; set human language apart from other known systems of communication, such as those used by non-human [[Animal language|animals]].

Communication systems used by other animals such as [[Bee learning and communication|bees]] or [[great ape language|apes]] are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hockett|1960}}; {{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, human language is open-ended and [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]], meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).&lt;ref name="Trask5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]], is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Crane |first2=Jodie S.|last3=Savage |first3=James L.|last4=Russel |first4=Andrew F. |last5=Townsend |first5=Simon W. |date=29 June 2015 |title=Experimental Evidence for Phonemic Contrasts in a Nonhuman Vocal System |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=13|issue=6|pages=e1002171|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002171|pmid=26121619 |pmc=4488142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Southern pied babbler|pied babblers]] have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type, which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Ridley |first2=Amanda R.|last3=Townsend |first3=Simon W. |date=20 July 2017 |title=Element repetition rates encode functionally distinct information in pied babbler 'clucks' and 'purrs' |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=20 |issue=5|pages=953–60|doi=10.1007/s10071-017-1114-6|pmid=28730513|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/89798/7/WRAP-element-repetition-rates-encode-functionally-Townsend-2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a [[bonobo]] named [[Kanzi]] learned to express itself using a set of symbolic [[lexigram]]s. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gorilla [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] reportedly uses as many as 1000 words in [[American Sign Language]], and understands 2000 words of spoken English. There are some doubts about whether her use of signs is based on complex understanding or simple [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]]; {{harvcoltxt|Candland|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ [[grammatical categories|grammatical and semantic categories]], such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"/&gt; Human language is also unique in having the property of [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursivity]]: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]&lt;/nowiki&gt;") or a clause can contain another clause (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I see [the dog is running]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;").&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt; Human language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as ''modality independent''. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas [[sign language]]s and writing use the visual modality, and [[braille]] writing uses the tactile modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=165–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called ''[[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]'', and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of [[bee]]s that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.&lt;ref name="Trask5"/&gt;

}}
Theories about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on the generative view of language pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]] see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ulbaek|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky is one prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"/&gt; He suggests that for scholars interested in the nature of language, "talk about the evolution of the language capacity is beside the point."{{sfn|Chomsky|1972|p=86}} Chomsky proposes that perhaps "some random mutation took place [...] and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}} Though cautioning against taking this story literally, Chomsky insists that "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}}

Continuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], hold the precedents to be [[animal cognition]],&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt; whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], see it as having developed from [[animal communication]] in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.&lt;ref name="Tomasello 2008"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from [[music]], a view already espoused by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]].{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=466–507}} [[Stephen R. Anderson|Stephen Anderson]] states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered&amp;nbsp;... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because language emerged in the early [[prehistory]] of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a [[larynx]] capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=250–92}}

It was mostly undisputed that pre-human [[australopithecine]]s did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in [[great ape]]s in general. However, a 2017 study on [[Origin of language#Ardipithecus ramidus|Ardipithecus ramidus]] challenges this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |pmid=28363458 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus  and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=101–21 |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with [[Anatomically modern humans|Anatomically Modern ''Homo sapiens'']] with the [[behavioral modernity|Upper Paleolithic revolution]] less than 100,000 years ago.{{sfn|Foley|1997|pp=70–74}}{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=292–93}}

{{main|Linguistics|History of linguistics}}
The study of language, [[linguistics]], has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in [[India]] more than 2000 years ago, after the development of the [[Brahmi script]]. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdisciplines===
The academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, [[descriptive linguistics]] examines the grammar of single languages, [[theoretical linguistics]] develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, [[sociolinguistics]] studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, [[neurolinguistics]] studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, [[computational linguistics]] builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and [[historical linguistics]] relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the [[comparative method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
The formal study of language is often considered to have started in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. However, [[Sumer]]ian scribes already studied the differences between [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century AD, the French [[Port-Royal Grammar]]ians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by British [[philologist]] and expert on ancient India [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1914|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.&lt;ref name="Saussure"/&gt;

By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|Langue-parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue''), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clarke|1990|pages=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary linguistics===
In the 1960s, [[Noam Chomsky]] formulated the [[Generative linguistics|generative theory of language]]. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]]; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, [[Functional theories of grammar|functional theories of language]] propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. [[Formal grammar|Formal theories of grammar]] seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Functional grammar analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approaches not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate even as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation"; {{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework of [[cognitive linguistics]] interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|Cruse|2004|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological and neural architecture of language and speech==
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=11–14, 105–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the [[genetics|genetic]] bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is [[FOXP2]], which may cause a kind of [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|congenital language disorder]] if affected by [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fisher|Lai|Monaco|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brain===
{{main|Neurolinguistics|Language processing in the brain}}
[[File:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[Angular Gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[Supramarginal Gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green, and the [[Primary Auditory Cortex]] is represented in pink.]] The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref name="Lesser205"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lesser|1989|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is [[Wernicke's area]], which is in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop [[receptive aphasia]], a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax|sentence structure]]. The second area is [[Broca's area]], in the posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop [[expressive aphasia]], meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=105–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, [[word repetition]], and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|p=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[electrophysiology]] to study language processing in individuals without impairments.&lt;ref name="Lesser205"/&gt;

Spoken language relies on human physical ability to produce [[sound]], which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the [[ear drum]]. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box ([[larynx]]), and the upper vocal tract&amp;nbsp;– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of [[Segment (linguistics)|segmental and suprasegmental]] elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[phonation]] type, voice [[timbre]], and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], all of which may have effects across multiple segments.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consonant]]s and [[vowel]] segments combine to form [[syllable]]s, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. [[Acoustics|Acoustically]], these different segments are characterized by different [[formant]] structures, that are visible in a [[spectrogram]] of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; Vowels are called ''[[Close vowel|close]]'' when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel {{ipa|[i]}} (English "ee"), or ''[[open vowel|open]]'' when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel {{ipa|[a]}} (English "ah"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as {{ipa|[u]}} (English "oo"). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are [[Roundedness|rounded]] as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between {{ipa|[i]}} (unrounded front vowel such as English "ee") and {{ipa|[y]}} ([[rounded front vowel]] such as German "ü").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, [[alveolar ridge]], [[palate]], [[Soft palate|velum]], [[uvula]], or [[glottis]]. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by [[manner of articulation]], or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called ''[[occlusive]]'' or ''[[stop consonant|stop]]'', or different degrees of aperture creating ''[[fricative]]s'' and ''[[approximant consonant|approximants]]''. Consonants can also be either ''[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced or unvoiced]]'', depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English {{ipa|[s]}} in ''bus'' ([[sibilant|unvoiced sibilant]]) from {{ipa|[z]}} in ''buzz'' ([[Voiced alveolar sibilant#Voiced alveolar sibilant|voiced sibilant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called ''[[Nasal consonant|nasals]]'' or ''[[Nasalization|nasalized]]'' sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called ''[[Lateral consonant|laterals]]'', because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called ''[[rhotics]]'') that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt;

By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
When described as a system of [[symbolic communication]], language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[meaning (semiotics)|meanings]], and a [[code (semiotics)|code]] connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of [[semiosis]], how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called [[semiotics]]. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancient Tamil Script.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription at [[Thanjavur]]]]
Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"/&gt;

The rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called [[syntax]] or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called [[semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=218–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
{{main|Semantics|Semiotics|Meaning (linguistics)}}
Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.

Thus, languages must have a [[vocabulary]] of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species ''[[Canis familiaris]]''. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the [[lexicon]], and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a [[lexeme]]. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of [[Grammatical category|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages contain the semantic structure of [[predicate (grammar)|predication]]: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign [[truth value]]s to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[x [is y]]" or "[x [does y]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"/&gt;

===Sounds and symbols===

Depending on modality, language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Goldsmith|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called [[phonetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"/&gt;

Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called [[phonemes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called [[minimal pair]]. In English, for example, the words ''bat'' {{ipa|[bæt]}} and ''pat'' {{ipa|[pʰæt]}} form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated and non-aspirated]] pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Hindi]] do: the unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''spin'' {{ipa|[spɪn]}} and the aspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''pin'' {{ipa|[pʰɪn]}} are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called [[allophones]]), whereas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words {{ipa|[pʰá]}} 'crouch' and {{ipa|[pá]}} 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).&lt;ref name="Trask214"/&gt;

All [[oral language|spoken languages]] have phonemes of at least two different categories, [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], that can be combined to form [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[pitch accent|pitch]], [[Vowel length|duration]], and [[tonal language|tone]] to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called [[suprasegmental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] and [[Pirahã language]] with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like [[Taa language#Phonology|Taa]] may have as many as 141 phonemes.&lt;ref name="Trask214"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s, [[Phoneme#Phonemes in sign languages|the equivalent to phonemes]] (formerly called [[chereme]]s) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C. (1960). ''Sign Language Structure: An Outline of the Visual Communication Systems of the American Deaf,'' Studies in linguistics: Occasional papers (No. 8). Buffalo: Dept. of Anthropology and Linguistics, University of Buffalo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg (1965). ''A dictionary of American sign languages on linguistic principles.'' Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|pp=539–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writing system]]s represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The [[Latin alphabet]] (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the [[Inuktitut]] syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In [[logographic]] scripts, each sign represents an entire word,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.

Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the [[Arabic script]]), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Coulmas|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
{{main|Grammar}}
Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called ''[[morpheme]]s'' within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be ''free'' or ''bound''. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called ''[[word]]s'', and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called [[affix]]es. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called ''syntax''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grammatical categories====
{{main|Grammatical category}}
Grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Allerton|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically [[morphosyntactic alignment|distinguishing between their relations]] to a predicate, the encoding of [[Grammatical tense|temporal]] and [[Preposition and postposition|spatial]] relations on predicates, and a system of [[grammatical person]] governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Word classes====
Languages organize their [[parts of speech]] into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song", are usually called [[noun]]s. The second, which includes "run" and "sing", are called [[verb]]s. Another common category is the [[adjective]]: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in "noun-like"). In other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]], the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct [[predicate (grammar)|predicates]], while nouns are used as [[argument]]s of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs", the predicate is "runs", because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally". Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can only take a single argument is called [[transitivity (grammar)|''intransitive'']], while a predicate that can take two arguments is called [[transitive verb|''transitive'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] like "and" that serve to join two sentences, [[article (grammar)|articles]] that introduce a noun, [[interjections]] such as "wow!", or [[ideophones]] like "splash" that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the general noun classifier for humans is ''nin'' (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Senft|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''san-nin no gakusei'' (三人の学生) lit. "3 human-classifier of student"&amp;nbsp;— three students
For trees, it would be:
:''san-bon no ki'' (三本の木) lit. "3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree"&amp;nbsp;— three trees

====Morphology====
In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several [[morpheme]]s. For instance, the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aronoff|Fudeman|2011|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or [[affix]]es can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: ''[[prefix]]es'' precede the root, [[suffix]]es follow the root, and [[infix]]es are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word "run", which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called ''[[ablaut]]''. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of [[inflection]], which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bauer|2003}}; {{harvcoltxt|Haspelmath|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called [[Isolating language|isolating]], or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word ''bonus'', or "good", consists of the root ''bon-'', meaning "good", and the suffix -''us'', which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and [[nominative]] case. These languages are called ''[[fusional languages]]'', because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are [[agglutinative languages]] which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], where for example, the word ''evlerinizden'', or "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ''ev-ler-iniz-den'' with the meanings ''house-plural-your-from''. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called [[polysynthetic languages]]. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in [[Persian language|Persian]] the single word ''nafahmidamesh'' means ''I didn't understand it'' consisting of morphemes ''na-fahm-id-am-esh'' with the meanings, "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the [[Yupik language|Yupik]] word ''tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq'', which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes ''tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq'' with the meanings, "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme ''tuntu'' ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called ''[[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]''. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective ''bonus'', or "good", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the [[Basque language|Basque]] phrase ''ikusi nauzu'', or "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb ''n-au-zu'' (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the ''n''- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the – ''zu'' suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syntax====
{{main|Syntax}}
[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: "The cat" is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the phrase, "on the mat" is a [[locative (case)|locative]] phrase, and "sat" is the core of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].]]

Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful, but "*love you I" is not.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The prefixed asterisk * conventionally indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical, i.e. syntactically incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baker|2001|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in [[Latin language|Latin]], both ''Dominus servos vituperabat'' and ''Servos vituperabat dominus'' mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because ''servos'', or "slaves", is in the [[accusative case]], showing that they are the [[Object (grammar)|grammatical object]] of the sentence, and ''dominus'', or "master", is in the [[nominative case]], showing that he is the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of [[Wh-movement|inverse word order in questions]], which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question, it becomes "Who is John talking to?", and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing [[focus (linguistics)|special emphasis]] on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called [[phrase]]s, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.{{sfn|Baker|2001|pp=269–70}} To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=218–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, "the cat" is one phrase, and "on the mat" is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"/&gt; There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;

===Typology and universals===
{{Main|Linguistic typology|Linguistic universal}}

Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1992}};{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic [[word order]], the relative order of the [[verb]], and its constituents in a normal indicative [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In English, the basic order is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]: "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian language]] [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] would be ''d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy'' (snake man bit), [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]].&lt;ref name="CroftErg"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of [[prepositions]] or [[postpositions]]. Such correlations are called [[Linguistic universals|implicational universals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Greenberg|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]] type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009|p=45}}; {{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1994|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the [[Nominative–absolutive language|nominative-accusative]] word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun ''I''. Some languages, called [[Ergativity|ergative]], Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of "me run". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun "I" be used.&lt;ref name="CroftErg"/&gt; In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the [[Tripartite language|tripartite type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, "language universals", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;

==Social contexts of use and transmission==
[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|The [[Wall of Love]] in [[Paris]], where the phrase "I love you" is featured in 250 languages of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.travelfranceonline.com/wall-of-love-mur-des-je-taime-montmartre/|title=Wall of Love&amp;nbsp;– Mur des Je t'aime&amp;nbsp;– Montmartre|publisher=Travel France Online|accessdate = 30 November 2014|date=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on [[speech community|communities of speakers]] in which children [[language acquisition|learn language]] from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to [[communicate]] and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.&lt;ref name="Myths"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Evans|Levinson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to [[language contact]]. The process is similar to the process of [[evolution]], where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, languages differ from biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of [[diffusion]], as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their [[first language]] or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming [[endangered language|endangered]] as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage and meaning===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called [[deixis]], which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, "I" (which designates the person speaking), "now" (which designates the moment of speaking), and "here" (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=54–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called [[speech act]]s, although they can also be carried out through writing or hand signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=226–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called [[conversational implicature]]s. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring [[communicative competence]] in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=100–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
{{main|Language acquisition|Second-language acquisition|Second language|Language education}}
All healthy, [[Human development (biology)|normally developing]] human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring [[sign language|sign]] or [[oral language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bonvillian |first1=John D. |author2=Michael D. Orlansky |author3=Leslie Lazin Novack |title=Developmental milestones: Sign language acquisition and motor development |journal=Child Development |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=December 1983 |pages=1435–45 |doi=10.2307/1129806|pmid=6661942 |jstor=1129806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] called this process "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art".&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt;

First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]]. Around six months of age, a child will begin [[babbling]], producing the speech sounds or [[handshape]]s of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average [[vocabulary]] of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 [[word]]s. A child's first [[utterance]]s are [[Holophrasis|holophrases]] (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, he or she will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce [[telegraphic speech]], or short sentences that are less [[Grammar|grammatically]] complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.&lt;ref name="OGrady-Cho"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=O'Grady |first1=William |last2=Cho |first2=Sook Whan |chapter=First language acquisition |title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=fourth |location=Boston |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennison"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kennison|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn [[fetus]]es are capable of language acquisition to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;"First Impressions: We start to pick up words, food preferences and hand-eye coordination long before being born", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 1 (July 2015), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beth Skwarecki, "Babies Learn to Recognize Words in the Womb", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 26 August 2013 [http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/08/babies-learn-recognize-words-womb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Macaro|editor-first1=Ernesto| year=2010 | title=Continuum companion to second language acquisition|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9922-5|pages=137–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
{{see also|Culture#Language_and_culture|l1=Culture|Speech community}}
[[File:Arnold Lakhovsky Conversation.png|thumb|right|[[Arnold Lakhovsky]], ''The Conversation'' (c. 1935)]]
Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different "cultures of speaking." Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]], and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between [[Speech community|speech communities]].&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Duranti|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists use the term "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Agha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between [[social class]]es, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dixon|1972|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of "social [[deixis]]", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=311–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor", or "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt;

===Writing, literacy and technology===
{{main|Writing|Literacy}}
[[File:Winnipeg Forks - Plains Cree Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An inscription of [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] using [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], an [[abugida]] developed by Christian missionaries for Indigenous Canadian languages]]
Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called [[writing systems]].

The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and [[formal education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Olson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]]. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]]. A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"/&gt;

===Change===
{{main|Language change|Grammaticalization}}
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The first page of the poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', written in [[Old English]] in the early medieval period (800–1100 AD). Although Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, it is unintelligible to contemporary English speakers.]]
All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire [[Phonological change|phonological system]]. [[Sound change]] can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or [[distinctive feature|phonetic feature]] by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be ''conditioned'' in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be ''regular'', which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be ''sporadic'', affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a [[chain shift]] in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the [[Germanic languages]] when the sound change known as [[Grimm's law]] affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *{{PIE|bʰ}} became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *{{PIE|b}} in turn became /p/, and the previous *{{PIE|p}} became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why [[Italic languages]] such as Latin have ''p'' in words like '''''p'''ater'' and '''''p'''isces'', whereas Germanic languages, like English, have '''''f'''ather'' and '''''f'''ish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clackson|2007|pp=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin ''mea domina'' to eventually become the [[French language|French]] ''madame'' and American English ''ma'am''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as [[idiom]]s or particular constructions become [[grammaticalized]]. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of [[Caribbean Spanish]] the final /s/ has eroded away. Since [[Standard Spanish]] uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the [[grammatical person|second person]] subject "you" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun ''tú''. This means that the sentence "what's your name" is ''¿como te llamas?'' {{ipa|[ˈkomo te ˈjamas]}} in Standard Spanish, but {{ipa|[ˈkomo ˈtu te ˈjama]}} in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Zentella|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. ''I'm gonna'').

Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] towards more common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with [[Language ideology|ideologies]], and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact===
{{main|language contact}}
One important source of language change is contact and resulting [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] interact on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multilingualism]] is likely to have been the norm throughout [[human history]] and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the [[Nation state|ethno-national state]], monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Romaine|2001|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of [[Sprachbund|language areas]] in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the [[Balkan language area]], the [[Mesoamerican language area]], and the [[Ethiopian language area]]. Also, larger areas such as [[South Asia]], Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aikhenvald|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including [[language convergence]], [[loanword|borrowing]], and [[relexification]] (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new [[mixed language]]s that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called [[pidgins]] occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a [[creole language]]. An example of such mixed languages is [[Tok Pisin]], the official language of [[Papua New-Guinea]], which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and [[Austronesian languages]]; others are [[Haitian Creole|Kreyòl ayisyen]], the French-based creole language spoken in [[Haiti]], and [[Michif language|Michif]], a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language [[Cree language|Cree]] and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Matras|Bakker|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[SIL Ethnologue]]'' defines a "living language" as "one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language". The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and [[dialects]]. As of 2016, ''Ethnologue'' cataloged 7,097 living human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics|title = Ethnologue statistics|website = Summary by world area {{!}} Ethnologue|publisher = SIL|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ethnologue'' establishes linguistic groups based on studies of [[mutual intelligibility]], and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the [[Danish language]] that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish]]) by the ''Ethnologue''.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

According to the ''Ethnologue'', 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94% of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population estimates from the ''Ethnologue'' (2009 figures).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages and dialects===
{{main|Dialect#Dialect or language}}
[[File:Novi Sad mayor office.jpg|thumb|[[Multilingualism|Multi-lingual]] sign outside the [[mayor]]'s office in [[Novi Sad]], written in the four official languages of the city: [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]]]]
There is no [[Language or dialect|clear distinction]] between a language and a [[dialect]], notwithstanding a famous [[aphorism]] attributed to linguist [[Max Weinreich]] that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]".&lt;ref name="5 minute linguist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rickerson |first=E.M. |title=What's the difference between dialect and language? |url=http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |work=The Five Minute Linguist |publisher=College of Charleston |accessdate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219070627/http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] are, for example, often classified as "dialects" of Chinese, even though they are more different from each other than [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is from [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. Before the [[Yugoslav civil war]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was considered a single language with two dialects, but now [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive [[writing system]]s, or degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language families of the world===
{{Main|Language family|Dialectology|Historical linguistics|List of language families}}
[[File:Primary Human Language Families Map.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Principal language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families). For greater detail, see ''[[:Template:Distribution of languages in the world|Distribution of languages in the world]]''.]]
The world's languages can be grouped into [[Language family|language families]] consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of [[language isolate]]s: languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are [[Basque language|Basque]], spoken in Europe, [[Zuni language|Zuni]] of [[New Mexico]], [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] of Mexico, [[Ainu language|Ainu]] of Japan, [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] of [[Pakistan]], and many others.&lt;ref name="Katzner"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Katzner|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language family of the world that has the most speakers is the [[Indo-European languages]], spoken by 46% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}, "[http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family Summary by language family]"&lt;/ref&gt; This family includes major world languages like [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the [[Eurasia]]n [[Migration Period]] (c. 400–800 AD),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and subsequently through the [[History of colonialism|European colonial expansion]], which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the [[Americas]] and much of [[Africa]]. The [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] are spoken by 20%&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Cantonese]], and hundreds of smaller languages.&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Brown|Ogilvie|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] is home to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo language family]], which includes such languages as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Shona language|Shona]], and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; A similar number of people speak the [[Afroasiatic languages]], which include the populous [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language]], and the languages of the [[Sahara]] region, such as the [[Berber languages]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]].&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The [[Austronesian languages]] are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from [[Madagascar]] to [[maritime Southeast Asia]] all the way to [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; It includes such languages as [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Maori language|Māori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], and many of the indigenous languages of [[Indonesia]] and [[Formosan languages|Taiwan]]. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the [[Dravidian languages]] of [[South Asia]] (among them [[Kannada language|Kannada]] [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]), the [[Turkic languages]] of Central Asia (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (among them [[Khmer language|Khmer]]), and [[Tai–Kadai languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]] (including [[Thai language|Thai]]).&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, [[Papua New Guinea]], [[West Africa]], and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the [[Quechumaran languages|Quechumaran]], [[Arawak languages|Arawak]], and [[Tupi-Guarani languages|Tupi-Guarani]] families of South America, the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]], and [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] of [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], and [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language families of [[North America]]. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the [[Pama-Nyungan languages|Pama-Nyungan family]], whereas New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.&lt;ref name="Katzner"/&gt;

===Language endangerment===
{{main|Endangered language|Language loss|Language shift|Language death|}}
[[File:Linguistic diversity.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Together, the eight countries in red contain more than 50% of the world's languages. The areas in blue are the most linguistically diverse in the world, and the locations of most of the world's endangered languages.]]
[[endangered language|Language endangerment]] occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or [[language shift|shift]] to speaking another language. [[Language loss]] occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a ''[[dead language]]''. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an ''[[extinct language]]''. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of [[globalization]] and [[neo-colonialism]], where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Moseley|2010}}: "[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php Statistics]"&lt;/ref&gt; and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of languages by number of native speakers|top 20 languages]], those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) operates with five levels of language endangerment: "safe", "vulnerable" (not spoken by children outside the home), "definitely endangered" (not spoken by children), "severely endangered" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often [[Speaker types|semi-speakers]]). Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common ''[[lingua franca]]'', such as English or [[Esperanto]], there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the [[tower of Babel]] in the [[Old Testament]], that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,&lt;ref name="Haugen"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Haugen|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav]] and [[American Civil War]], or the genocide of [[Rwanda]], whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by [[language revitalization|revitalizing]] endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted [[Language policy|specific legislation]] to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous [[speech community|speech communities]]. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[national language]]s of [[Seychelles]] are [[Seychellois Creole]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

Seychellois Creole, a [[French-based creole language]], is by far the most commonly spoken language in the archipelago and is spoken natively by about 95% of the population. Nevertheless, the country was a [[British Empire|British colony]] for over a century and a half, and the legacy of [[History of Seychelles#British rule|British Seychelles]]) made English remain the main language in government and business.

French was introduced before the British rule. It has remained in use largely because it is used by the [[Franco-Seychellois]] minority and is similar to Seychellois Creole.

'''Lather, rinse, repeat''' (sometimes '''wash, rinse, repeat''') is an [[idiom]] roughly quoting the instructions found on many brands of [[shampoo]]. It is also used as a humorous way of pointing out that such instructions, if taken literally, would result in an [[endless loop]] of repeating the same steps, at least until one runs out of shampoo. It is also a sarcastic [[metaphor]] for following instructions or procedures slavishly without critical thought.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

It is known as the '''shampoo algorithm''', and is a classic example of an [[algorithm]] in introductory [[computer science]] classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[Benjamin Cheever]]'s novel ''The Plagiarist'', a fictional advertising executive increases the sales of his client's shampoo by adding the word "repeat" to its instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Level of detail''' in writing, sometimes known as level of abstraction, refers to three concepts: the precision in using the right [[word]]s to form [[phrase]]s, clauses and sentences;&lt;ref&gt;p.204, Wilson, Ferster-Glazie&lt;/ref&gt; the generality of [[Statement (logic)|statements]]; and the organisational strategy in which authors [[Expository writing#Classification|arrange]] ideas according to a common topic in the [[hierarchy]] of detail. Placing different objects or ideas in categories is a type of classification in [[expert writing]] which allows more efficient cognitive retrieval of information by placing it in [[Context principle|context]].&lt;ref&gt;p.396, MacArthur, Graham, Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining appropriate level of detail in any body of text is a part of ensuring that the cognitive effort required by the reader is appropriate to the general subject of the written as a whole. Authors use level of detail to maintain [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in [[syntactic hierarchy]] in texts, such as a [[screenplay]]s.&lt;ref&gt;p.227, Kitchen&lt;/ref&gt; Continuity in text is achieved by using [[transitional expressions]] to move from one detail, or level of detail, to another.&lt;ref&gt;p.223, Wilson, Ferster-Glazie&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the basic writing structure of ''introducing'', ''characterising'' and ''bringing to a close'' of any proper subject description,&lt;ref&gt;p.204, Wilson, Ferster-Glazie&lt;/ref&gt; level of detail is used in [[theme development]] during ''elaboration'', ''evaluation'' and ''adding context'' as a repertoire of retrieval strategies.&lt;ref&gt;p.395, MacArthur, Graham, Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt;  Van der Pool in 1995 had found that omission of detail in text structuring is an age-related effect that differentiates mature and young writers.&lt;ref&gt;pp.395-396, MacArthur, Graham, Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the general rule that the level of detail must be both sufficient and appropriate
for the author's audience and their subject in literature intended for experts,&lt;ref&gt;p.25, Campbell&lt;/ref&gt; it is also used in primary and secondary education to assess student understanding.&lt;ref&gt;p.180, Levstik, Barton&lt;/ref&gt; In general the depth of detail is gradually developed to one appropriate for the subject.&lt;ref&gt;p.59, Alley&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggested list in identifying appropriate level of detail may include&lt;ref&gt;p.25, Campbell&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sufficiency of information for the reader to exercise good judgement about the subject
* Sufficiency of information for the reader to take appropriate action
* Correctness of the information based on type of data
* Correctness of the information based on audience
* Level of detail appropriateness to the subject
* Level of detail appropriateness to the audience in size, required knowledge for comprehension or experience

Presenting the reader with specific details without first introducing it with general statements can be dangerous because it omits a [[Grammatical modifier|qualifier]], and therefore introduces elements that invite questions and create confusion.&lt;ref&gt;p.80, Alley&lt;/ref&gt;

Level of detail is often important in [[technical writing]] due to the need to differentiate between different levels of audience need for information within the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;p.198, Alred, Brusaw, Oliu&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the engineering design process, writing also takes place by the author usually adopting either a top-down or a bottom-up process by identifying components of the text that become the focus subjects in the overall [[Theme (literature)|theme]].&lt;ref&gt;p.1018, Weik&lt;/ref&gt;

The content of a text is often assessed for its level of detail as ''high'', ''intermediate'' or ''low'' based on the objective of the author in addressing the needs of the audience. The highly detailed text refers to the bottom-up structuring design where &lt;blockquote&gt;
Facts that are generally available but not used frequently (and likely to be forgotten) should be included in this ideal level of writing.&lt;ref&gt;p.19, Harkins &amp; Plung&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; This level of detail is appropriate for the subjects where expert specialist knowledge and understanding are required, and is often used in technical and [[scientific writing]], or in literary genres like [[science fiction]], [[biography|biographical writing]]  or [[military history]].

In the [[Linguistics|study of language]], '''description''' or '''descriptive linguistics''' is the work of [[Objectivity (science)|objectively]] analyzing and describing how [[language]] is actually used (or how it was used in the past) by a group of people in a speech community.

All academic research in [[linguistics]] is descriptive; like all other scientific disciplines, its aim is to describe the reality as it is, without the bias of preconceived ideas about how it ought to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kordić|first=Snježana|authorlink=Snježana Kordić|year=2010|language=Serbo-Croatian|title=Jezik i nacionalizam|trans-title=Language and Nationalism|url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf|series=Rotulus Universitas|location=Zagreb|publisher=Durieux|page=60|isbn=978-953-188-311-5|lccn=2011520778|oclc=729837512|ol=15270636W|id={{COBISS|13436977}}|archivedate= 8 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/690BiBe4T?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2015|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Moch.

Linguistic description is often contrasted with [[linguistic prescription]], which is found especially in [[education]] and in [[publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lawrence Trask|title=Key Concepts in Language and Linguistics|pages=47-48|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EE4dhRzavEgC|isbn=9780415157414|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nils Langer|title=Linguistic Purism in Action: How auxiliary tun was stigmatized in Early New High German|year=2013|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110881103|pages=223|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IZUiAAAAQBAJ|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescription seeks to define standard language forms and give advice on effective language use, and can be thought of as a presentation of the fruits of descriptive research in a learnable form, though it also draws on more subjective aspects of language aesthetics. Prescription and description are complementary, but have different priorities and sometimes are seen to be in conflict. Description is sometimes distinguished from "descriptivism", which is then defined as the belief that description is more significant or important to teach, study, and practice than prescription.

==Description==
As English-linguist Larry Andrews describes it, descriptive grammar is the linguistic approach that studies what a language is like, as opposed to prescriptive, which declares what a language should be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Larry|title=Language Exploration and Awareness: A Resource Book for Teachers|date=2006|publisher=Lawrence Earlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-4308-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, descriptive grammarians focus analysis on how all sorts of people in all sorts of environments, usually in more casual, everyday settings, communicate, while prescriptive grammarians focus on the grammatical rules and structures predetermined by linguistic registers and figures of power for those who are under the control of said authorities to use. An example Andrews uses in his book is ''fewer than'' vs ''less than''.&lt;ref name="Andrews-26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Larry|title=Language Exploration and Awareness: A Resource Book for Teachers|date=2006|publisher=Lawrence Earlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-4308-6|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A descriptive grammarian would state that both statements are correct, as long as the receiver of the message can understand the meaning behind the statement. A prescriptive grammarian, on the other hand, would analyze the rules and conventions behind the statements made and determine which statement is correct according to those rules. Andrews also believes that although the majority of linguists would be descriptive grammarians, the majority of public school teachers tend to be prescriptive.&lt;ref name="Andrews-26" /&gt;

==Challenges==
Accurate description of real speech is a difficult problem, and linguists have often been reduced to approximations. Almost all linguistic theory has its origin in practical problems of descriptive linguistics. [[Phonology]] (and its theoretical developments, such as the [[phoneme]]) deals with the function and interpretation of sound in language. [[Syntax]] has developed to describe the rules concerning how words relate to each other in order to form sentences. [[Lexicology]] collects "words" and their derivations and transformations: it has not given rise to much generalized theory.

An extreme "mentalist" viewpoint denies that the linguistic description of a language can be done by anyone but a competent speaker. Such speakers have internalized something called "[[linguistic competence]]", which gives them the ability to extrapolate correctly from their experience new but correct expressions, and to reject expressions which do not convey meaning in the way the speaker intends. For example, an expression could be [[ambiguous]], possibly leading to several different interpretations by the listener. Depending on the speaker's intent, ambiguity can be desirable (as in [[joke]]s and other [[humor]]) or not. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A linguistic description is considered descriptively adequate if it achieves one or more of the following goals of descriptive linguistics:
# A description of the [[phonology]] of the language in question.
# A description of the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of words belonging to that language.
# A description of the [[syntax]] of well-formed sentences of that language.
# A description of [[Derivation (linguistics)|lexical derivation]].
# A documentation of the [[vocabulary]], including at least one thousand entries.
# A reproduction of a few genuine texts.

'''{{lang|pt|Português macarrônico}}''' ({{IPA-pt|puʁtuˈgez mɐkɐˈʁõniku}}, "macaronic Portuguese", pronounced {{IPA-all|portʊˈgeːz(e) makaˈrɔːniko|}} by its speakers) is an [[Italian language|Italian]]-[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[macaronic language]] that was widely spoken by [[Italian Brazilian|Italian immigrants]] in [[Brazil]] (especially in the [[Greater São Paulo]] area and elsewhere in the [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]]) well into the 1950s.

It is not to be confused with the more strongly conserved [[Talian dialect]], based primarily with [[Venetian language|Venetian]] lexicon and grammar, and contribution of other northern Italian languages, and spoken by more isolated communities primarily in southern Brazil and Espírito Santo, while {{lang|pt|macarrônico}} is a more characteristically urban code-switching that often fades away with time according to the speaker.

In spite of its near-extinction, it significantly influenced the Portuguese spoken by people in the state of São Paulo, most importantly when it comes to the {{lang|pt|paulistano}} dialect.

'''Macro-Andean''' is a speculative proposal by [[Terrence Kaufman|Kaufman]] (2007) linking languages of the northern Andes. 

Kaufman (1990) found lexical support for proposals linking the [[Macro-Jibaro languages|Jivaro–Cahuapanan]] families as suggested by Swadesh and others. By 2007 he had tentatively added [[Saparo–Yawan languages|Saparo–Yawan]], which is itself provisional, and [[Bora–Witoto languages|Bora–Witoto]].

==Languages==
Kaufman (2007) posits the following membership. The unclassified languages [[Urarina language|Urarina]], [[Puelche language|Puelche]], [[Huaorani language|Sabela]], [[Taushiro language|Taushiro]], [[Omurano language|Omurano]] are included in the Kawapanan and Yawan branches.

A '''meaningless statement''' posits nothing of substance with which one could agree or disagree. In the context of [[logical argument]]s, the inclusion of a meaningless statement in the premises will undermine the validity of the argument since that premise can neither be true nor false.

There are many classes of meaningless statement:

* A statement may be considered meaningless if it asserts that two categories are disjoint without proposing a criterion to distinguish between them. For example, the claim, "I wouldn't know how [[pornography]] differs from [[erotica]]" is a [[distinction without a difference]].
* A statement may be meaningless if its terms are undefined, or if it contains unbound variables. For instance, the sentence "All ''X'' have ''Y''" is meaningless unless the terms ''X'' and ''Y'' are defined (or bound).
* A grammatically correct sentence may be meaningless if it ascribes properties to particulars which admit of no such properties. For example, the famous sentence "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" cannot be taken literally.
* An ungrammatical sentence admits of no meaning. For instance, the string of words "deities Olympus Greek reside The. upon" offers no information regarding the Greek deities, or their whereabouts.
* [[Lewis Carrol]]'s poem [[Jabberwocky]] is a famous example of the [[nonsense verse|nonsensical as literature]].

In [[sociolinguistics]], a '''minoritized language''' is a language that is marginalized, persecuted or banned.&lt;ref name="LSE" &gt;[http://www.farocnse.com/documentos/planificacionLSE.pdf Planificación lingüística de la lengua de los signos español (LSE).

Speakers of minoritized languages face various consequences, including reduced educational achievement and [[language shift]] in favor of the dominant language.

==Minority vs. minoritized==
A minoritized language differs from a [[minority language]], which means a language used by a small number of speakers,&lt;ref name="LSE"/&gt; or alternately to a language with lesser numerical or political power in a given context.&lt;ref name=spo&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spolsky |first1=Bernard |last2=Hult |first2=Francis M. |title=The Handbook of Educational Linguistics |date=2010|p=266 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444331042 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8nc6nRRbMSQC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=minoritized+language#v=onepage&amp;q=minoritized%20language&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cases in which a language is minoritized while being spoken by a majority of the population, such as some [[indigenous languages]] during the colonization of Africa, when colonial languages were favored.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061110222938/http://www.uzei.com/Modulos/UsuariosFtp/Conexion/archivos26A.pdf Anna Aguilar-Amat Castillo, Mohammed Pathé Sidibé, Joan Vilarnau Dalmaula.

=="Western language ideology"==
{{further|Linguistic imperialism}}
[[Nancy Dorian]], Kathryn A. Davis, and Prem Phyak have argued that there is a "Western language ideology" which applies [[social Darwinism]] to linguistics. This ideology allegedly idealizes [[monolingualism]], denies the [[benefits of multilingualism]], and disdains [[non-standard language varieties]]. Because such non-standard varieties are labeled deficient, a hierarchy of languages is created.{{efn|The prevailing view among contemporary linguists is that regardless of perceptions that a dialect or language is "better" or "worse" than its counterparts, when dialects and languages are assessed "on purely [[linguistics|linguistic]] grounds, all languages—and all dialects—have equal merit".&lt;ref name="on_language"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/12/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-9-12-99-on-language-dialects.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/F/Fox,%20Margalit|title=The Way We Live Now: 9-12-99: On Language; Dialects|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=12 September 1999|work=The New York Times|ref=harv|accessdate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary Linguistics|last1=O'Grady |first1=William|last2=Archibald |first2=John |last3=Aronoff |first3=Mark |last4=Rees-Miller |first4=Janie |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's|year=2001|isbn=9780312247386|location=Boston|ref=harv|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics|last1=Fasold|first1=Ralph W.|last2=Connor-Linton|first2=Jeff|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-521-84768-1|location=Cambridge|ref=harv|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Some authors have drawn a connection between [[anti-immigration sentiment]], especially [[anti-German sentiment]], and [[English-only education]] in the US.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

In Europe, the process of minoritization, for example of the [[Celtic languages]] in Britain and [[Languages of France|minority languages in France]], was connected to the emergence of [[nationalist]] movements calling for the establishment of [[monolingual]], [[monocultural]] [[nation-states]] in the nineteenth century. The process of minoritization then led to [[language shift]] towards English and French.&lt;ref name=Hinton&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hinton |first1=Leanne |last2=Huss |first2=Leena |last3=Roche |first3=Gerald |title=The Routledge Handbook of Language Revitalization |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317200857 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5zpODwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT375&amp;lpg=PT375&amp;dq=language+death+%22minoritization%22#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20death%20%22minoritization%22&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of minoritization==
The defining characteristic of minoritization is the existence of a power imbalance between it and the dominant language. One sign that a language is minoritized is if its speakers develop [[one-way bilingualism]]—they learn the [[dominant language]], but speakers of the dominant language do not learn the minoritized language. Another frequent symptom of minoritization is the restriction of the language to a limited range of [[language domains|domains]]. A language excluded from use in government and formal education might only be used at home and social situations. Because of the above, speakers of the minoritized language became a subset of speakers of the dominant language;&lt;ref name=Calaforra&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Calaforra |first1=Guillem |title=Lengua y poder en las situaciones de minorización lingüística |url=http://www.uv.es/calaforr/CursColonia.pdf |publisher=Universidad Jagellónica (Cracovia) |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, all speakers of [[Scottish Gaelic]] are also speakers of English, but most English speakers in Scotland do not speak Gaelic.&lt;ref name=MacAulay1992&gt;{{cite book |last=MacAulay |first=Donald|authorlink=Donald MacAulay |title=The Celtic Languages |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521231275  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3kIq1DYAkMC&amp;pg=PA141|p=141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, speakers of a dominant language can carry out all functions of daily life using their native language.&lt;ref name="Calaforra" /&gt; 

Speakers of the dominant language typically use the greater [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] of the dominant language to prevent speakers of the minoritized language from changing the situation to one more favorable to the minoritized language. They use "[[amnesia (sociology)|amnesia]]" and "[[normalization (sociology)|normalization]]" to confuse the reality with what should be, and therefore legitimize the situation in which some languages are minoritized. For example, many "liberal" criticisms of [[language planning]] for minoritized language communities assert that intervention in favor of minoritized languages is equivalent to the policies that caused the language to become minoritized in the first place, such as linguistic legislation, elitism, exclusion of minoritized languages from formal education, and even [[forced population transfer]].&lt;ref name="Calaforra" /&gt;

==Consequences==
In ''Engaged Language Policy and Practices'', the authors cite three studies that have shown that students' academic achievement suffers if policies are implemented that minoritize their native language. [[Nancy Dorian]] has argued that the "Western language ideology" favoring monolingualism has fostered an "ideology of contempt" for minoritized languages.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Kathryn A.|p=19 |last2=Phyak |first2=Prem |title=Engaged Language Policy and Practices |date=2016 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9781317442493 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nTQlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=%22minoritized%22+invented#v=onepage&amp;q=%22minoritized%22%20invented&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of minoritization can lead to language shift in favor of the dominant language.&lt;ref name="Hinton" /&gt;

==Examples==
* In Spain, minority languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Euskera|Basque]] were persecuted during the [[Francoism|dictatorship]] of [[Francisco Franco]], due to a desire to eradicate them. The persecution was somewhat counterproductive, because it actually raised their prestige in [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque country]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aulaintercultural.org/article.php3?id_article=1922 |title=Lenguas en guerra |trans-title=Languages in War |first=Irene |last=Lozano |author-link=Irene Lozano |publisher=Aulaintercultural |language=Spanish |date=28 November 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012230845/http://www.aulaintercultural.org/article.php3?id_article=1922 |archive-date=12 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Russia, speakers of [[Ös language|Ös]] and [[Tofa language|Tofa]], were, respectively, ridiculed for or banned from speaking the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Languages Die|last=Harrison|first=David K.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0195372069|location=|pages=20–21|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Guarani language]] of [[Paraguay]], although spoken by a majority of nationals, is seen as a clear example of minoritized language, due to the socioeconomic and political prevalence of Spanish. Organisations such as [[Yvy Marãe'ỹ]] are advocating against this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanlorenzomuni.gov.py/application/files/3715/2829/5960/Minuta_que_declara_interes_Cultural_Municipal_el_Seminario_Internacional_de_Traduccion..pdf |title=International Seminar on Translation, Terminology and Minoritized Languages |publisher=Municipality of [[San Lorenzo, Paraguay]] |date=30 May 2018}}{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The word "minoritized" is also used for racial groups, [[LGBT|LGBT people]], and other groups facing marginalization or institutionalized disadvantage in a certain setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Halwani |first1=Raja |last2=Quinn |first2=Carol Viola Anne |last3=Wible |first3=Andy |title=Queer Philosophy: Presentations of the Society for Lesbian and Gay Philosophy, 1998–2008 |date=2012 |publisher=Rodopi |isbn=978-9042035607 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E2SZmzI21rIC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=%22minoritized%22+race#v=onepage&amp;q=%22minoritized%22%20race&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Croisy |first1=Sophie |title=Globalization and "Minority" Cultures: The Role of "Minor" Cultural Groups in Shaping Our Global Future |date=2014 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=9789004282087 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FXOeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=minoritized+coinage#v=onepage&amp;q=minoritized%20coinage&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monzombo''' is a minor [[Ubangian language]] of the Congos.

There are three varieties, Monzombo (Mondjembo), Kpala (Kwala), and Yango, which ''Ethnologue'' lists separately. It is not clear how distinct they are.

{{Neuropsychology |functions}}

In [[neuropsychology]], [[linguistics]], and the [[philosophy of language]], a '''natural language''' or '''ordinary language''' is any [[language]] that has [[linguistic evolution|evolved]] naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation. Natural languages can take different forms, such as [[Vocal language|speech]] or [[Sign language|signing]]. They are distinguished from [[Constructed language|constructed]] and [[formal language]]s such as [[Programming language|those used to program computers]] or to study [[logic]].&lt;ref name="john lyons"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyons |first=John |title=Natural Language and Universal Grammar |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0521246965 |pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining natural language ==

Though the exact definition varies between scholars, natural language can broadly be defined in contrast to artificial or [[constructed language]]s (such as [[Programming language|computer programming languages]] and [[international auxiliary language]]s) and to other [[Biocommunication (science)|communication systems in nature]]. Such examples include bees' [[waggle dance]]&lt;ref name="fernandes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fernandes |first=Keith |title=On the Significance of Speech: How Infants Discover Symbols and Structure |year=2008 |publisher=ProQuest |location=Ann Arbor, MI |isbn=978-1243524065 |pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[whale vocalization|whale song]], to which researchers have found or applied the linguistic cognates of [[dialect]] and even [[syntax]]. 

All [[variety (linguistics)|language varieties]] of [[world language]]s are natural languages, although some varieties are subject to greater degrees of published [[linguistic prescription|prescriptivism]] or [[list of language regulators|language regulation]] than others. Thus [[nonstandard dialect]]s can be viewed as a [[wild type]] in comparison with [[standard language]]s. But even an [[official language]] with a regulating academy, such as [[Standard French]] with the [[Académie française|French Academy]], is classified as a natural language (for example, in the field of [[natural language processing]]), as its prescriptive points do not make it either constructed enough to be classified as a [[constructed language]] or controlled enough to be classified as a [[controlled natural language]].

== Controlled languages ==
{{Main|Controlled natural language}}

Controlled natural languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce or eliminate both ambiguity and complexity (for instance, by cutting down on rarely used superlative or adverbial forms or [[irregular verbs]]). The purpose behind the development and implementation of a controlled natural language typically is to aid non-native speakers of a natural language in understanding it, or to ease computer processing of a natural language. An example of a widely used controlled natural language is [[Simplified Technical English|Simplified English]], which was originally developed for [[aerospace]] industry maintenance manuals.

== Constructed languages and international auxiliary languages ==
{{Main|Constructed language|International auxiliary language}}
Constructed [[international auxiliary language]]s such as [[Esperanto]] and [[Interlingua]] (even those that have [[native speaker]]s) are not generally considered natural languages.&lt;ref name="Gopsill, F. P. 1990"&gt;Gopsill, F. P., "A historical overview of international languages". In ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield, England: British Interlingua Society, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural languages have been used to communicate and have evolved in a natural way, whereas Esperanto was designed by [[L.L. Zamenhof]] selecting elements from natural languages, not grown from natural fluctuations in vocabulary and syntax. Some natural languages have become naturally "standardized" by children's natural tendency to correct for illogical grammatical structures in their parents' speech, which can be seen in the development of [[pidgin]] languages into [[creole language]]s (as explained by Steven Pinker in ''[[The Language Instinct]]''), but this is not the case in many languages, including constructed languages such as Esperanto, where strict rules are in place as an attempt to consciously remove such irregularities. The possible exception to this are true native speakers of such languages.&lt;ref&gt;Proponents contend that there are 200–2000 [[native Esperanto speakers|native speakers of Esperanto]].&lt;/ref&gt; More substantive basis for this designation is that the vocabulary, grammar, and orthography of Interlingua are natural; they have been standardized and presented by a [[International Auxiliary Language Association|linguistic research body]], but they predated it and are not themselves considered a product of human invention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language]]''. New York: Storm Publishers, 1951. (Original edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Most experts, however, consider Interlingua to be naturalistic rather than natural.&lt;ref name="Gopsill, F. P. 1990"/&gt; [[Latino Sine Flexione]], a second naturalistic auxiliary language, is also naturalistic in content but is no longer widely spoken.&lt;ref&gt;Gopsill, F. P., "Naturalistic international languages". In ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield, England: British Interlingua Society, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''official script''' is a [[writing system]] that is specifically designated to be official in the [[constitution]]s or other applicable [[law]]s of [[jurisdiction (area)|countries, states, and other jurisdictions]]. Akin to an [[official language]], an official script is much rarer. It is used primarily where an official language is in practice written with two or more scripts. As, in these languages, use of script often has [[culture|cultural]] or [[politics|political]] connotations, proclamation of an official script is sometimes criticised as having a goal of influencing culture or politics or both.

A '''paragraph''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] παράγραφος ''paragraphos'', "''to write beside''" or "''written beside''") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in [[writing]] dealing with a particular point or [[idea]]. A paragraph consists of one or more [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s.&lt;ref name="UNC" /&gt; Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer [[prose]].language

==History==

The oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no space between words and could be written in [[boustrophedon]] (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized, and [[word divider]]s and [[terminal punctuation]] became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original ''[[paragraphos]]'', similar to an [[underscore]] at the beginning of the new group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the English Paragraph|author=Edwin Herbert Lewis|date=1894|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DwjAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''paragraphos'' evolved into the [[pilcrow]] (¶), which in English manuscripts in the [[Middle Ages]] can be seen inserted inline between sentences. The [[Fleuron (typography)|hedera leaf]] (e.g. ☙) has also been used in the same way.
[[File:United States Constitution.jpg|thumb|Indented paragraphs demonstrated in the US Constitution]]

In ancient manuscripts, another means to divide sentences into paragraphs was a line break ([[newline]]) followed by an [[initial]] at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original [[Old English]] manuscript of [[Beowulf]]. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005" /&gt;
Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by [[Indentation (typesetting)|indenting]] the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) [[United States Constitution]] from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph whitespace, or put in the indentation space.

A second common modern English style is to use no indenting, but add vertical white space to create "block paragraphs." On a typewriter, a double [[carriage return]] produces a blank line for this purpose; professional typesetters (or [[word processing]] software) may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting [[leading]]. This style is very common in electronic formats, such as on the [[World Wide Web]] and [[email]].

==Typographical considerations==

[[Widows and orphans]] occur when the first line of a paragraph is the last line in a column or page, or when the last line of a paragraph is the first line of a new column or page.

Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, [[Robert Bringhurst]] states that we should "Set opening paragraphs flush left."&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Elements of Typographic Style|last= Bringhurst|first=Robert|year= 2005|publisher= Hartley and Marks|location= Vancouver|isbn= 0-88179-206-3|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bringhurst explains as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The function of a paragraph is to mark a pause, setting the paragraph apart from what precedes it. If a paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead, the indent is superfluous and can therefore be omitted.&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Elements of Typographic Style'' states that "at least one [[En space|en [space]]]" should be used to indent paragraphs after the first,&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005" /&gt; noting that that is the "practical minimum".&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005a"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Elements of Typographic Style|last= Bringhurst|first=Robert|year= 2005|publisher= Hartley and Marks|location= Vancouver|isbn= 0-88179-206-3|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[em space]] is the most commonly used paragraph indent.&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005a" /&gt; [[Miles Tinker]], in his book ''Legibility of Print'', concluded that indenting the first line of paragraphs increases [[readability]] by 7%, on the average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Legibility of Print|last=Tinker|first=Miles A.|year= 1963|publisher= Iowa State University Press|location= Iowa|isbn= 0-8138-2450-8|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computing==
{{See also|Newline}}
In [[word processing]] and [[desktop publishing]], a '''hard return''' or '''paragraph break''' indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the '''soft return''' at the end of a line internal to a paragraph.
This distinction allows [[word wrap]] to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks.  The software may apply vertical whitespace or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style.

How such documents are actually stored depends on the [[file format]].  For example, [[HTML]] uses the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; tag as a paragraph container.  In [[plaintext]] files, there are two common formats.  Pre-formatted text will have a [[newline]] at the end of every physical line, and two newlines at the end of a paragraph, creating a blank line.  An alternative is to only put newlines at the end of each paragraph, and leave word wrapping up to the application that displays or processes the text.

A line break that is inserted manually, and preserved when re-flowing, may still be distinct from a paragraph break, although this is typically not done in [[prose]]. [[HTML]]'s &amp;lt;br&amp;nbsp;/&amp;gt; tag produces a line break without ending the paragraph; the [[W3C]] recommends using it only to separate lines of verse (where each "paragraph" is a [[stanza]]), or in a [[street address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/br|title=&lt;br&gt;: The Line Break element|author=|date=|website=MDN Web Docs|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbering==
{{See also|Newline}}
Paragraphs are commonly numbered using the decimal system, where (in books) the integral part of the decimal represents the number of the chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter in order of magnitude. Thus in Whittaker and Watson's 1921 ''[[A Course of Modern Analysis]]'', chapter 9 is devoted to Fourier Series; within that chapter §9.6 introduces Riemann's theory, the following section §9.61 treats an associated function, following §9.62 some properties of that function, following §9.621 a related lemma, while §9.63 introduces Riemann's main theorem, and so on. Whittaker and Watson attribute this system of numbering to [[Giuseppe Peano]] on their "Contents" page, although this attribution does not seem to be widely credited elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kowwalski|first1=E.|title=Peano paragraphing|url=http://blogs.ethz.ch/kowalski/2008/06/03/peano-paragraphing/|website=blogs.ethz.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section breaks ==

{{main|Section (typography)}}

Many published books use a device to separate certain paragraphs further when there is a change of scene or time. This extra space, especially when co-occurring at a page or section break, may contain an [[asterisk]], three asterisks, a special stylistic [[dingbat]], or a special symbol known as an [[asterism (typography)|asterism]].

==Purpose and style advice==

A [[List of common English usage misconceptions#Usage|common English usage misconception]] is that a paragraph has three to five sentences; single-word paragraphs can be seen in some professional writing, and journalists often use single-sentence paragraphs.&lt;ref name="UNC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/|title=Paragraph Development|author=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|first=|date=|work=The Writing Center|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crafting of clear, coherent paragraphs is the subject of considerable stylistic debate.  Forms generally vary among types of writing.  For example, newspapers, scientific journals, and fictional essays have somewhat different conventions for the placement of paragraph breaks.

English students are sometimes taught that a paragraph should have a [[topic sentence]] or "main idea", preferably first, and multiple "supporting" or "detail" sentences which explain or supply evidence.  One technique of this type, intended for essay writing, is known as the [[Schaffer paragraph]].  For example, the following excerpt from [[Samuel Johnson|Dr. Samuel Johnson]]'s ''Lives of the English Poets'', the first sentence is the main idea: that [[Joseph Addison]] is a skilled "describer of life and manners". The succeeding sentences are details that support and explain the main idea in a specific way.



This advice differs from stock advice for the construction of paragraphs in Japanese (translated as ''danraku'' 段落).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalt.org/pansig/2004/HTML/KimKon.htm|title=Effective writing instruction: From Japanese danraku to English paragraphs|first=Kazumi Kimura and Masako Kondo (timkondo *AT* nifty . com / Kazumikmr *AT* aol .|last=com)|date=|website=jalt.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy of language''' in the analytical tradition explored logic and accounts of the mind at the end of the nineteenth century, with English-speaking writers [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] being pivotal, followed by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] (''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''), the [[Vienna Circle]] and the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], while on the continent a foundation work was Ferdinand de [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure's]] ''[[Cours de linguistique générale]]'', published posthumously in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/|title=Philosophy of Language|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy of Language may investigate the relations between language, language users, and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophy-of-language|title=Philosophy of language|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of Philosophy of Language may include inquiry into the origins of [[language]], the nature of meaning, the usage and cognition of language. It overlaps to some extent with the study of [[Epistemology]], [[Logic]], [[Philosophy of mind|Philosophy of Mind]] and other fields (including linguistics and psychology).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_philosophy_of_language.html|title=Philosophy of Language - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broader sense it may be said that the philosophy of language explores the relationship between language and reality. In particular, philosophy of language studies issues that cannot be addressed by other fields, like linguistics, or psychology. Major topics in the philosophy of language include the [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|nature of meaning]], [[intentionality]], [[reference]], the constitution of sentences, concepts, [[learning]], and [[thought]].

==Overview==
The topic that has received the most attention in the philosophy of language has been the ''nature'' of meaning, to explain what "meaning" is, and what we mean when we talk about meaning. Within this area, issues include: the nature of [[synonymy]], the origins of meaning itself, our apprehension of meaning, and the nature of composition (the question of how meaningful units of language are composed of smaller meaningful parts, and how the meaning of the whole is derived from the meaning of its parts).

Secondly, this field of study seeks to better understand what speakers and listeners do with language in [[communication]], and how it is used socially. Specific interests include the topics of [[Language acquisition|language learning]], language creation, and [[speech act]]s.

Thirdly, the question of how language relates to the minds of both the speaker and the [[Language interpretation|interpreter]] is investigated. Of specific interest is the grounds for successful [[translation]] of words and concepts into their equivalents in another language.

Finally, philosophers of language investigate how language and meaning relate to [[truth]] and [[Reference|the reality being referred to]]. They tend to be less interested in which sentences are ''actually true'', and more in  ''what kinds of meanings can be true or false''. A truth-oriented philosopher of language might wonder whether or not a meaningless sentence can be true or false, or whether or not sentences can express propositions about things that do not exist, rather than the way sentences are used.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Major topics and sub-fields==

===Composition and parts===
{{Philosophy-of-language-key-terms}}
It has long been known that there are different [[parts of speech]]. One part of the common sentence is the [[lexical word]], which is composed of [[nouns]], verbs, and adjectives. A major question in the field – perhaps the single most important question for [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalist]] and [[structuralism|structuralist]] thinkers – is, "How does the meaning of a sentence emerge out of its parts?"

[[File:syntactic-semantic trees.gif|right|thumb|230px|Example of a syntactic tree]]

Many aspects of the problem of the composition of sentences are addressed in the field of linguistics of [[syntax]]. Philosophical semantics tends to focus on the [[principle of compositionality]] to explain the relationship between meaningful parts and whole sentences. The principle of compositionality asserts that a sentence can be understood on the basis of the meaning of the ''parts'' of the sentence (i.e., words, morphemes) along with an understanding of its ''structure'' (i.e., syntax, logic).&lt;ref&gt;Pagin, P. "Are Holism and Compositionality Compatible?" In ''Olismo''. ed. Massimo dell'Utri. Macerata: Quodlibet. 2002. {{ISBN|88-86570-85-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, syntactic propositions are arranged into 'discourse' or 'narrative' structures, which also encode meanings through [[pragmatics]] like temporal relations and pronominals.&lt;ref&gt;Syntax: An Introduction, Volume 1
Talmy GivónJohn Benjamins Publishing, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to use the concept of ''functions'' to describe more than just how lexical meanings work: they can also be used to describe the meaning of a sentence. Take, for a moment, the sentence "The horse is red". We may consider "the horse" to be the product of a ''[[propositional function]]''. A propositional function is an operation of language that takes an entity (in this case, the horse) as an input and outputs a ''semantic fact'' (i.e., the proposition that is represented by "The horse is red"). In other words, a propositional function is like an algorithm. The meaning of "red" in this case is whatever takes the entity "the horse" and turns it into the statement, "The horse is red."&lt;ref name="Stainton"&gt;Stainton, Robert J. (1996).

Linguists have developed at least two general methods of understanding the relationship between the parts of a linguistic string and how it is put together: syntactic and semantic trees. [[Syntax|Syntactic]] trees draw upon the words of a sentence with the ''[[grammar]]'' of the sentence in mind. [[Semantics|Semantic]] trees, on the other hand, focus upon the role of the ''meaning'' of the words and how those meanings combine to provide insight onto the genesis of semantic facts.

===Meaning&lt;!--'Ideational theory of meaning' and 'Reference theory of meaning' redirect here--&gt;===
{{Main|Meaning (linguistic)}}
{{Main|Meaning (philosophy of language)}}

There have been several distinctive explanations of what a [[Meaning (linguistics)|linguistic "meaning"]] is. Each has been associated with its own body of literature.

* The '''ideational theory of meaning'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, most commonly associated with the British [[empiricism|empiricist]] [[John Locke]], claims that meanings are purely mental contents provoked by signs.&lt;ref&gt; Grigoris Antoniou, John Slaney (eds.), ''Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence'', Springer, 1998, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this view of meaning has been beset by a number of problems from the beginning (see the main article for details), interest in it has been renewed by some contemporary theorists under the guise of ''[[semantic internalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Ned. "Conceptual Role Semantics" [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/ConceptualRoleSemantics.html (online)].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Truth-conditional semantics|truth-conditional theory of meaning]] holds meaning to be the conditions under which an expression may be true or false. This tradition goes back at least to [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] and is associated with a rich body of modern work, spearheaded by philosophers like [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].&lt;ref name="Tarsk"&gt;Tarski, Alfred. (1944). ''The Semantical Conception of Truth''. [http://www.ditext.com/tarski/tarski.html PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TandI"&gt;Davidson, D. (2001) ''Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-924629-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[use theory of meaning]], most commonly associated with the [[late Ludwig Wittgenstein]], helped inaugurate the idea of "meaning as use", and a [[communitarian]] view of language. Wittgenstein was interested in the way in which the communities use language, and how far it can be taken.&lt;ref name="LW"&gt;Wittgenstein, L. (1958) ''Philosophical Investigations''. Third edition. trans. G. E. M. Anscombe. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also associated with [[P. F. Strawson]], [[John Searle]], [[Robert Brandom]], and others.&lt;ref name="Brand"&gt;Brandom, R. (1994) ''Making it Explicit''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-54330-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] theory of meaning claims that [[speech]] is not only passively describing a given reality, but it can change the (social) reality it is describing through [[speech act]]s, which for linguistics was as revolutionary a discovery as for [[physics]] was the discovery that the very act of [[measurement]] can change the measured reality itself.  [[Speech act]] theory was developed by [[J. L. Austin]], although other previous thinkers have had similar ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Filozofija jezika i pragmatika |trans-title=Philosophy of language and pragmatics |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446878.rec_PUPOVAC.PDF |deadurl=no |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=Revija |volume=30 |issue=7 |page=99 |year=1990 |issn=0034-6888 |archivedate=10 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AZGjjiCD?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446878.rec_PUPOVAC.PDF |accessdate=6 June 2015 |df= }} [http://katalog.nsk.hr/F/?func=direct&amp;doc_number=000147293 (NSK)].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''reference theory of meaning'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, also known collectively as ''[[semantic externalism]]'', views meaning to be equivalent to those things in the world that are actually connected to signs. There are two broad subspecies of externalism: social and environmental. The first is most closely associated with [[Tyler Burge]] and the second with [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Saul Kripke]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Burge, Tyler. 1979.  Individualism and the Mental.

* The [[verificationist]] theory of meaning is generally associated with the early 20th century movement of [[logical positivism]]. The traditional formulation of such a theory is that the meaning of a sentence is its method of verification or falsification. In this form, the thesis was abandoned after the acceptance by most philosophers of the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]] of [[confirmation holism]] after the publication of [[W.V.O. Quine|Quine]]'s "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Voltolini, A. (2002) "Olismi Irriducibilmente Indipendenti?". In ''Olismo'' ed. Massimo Dell'Utri. Macerata: Quodlibet. {{ISBN|88-86570-85-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Michael Dummett]] has advocated a modified form of verificationism since the 1970s. In this version, the ''comprehension'' (and hence meaning) of a sentence consists in the hearer's ability to recognize the demonstration (mathematical, empirical or other) of the truth of the sentence.&lt;ref name="Dummett"&gt;Dummett, M. (1991) ''The Logical Basis of Metaphysics''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|88-15-05669-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Pragmatic theory of truth|pragmatic theory of meaning]] is any theory in which the meaning (or understanding) of a sentence is determined by the consequences of its application. Dummett attributes such a theory of meaning to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and other early 20th century [[American philosophy|American]] pragmatists.&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt;
* The [[contrast theory of meaning]] suggests that knowledge attributions have a ternary structure of the form 'S knows that p rather than q'. This is in contrast to the traditional view whereby knowledge attributions have a binary structure of the form 'S knows that p'.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, J., "Contrastive Knowledge," in Gendler and Hawthorne, eds. (2005), Oxford University Press, pp. 235–71; Schaffer, J., "The Contrast-Sensitivity of Knowledge Ascriptions," ''Social Epistemology'' '''22'''(3):235–245 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories exist to discuss [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|non-linguistic meaning]] (i.e., meaning as conveyed by body language, meanings as consequences, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Grice, Paul. "Meaning". ''Perspectives in the Philosophy of Language.'' (2000), ed. Robert Stainton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reference&lt;!--'Philosophy of reference', 'Reference theory', and 'Theory of reference' redirect here--&gt;===

Investigations into how language interacts with the world are called '''theories of reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. [[Gottlob Frege]] was an advocate of a [[mediated reference theory]]. Frege divided the semantic content of every expression, including sentences, into two components: sense and reference. The sense of a sentence is the thought that it expresses. Such a thought is abstract, universal and objective. The sense of any sub-sentential expression consists in its contribution to the thought that its embedding sentence expresses. Senses determine reference and are also the modes of presentation of the objects to which expressions refer. [[Referent]]s are the objects in the world that words pick out. The senses of sentences are thoughts, while their referents are [[truth value]]s (true or false). The referents of sentences embedded in [[propositional attitude]] ascriptions and other opaque contexts are their usual senses.&lt;ref name="GF"&gt;Frege, G. (1892) "On Sense and Reference". In ''Frege: Senso, Funzione e Concetto''. eds. [[Eva Picardi]] and [[Carlo Penco]]. Bari: Editori Laterza. 2001. {{ISBN|88-420-6347-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]], in his later writings and for reasons related to his theory of acquaintance in [[epistemology]], held that the only directly referential expressions are, what he called, "logically proper names". Logically proper names are such terms as ''I'', ''now'', ''here'' and other [[indexical]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Jason. (2006). [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jasoncs/routledge.pdf Philosophy of Language in the Twentieth Century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424165706/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jasoncs/routledge.pdf |date=2006-04-24 }}. Forthcoming in the Routledge Guide to Twentieth Century Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaynesford, M. de ''I: The Meaning of the First Person Term'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed proper names of the sort described above as "abbreviated [[definite description]]s". Hence ''Donald J. Trump'' may be an abbreviation for "the current President of the United States and husband of Melania Trump."  Definite descriptions are denoting phrases (see "[[On Denoting]]") which are analyzed by Russell into existentially quantified logical constructions. Such phrases denote in the sense that there is an object that satisfies the description. However, such objects are not to be considered meaningful on their own, but have meaning only in the [[proposition]] expressed by the sentences of which they are a part. Hence, they are not directly referential in the same way as logically proper names, for Russell.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B. (1905) "On Denoting". Published in ''Mind''.[http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Russell/denoting/ online text], Neale, Stephen (1990) Descriptions, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B. (1903) ''I Principi della Matematica''. Original title: ''The Principles of Mathematics''. Italian trans. by Enrico Carone and Maurizio Destro. Rome: Newton Compton editori. 1971. {{ISBN|88-8183-730-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Frege's account, any [[referring expression]] has a sense as well as a referent. Such a "mediated reference" view has certain theoretical advantages over Mill's view. For example, co-referential names, such as ''Samuel Clemens'' and ''Mark Twain'', cause problems for a directly referential view because it is possible for someone to hear "Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens" and be surprised – thus, their cognitive content seems different.

Despite the differences between the views of Frege and Russell, they are generally lumped together as [[Descriptivist theory of names|descriptivists]] about proper names. Such descriptivism was criticized in [[Saul Kripke]]'s ''Naming and Necessity''.

Kripke put forth what has come to be known as "the modal argument" (or "argument from rigidity"). Consider the name ''Aristotle'' and the descriptions "the greatest student of Plato", "the founder of logic" and "the teacher of Alexander". [[Aristotle]] obviously satisfies all of the descriptions (and many of the others we commonly associate with him), but it is not [[logical truth|necessarily true]] that if Aristotle existed then Aristotle was any one, or all, of these descriptions. Aristotle may well have existed without doing any single one of the things for which he is known to posterity. He may have existed and not have become known to posterity at all or he may have died in infancy. Suppose that Aristotle is associated by Mary with the description "the last great philosopher of antiquity" and (the actual) Aristotle died in infancy. Then Mary’s description would seem to refer to Plato. But this is deeply counterintuitive. Hence, names are ''[[rigid designator]]s'', according to Kripke. That is, they refer to the same individual in every possible world in which that individual exists. In the same work, Kripke articulated several other arguments against "[[Frege–Russell view|Frege–Russell]]" descriptivism.&lt;ref name="SK" /&gt;

It is worth noting that the whole philosophical enterprise of studying reference has been critiqued by linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] in various works.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. ''New horizons in the study of language and mind''. Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piattelli-Palmarini, Massimo, Juan Uriagereka, and Pello Salaburu, eds. ''Of Minds and Language: A Dialogue with Noam Chomsky in the Basque Country: A Dialogue with Noam Chomsky in the Basque Country''. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mind and language ===

==== Innateness and learning ====
Some of the major issues at the intersection of philosophy of language and philosophy of mind are also dealt with in modern [[psycholinguistics]]. Some important questions are ''How much of language is innate? Is language acquisition a special faculty in the mind? What is the connection between thought and language?''

There are three general perspectives on the issue of language learning. The first is the [[behaviorist]] perspective, which dictates that not only is the solid bulk of language learned, but it is learned via conditioning. The second is the ''hypothesis testing perspective'', which understands the child's learning of syntactic rules and meanings to involve the postulation and testing of hypotheses, through the use of the general faculty of intelligence. The final candidate for explanation is the [[Psychological nativism|innatist]] perspective, which states that at least some of the syntactic settings are innate and hardwired, based on certain modules of the mind.&lt;ref name="Fodor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fodor |first=Jerry A. |title=The Modularity of Mind: An Essay in Faculty Psychology |year=1983 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=0-262-56025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;Pinker, S. (1994) ''L'Istinto del Linguaggio''. Original title: ''The Language Instinct''. 1997. Milan: Arnaldo Mondadori Editori. {{ISBN|88-04-45350-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are varying notions of the structure of the brain when it comes to language. [[Connectionism|Connectionist]] models emphasize the idea that a person's lexicon and their thoughts operate in a kind of distributed, [[associationism|associative]] network.&lt;ref&gt;Churchland, P. (1995) Engine of Reason, Seat of the Soul: A Philosophical Journey Into the Brain. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychological nativism|Nativist model]]s  assert that there are [[language acquisition device|specialized devices]] in the brain that are dedicated to language acquisition.&lt;ref name="SP" /&gt; [[Computationalism|Computation]] models emphasize the notion of a representational [[language of thought]] and the logic-like, computational processing that the mind performs over them.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J and E. Lepore. (1999) "All at Sea in Semantic Space: Churchland on Meaning Similarity." Journal of Philosophy 96, 381–403.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergentism|Emergentist]] models focus on the notion that natural faculties are a complex system that emerge from simpler biological parts. [[Reductionism|Reductionist]] models attempt to explain higher-level mental processes in terms of the basic low-level neurophysiological activity of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, D.R. (1979)''Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid''. New York: Random House. {{ISBN|0-394-74502-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Language and thought ====
An important problem which touches both philosophy of language and [[philosophy of mind]] is to what extent language influences thought and vice versa. There have been a number of different perspectives on this issue, each offering a number of insights and suggestions.

Linguists [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir and Whorf]] suggested that language limited the extent to which members of a "linguistic community" can think about certain subjects (a hypothesis paralleled in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Kay, P. and W. Kempton. 1984. "What is the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis?" American Anthropologist 86(1): 65–79.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, language was analytically prior to thought. Philosopher [[Michael Dummett]] is also a proponent of the "language-first" viewpoint.&lt;ref name=BlackwellPhil&gt;{{cite book |last=Bunnin |first=Nicholas |first2=E. P. |last2=Tsui-James |title=The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |pages=97, 120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stark opposite to the Sapir–Whorf position is the notion that thought (or, more broadly, mental content) has priority over language. The "knowledge-first" position can be found, for instance, in the work of [[Paul Grice]].&lt;ref name="BlackwellPhil" /&gt; Further, this view is closely associated with [[Jerry Fodor]] and his [[language of thought]] hypothesis. According to his argument, spoken and written language derive their intentionality and meaning from an internal language encoded in the mind.&lt;ref name="LOT"&gt;Fodor, J. ''The Language of Thought'', Harvard University Press, 1975, {{ISBN|0-674-51030-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main argument in favor of such a view is that the structure of thoughts and the structure of language seem to share a compositional, systematic character. Another argument is that it is difficult to explain how signs and symbols on paper can represent anything meaningful unless some sort of meaning is infused into them by the contents of the mind. One of the main arguments against is that such levels of language can lead to an infinite regress.&lt;ref name="LOT" /&gt; In any case, many philosophers of mind and language, such as [[Ruth Millikan]], [[Fred Dretske]] and Fodor, have recently turned their attention to explaining the meanings of mental contents and states directly.

Another tradition of philosophers has attempted to show that language and thought are coextensive – that there is no way of explaining one without the other. Donald Davidson, in his essay "Thought and Talk", argued that the notion of belief could only arise as a product of public linguistic interaction. [[Daniel Dennett]] holds a similar ''interpretationist'' view of [[propositional attitude]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gozzano, S. "Olismo, Razionalità e Interpretazione". In ''Olismo'' ed. Massimo dell'Utri. 2002. Macerata: Quodlibet. {{ISBN|88-86570-85-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; To an extent, the theoretical underpinnings to [[cognitive semantics]] (including the notion of semantic [[framing (social sciences)|framing]]) suggest the influence of language upon thought.&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G. (1987) ''Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind''. Chicago:University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-46804-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same tradition views meaning and grammar as a function of conceptualization, making it difficult to assess in any straightforward way.

Some thinkers, like the ancient sophist [[Gorgias]], have questioned whether or not language was capable of capturing thought at all.
{{cquote|...speech can never exactly represent perceptibles, since it is different from them, and perceptibles are apprehended each by the one kind of organ, speech by another. Hence, since the objects of sight cannot be presented to any other organ but sight, and the different sense-organs cannot give their information to one another, similarly speech cannot give any information about perceptibles. Therefore, if anything exists and is comprehended, it is incommunicable.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgias (c. 375 BCE) translated by Kathleen Freeman. In Kaufmann, W. ''Philosophic Classics: Thales to Ockham''. New Jersey: Prentice Hall, Inc. 1961, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are studies that prove that languages shape how people understand causality. Some of them were performed by [[Lera Boroditsky]]. For example, English speakers tend to say things like "John broke the vase" even for accidents. However, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speakers would be more likely to say "the vase broke itself." In studies conducted by Caitlin Fausey at [[Stanford University]] speakers of English, Spanish and Japanese watched videos of two people popping balloons, breaking eggs and spilling drinks either intentionally or accidentally. Later everyone was asked whether they could remember who did what. Spanish and Japanese speakers did not remember the agents of accidental events as well as did English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/Proceedings/2009/papers/559/paper559.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Russian language|Russian]] speakers, who make an extra distinction between light and dark blue in their language, are better able to visually discriminate shades of blue. The [[Pirahã people|Piraha]], a tribe in [[Brazil]], whose language has only terms like few and many instead of numerals, are not able to keep track of exact quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boroditsky |first=Lera |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703467304575383131592767868?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_MIDDLETopNews#printMode |title=Lost in Translation.

In one study German and Spanish speakers were asked to describe objects having opposite [[gender]] assignment in those two languages. The descriptions they gave differed in a way predicted by [[grammatical gender]]. For example, when asked to describe a "key"—a word that is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish—the [[German language|German]] speakers were more likely to use words like "hard," "heavy," "jagged," "metal," "serrated," and "useful," whereas Spanish speakers were more likely to say "golden," "intricate," "little," "lovely," "shiny," and "tiny." To describe a "bridge," which is feminine in German and masculine in Spanish, the German speakers said "beautiful," "elegant," "fragile," "peaceful," "pretty," and "slender," and the Spanish speakers said "big," "dangerous," "long," "strong," "sturdy," and "towering." This was the case even though all testing was done in English, a language without grammatical gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/boroditsky09/boroditsky09_index.html |title=How Does Our Language Shape The Way We Think? |publisher=Edge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of studies conducted by Gary Lupyan, people were asked to look at a series of images of imaginary aliens.&lt;ref&gt;http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu/papers/lupyan_rakison_mcClelland_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Whether each alien was friendly or hostile was determined by certain subtle features but participants were not told what these were. They had to guess whether each alien was friendly or hostile, and after each response they were told if they were correct or not, helping them learn the subtle cues that distinguished friend from foe. A quarter of the participants were told in advance that the friendly aliens were called "leebish" and the hostile ones "grecious", while another quarter were told the opposite. For the rest, the aliens remained nameless. It was found that participants who were given names for the aliens learned to categorize the aliens far more quickly, reaching 80 per cent accuracy in less than half the time taken by those not told the names. By the end of the test, those told the names could correctly categorize 88 per cent of aliens, compared to just 80 per cent for the rest. It was concluded that naming objects helps us categorize and memorize them.

In another series of experiments &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/lupyan/web/lupyan_2008_jepG.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102193358/https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/lupyan/web/lupyan_2008_jepG.pdf |archive-date=2013-11-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a group of people was asked to view furniture from an [[IKEA]] catalog. Half the time they were asked to label the object – whether it was a chair or lamp, for example – while the rest of the time they had to say whether or not they liked it. It was found that when asked to label items, people were later less likely to recall the specific details of products, such as whether a chair had arms or not. It was concluded that labeling objects helps our minds build a prototype of the typical object in the group at the expense of individual features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727761.500-whats-in-a-name-the-words-behind-thought.html?full=true |title=What's in a name?

=== Social interaction and language ===
A common claim is that language is governed by social conventions. Questions inevitably arise on surrounding topics. One question is, "What exactly is a convention, and how do we study it?", and second, "To what extent do conventions even matter in the study of language?" [[David Kellogg Lewis]] proposed a worthy reply to the first question by expounding the view that a convention is a ''rationally self-perpetuating regularity in behavior''. However, this view seems to compete to some extent with the Gricean view of speaker's meaning, requiring either one (or both) to be weakened if both are to be taken as true.&lt;ref name=BlackwellPhil /&gt;

Some have questioned whether or not conventions are relevant to the study of meaning at all. [[Noam Chomsky]] proposed that the study of language could be done in terms of the I-Language, or internal language of persons. If this is so, then it undermines the pursuit of explanations in terms of conventions, and relegates such explanations to the domain of "meta-semantics". ''Metasemantics'' is a term used by philosopher of language Robert Stainton to describe all those fields that attempt to explain how semantic facts arise.&lt;ref name="Stainton" /&gt; One fruitful source of research involves investigation into the social conditions that give rise to, or are associated with, meanings and languages. ''[[Etymology]]'' (the study of the origins of words) and ''[[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]]'' (philosophical argumentation over what makes "good grammar", relative to a particular language) are two other examples of fields that are taken to be meta-semantic.

Not surprisingly, many separate (but related) fields have investigated the topic of linguistic convention within their own research paradigms. The presumptions that prop up each theoretical view are of interest to the philosopher of language. For instance, one of the major fields of sociology, [[symbolic interactionism]], is based on the insight that human social organization is based almost entirely on the use of meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Teevan, James J. and W.E. Hewitt. (2001) Introduction to Sociology: A Canadian Focus. Prentice Hall: Toronto. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, any explanation of a [[social structure]] (like an [[institution]]) would need to account for the shared meanings which create and sustain the structure.

[[Rhetoric]] is the study of the particular words that people use to achieve the proper emotional and rational effect in the listener, be it to persuade, provoke, endear, or teach. Some relevant applications of the field include the examination of [[propaganda]] and [[didactic]]ism, the examination of the purposes of [[Profanity|swearing]] and [[pejorative]]s (especially how it influences the behavior of others, and defines relationships), or the effects of gendered language. It can also be used to study [[linguistic transparency]] (or speaking in an accessible manner), as well as [[performative]] utterances and the various tasks that language can perform (called "speech acts"). It also has applications to the study and interpretation of law, and helps give insight to the logical concept of the [[domain of discourse]].

[[Literary theory]] is a discipline that some literary theorists claim overlaps with the philosophy of language. It emphasizes the methods that readers and critics use in understanding a text. This field, an outgrowth of the study of how to properly interpret messages, is unsurprisingly closely tied to the ancient discipline of [[hermeneutics]].

==Language and Continental philosophy==
In [[Continental philosophy]], language is not studied as a separate discipline, as it is in [[analytic philosophy]]. Rather, it is an inextricable part of many other areas of thought, such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[semiotics]], [[hermeneutics]], Heideggerean [[ontology]], [[existentialism]], [[structuralism]], [[deconstruction]] and [[critical theory]]. The idea of language is often related to that of logic in its Greek sense as "[[logos]]", meaning discourse or dialectic. Language and concepts are also seen as having been formed by history and politics, or even by historical philosophy itself.

The field of hermeneutics, and the theory of interpretation in general, has played a significant role in 20th century Continental philosophy of language and [[ontology]] beginning with [[Martin Heidegger]]. Heidegger combines phenomenology with the hermeneutics of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]. Heidegger believed language was one of the most important concepts for ''[[Dasein]]''. Heidegger believed that language today is worn out because of overuse of important words, and would be inadequate for in-depth study of Being (''Sein''). For example, ''Sein'' (''being''), the word itself, is saturated with multiple meanings. Thus, he invented new vocabulary and [[Stylistics (linguistics)|linguistic styles]], based on [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Germanic language|Germanic]] [[Etymology|etymological]] word relations, to disambiguate commonly used words. He avoided words like consciousness, ego, human, nature, etc. and instead talked holistically of [[Being-in-the-world]], [[Dasein]].

With such new concepts as ''Being-in-the-world'', Heidegger constructs his theory of language, centered on [[Speech communication|speech]]. He believed speech (talking, listening, silence) was the most essential and pure form of language. Heidegger claims writing is only a supplement to speech, because even a reader constructs or contributes one's own "talk" while reading. The most important feature of language is its ''projectivity'', the idea that language is prior to human speech. This means that when one is "thrown" into the world, his existence is characterized from the beginning by a certain pre-comprehension of the world. However, it is only after naming, or "articulation of intelligibility", can one have primary access to ''Dasein'' and ''Being-in-the-World''.&lt;ref name="Being"&gt;Heidegger, Martin.(1996) ''Being and Time''. New York: Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-19770-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] expanded on these ideas of Heidegger and proposed a complete hermeneutic ontology. In ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer describes language as "the medium in which substantive understanding and agreement take place between two people."&lt;ref name="Gadamer"&gt;Gadamer, Hans G. (1989)''Truth and Method'', New York: Crossroad, 2nd ed., {{ISBN|0-8264-0401-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Gadamer claims that the world is linguistically constituted, and cannot exist apart from language. For example, monuments and statues cannot communicate without the aid of language. Gadamer also claims that every language constitutes a world-view, because the linguistic nature of the world frees each individual from an objective environment: "... the fact that we have a world at all depends upon [language]  and presents itself in it. The world as world exists for man as for no other creature in the world."&lt;ref name="Gadamer" /&gt;

[[Paul Ricœur]], on the other hand, proposed a hermeneutics which, reconnecting with the original Greek sense of the term, emphasized the discovery of  hidden meanings in the equivocal terms (or "symbols") of [[ordinary language]]. Other philosophers who have worked in this tradition include [[Luigi Pareyson]] and [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref name="Volli"&gt;Volli, U. (2000) ''Manuale di Semiotica''. Rome-Bari: Editori Laterza. {{ISBN|88-420-5953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Semiotics]] is the study of the transmission, reception and meaning of signs and symbols in general. In this field, human language (both natural and artificial) is just one among many ways that humans (and other conscious beings) are able to communicate. It allows them to take advantage of and effectively manipulate the external world in order to create meaning for themselves and transmit this meaning to others. Every object, every person, every event, and every force communicates (or ''signifies'') continuously. The ringing of a telephone for example, ''is'' the telephone. The smoke that I see on the horizon is the sign that there is a fire. The smoke signifies. The things of the world, in this vision, seem to be ''labeled'' precisely for intelligent beings who only need to interpret them in the way that humans do. Everything has meaning. True communication, including the use of human language, however, requires someone (a ''sender'') who sends a ''message'', or ''text'', in some code to someone else (a ''receiver''). Language is studied only insofar as it is one of these forms (the most sophisticated form) of communication. Some important figures in the history of semiotics, are [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Roland Barthes]], and [[Roman Jakobson]]. In modern times, its best-known figures include [[Umberto Eco]], [[A.J. Greimas]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], and [[Tullio De Mauro]].&lt;ref name="Volli" /&gt; Investigations on signs in non-human communications are subject to [[biosemiotics]], a field founded in the late 20th century by [[Thomas Sebeok]] and [[Thure von Uexküll]].

==Problems in the philosophy of language==

===Vagueness===
One issue that has troubled philosophers of language and logic is the problem of the [[vagueness]] of words. The specific instances of vagueness that most interest philosophers of language are those where the existence of "borderline cases" makes it seemingly impossible to say whether a predicate is true or false. Classic examples are "is tall" or "is bald", where it cannot be said that some borderline case (some given person) is tall or not-tall. In consequence, vagueness gives rise to the [[paradox of the heap]]. Many theorists have attempted to solve the paradox by way of ''n''-valued logics, such as [[fuzzy logic]], which have radically departed from classical two-valued logics.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, Roy. (2006) "Vagueness". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vagueness/#3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problem of universals and composition ===
{{Further|problem of universals}}
One debate that has captured the interest of many philosophers is the debate over the meaning of ''[[universals]]''. One might ask, for example, "When people say the word ''rocks'', what is it that the word represents?" Two different answers have emerged to this question. Some have said that the expression stands for some real, abstract universal out in the world called "rocks". Others have said that the word stands for some collection of particular, individual rocks that we associate with merely a nomenclature. The former position has been called ''[[philosophical realism]]'', and the latter ''[[nominalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue here can be explicated if we examine the proposition "Socrates is a Man".

From the radical realist's perspective, the connection between S and M is a connection between two abstract entities. There is an entity, "man", and an entity, "Socrates". These two things connect in some way or overlap.

From a nominalist's perspective, the connection between S and M is the connection between a particular entity (Socrates) and a vast collection of particular things (men). To say that Socrates is a man is to say that Socrates is a part of the class of "men". Another perspective is to consider "man" to be a ''property'' of the entity, "Socrates".

There is a third way, between nominalism and radical realism, usually called "moderate realism" and attributed to Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Moderate realists hold that "man" refers to a real essence or form that is really present and identical in Socrates and all other men, but "man" does not exist as a separate and distinct entity. This is a realist position, because "Man" is real, insofar as it really exists in all men; but it is a moderate realism, because "Man" is not an entity separate from the men it informs.

=== Nature of language ===
Many philosophical discussions of language begin by clarifying terminology. One item which has undergone  significant scrutiny is the idea of language itself. Those philosophers who have set themselves to the task ask two important questions: "What is language in general?" and "What is a particular, individual language?"

Some [[semiotic]] outlooks have stressed that language is the mere manipulation and use of symbols in order to draw attention to signified content. If this were so, then humans would not be the sole possessors of language skills.&lt;ref name="Volli" /&gt; On the other hand, many works by linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] have emphasized the role of syntax as a characteristic of any language.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. (1985)''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory/'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

More puzzling is the question of what it is that distinguishes one particular language from another. What is it that makes "English" English? What's the difference between Spanish and French? Chomsky has indicated that the search for what it means to be a language must begin with the study of the internal language of persons, or [[I-language]]s, which are based upon certain rules (or principles and parameters) which generate grammars. This view is supported in part by the conviction that there is no clear, general, and principled difference between one language and the next, and which may apply across the field of all languages. Other attempts, which he dubs ''E-languages,'' have tried to explain a language as usage within a specific speech community with a specific set of well-formed utterances in mind (markedly associated with linguists like Bloomfield).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. "Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin, and Use." ''Perspectives in the Philosophy of Language.'' (2000) ed. Robert Stainton.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formal versus informal approaches ===
Another of the questions that has divided philosophers of language is the extent to which formal logic can be used as an effective tool in the analysis and understanding of natural languages. While most philosophers, including [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]], have been more or less skeptical about formalizing natural languages, many of them developed formal languages for use in the sciences or formalized ''parts'' of natural language for investigation. Some of the most prominent members of this tradition of formal semantics include Tarski, Carnap, [[Richard Montague]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].&lt;ref&gt;Partee, B. [http://people.umass.edu/partee/docs/Richard_Montague_by_%20Partee_05.pdf Richard Montague (1930–1971)]. In Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, 2nd Ed., ed. Keith Brown. Oxford: Elsevier. V. 8, pp. 255–57, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other side of the divide, and especially prominent in the 1950s and 60s, were the so-called "Ordinary language philosophers". Philosophers such as [[P. F. Strawson]], [[John Langshaw Austin]] and [[Gilbert Ryle]] stressed the importance of studying natural language without regard to the truth-conditions of sentences and the references of terms. They did not believe that the social and practical dimensions of linguistic meaning could be captured by any attempts at formalization using the tools of logic. Logic is one thing and language is something entirely different. What is important is not expressions themselves but what people use them to do in communication.&lt;ref&gt;Lycan, W. G. (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j94wa55sCU8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Philosophy of Language: A Contemporary Introduction]''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, Austin developed a theory of [[speech act]]s, which described the kinds of things which can be done with a sentence (assertion, command, inquiry, exclamation) in different contexts of use on different occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Austin |first=J.L. |year=1962 |title=[[How to Do Things With Words]]: The William James Lectures delivered at Harvard University in 1955 |editor=ed. J.O. Urmson. |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=0-674-41152-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strawson argued that the truth-table semantics of the logical connectives (e.g., &lt;math&gt; \land &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \lor &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \rightarrow &lt;/math&gt;) do not capture the meanings of their natural language counterparts ("and", "or" and "if-then").&lt;ref&gt;P. F. Strawson, "On Referring". ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 59, No. 235 (Jul., 1950), pp. 320–344&lt;/ref&gt; While the "ordinary language" movement basically died out in the 1970s, its influence was crucial to the development of the fields of speech-act theory and the study of [[pragmatics]].  Many of its ideas have been absorbed by theorists such as [[Kent Bach]], [[Robert Brandom]], [[Paul Horwich]] and [[Stephen Neale]].&lt;ref name="Brand" /&gt; In recent work, the division between semantics and pragmatics has become a lively topic of discussion at the interface of philosophy and linguistics, for instance in work by Sperber and Wilson, Carston and Levinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32589501|title=Relevance : communication and cognition|last=Sperber,|first=Dan|last2=Wilson|first2=Deirdre|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=|year=|isbn=9780631198789|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=32589501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49525903|title=Thoughts and utterances : the pragmatics of explicit communication|last=Robyn.|first=Carston,|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell Pub|isbn=9780631178910|location=Oxford, U.K.|oclc=49525903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45733473|title=Presumptive meanings : the theory of generalized conversational implicature|last=C.|first=Levinson, Stephen|date=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262621304|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=45733473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While keeping these traditions in mind, the question of whether or not there is any grounds for conflict between the formal and informal approaches is far from being decided. Some theorists, like [[Paul Grice]], have been skeptical of any claims that there is a substantial conflict between logic and natural language.&lt;ref&gt;Grice, Paul. "Logic and Conversation". ''Perspectives in the Philosophy of Language.'' (2000) ed. Robert Stainton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation and interpretation===
Translation and interpretation are two other problems that philosophers of language have attempted to confront. In the 1950s, [[W.V. Quine]] argued for the indeterminacy of meaning and reference based on the principle of ''[[radical translation]]''. In ''[[Word and Object]]'', Quine asks readers to imagine a situation in which  they are confronted with a previously undocumented, group of indigenous people where they must attempt to make sense of the utterances and gestures that its members make. This is the situation of radical translation.&lt;ref name="WVQ"&gt;Quine, W.V. (1960) ''Word and Object''. MIT Press; {{ISBN|0-262-67001-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed that, in such a situation, it is impossible ''in principle'' to be absolutely certain of the meaning or reference that a speaker of the indigenous peoples language attaches to an utterance. For example, if a speaker sees a rabbit and says "gavagai", is she referring to the whole rabbit, to the rabbit's tail, or to a temporal part of the rabbit. All that can be done is to examine the utterance as a part of the overall linguistic behaviour of the individual, and then use these observations to interpret the meaning of all other utterances. From this basis, one can form a manual of translation. But, since reference is indeterminate, there will be many such manuals, no one of which is more correct than the others. For Quine, as for Wittgenstein and Austin, meaning is not something that is associated with a single word or sentence, but is rather something that, if it can be attributed at all, can only be attributed to a whole language.&lt;ref name="WVQ" /&gt; The resulting view is called ''[[semantic holism]]''.

Inspired by Quine's discussion, [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] extended the idea of radical translation to the interpretation of utterances and behavior within a single linguistic community. He dubbed this notion ''radical interpretation''. He suggested that the meaning that any individual ascribed to a sentence could only be determined by attributing meanings to many, perhaps all, of the individual's assertions, as well as their mental states and attitudes.&lt;ref name="TandI" /&gt;

== History ==
{{Further|History of linguistics}}

===Ancient philosophy===
Linguistic speculation in [[Indian subcontinent|India]] is attested since the [[Vedic period]] ([[Iron Age in India|Iron Age]]), beginning with the deification of ''[[vāk]]'' "speech" and the role of language (utterance, [[shabda]]) in [[Kalpa (ritual)|ritual]]. [[Vyākaraṇa|Sanskrit grammatical tradition]] gives rise to linguistic philosophy beginning in the final centuries BC and early centuries AD, notably in the philosophical schools of [[Nyaya]] and [[Mimamsa]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the West, inquiry into language stretches back to the 5th century BC with [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, S. "History of the Philosophy of Language". In ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. ed. Ted Honderich. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both in India and in Greece, linguistic speculation predates the emergence of [[grammar|grammatical traditions]] of systematic description of language, which emerged around the 5th century BC in India (see [[Yāska]]), and around the 3rd century BC in Greece (see [[Rhianus]]).

In the dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', Plato considered the question of whether the names of things were determined by convention or by nature. He criticized [[conventionalism]] because it led to the bizarre consequence that anything can be conventionally denominated by any name. Hence, it cannot account for the correct or incorrect application of a name. He claimed that there was a natural correctness to names. To do this, he pointed out that [[compound words]] and phrases have a range of correctness. He also argued that primitive names had a natural correctness, because each [[phoneme]] represented basic ideas or sentiments. For example, for Plato the letter ''l'' and its sound represented the idea of softness. However, by the end of the ''Cronic'', he had admitted that some social conventions were also involved, and that there were faults in the idea that phonemes had individual meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Cratylus''(c. 360 BCE) Series: Cambridge Studies in the Dialogues of Plato. Trans. David Sedley. Cambridge:University of Cambridge Press. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-521-58492-0}} also available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1616 Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle interested himself with the issues of [[logic]], categories, and meaning creation. He separated all things into categories of [[species]] and [[genus]]. He thought that the meaning of a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] was established through an abstraction of the similarities between various individual things. This theory later came to be called ''nominalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Steven K. Strange, (1992) ''Porphyry: On Aristotle, Categories''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|0-8014-2816-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Aristotle took these similarities to be constituted by a real commonality of form, he is more often considered a proponent of "moderate realism".

The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers made important contributions to the analysis of grammar, distinguishing five parts of speech: nouns, verbs, appellatives (names or [[epithet]]s), [[conjunctions]] and [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. They also developed a sophisticated doctrine of the ''lektón'' associated with each sign of a language, but distinct from both the sign itself and the thing to which it refers. This ''lektón'' was the meaning (or sense) of every term. The ''lektón'' of a sentence is what we would now call its [[proposition]]. Only propositions were considered "[[truth-bearer]]s" or "truth-vehicles" (i.e., they could be called true or false) while sentences were simply their vehicles of expression. Different ''lektá'' could also express things besides propositions, such as commands, questions and exclamations.&lt;ref&gt;Mates, B. (1953) ''Stoic Logic''. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-02368-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval philosophy===
Medieval philosophers were greatly interested in the subtleties of language and its usage. For many [[Scholasticism|scholastics]], this interest was provoked by the necessity of translating [[Greek language|Greek]] texts into [[Latin]]. There were several noteworthy philosophers of language in the medieval period. According to Peter J. King, (although this has been disputed), [[Peter Abelard]] anticipated the modern ideas of ''[[sense and reference]]''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Peter. ''Peter Abelard.'' Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abelard/#4&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[William of Ockham]]'s ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]]'' brought forward one of the first serious proposals for codifying a mental language.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, D. (1999) "Is there Synonymy in Occam's Mental Language?". Published in ''The Cambridge Companion to Ockham'', edited by Paul Vincent Spade. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-58244-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholastics of the high medieval period, such as Ockham and [[John Duns Scotus]], considered logic to be a ''scientia sermocinalis'' (science of language). The result of their studies was the elaboration of linguistic-philosophical notions whose complexity and subtlety has only recently come to be appreciated. Many of the most interesting problems of modern philosophy of language were anticipated by medieval thinkers. The phenomena of vagueness and ambiguity were analyzed intensely, and this led to an increasing interest in problems related to the use of ''syncategorematic'' words such as ''and'', ''or'', ''not'', ''if'', and ''every''. The study of ''categorematic'' words (or ''terms'') and their properties was also developed greatly.&lt;ref name="MD"&gt;Marconi, D. "Storia della Filosofia del Linguaggio". In ''L'Enciclopedia Garzantina della Filosofia''. ed. Gianni Vattimo. Milan: Garzanti Editori. 1981. {{ISBN|88-11-50515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major developments of the scholastics in this area was the doctrine of the ''suppositio''.&lt;ref name="KKP"&gt;[[Norman Kretzmann|Kretzmann, N.]], [[Anthony Kenny]] &amp; [[Jan Pinborg]]. (1982) ''Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-22605-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suppositio of a term is the interpretation that is given of it in a specific context. It can be ''proper'' or ''improper'' (as when it is used in [[metaphor]], [[metonym]]s and other figures of speech). A proper suppositio, in turn, can be either formal or material accordingly when it refers to its usual non-linguistic referent (as in "Charles is a man"), or to itself as a linguistic entity (as in "''Charles'' has seven letters"). Such a classification scheme is the precursor of modern distinctions between [[use–mention distinction|use and mention]], and between language and metalanguage.&lt;ref name="KKP" /&gt;

There is a tradition called speculative grammar which existed from the 11th to the 13th century.  Leading scholars included, among others, Martin of Dace and Thomas of Erfurth.

===Modern philosophy===
Linguists of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods such as [[Johannes Goropius Becanus]], [[Athanasius Kircher]] and [[John Wilkins]] were infatuated with the idea of a [[philosophical language]] reversing the [[confusion of tongues]], influenced  by the gradual discovery of [[Chinese character]]s and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] (''[[Hieroglyphica]]''). This thought parallels the idea that there might be a universal language of music.

European scholarship began to absorb the [[Vyākaraṇa|Indian linguistic tradition]] only from the mid-18th century, pioneered by [[Jean François Pons]] and [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]] (the ''editio princeps'' of [[Varadarāja]], a 17th-century [[Sanskrit]] grammarian, dating to 1849).

In the early 19th century, the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] insisted that language ought to play a larger role in [[Western philosophy]]. He argues that philosophy has not sufficiently focused on the role language plays in cognition and that future philosophy ought to proceed with a conscious focus on language:

{{quote|If the claim of philosophers to be unbiased were all it pretends to be, it would also have to take account of language and its whole significance in relation to speculative philosophy&amp;nbsp;... Language is partly something originally given, partly that which develops freely. And just as the individual can never reach the point at which he becomes absolutely independent&amp;nbsp;... so too with language.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855). In Cloeren, H. ''Language and Thought''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Contemporary philosophy===
{{also|Ordinary language philosophy}}
The phrase "[[linguistic turn]]" was used to describe the noteworthy emphasis that contemporary philosophers put upon language.

Language began to play a central role in Western philosophy in the early 20th century. One of the central figures involved in this development was the German philosopher [[Gottlob Frege]], whose work on philosophical logic and the philosophy of language in the late 19th century influenced the work of 20-century [[analytic philosopher]]s [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. The philosophy of language became so pervasive that for a time, in [[analytic philosophy]] circles, philosophy as a whole was understood to be a matter of philosophy of language.

In [[Continental philosophy]], the foundation work was [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Cours de linguistique générale]]'', published posthumously in 1916.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11737">'''Pragmatic language impairment''' ('''PLI'''), or '''social''' ('''pragmatic''') '''communication disorder''' ('''SCD'''), is an impairment in understanding [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] aspects of language. This type of impairment was previously called '''semantic-pragmatic disorder''' ('''SPD'''). People with these impairments have special challenges with the semantic aspect of language (the meaning of what is being said) and the pragmatics of language (using language appropriately in social situations). It is assumed that those with autism have difficulty with "the meaning of what is being said" due to different ways of responding to social situations.

PLI is now a diagnosis in [[DSM-5]], and is called social (pragmatic) communication disorder. Communication problems are also part of the [[autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD); however, the latter [[Autism spectrum#Characteristics|also show]] a restricted pattern of behavior, according to behavioral psychology. The diagnosis SCD can only be given if ASD has been ruled out.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Social%20Communication%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf||title=Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder|accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Individuals with PLI have particular trouble understanding the meaning of what others are saying, and they are challenged in using language appropriately to get their needs met and interact with others. Children with the disorder often exhibit:

* delayed language development
* aphasic speech (such as word search pauses, [[jargoning]], word order errors, word category errors, [[verb tense]] errors)     
* Stuttering or cluttering speech
* Repeating words or phrases
* difficulty with pronouns or pronoun reversal  
* difficulty understanding questions 
* difficulty understanding choices and making decisions.  
* difficulty following conversations or stories. Conversations are "off-topic" or "one-sided".
* difficulty extracting the key points from a conversation or story; they tend to get lost in the details
* difficulty with verb tenses
* difficulty explaining or describing an event
* tendency to be concrete or prefer facts to stories
* difficulty understanding satire or jokes 
* difficulty understanding contextual cues 
* difficulty in reading comprehension
* difficulty with reading [[body language]]
* difficulty in making and maintaining friendships and relationships because of delayed language development.
* difficulty in distinguishing offensive remarks
* difficulty with organizational skills

According to Bishop and Norbury (2002), children with semantic pragmatic disorder have fluent, complex and clearly articulated expressive language but exhibit problems with the way their language is used. These children typically are verbose. However, they usually have problems understanding and producing connected discourse, instead giving conversational responses that are socially inappropriate, tangential and/or stereotyped. They often develop obsessional interests but not as strong or eccentric as people with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s.

The current view, therefore, is that the disorder has more to do with communication and information processing than language. For example, children with semantic pragmatic disorder will often fail to grasp the central meaning or saliency of events. This then leads to an excessive preference for routine and "sameness" (seen in autism spectrum disorders), as PLI children struggle to generalize and grasp the meaning of situations that are new; it also means that more difficulties occur in a stimulating environment than in a one-to-one setting.

A further problem caused by PLI is the assumption of literal communication. This would mean that obvious, concrete instructions are clearly understood and carried out, whereas simple but non-literal expressions such as jokes, sarcasm and general social chatting are difficult and can lead to misinterpretation. Lies are also a confusing concept to children with PLI as it involves knowing what the speaker is thinking, intending and truly meaning beyond a literal interpretation.
===Relationship to autism===
Prior to the DSM-5, SCD was not differentiated from a diagnosis of autism. However, there was a large number of cases of children experiencing difficulties with pragmatics that did not meet the criteria for ASD. The differential diagnosis of SCD allows practitioners to account for social and communication difficulties that occur at a lesser degree than in children with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;Mash, Eric. (2016). ''Abnormal Child Psychology, 6e, 6th Edition''. [VitalSource Bookshelf Online]. Retrieved fromhttps://cengagebrain.vitalsource.com/#/books/9781305445765/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate over the relationship between semantic pragmatic disorder and autistic disorder as the clinical profile of semantic pragmatic disorder is often  seen in children with [[high-functioning autism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V.M. and Norbury, C. F. (2002). "Exploring the borderlands of autistic disorder and specific language impairment: a study using standardised diagnostic instruments" ''Journal of Child Psychiatry, 43: 917–929. doi: 10.1111/1469-7610.00114''. [Wiley Online Library]. Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1469-7610.00114/full&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatic language impairment is distinguished from autism by the absence of any history (current or past) of restricted/repetitive patterns of interest or behavior in PLI.&lt;ref name="DSM 5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder, 315.39 (F80.89) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pages = 47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostic ==

The [[DSM-5]] categorizes SCD as a [[communication disorder]] within the domain of [[neurodevelopmental disorders]], listed alongside other disorders of speech and language which typically manifest in early childhood. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for social (pragmatic) communication disorder is as follows:
&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:0em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 8px #ccc;padding:0.5em"&gt;
*A. Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal communication as manifested by all of the following:
# Deficits in using communication for social purposes, such as greeting and sharing information, in a manner that is appropriate for the social context.
# Impairment of the ability to change communication to match context or the needs of the listener, such as speaking differently in a classroom than on a playground, talking differently to a child than to an adult, and avoiding use of overly formal language.
# Difficulties following rules for conversation and storytelling, such as taking turns in conversation, rephrasing when misunderstood, and knowing how to use verbal and nonverbal signals to regulate interaction.
# Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly stated (e.g., making inferences) and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings of language (e.g., idioms, humor, metaphors, multiple meanings that depend on the context for interpretation).
*B. The deficits result in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, social relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in combination.
*C. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period (but deficits may not become fully manifest until social communication demands exceed limited capacities).
*D. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurological condition or to low abilities in the domains of word structure and grammar, and are not better explained by autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), global developmental delay, or another mental disorder.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Related disorders==
[[Hyperlexia]] is a similar but different disorder where main characteristics are an above-average ability to read with a below-average ability to understand spoken and/or written language. Joanne Volden wrote an article in 2002 comparing the linguistic weaknesses of children with [[nonverbal learning disability]] to PLI.&lt;ref name="volden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/Publications/leader/2002/021022/f021022.htm |title=Nonverbal learning disability: What the SLP needs to know |last=Volden |first=Joanne |date=October 22, 2002 |work=The ASHA Leader |publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association |accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==
In 1983, [[Isabelle Rapin|Rapin]] and Allen suggested the term "semantic pragmatic disorder" to describe the communicative behavior of children who presented traits such as pathological talkativeness, deficient access to vocabulary and discourse comprehension, atypical choice of terms and inappropriate conversational skills.&lt;ref name=Rapin&gt;Rapin I., and D. Allen (1983). "Developmental language disorders: Nosologic considerations", in U. Kirk (ed.), ''Neuropsychology of language, reading, and, spelling'' (pp. 155–184). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They referred to a group of children who presented with mild [[autism|autistic]] features and specific semantic pragmatic language problems. More recently, the term "pragmatic language impairment" (PLI) has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Conti-Ramsden G. |author2=N. Botting |title=Classification of children with specific language impairment: longitudinal considerations |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=1195–204 |year=1999 |pmid=10515515 |doi=10.1044/jslhr.4205.1195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2000), "Pragmatic language impairment: A correlate of SLI, a distinct subgroup, or part of the autistic continuum?" In D. V. M. Bishop and L. B. Leonard (eds.), ''Speech and Language Impairments in Children: Causes, characteristics, intervention and outcome'' (pp. 99–113). Hove, UK: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapin and Allen's definition has been expanded and refined by therapists who include communication disorders that involve difficulty in understanding the meaning of words, grammar, syntax, prosody, eye gaze, body language, gestures, or social context. While autistic children exhibit pragmatic language impairment, this type of communication disorder can also be found in individuals with other types of disorders including [[auditory processing disorder]]s, [[neuropathies]], [[encephalopathies]] and certain genetic disorders.&lt;ref name=Bishop2002&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Rhyming slang''' is a form of slang word construction in the [[English language]].  It is especially prevalent in the UK, Ireland and Australia. It started in the early 19th century in the [[East End of London]]; hence its alternative name, '''Cockney rhyming slang'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Word with You: Jack may have been a dull boy, but he had lots of friends |url=http://www.sharonherald.com/opinion/columns/a-word-with-you-jack-may-have-been-a-dull/article_b646b9a2-c282-5082-b2d8-15c191e14778.html |website=Sharon Herald |publisher=Sharon Herald |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, especially the [[criminal underworld]] of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] between 1880 and 1920, rhyming slang has sometimes been known as '''Australian slang'''.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Partridge, 2015, ''A Dictionary of the Underworld: British and American'' (1968 ed.); Abingdon, England/New York; Routledge; p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maurer, D.W. |title='Australian' Rhyming Argot in the American Underworld |journal=American Speech |volume=19 | issue = 3 |year=1944 |pages=183–195 |doi=10.2307/487290|jstor=487290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Baker, Sidney J. |title=The Australian Language |year=1945 |chapter= Chapter XV | location =  | publisher =  | isbn =  | page=271}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Partridge|first=Eric|date=1967|title=A dictionary of slang and unconventional English: colloquialisms and catch-phrases, solecisms and catachreses, nicknames, vulgarisms, and such Americanisms as have been naturalized|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001183457/Cite|journal=New York: Macmillan|volume=6 edition|pages=1894–1979|via=Carleton Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of rhyming slang involves replacing a common word with a phrase of two or more words, the last of which rhymes with the original word; then, in almost all cases, omitting, from the end of the phrase, the secondary rhyming word (which is thereafter implied),&lt;!--, in a process called ''hemiteleia'',--&gt;&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberts, Chris | year = 2006 |title=Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme | location = Waterville, ME |publisher=Gale/Thorndike Press|isbn=978-0786285174}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;ref name=mother&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryson, Bill| year = 1990 | title=Mother Tongue | location =  | publisher=[[Penguin Books]] | isbn=978-0140143058|quote=}}{{page needed|date=January 2017}} Bryson, a humourist, states that there is a special name given to this omission: "the word that rhymes is almost always dropped... There's a technical term for this process as well: hemiteleia". Given that this is a genus of plant species, and appears in no readily available sources as a linguistic term, it is unclear whether the humourist was being humorous, or informative.&lt;/ref&gt; making the origin and meaning of the phrase elusive to listeners not in the know.&lt;ref name="ayto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ayto, John|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Rhyming Slang|location = Oxford | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0192801227}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}

==Examples==
The form that is followed is made clear with the following example. The rhyming phrase "apples and pears" evolved to mean "stairs". Following the pattern of omission, "and pears" is dropped, thus the spoken phrase "I'm going up the apples" means "I'm going up the stairs".&lt;ref name="cockney-guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/09/guide-to-cockney-rhyming-slang|title=Guide to Cockney Rhyming Slang|date=9 June 2014|access-date=25 March 2018|website=The Guardian|last=Jacot de Boinod|first=Adam|author-link=Adam Jacot de Boinod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are further common examples of these phrases:&lt;ref name="cockney-guide"/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Slang Word !! Meaning !! Original Phrase
|-
| dog || telephone || dog-and-bone
|-
| trouble || wife || trouble-and-strife
|-
| mincers || eyes || mince-pies
|-
| syrup || wig || syrup-of-figs
|-
| plates || feet || plates-of-meat
|-
| frog || road || frog-and-toad
|-
| apples || stairs || apples-and-pears
|-
| Khyber || arse ||  Khyber Pass
|-
| Septic|| Yank ||  septic tank
|-
| Turkish || laugh || Turkish bath (pronounced "bahf" {{IPA|/baf/}})
|}
Thus a construction of the following type could conceivably arise: "It nearly knocked me off me plates – the septic was wearing a syrup! I couldn't believe me mincers, so I ran up the apples, got straight on the dog to me trouble and we had a Turkish."

In some examples the meaning is further obscured by adding a second iteration of rhyme and truncation to the original rhymed phrase. For example, the word "Aris" is often used to indicate the buttocks. This is the result of a double rhyme, starting with the original rough synonym "arse", which is rhymed with "bottle and glass", leading to "bottle". "Bottle" was then rhymed with "Aristotle" and truncated to "Aris".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28477779|title=Cockney rabbit : a Dick'n'Arry of rhyming slang|last=Puxley,|first=Ray|date=1992|publisher=Robson Books|year=|isbn=978-0860518273|location=London|pages=4–5|oclc=28477779}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=mother/&gt;DEMANDS VERIFICATION FROM EXPERT OR SECOND SOURCE, SEE EDIT SUMMARY--&gt;

===Phonetic ''versus'' phono-semantic forms===
[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], a [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[Language revitalization|revivalist]], has proposed a distinction between rhyming slang based on sound only, and phono-semantic rhyming slang, which includes a semantic link between the slang expression and its [[referent]] (the thing it refers to).&lt;ref name = Zuckermann03&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]].

==History==
Rhyming slang is believed to have originated in the mid-19th century in the [[East End]] of [[London]], with several sources suggesting some time in the 1840s.&lt;ref name = Partridge72&gt;{{cite book | author = Partridge, Eric | year = 1972 | title = Dictionary of Historical Slang | location = London | publisher = Penguin | isbn =  | url =  | access-date =  }}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;ref name="hott"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hotten, John Camden| year=1859 | title=A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words: Used at the Present Day in the Streets of London, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the Houses of Parliament, the Dens of St. Giles, and the Palaces of St. James : Preceded by a History of Cant and Vulgar Language from the Time… |chapter=Some Account of the Rhyming Slang, the Secret Language of Chaunters and Patterers | pages=133–136 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Zhk9h-w1negC | access-date = January 26, 2017 | location = London | publisher=John Camden Hotten }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vicweb"&gt;{{cite web |author=Sullivan, Dick | date = July 16, 2007 | title="Weeping Willow" Stands for "Pillow": Victorian Rhyming Slang | url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/slang1.html |accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Routledge's slang dictionary from 1972, English rhyming slang dates from around 1840 and arose in the East End of London;&lt;ref name = Partridge72/&gt;{{rp|p. 12}} [[John Camden Hotten]]'s 1859 ''[[A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words|Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words]]'' likewise states that it originated in the 1840s ("about twelve or fifteen years ago"), but with "chaunters" and "patterers" in the [[Seven Dials, London|Seven Dials]] area of London.&lt;ref name="hott"/&gt; The reference is to travelling salesmen of certain kinds, chaunters selling sheet music and patterers offered cheap, tawdry goods at fairs and markets up and down the country.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Hotten's ''Dictionary'' included the first known "Glossary of the Rhyming Slang", which included later mainstays such as "frog and toad" (the main road) and "apples and pears (stairs), as well as many more obscure examples, e.g. "Battle of the Nile" (a tile, a  vulgar term for a hat), "Duke of York" (take a walk), and "Top of Rom" (home).&lt;ref name="hott"/&gt;

It remains a matter of speculation whether rhyming slang was a linguistic accident, a game, or a [[cryptolect]] developed intentionally to confuse non-locals.{{according to whom|date=January 2017}} If deliberate, it may also have been used to maintain a sense of community, or to allow traders to talk amongst themselves in marketplaces in order to facilitate [[collusion]], without customers knowing what they were saying, or by criminals to confuse the police (see [[thieves' cant]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The English academic, lexicographer and radio personality [[Terence Dolan]] has suggested that rhyming slang may have been invented by Irish immigrants to London "so the actual English wouldn't understand what they were talking about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eolas Staff &amp; [[Terence Dolan|Dolan, Terence]] | date = February 6, 2012 | title = Irish-English Explained | journal = Eolas Magazine | url = http://www.eolasmagazine.ie/irish-english-explained/ | access-date = January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many examples of rhyming slang are based on locations in London, such as "[[Peckham Rye]]", meaning "tie" (as in necktie), which dates from the late 19th century; "[[Hampstead Heath]]", meaning "teeth" (usually as "Hampsteads"), which was first recorded in 1887; and "[[Barnet Fair]]", meaning "hair", which dates from the 1850s.

By the mid-20th century many rhyming slang expressions used the names of contemporary personalities, especially actors and performers: for example "[[Gregory Peck]]"  meaning "neck" and also "cheque"; "[[Ruby Murray]]" meaning "curry"; "Alans", meaning "knickers" from [[Alan Whicker]]; "[[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]]" meaning "pillow" when pronounced /ˈpilə/  and "[[Henry Hall (bandleader)|Henry Halls]]" for "balls (testicles)".

The use of personal names as rhymes continued into the late 20th century, for example "[[Tony Blair]]s" meaning "flares", as in trousers with a wide bottom (previously this was "[[Lionel Blair]]s"  and this change illustrates the ongoing mutation of the forms of expression) and  "[[Britney Spears]]", meaning "beers".

Many examples have passed into common usage. Some substitutions have become relatively widespread in England in their contracted form. "To have a butcher's", meaning to have a look, originates from "[[butcher]]'s hook", an S-shaped hook used by butchers to hang up meat, and dates from the late 19th century but has existed independently in general use from around the 1930s simply as "butchers". Similarly, "use your loaf", meaning "use your head", derives from "loaf of [[bread]]" and also dates from the late 19th century but came into independent use in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="ayto" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}} To "have a giraffe" is commonly employed for a "laugh"&lt;!--, although technically this does not involve hemiteleia--&gt;.

In some cases, false etymologies exist. For example, the term "barney" has been used to mean an altercation or fight since the late 19th century, although without a clear derivation.&lt;ref name = Partridge91&gt;{{cite book | author = Partridge, Eric | year = 1991 | title = A Concise Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English | location = London | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 978-0415063524 | url =  | access-date =  }}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 22}} In the 2001 feature film ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'', the explanation for the term is that it derives from [[Barney Rubble]],{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} the name of a cartoon character from the ''[[The Flintstones|Flintstones]]'' television  program many decades later in origin, and so an obviously incorrect explanation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;!--Early bulletin board posting moved to external links as a non-authoritative source that DOES NOT IN ANY CASE SUPPORT THIS SENTENCE.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an authoritative definition and etymology, see "Barney," op. cit., at {{cite book | author = Partridge, Eric | editor = Beale, Paul | year = 2002 | title = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English | location = London | publisher = Routledge | edition = 8th Edn. | isbn = 978-0415291897 | url =  | access-date =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional and international variations===
Rhyming slang is used mainly in London in England but can to some degree be understood across the country. Some constructions, however, rely on particular regional accents for the rhymes to work. For instance, the term "Charing Cross" (a place in London), used to mean "horse" since the mid-19th century,&lt;ref name="ayto" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}} does not work for a speaker without the [[lot–cloth split]], common in London at that time but not nowadays. A similar example is "Joanna" meaning "piano", which is based on the pronunciation of "piano" as "pianna" {{IPAc-en|p|i|ˈ|æ|n|ə}}.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Unique formations also exist in other parts of the United Kingdom, such as in the East Midlands, where the local accent has formed "Derby Road", which rhymes with "cold".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Outside England, rhyming slang is used in many English-speaking countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], with local variations. For example, in Australian slang, the term for an English person is "[[Alternative words for British#Pommy|pommy]]", which has been proposed as a rhyme on "pomegranate" rhyming with "immigrant".&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''{{clarify|date=January 2017}} cites a well-known Australian weekly, ''[[The Bulletin]]'', which on 14 November 1912 reported: "The other day a Pummy Grant (assisted immigrant) was handed a bridle and told to catch a horse." See {{cite dictionary | entry = "Pomegranate" [Usage examples] | work = Oxford English Dictionary | via = Dictionary.OED.com | date = | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50183640?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=pomegranate&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 | subscription = yes | dead-url = yes | access-date =  | quote = }}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Partridge91/&gt;{{rp|p. 342}}

Rhyming slang as such is not in general use in the United States, but a few notable exceptions include&lt;ref name="american-slang"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780415371827|last=Dalzell|first=Tom|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5F-YNZRv-VMC|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date=2009|pages=122,123,327}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

Rhyming slang is continually evolving, and new phrases are introduced all the time; new personalities replace old ones—pop culture introduces new words—as in "I haven't a Scooby" (from [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby Doo]], the eponymous cartoon dog of the [[Scooby-Doo|cartoon series]]) meaning "I haven't a clue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|entry=Scooby"|work=Oxford Dictionaries|via=OxfordDictionaries.com|date=22 March 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/scooby|access-date=22 March 2017|quote=1990s; earliest use found in The Glasgow Herald. Short for ScoobyDoo, the name of a cartoon dog which features in several U.S. television series and films (which typically include the name of the dog in the title), as rhyming slang for clue.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taboo terms===
Rhyming slang is often used as a substitute for words regarded as taboo, often to the extent that the association with the taboo word becomes unknown over time. "[[Wiktionary:berk|Berk]]" (often used to mean "foolish person") originates from the most famous of all [[fox hunting|fox hunts]], the  "[[Berkeley Hunt]]" meaning "cunt"; "[[Wiktionary:cobblers|cobblers]]" (often used in the context "what you said is rubbish") originates from "[[Stitching awl|cobbler's awls]]", meaning "balls" (as in testicles); and "hampton" meaning "prick" (as in penis) originates from "[[Hampton Wick]]" (a place in London).

Lesser taboo terms include "[[pony]] and [[Trap (carriage)#Types of horse-drawn carriages|trap]]" for "crap" (as in defecate, but often used to denote nonsense or low quality); to blow a [[Blowing a raspberry|raspberry]] (rude sound of derision) from raspberry tart for "fart"; "[[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte]] (an opera company) for "fart"; "[[Jimmy Riddle]]" (an American country musician) for "piddle" (as in [[urinate]]), "[[J. Arthur Rank]]" (a film mogul), "[[Jodrell Bank]]" or "[[Ham hock|ham shank]]" for "[[wank (sexual act)|wank]]", "[[Bristol City Football Club|Bristol Cities]]" (contracted to 'Bristols') for "titties", etc. "Taking the Mick" or "taking the Mickey" is thought to be a rhyming slang form of "[[taking the piss]]", where "Mick" came from "Mickey Bliss".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= BBC Staff; Styles, Tania &amp; Gilliver, Peter [OED] |date= January 9, 2009 |title= ''Balderdash and Piffle'': Who Were They?—Tricky Verdicts |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/wordhunt/whoweretheyextras.shtml |access-date= |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090109062814/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/wordhunt/whoweretheyextras.shtml |archive-date= January 9, 2009 |time= |location= |publisher= BBC |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhyming slang terms for [[Jew]] have included "[[Chelsea Football Club|Chelsea Blue]]", "[[Glue|Stick of Glue]]", "[[dimensional lumber|Four by Two]]", "[[Shoemaking|Buckle my shoe]]", and "Front Wheel Skid", which is a more arcane form of the insulting term "[[Yid]]" (which itself comes from the [[Yiddish]] word for a Jew).

In December 2004 [[Joe Pasquale]], winner of the fourth series of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!]]'', became well known for his frequent use of the term "Jacobs", for [[Jacob's|Jacob's Crackers]], a rhyming slang term for knackers i.e. [[testicles]].

==In popular culture==
===In film===

Cary Grant's character teaches rhyming slang to his female companion in ''[[Mr. Lucky (film)|Mr. Lucky]]'' (1943), describing it as 'Australian rhyming slang'. Rhyming slang is also used and described in a scene of the 1967 film ''[[To Sir, with Love]]'' starring [[Sidney Poitier]], where the English students tell their foreign teacher that the slang is a drag and something for old people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/t/to-sir-with-love-script.html|title=To Sir With Love -  Script - transcript from the screenplay and/or Sidney Poitier movie|author=|date=|website=www.script-o-rama.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closing song of the 1969 crime caper, ''[[The Italian Job]]'', ("Getta Bloomin' Move On" a.k.a. "The Self Preservation Society") contains many slang terms. 

Rhyming slang has been used to lend authenticity to an East End setting. Examples include ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' (1998) (wherein the slang is translated via subtitles in one scene); ''[[The Limey]]'' (1999); ''[[Sexy Beast]]'' (2000); ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' (2000); ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' (2001); and ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002); ''[[It's All Gone Pete Tong]]'' (2004), after BBC radio disc jockey [[Pete Tong]] whose name is used in this context as rhyming slang for "wrong"; ''[[Green Street Hooligans]]'' (2005). In [[Margin Call (film)|''Margin Call'']] (2011), Will Emerson, played by London-born actor [[Paul Bettany]], asks a friend on the telephone, "How's the trouble and strife?" ("wife").

[[Cockneys vs Zombies]] (2012) mocked the genesis of rhyming slang terms when a Cockney character calls zombies "Trafalgars" to even his Cockney fellows' puzzlement; he then explains it thus: "''Trafalgar square - fox and hare - hairy cheek - five day week - weak and feeble - pins and needles - needle and stitch - Abercrombie and Fitch - Abercrombie: zombie''".

===Television===
One early US show to regularly feature rhyming slang was the Saturday morning children's show ''[[The Bugaloos]]'' (1970–72), with the character of Harmony ([[Wayne Laryea]]) often incorporating it in his dialogue.

In Britain, rhyming slang had a resurgence of popular interest beginning in the 1970s, resulting from its use in a number of London-based television programmes such as ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' (1970–74); and ''[[Not On Your Nellie]]'' (1974–75), starring [[Hylda Baker]] as Nellie Pickersgill, alludes to the phrase "not on your Nellie Duff", rhyming slang for "not on your puff" i.e. not on your life. Similarly, ''[[The Sweeney]]'' (1975–78) alludes to the phrase "Sweeney Todd" for "[[Flying Squad]]", a rapid response unit of London’s Metropolitan Police. In ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'' (1976–79), a comic twist was added to rhyming slang by way of spurious and fabricated examples which a young man had laboriously attempted to explain to his father (e.g. 'dustbins' meaning 'children', as in 'dustbin lids'='kids'; 'Teds' being 'Ted Heath' and thus 'teeth'; and even 'Chitty Chitty' being 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', and thus 'rhyming slang'...). It was also featured in an episode of ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'' in the first season (1975) where Tom and Barbara purchase a wood burning range from a junk trader called Sam, who litters his language with phony slang in hopes of getting higher payment. He comes up with a fake story as to the origin of Cockney Rhyming slang and is caught out rather quickly. In ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' season 2 (1976) episode "The Breakup: Part 2", [[Harry Bentley (character)|Mr. Bentley]] explains Cockney rhyming slang to [[George Jefferson]], in that "whistle and flute" means "suit", "apples and pears" means "stairs", "plates of meat" means "feet".

The use of rhyming slang was also prominent in ''[[Mind Your Language]]'' (1977–79), ''[[Citizen Smith]]'' (1977–80), ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawkins, Brian |year=2002 |title=The Phenomenon That Was Minder |page= |location= |publisher=Chameleon Press |isbn=978-9628681211 |url= |access-date= }}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2017}} (1979–94), ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' (1981–91), and ''[[EastEnders]]'' (1985-). ''Minder'' could be quite uncompromising in its use of obscure forms without any clarification. Thus the non-Cockney viewer was obliged to deduce that, say, "iron" was "male homosexual" ('iron'='iron hoof'='poof'). One episode in Series 5 of ''Steptoe and Son'' was entitled "Any Old Iron", for the same reason, when Albert thinks that Harold is 'on the turn'.

===Music===
In popular music, [[Spike Jones]] and his City Slickers recorded "So 'Elp Me", based on rhyming slang&lt;!-- (without the hemiteleia)--&gt;, in 1950.  The 1967 [[Kinks]] song "Harry Rag" was based on the usage of the name [[Harry Wragg]] as rhyming slang for "fag" (i.e. a cigarette). The idiom made a brief appearance in the UK-based DJ reggae music of the 1980s in the hit "Cockney Translation" by [[Smiley Culture]] of [[South London]]; this was followed a couple of years later by Domenick and Peter Metro's "Cockney and Yardie". London-based artists such as [[Audio Bullys]] and [[Chas &amp; Dave]] (and others from elsewhere in the UK, such as [[The Streets]], who are from Birmingham) frequently use rhyming slang in their songs.

British-born M.C. [[MF Doom]] released an ode entitled "Rhymin' Slang", after settling in the UK in 2010. The track was released on the 2012 album [[JJ Doom]] album ''Keys to the Kuffs''.

===Literature===
In modern literature, Cockney rhyming slang is used frequently in the novels and short stories of [[Kim Newman]], for instance in the short story collections "The Man from the Diogenes Club" (2006) and "Secret Files of the Diogenes Club" (2007), where it is explained at the end of each book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Newman, Kim  | date = June 18, 2014 | title = ''Cult'': A Shambles in Belgravia | website = BBC.com | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/sherlock/shamblesinbelgravia1.shtml | access-date = January 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel ''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]'' by [[Terry Pratchett]], this slang is also frequently used.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} 

It is also parodied in Pratchett's ''Going Postal'', which features a geriatric Junior Postman by the name of Tolliver Groat, a speaker of 'Dimwell Arrhythmic Rhyming Slang', or rather, rhyming slang which ''does not actually rhyme''. Thus, a wig is a 'prunes', from 'syrup of prunes', an obvious parody of the Cockney ''syrup'' from ''syrup of figs -- wig''.  There are numerous other parodies, though it has been pointed out that the result is even more impenetrable than a conventional rhyming slang and so may not be quite so illogical as it seems, given the assumed purpose of rhyming slang as a means of communicating in a manner unintelligible to all but the initiated.

===Sport===
In Scottish football, a number of clubs have nicknames taken from rhyming slang. Partick Thistle are known as the "Harry Rags", which is taken from the rhyming slang of their 'official' nickname "the jags". Rangers are known as the "Teddy Bears", which comes from the rhyming slang for "the Gers" (shortened version of Ran-gers).  Heart of Midlothian are known as the "Jambos", which comes from "Jam Tarts" which is the rhyming slang for "Hearts" which is the common abbreviation of the Club's name. Hibernian are also referred to as "The Cabbage" which comes from Cabbage and Ribs being the rhyming slang for Hibs.

===Politics===
Junior doctors in the United Kingdom have helped popularise rhyming slang for the [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Jeremy Hunt]], amidst dispute over a new contract which has been imposed upon them. This was additionally supported in a tweet by James Blunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Bartlett, Evan | date = February 11, 2016 | title = James Blunt is 'Handing Over his Cockney Rhyming Slang Title' to Jeremy Hunt | website = Indy100.com | url = https://www.indy100.com/article/james-blunt-is-handing-over-his-cockney-rhyming-slang-title-to-jeremy-hunt--byLlHOQA6e | access-date=January 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ronde''' (''round'' in French) is a kind of script in which the heavy strokes are nearly upright, giving the characters when taken together a round look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |year=1913 |title=Webster's Dictionary |trans-title= |url= |access-date=|dead-url= |format= |language=English |location= |publisher= |page= |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronde script appeared in France at the end of the 16th century, and was popularized by writing masters such as [[Louis Barbedor]] in the 17th century. In its original form, it borrowed some of its letterforms from the [[Rotunda (script)|round Gothic style]]. This style of writing was still in use (with some modifications) until the 20th century because it was used in French school manuals to teach the bases of cursive writing. It was also commonly used by the scribes of the [[French Ministry of Finance]] until right after World War II,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Marc H.|date=|year=2008|title=Du manuscrit à la typographie numérique : présent et avenir des écritures anciennes|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00646804/|journal=Gazette du Livre Médiéval|publisher=CNRS|volume=|issue=52-53|pages=51–78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave this style the name of ''écriture ronde finnancière'' (''round financial writing'', not to be confused with the ''financière'' writing style).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/654540|title=The history and technique of lettering|last=1901-1995.|first=Nesbitt, Alexander,|date=1957|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=9780486204277|edition=[New Dover ed.]|location=New York|oclc=654540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic French rondes where also very present in the work of 18th century type founder and calligrapher [[Nicholas Gando]], which has been revived for the digital medium by way of the French 111 font.&lt;ref&gt;Published by the [[Bitstream]] type foundry in 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''semisoft sign''' (Ҍ&amp;nbsp;ҍ; italics: &lt;span style="font-family: times, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: larger"&gt;''Ҍ&amp;nbsp;ҍ''&lt;/span&gt;) is a letter of the [[Cyrillic script]].&lt;ref name=Unicode/&gt;

The semisoft sign is used in the alphabet of the [[Kildin Sami language]], where it indicates [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] (sometimes also called "half-palatalization") of the preceding stop, {{IPA|/nʲ/, /tʲ/, or /dʲ/}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2439">A '''singular term''' is a paradigmatic referring device in a language. Singular terms are of philosophical importance for [[philosophy of language|philosophers of language]], because they ''refer'' to things in the world, and the ability of words to refer calls for scrutiny.

==Overview==
Singular terms are defined as expressions that purport to denote or designate particular individual people, places, or other objects. They contrast with ''general terms'' (such as "car" or "chair") which can apply to more than one thing.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lycan]], ''Philosophy of Language'', 2nd edition, Routledge, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are various kinds of singular terms: proper names (eg. "Matthew"), definite descriptions (eg. "the second fisherman in the boat"), singular personal pronouns (eg. "she"), demonstrative pronouns (eg. "this"), etc.

Historically, various definitions for "singular term" have been offered:

# A term that tells us which individual is being talked about. ([[John Stuart Mill]], [[Arthur Prior]], [[P. F. Strawson]]) &lt;ref&gt;Strawson 1950, Prior 1976, Mill 1908&lt;/ref&gt;
# A term that is grammatically singular, i.e. a [[proper name]] (''proprium nomen''), a [[demonstrative pronoun]] (''pronomen demonstrativum'') or a demonstrative pronoun with a common name (''cum termino communi''). ([[William of Ockham]])&lt;ref&gt;Ockham, ''Summa Logicae''&lt;/ref&gt;
# A term that is inherently ''about'' the object to which it applies or [[Reference|refers]]. ([[Gottlob Frege]]) &lt;ref&gt;Frege 1892&lt;/ref&gt;
# A term that is true "in the same sense" of only one object. ([[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]])&lt;ref&gt;Peter of Spain 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Speech disorders''' or '''speech impediments''' are a type of [[communication disorder]] where 'normal' [[Manner of articulation|speech]] is disrupted. This can mean [[stuttering]], [[lisp (speech)|lisps]], etc. Someone who is unable to speak due to a speech disorder is considered [[muteness|mute]].&lt;ref name="Kennison 2014"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Kennison | first1 = Shelia M. | title = Introduction to language development | date = 2014 | publisher = SAGE  | location = Malaysia  | isbn = 978-1-4129-9606-8 | oclc = 830837502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Classifying speech into normal and disordered is more problematic than it first seems. By a strict classification,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} only 5% to 10% of the population has a completely normal manner of speaking (with respect to all parameters) and healthy voice; all others suffer from one disorder or another.

There are three different levels of classification when determining the magnitude and type of a speech disorders and the proper treatment or therapy:&lt;ref&gt;Deputy, Paul; ''Human Communication Disorders''; March 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
# Sounds the patient can produce
## Phonemic – can be produced easily; used meaningfully and constructively
## Phonetic – produced only upon request; not used consistently, meaningfully, or constructively; not used in connected speech
# Stimulate sounds
## Easily stimulated
## Stimulate after demonstration and probing (i.e. with a tongue depressor)
# Cannot produce the sound
## Cannot be produced voluntarily
## No production ever observed

===Types of disorder===
* [[Apraxia of speech]] may result from stroke or progressive illness, and involves inconsistent production of speech sounds and rearranging of sounds in a word ("potato" may become "topato" and next "totapo"). Production of words becomes more difficult with effort, but common phrases may sometimes be spoken spontaneously without effort.
* [[Cluttering]], a speech and fluency disorder characterized primarily by a rapid rate of speech, which makes speech difficult to understand.
* [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]] also known as childhood apraxia of speech. 
* [[Dysarthria]] is a weakness or paralysis of speech muscles caused by damage to the nerves or brain. Dysarthria is often caused by [[stroke]]s, [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]], head or neck injuries, surgical accident, or [[cerebral palsy]].
* [[Dysprosody]] is the rarest neurological speech disorder. It is characterized by alterations in intensity, in the timing of utterance segments, and in rhythm, cadence, and intonation of words. The changes to the duration, the [[fundamental frequency]], and the intensity of tonic and atonic syllables of the sentences spoken, deprive an individual's particular speech of its characteristics. The cause of dysprosody is usually associated with neurological pathologies such as [[brain vascular accident]]s, cranioencephalic traumatisms, and [[brain tumor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pinto JA, Corso RJ, Guilherme AC, Pinho SR, Nóbrega Mde O |title=Dysprosody nonassociated with neurological diseases--a case report |journal=J Voice |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=90–6 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15070228 |doi= 10.1016/j.jvoice.2003.07.005|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Muteness]] is complete inability to speak.
* [[Speech sound disorder]]s involve difficulty in producing specific speech sounds (most often certain consonants, such as /s/ or /r/), and are subdivided into [[Speech-Language Pathology in School Settings#Articulation disorders|articulation disorders]] (also called phonetic disorders) and [[Speech sound disorder#Phonemic Disorders|phonemic disorders]]. Articulation disorders are characterized by difficulty learning to produce sounds physically. Phonemic disorders are characterized by difficulty in learning the sound distinctions of a language, so that one sound may be used in place of many. However, it is not uncommon for a single person to have a mixed speech sound disorder with both phonemic and phonetic components.
*[[Stuttering]] affects approximately 1% of the adult population.&lt;ref name="Kennison 2014"/&gt;
* [[Voice disorders]] are impairments, often physical, that involve the function of the [[larynx]] or vocal resonance.

==Causes==
In most cases the cause is unknown. However, there are various known causes of speech impediments, such as "[[hearing loss]], [[neurological disorder]]s, [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]], [[intellectual disability]], [[drug abuse]], physical impairments such as [[cleft lip and palate]], and vocal abuse or misuse."&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;"Disability Info: Speech and Language Disorders Fact Sheet (FS11)." National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities. http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs11txt.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
{{Globalize|date=December 2009}}
Many of these types of disorders can be treated by [[speech therapy]], but others require medical attention by a doctor in [[phoniatrics]]. Other treatments include correction of organic conditions and [[psychotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Speech Defect." Encyclopedia.com. http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-speechde.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, school-age children with a speech disorder are often placed in [[special education]] programs. Children who struggle to learn to talk often experience persistent communication difficulties in addition to academic struggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Scott G. G. |author2=O'Donnell P. J. |author3=Sereno S. C. | year = 2012 | title = Emotion words affect eye fixations during reading | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = | issue = | page = | doi = 10.1037/a0027209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 700,000 of the students served in the public schools’ special education programs in the 2000-2001 school year were categorized as having a speech or language impediment. This estimate does not include children who have [[speech and language impairment]]s secondary to other conditions such as deafness".&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; Many [[school district]]s provide the students with speech therapy during school hours, although extended day and summer services may be appropriate under certain circumstances.

Patients will be treated in teams, depending on the type of disorder they have. A team can include SLPs, specialists, family doctors, teachers, and family members.

==Social effects==
Suffering from a speech disorder can have negative social effects, especially among young children. Those with a speech disorder can be targets of [[bullying]] because of their disorder. The bullying can result in decreased [[self-esteem]].

==Language disorders==

[[Language disorder]]s are usually considered distinct from speech disorders, even though they are often used synonymously.

Speech disorders refer to problems in producing the sounds of speech or with the quality of voice, where language disorders are usually an impairment of either understanding words or being able to use words and do not have to do with speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs11txt.htm|title=NICHCY’s New Home|work=nichcy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Standard Macedonian''' or '''Literary Macedonian'''&lt;ref&gt;Victor Freidman. "Macedonian", (2001) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-mk|Книжевен македонски јазик}} or Македонски литературен јазик)&lt;ref&gt;Transliterated, ''Kniževen makedonski jazik''. Also, "Литературен македонски јазик" (''Literaturen makedonski jazik'').&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Standard language|standard]] [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the [[Macedonian language]] and [[official language]] of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] used as a [[Literary language|written language]], in formal contexts, and for communication between different [[Isogloss|dialect areas]]. Several [[prestige dialect]]s have developed around the major urban centers of [[Skopje]], [[Bitola]], [[Veles (city)|Veles]] and [[Prilep]].

It was only in the 1940s, however, that the Macedonian language was able to be implemented, after being formally declared the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]]. The rapid pace at which the standardization process took place was in part owing to an already existing interdialect (see [[Spoken Macedonian]]). The standard language is [[Macedonian phonology|phonologically]] and [[Macedonian grammar|morphologically]] based on the central [[Western Macedonian dialects]] (in particular, the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect|Prilep-Bitola]] and [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]) with its [[lexicon]] influenced by all [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|Macedonian dialects]].

Educated speakers will usually use, or aim to use, the formal standard in public settings and in most forms of [[written language]]. Probably the best exemplars of this type of speech, though not always the case, are [[actors]], [[teachers]] and writers. A high degree of [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|social prestige]] and [[respect]] is assigned to those who correctly use the standard language in the appropriate situations. In extremely rare examples, some speakers will use the formal code exclusively in everyday conversational speech.

While acquisition of the formal code constitutes a significant part of elementary education, during which children are taught the relationship between their local dialect and the target code, the formal [[literary language]]. Most educated speakers [[Code-switching|switch]] to the colloquial register of the standard language, [[Spoken Macedonian]], when communicating in less formal circumstances, but tend to aim for more formal usage in circumstances where educated speakers are present or as a sort of "[[Ausbausprache - Abstandsprache - Dachsprache#Dachsprache|interdialect]]" in the case where the company is not exclusively local.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4047">'''Theomatics''' is a [[numerology|numerological]] study of the [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]]/[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]] text of the [[Christian]] [[Bible]], based upon [[gematria]] and [[isopsephia]], by which its proponents claim to show the direct intervention of [[God]] in the writing of Christian scripture.

== Etymology ==
The term "theomatics" was coined by [[Del Washburn]] in 1976 as a [[portmanteau|combination]] of "[[Wiktionary:Θεός|Θεός]]" ("God") and "[[Wiktionary:mathematics|mathematics]]". Washburn wrote three books about theomatics&lt;ref&gt;The three books are:
*{{cite book|author=[[Jerry Lucas]] and Del Washburn|title=Theomatics: God's Best Kept Secret Revealed|year=1986|publisher=[[Stein &amp; Day]] Pub|isbn=0-8128-6017-9}}
*{{cite book|author=Del Washburn|title=Theomatics II : God's Best-Kept Secret Revealed|year=1994|publisher=Scarborough House|isbn=0-8128-4023-2}}
*{{cite book|author=Del Washburn|title=The Original CODE in the BIBLE|year=1994|publisher=Madison Books|isbn=1-56833-115-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created a website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Del Washburn|url=http://www.theomatics.com/theomatics/whatis.html|title=What is Theomatics?|accessdate=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; espousing the hypothesis.

== Methodology ==
Theomatics is not the same thing as [[Bible code]]; it uses an entirely different technique. The Bible code (also called ELS for Equidistant Letter Sequences) uses a letter skipping technique. Theomatics, on the other hand, is based on [[gematria]] and [[isopsephia]], systems which assign numerical values to letters in the ancient Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek alphabets.

== Controversy ==
An analysis and criticism of theomatics has been published by
Tim Hayes, previously under the pseudonym "A. B. Leever". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Tim|title=ABLEEVER|url=http://www.ableever.net/|accessdate=8 January 2014|quote="I am Tim Hayes, "a believer" in Jesus Christ, whom I know and love."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Tim|url=http://www.ableever.net/Apologetics/Theomatics/theomatics.html|title=Theomatics|accessdate=October 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German statistician, Kurt Fettelschoss, published an analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kurt Fettelschoss|url=http://www.theomatics.net/contents.html|title=Table of Contents|work=Theomatics|accessdate=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; that claims that "The observed quantity of theomatic hits is significantly not random".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kurt Fettelschoss |url=http://theomatics.net/cover.html |title=Cover letter |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |accessdate=2006-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928091625/http://theomatics.net/cover.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; A response to the findings was posted by Tim Hayes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Tim|url=http://www.ableever.net/Apologetics/Theomatics/Theom-Lk15/Theom-Lk15-Response/theom-lk15-response.html|title=Response to Fettelschoss|accessdate=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by [[Russell Glasser]], entitled "Theomatics Debunked",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Russell Glasser|url=http://www.apollowebworks.com/atheism/theomatics.html|title=Theomatics Debunked|accessdate=October 10, 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029130554/http://www.apollowebworks.com/atheism/theomatics.html|archivedate=October 29, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the same phenomenon in a secular text.

Washburn's website has a page entitled "Scientific Proof"&lt;ref name="proof"&gt;{{cite web | author=el Washburn|url=http://www.theomatics.com/theomatics/proof.html|title=Scientific Proof of the Discovery|accessdate=2005-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which discusses and responds to potential arguments against theomatics.

A '''truth claim''' is a proposition or statement that a particular person or [[belief system]] holds to be true. The term is commonly used in philosophy in discussions of [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], and [[epistemology]], particularly when discussing the [[Doctrine|doctrinal]] statements of religions; however, it is also used when discussing non-religious [[Ideology|ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=people of every religion, as well as of no religion, have a reason for wanting it to be possible to face other people with challenges to their faith, namely that this is the only way those people can be brought to see the truth.|author1=Michael Herz|author2=Peter Molnar|title=The Content and Context of Hate Speech: Rethinking Regulation and Responses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KC0gAwAAQBAJ|date=9 April 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-37561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Positive and negative ===
A major division of truth claims is that between positive and negative truth claims. Positive truth claims proclaim the existence of an object or [[entity]]. Negative truth claims, which are the opposite of truth claims, proclaim the non-existence of an object or [[entity]].

== Religions ==
{{anchor|In religion}}
Some religions make strong [[Absolute truth|absolutist]] truth claims about the [[Laws of science|laws of nature]] and [[human nature]] while others make [[Relativism|relativist]] or [[Universalism|universalist]] truth claims.

===Hinduism===
{{anchor|Hindu}}
In the post-modern period Hinduism is generally known to be Universalist and accepts
all other religions to be true and valid. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] is credited to be the original proponent. However, this seems to be true from a socio-political perspective, since Hinduism itself is a congregation of large numbers of individual sects and peoples that have long lived in harmony among themselves without persecuting each other. But if one goes into what is in the scriptures of
more organised Hindu sects like Vedanta; we do find exclusive truth claims.

Bhagavad Gita says -

''ye me matamidaM nityamanutishhThanti maanavaaH .&lt;br /&gt;''
''shraddhaavanto.anasuuyanto muchyante te.api karmabhiH .. 3.31''

Those who continuously practice what I preach they will be freed from Karma.

''ye tvetadabhyasuuyanto naanutishhThanti me matam.h .&lt;br /&gt;''
''sarvaGYaanavimuuDhaa.nstaanviddhi nashhTaanachetasaH .. 3.32''

But those who, out of envy, disregard these teachings and do not practice them regularly, are to be considered bereft of all knowledge, befooled, and doomed to ignorance and bondage.

A Hindu is expected to examine a truth claim based on his intellect. He can add or improve upon the vast ocean of Hindu philosophy. This is unlike religions such as [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], where, because of the truth claim is endowed as infallible, a contradiction of single verse is a contradiction of the entire claim.

Traditionally Hinduism (more specifically Vedanta) considers itself to be eternal religion (Sanatana Dharma).  Fundamental belief is that all beings are divine, that the human condition is one of ignorance to not recognize this divinity inside, and that direct experience of God is achievable for all human beings.

== Science ==
{{Main|Philosophy of science}}
It has been debated as to whether science makes any truth claims of its own, or if it is a set of [[Scientific method|methods]] for evaluating or [[Falsifiability|falsifying]] other truth claims.

=== Agnosticism ===
Agnosticism makes the claim that the existence or non-existence of any deity is unknown and possibly unknowable.  This is a claim about what we can or do know, not a metaphysical claim as to the nature of the world.

===Atheism===
{{Main|Negative and positive atheism}}
The truth claims of atheism are divided between negative atheism, which does not accept the positive truth claims of religions, and positive atheism, which specifically claims the non-existence of deities (and other spiritual phenomena).

A '''universal translator''' is a device common to many [[science fiction]] works, especially on television. First described in [[Murray Leinster]]'s 1945 [[novella]] "[[First Contact (novelette)|First Contact]]",&lt;ref&gt;"Hic Rhodus, His Salta" by [[Robert Silverberg]], [[Asimov's Science Fiction]], January 2009, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the translator's purpose is to offer an instant [[translation]] of any [[language]]. Technology companies are striving to develop a practical "universal" translator for common use.{{cn|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iamili.com/index.html|title=ili - The world's fastest offline translator for travelers|website=iamili.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a convention, it is used to remove the problem of translating between [[alien language]]s, unless that problem is essential to the plot. To translate a new language in every episode when a new species or culture is encountered would consume time (especially when most of these shows have a half-hour or one-hour format) normally allotted for plot development and would potentially, across many episodes, become repetitive to the point of annoyance. Occasionally, alien races can extrapolate the [[English grammar|rules of English]] from little speech and then immediately be fluent in it, making the translator unnecessary.

While a ''universal'' translator seems unlikely, due to the apparent need for telepathy, scientists continue to work towards similar real-world technologies involving small numbers of known languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =  | title  = 'Tower of Babel' translator made | date = 2006-10-25 | work = [[BBC News]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6083994.stm | accessdate = 2008-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
As a rule, a universal translator is instantaneous, but if that language has never been recorded, there is sometimes a time delay until the translator can properly work out a translation, as is true of ''[[Star Trek]]''. Some writers seek greater plausibility by instead having computer translation that requires collecting a database of the new language, often by listening to radio transmissions.

The existence of a universal translator is sometimes problematic in film and television productions from a logical perspective (for example, aliens who still speak English when no universal translator is in evidence and all characters appear to hear the appropriately translated speech instead of the original speech, the ability to speak in the language when direct translation is possible), and requires some [[suspension of disbelief]] when characters' mouths move in sync with the translated words and not the original language; nonetheless, it removes the need for cumbersome and potentially extensive subtitles, and it eliminates the rather unlikely supposition that every other race in the galaxy has gone to the trouble of learning English.

== Fictional depictions ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}

===''Doctor Who''===
Using a [[telepathy|telepathic field]], the [[TARDIS]] automatically translates most comprehensible languages (written and spoken) into a language understood by its pilot and each of the crew members. The field also translates what they say into a language appropriate for that time and location (e.g., speaking the appropriate dialect of [[Latin]] when in ancient [[Rome]]). This system has frequently been featured as a main part of the show. The TARDIS, and by extension a number of its major systems, including the translator, are telepathically linked to its pilot, [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]].  None of these systems appear able to function reliably when the Doctor is incapacitated.  In "[[The Fires of Pompeii]]", when companion Donna Noble attempts to speak the local language directly, her words are humorously rendered into what sounds to a local like Welsh. One flaw of this translation process is that if the language that a word is being translated into does not have a concept for it, e.g, the Romans don't have a word or a general understanding of "volcano" as Mt. Vesuvius has not erupted yet.

===''Farscape''===
On the TV show ''[[Farscape]]'', John Crichton is injected with bacteria called translator microbes which function as a sort of universal translator. The microbes colonize the host's brainstem and translate anything spoken to the host, passing along the translated information to the host's brain.  This does not enable the injected person to speak other languages; they continue to speak their own language and are only understood by others as long as the listeners possess the microbes. The microbes sometimes fail to properly translate slang, translating it literally. Also, the translator microbes cannot translate the natural language of the alien Pilots or Diagnosans because every word in their language can contain thousands of meanings, far too many for the microbes to translate; thus Pilots must learn to speak in "simple sentences", while Diagnosans require interpreters. The implanted can learn to speak new languages if they want or to make communicating with non-injected individuals possible.  The crew of [[Moya (Farscape)|Moya]] learned English from Crichton, thereby being able to communicate with the non-implanted populace when the crew visited Earth. Some species, such as the [[List of races in Farscape#Kalish|Kalish]], cannot use translator microbes because their body rejects them, so they must learn a new language through their own efforts.

===''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''===
{{further|List of races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Babel fish}}

In the universe of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', universal translation is made possible by a small fish called a "babel fish". The fish is inserted into the auditory canal where it feeds off the mental frequencies of those speaking to its host. In turn it excretes a translation into the brain of its host.

The book remarks that, by allowing everyone to understand each other, the babel fish has caused more wars than anything else in the universe.

The book also explains that the babel fish could not possibly have developed naturally and therefore proves the existence of God as its creator, which in turn proves the non-existence of God. Since God needs faith to exist, and this proof dispels the need for faith, this therefore causes God to vanish "in a puff of logic".

===''Men in Black''===
The [[Men in Black (franchise)|''Men in Black'' franchise]] possess a universal translator, which, as [[Agent K]] explains in the first film, [[Men in Black (1997 film)|''Men in Black'']], they are not allowed to have because "human thought is so primitive, it's looked upon as an infectious disease in other galaxies."

===''Neuromancer''===
In [[William Gibson]]'s novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'', along with the other novels in his [[Sprawl trilogy]], ''[[Count Zero]]'' and ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'', devices known as "microsofts" are small chips plugged into "wetware" sockets installed behind the user's ear, giving them certain knowledge and/or skills as long as they are plugged in, such as the ability to speak another language.  (The name is a combination of the words "micro" and "soft", and is not named after the software firm [[Microsoft]].)

===''Star Control''===
In the ''[[Star Control]]'' computer game series, almost all races are implied to have universal translators; however, discrepancies between the ways aliens choose to translate themselves sometimes crop up and complicate communications. The [[VUX]], for instance, are cited as having uniquely advanced skills in linguistics and can translate human language long before humans are capable of doing the same to the VUX. This created a problem during the first contact between Vux and humans, in a starship commanded by Captain Rand. According to ''[[Star control#Star Control|Star Control: Great Battles of the Ur-Quan Conflict]]'', Captain Rand is referred to as saying "That is one ugly sucker" when the image of a VUX first came onto his viewscreen. However, in ''[[Star Control II#Star Control II|Star Control II]]'', Captain Rand is referred to as saying "That is the ugliest freak-face I've ever seen" to his first officer, along with joking that the VUX name stands for Very Ugly Xenoform. It is debatable which source is canon. Whichever the remark, it is implied that the VUX's advanced Universal Translator technologies conveyed the exact meaning of Captain Rand's words. The effete VUX used the insult as an excuse for hostility toward humans.

Also, a new race called the [[Orz (Star Control)|Orz]] was introduced in ''Star Control II''. They presumably come from another dimension, and at first contact, the ship's computer says that there are many vocal anomalies in their language resulting from their referring to concepts or phenomena for which there are no equivalents in human language. The result is dialogue that is a patchwork of ordinary words and phrases marked with *asterisk pairs* indicating that they are loose translations of unique Orz concepts into human language, a full translation of which would probably require paragraph-long definitions. (For instance, the Orz refer to the human dimension as *heavy space* and their own as *Pretty Space*, to various categories of races as *happy campers* or *silly cows*, and so on.)

In the other direction, the [[Supox]] are a race portrayed as attempting to mimic as many aspects of other races' language and culture as possible when speaking to them, to the point of referring to their own planet as “[[Earth]],” also leading to confusion.

In ''Star Control III'', the [[K'tang|K’tang]] are portrayed as an intellectually inferior species using advanced technology they do not fully understand to intimidate people, perhaps explaining why their translators’ output is littered with misspellings and nonstandard usages of words, like threatening to “crushify” the player. Along the same lines, the [[Daktaklakpak]] dialogue is highly stilted and contains many numbers and mathematical expressions, implying that, as a mechanical race, their thought processes are inherently too different from humans’ to be directly translated into human language.

===''Stargate''===
In the television shows ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', there are no personal translation devices used, and most alien and Human cultures on other planets speak English. The makers of the show have themselves admitted this on the main ''SG-1'' site, stating that this is to save spending ten minutes an episode on characters learning a new language (early episodes of ''SG-1'' revealed the difficulties of attempting to write such processes into the plot). In the season 8 finale of ''SG-1'', “[[Moebius (Stargate SG-1)|Moebius (Part II)]],” the characters go back in time to 3000 B.C. and one of them teaches English to the people there.

A notable exception to this rule are the [[Goa'uld|Goa’uld]], who occasionally speak [[Goa'uld language|their own language]] amongst themselves or when giving orders to their [[Jaffa]]. This is never subtitled, but occasionally a translation is given by a third character (usually [[Teal'c|Teal’c]] or [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]]), ostensibly for the benefit of the human characters nearby who do not speak Goa’uld.  The [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] are also shown having their own language (apparently related to the [[Old Norse|Norse languages]]), although it is English played backwards. (See [[Asgard (Stargate)#Hermiod|Hermiod]]).

In contrast a major plot element of the original [[Stargate (film)|''Stargate'']] film was that Daniel Jackson had to learn the language of the people of [[Abydos (Stargate)|Abydos]] in the common way, which turned out to be derived from [[ancient Egypt]]ian. The language had been extinct on Earth for many millennia, but Jackson eventually realized that it was merely errors in pronunciation that prevented effective communication.

===''Star Trek''===
In ''[[Star Trek]]'', the universal translator was used by [[Ensign (Star Trek)|Ensign]] [[Hoshi Sato]], the communications officer on the ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' in ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', to invent the linguacode matrix. It was supposedly first used in the late 22nd century on Earth for the instant translation of well-known Earth languages. Gradually, with the removal of language barriers, Earth's disparate cultures came to terms of universal peace. Translations of previously unknown languages, such as those of aliens, required more difficulties to be overcome. Like most other common forms of ''Star Trek'' technology (warp drive, transporters, etc.), the universal translator was probably developed independently on several worlds as an inevitable requirement of space travel; certainly the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]] had no difficulty communicating with humans upon making "[[Star Trek: First Contact|first contact]]" (although the Vulcans could have learned [[Standard English]] from monitoring Earth radio transmissions). The Vulcan ship that landed during [[first contact (science fiction)|First Contact]] was a survey vessel. The Vulcans had been surveying the humans for over a hundred years, when first contact actually occurred to T'Pol's great-grandmother, T'mir, in the episode "[[Carbon Creek (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Carbon Creek]]"; however, in ''Star Trek First Contact'' it is implied that they learned English by surveying the planets in the Solar System. Deanna Troi mentions the Vulcans have no interest in Earth as it is "too primitive", but the [[Prime Directive]] states not to interfere with pre-Warp species. The Vulcans only noticed the warp trail and came to investigate.

Improbably, the universal translator has been successfully used to interpret non-biological lifeform communication (in the ''Original Series'' episode "[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Metamorphosis]]"). In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (''TNG'') episode "[[The Ensigns of Command]]", the translator proved ineffective with the language of the [[Sheliak]]s, so the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] had to depend on the aliens' interpretation of Earth languages. It is speculated that the Sheliak communicate amongst themselves in extremely complex [[legalese]]. The ''TNG'' episode "[[Darmok]]" also illustrates another instance where the universal translator proves ineffective and unintelligible, because the Tamarian language is too deeply rooted in local [[metaphor]].

Unlike virtually every other form of Federation technology, universal translators almost never break down. Although they were clearly in widespread use during [[Captain (Star Trek)|Captain]] [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]]'s time (inasmuch as the crew regularly communicated with species who could not conceivably have knowledge of Standard English), it is unclear where they were carried on personnel of that era.

The episode "[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Metamorphosis]]" was the only time in which the device was actually seen. In the episode "[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]" the Metrons supply Captain Kirk and the Gorn commander with a Translator-Communicator, allowing conversation between them to be possible. During Kirk's era, they were also apparently less perfect in their translations into [[Klingon language|Klingon]]. In the [[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|sixth ''Star Trek'' film]], the characters are seen relying on print books in order to communicate with a Klingon military ship, since [[Pavel Chekov|Chekov]] said that the Klingons would recognize the use of a Translator. Actress [[Nichelle Nichols]] reportedly protested this scene, as she felt that [[Uhura]], as communications officer during what was effectively a cold war, would be trained in [[fluency|fluent]] Klingon to aid in such situations. In that same movie during the trial scene of Kirk and McCoy before a Klingon judiciary, the Captain and the Doctor are holding communication devices while a Klingon (played by Todd Bryant) translates for them. The novelization of that movie provided a different reason for the use of books: sabotage by somebody working on the Starfleet side of the conspiracy uncovered by the crew in the story, but the novelization is not part of the [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]].

By the 24th century, universal translators are built into the communicator pins worn by [[Starfleet]] personnel, although there were instances when crew members (such as [[William Riker|Riker]] in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' episode "[[First Contact (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|First Contact]]") spoke to newly encountered aliens even when deprived of their communicators. In the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[The 37's (Star Trek: Voyager)|The 37's]]" the device apparently works among intra-species languages as well; after the ''Voyager'' crew discovers and revives eight humans abducted in 1937 (including [[Amelia Earhart]] and [[Fred Noonan]]) and held in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] since then, a Japanese Army officer expresses surprise that an Ohio farmer is apparently speaking Japanese, while the farmer is equally surprised to hear the soldier speaking English (the audience hears them all speaking English only, however). Certain Starfleet programs, such as the Emergency Medical Hologram, have universal translators encoded into the programming.

The ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' says that the universal translator is an "extremely sophisticated computer program" which functions by "analyzing the patterns" of an unknown foreign language, starting from a speech sample of two or more speakers in conversation. The more extensive the conversational sample, the more accurate and reliable is the "translation matrix", enabling instantaneous conversion of verbal utterances or written text between the alien language and American English / Federation Standard.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda, ''Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual (introduction by Gene Roddenberry)'', p. 101. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', we see a [[Cardassian]] universal translator at work. It takes some time to process an alien language, whose speakers are initially not understandable but as they continue speaking, the computer gradually learns their language and renders it into Standard English (also known as Federation Standard).

[[Ferengi]] customarily wear their universal translators as an implant in their ears. In the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (''DS9'') episode "[[Little Green Men (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Little Green Men]]", in which the show's regular Ferengi accidentally become the [[Roswell UFO incident|three aliens in Roswell]], the humans without translators are unable to understand the Ferengi (who likewise can not understand the English spoken by the human observers) until the Ferengi get their own translators working. Similarly, throughout all ''Trek'' series, a universal translator possessed by only one party can audibly broadcast the results within a limited range, enabling communication between two or more parties, all speaking different languages. The devices appear to be standard equipment on starships and space stations, where a communicator pin would therefore presumably not be strictly necessary.

Since the Universal Translator presumably does not physically affect the process by which the user's vocal cords (or alien equivalent) forms audible speech (i.e. the user is nonetheless speaking in his/her/its own language regardless of the listener's language), the listener apparently hears only the speaker's translated words and not the alien language that the speaker is actually, physically articulating; the unfamiliar oratory is therefore not only translated but somehow replaced. The universal translator is often used in cases of contact with pre-warp societies such as in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Who Watches the Watchers]]", and its detection could conceivably lead to a violation of the Prime Directive. Therefore, logically there must be some mechanism by which the lips of the speaker are perceived to be in sync with the words spoken. No explanation of the mechanics of this function appears to have been provided, the viewer is required to suspend disbelief enough to overcome the apparent limitation.

{{Contradicts other|date=June 2012|1=Machine translation}}
[[Microsoft]] is developing its own translation technology, for incorporation into many of their software products and services. Most notably this includes real time translation of video calls with [[Skype Translator]]. As of October 2015, [[Microsoft Translator]] supports over 50 languages and can translate video calls between English, French, German, Chinese (Mandarin), Italian, and Spanish.

In 2015, [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ms.blabber.messenger Blabber Messenger] was developed – a speech translator for 23 languages.

SpeechGear, a Minnesota company, has produced a stand-alone speech translator called Compadre and a web-based translator called Streamer (www.streamer.center).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/one-step-closer-to-a-universal-translator/ |first=Michelle |last=Thatcher |date=January 10, 2008 |title=One step closer to a universal translator |work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Google]] announced that it was developing a translator. Using a voice recognition system and a database, a robotic voice will recite the translation in the desired language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | author = | title  = Google's Next Venture: Universal Translator  | date = 2010-02-08  | work = PC World  | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/188777  | accessdate = 2010-02-08  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Google's stated aim is to translate the entire world's information. Roya Soleimani, a spokesperson for Google, said during a 2013 interview demonstrating the translation app on a smartphone, "You can have access to the world's languages right in your pocket... The goal is to become that ultimate Star Trek computer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | author = Alison van Diggelen  | title  = From Babel to Star Trek: The Quest for Translation  | date = 2013-08-05  | work = KQED  | url = http://www.californiareport.org/archive/R201308050850/b#sthash.sib90ihU.dpuf  | accessdate = 2013-10-02  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[United States Army]] has also developed a two-way translator for use in Iraq.  TRANSTAC (Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use), though, only focuses on Arabic-English translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | author = Lucian Dorneanu  | title  = US Army Develops Automatic Translators for Iraq Soldiers  | date = 2007-07-24  | work = Softpedia  | url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/US-Army-Wants-Automatic-Translators-for-Iraq-Soldiers-60817.shtml  | accessdate = 2010-02-08  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The United States Army has scrapped the TRANSTAC Program and is developing in conjunction with DARPA, the BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) in its place.

In February 2010, a communications software called VoxOx launched a two-way translator service for instant messaging, SMS, email and social media titled the VoxOx Universal Translator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title  = VoxOx Adds Native Translation to Differentiate from Skype, Google Voice  | author = Clint Boulton  | date = 2010-02-16  | url = http://www.eweek.com/c/a/VOIP-and-Telephony/VoxOx-Adds-Native-Translation-to-Differentiate-From-Skype-Google-Voice-575273/  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It enables two people to communicate instantly with each other while both typing in their native languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title  = VoxOx Real-Time Language Translation For SMS/Chat/Email/Twitter Makes You Fluent Across the Globe  | author = Brian Barrett  | date = 2010-02-16  | url = https://gizmodo.com/5472968/voxox-real+time-language-translation-for-smschatemailtwitter-makes-you-fluent-across-the-globe  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Specimen by William Caslon.jpg|thumb|right|''A Specimen'' of [[typeset]] [[font]]s and languages, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''.]]

A '''written language''' is the representation of a spoken or gestural [[language]] by means of a [[writing system]]. Written language is an [[invention]] in that it must be taught to children, who will pick up [[spoken language]] ([[oral language|oral]] or [[sign language|sign]]) by exposure even if they are not specifically taught.

A written language exists only as a complement to a specific spoken language, and no [[natural language]] is purely written.

==Compared to spoken language==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
Written languages change more slowly than corresponding spoken languages. When at least one [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of a language is strongly divergent from spoken language, the resulting situation is called [[diglossia]]. However, that is still often considered as one language, between [[literary language]] and other registers, especially if the [[writing system]] reflects its [[pronunciation]].

Native readers and writers of [[English language|English]] are often unaware that the complexities of [[English spelling]] make written English a somewhat artificial construct. The traditional spelling of English, at least for inherited words, preserves a late [[Middle English]] [[phonology]] that is never used as a speech dialect. The artificial preservation of that form of the language, in writing, might make much of what is now written intelligibly to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1343–1400) even if the medieval writer's speech could no longer be understood{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}.
