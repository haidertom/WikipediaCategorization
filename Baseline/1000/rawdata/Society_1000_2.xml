      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16583">The '''2010 gang rapes in Cleveland, Texas''' were a series of acts of [[sexual violence]] committed by a group of adult men and teenage boys on an [[Minor (law)#United States|underage]] girl in the town of [[ Cleveland, Texas|Cleveland]], in [[Texas]], USA.
==Background==
The victim was the 11-year old daughter of [[Mexicans|Mexican]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]], living in [[Cleveland, Texas]], a "timber town"&lt;ref name=worst&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jarboe Russell|first1=Jan|date=July 2011 |title=The Worst Hard Time |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-worst-hard-time/ |dead-url=no |work=[[Texas Monthly]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of about nine thousand people in the  [[Greater Houston]] metropolitan area and [[Liberty County, Texas|Liberty&amp;nbsp;County]]. Her father was a former [[construction worker]], unemployed at the time for a year and a half because of a back injury, while her mother was working making change in a [[Slot machine|slot game room]].&lt;ref name=gq/&gt;

The group of perpetrators included students at the local high school, two of whom were members of the basketball team and one the son of a school-board member, and persons with [[criminal record]]s, from [[Recreational drug use|selling drug]]s to [[robbery]] and, in one case, [[manslaughter]]. They ranged from [[Middle_school#United_States|middle school]]ers to one 27-year-old, at the time of the crime.&lt;ref name=vicious&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKinley|first1=James C. |date=8 March 2011 |title=Vicious Assault Shakes Texas Town |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/us/09assault.html?hp |dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Discovery==
On the Monday after [[Thanksgiving]] day, on 29 November 2010, a [[cell phone]] [[video clip]] with images of the sexual encounter between a group of males and a young female circulated in the cafeteria of Cleveland's high school. Some viewers recognized the girl as a [[Sixth grade#United States|6th grade]]r from the middle school next door.&lt;ref name=gq&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dobie|first1=Kathie |date=6 September 2011 |title=The Girl from Trails End|url=https://www.gq.com/story/texas-gang-rape-11-year-old-girl-story|dead-url=no |work=[[GQ]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of the girl told a teacher what he had seen in the cell-phone video, as a school-district spokeswoman subsequently stated, and the police were alerted.&lt;ref name=sloppy&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams|first1=Mary Elizabeth |date=9 March 2011 |title=The New York Times’ sloppy, slanted child rape story |url=https://www.salon.com/2011/03/09/new_york_times_blames_11_year_old_rape_victim/|dead-url=no |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arrested&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lozano|first1=Juan A. |date=9 March 2011 |title=18 arrested in assaults on 11-year-old Texas girl|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41993963/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/arrested-assaults--year-old-texas-girl/#.W7cNP2j7Tcu|dead-url=no |work=[[NBC News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Investigation==
Police investigators identified and contacted the girl, whereupon she stated that, over the 2010 Thanksgiving holiday break, she was raped by a group of young men first at a house and then in a [[mobile home]]. According to a [[search warrant]] [[affidavit]] obtained by the media, police determined the video clip was recorded inside an abandoned mobile home on the city's northern outskirts, next to a [[Baptist church]].&lt;ref name=arrested&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lozano|first1=Juan A. |date=9 March 2011 |title=18 arrested in assaults on 11-year-old Texas girl|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41993963/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/arrested-assaults--year-old-texas-girl/#.W7cNP2j7Tcu|dead-url=no |work=[[NBC News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the subsequent, criminal [[indictment]]s, the girl was assaulted on four separate occasions: the first in September, followed by three more throughout the fall of 2010. In January 2011, she was removed by [[social worker]]s from her parents' home and taken to [[foster care]].&lt;ref name=gq/&gt;

The investigation stirred [[Racism in the United States|racial tensions]] on account of the defendants all being [[African-American]]s and the girl [[Hispanic]],&lt;ref name=period&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hopper|first1=Jessica |date=18 March 2011 |title=Texas Girl Allegedly Gang Raped Over Three Month Period |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/cleveland-texas-girl-allegedly-raped-multiple-times-court/story?id=13167326|work=[[ABC News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both the town and nationwide.&lt;ref name=appear&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martinez|first1=Edecio |date=5 April 2011 |title=Cleveland, Texas gang rape suspects appear in court |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cleveland-texas-gang-rape-suspects-appear-in-court/|work=[[CBS News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was publicized nationwide in the States and also abroad.&lt;ref name=paris&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vely|first1=Yannick|date=9 March 2011 |title=Le Viol Collectif qui choque l’Amérique|url=https://www.parismatch.com/Actu/International/Le-viol-collectif-qui-choque-l-Amerique-146689|dead-url=no|language=French|trans-title=The Gang Rape that shocked America |work=[[Paris Match]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Freeman|first1=Hadley|author-link=Hadley Freeman|date=3 September 2013 |title=The painful lesson of the Cherice Moralez rape trial|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/03/painful-lesson-cherice-moralez-rape|dead-url=no |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 4 April 2011,  nineteen defendants appeared in the court of [[Liberty County, Texas|Liberty County]] district judge Mark Morefield for their [[arraignment]] hearing, with six of them pleading "not guilty."&lt;ref name=appear/&gt;

==Support for the accused==
The ''[[New York Times]]''' first report&lt;ref name=vicious/&gt; focused on the impact of the crime on the Cleveland community.&lt;ref group=note&gt;On the 8 March NYT article, a hospital worker, who said she knew several of the defendants, was quoted: “It’s just destroyed our community. These boys have to live with this the rest of their lives.” Also quoted was the spokeswoman for the Cleveland Independent School District: “It’s devastating, and it’s really tearing our community apart. I really wish that this could end in a better light.” There were also quotes from local people who questioned the attitude of the victim's family, such as a neighbor of her parents: "Where was her mother? What was her mother thinking?”&lt;/ref&gt; The report came under criticism for its alleged "sympathy" for the accused,&lt;ref name=mj&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCleland|first1=Mac |date=9 March 2011 |title=The New York Times’ Rape-Friendly Reporting|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/new-york-times-texas-rape/|dead-url=no |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amira|first1=Dan |date=11 March 2011 |title=A Lot of People in Cleveland, Texas, Blame 11-Year-Old for Being Raped|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/03/a_lot_of_people_in_cleveland_t.html|dead-url=no |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] ''magazine'' |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nation&gt;{{cite news |last1= Cobb|first1= William Jelani|author-link=William Jelani Cobb|date=29 March 2011 |title=Cleveland, Texas and Gender Jim Crow |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/03/a_lot_of_people_in_cleveland_t.html|dead-url=no |work=[[The Nation]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the point where the newspaper sent another reporter back at the place&lt;ref name=balance&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brisbane|first1=Arthur S.|date=11 March 2011 |title=Gang Rape Story Lacked Balance |url=https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/gang-rape-story-lacked-balance/?smid=fb-nytimes|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published a self-critical article.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The 11 March NYT article stated: "The outrage [against the previous NYT report] is understandable. The story dealt with a hideous crime but addressed concerns about the ruined lives of the perpetrators without acknowledging the obvious: concern for the victim. While the story appeared to focus on the community’s reaction to the crime, it was not enough to simply report that the community is principally concerned about the boys and men involved – as this story seems to do. If indeed that is the only sentiment to be found in this community...it becomes important to report... as well [of] voices of professional authorities or dissenting community members who will at least address, and not ignore, the plight of the young girl involved."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quanell X]], [[community leader]] and head of the [[New Black Panthers]], was an "outspoken critic" of the  victim. In a [[press conference]] in front of a Cleveland church, he [[rhetorical question|asked rhetorically]] where the girl's parents were when this happened and why was "that child experiencing so much sex with so many African-American men." He also disputed the rape claims since, as he put it, the girl never actually yelled the word "rape" during the assault and did not make an "outcry" until after footage of the assault surfaced.&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to the ''[[Houston Press]]'' 2014 report, Quanell X  claimed the investigation into the rape was being "run by the [[KKK]]" and stated to the [[African American]] community of the town: "We do not want someone with a malicious, racist motive to rid your community of an entire generation of black men."&lt;/ref&gt; The media reported that the audience "cheered and hollered in agreement."&lt;ref name=cheered&gt;{{cite news |last1=Leicht|first1=Angelica|date=19 December 2014 |title=Why Does Quanell X Support Some Rape Victims But Shame Others?|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/03/a_lot_of_people_in_cleveland_t.html|dead-url=no |work=[[Houston Press]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Florida]] [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] [[Kathleen Passidomo]] proposed that the state should step in and regulate the wardrobe of young girls.&lt;ref name=pasidomo&gt;{{cite news |last1=Linkins|first1=Jason|date=13 March 2011 |title=In Wake Of Texas Gang Rape, Florida Lawmaker Proposes School Dress Code Legislation|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/16/texas-gang-rape-aftermath-florida-law_n_836841.html|dead-url=no |work=[[Huffington Post]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasidomo referred to "an article about an 11 year old girl who was gang-raped in Texas by 18 young men because she was dressed like a 21-year-old [[prostitute]].”&lt;ref group=note&gt;Passidomo claimed that "it’s incumbent upon [the state] to create some areas where students can be safe in school and show up in proper attire, so what happened in Texas doesn’t happen to [Florida's] students.”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
In Texas, [[sexual assault]] against a [[Minor (law)#United States|person under 17 years of age]] is a second degree [[felony]], and [[aggravated sexual assault]] a first degree felony.&lt;ref name=texaslaw&gt;{{cite web |url=https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.22.htm|title=Penal Code - Title 5, Chapter 22: Assaultive Offenses|publisher=[[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] |date=October 2017 |website=|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, twenty-one persons were charged with crimes related to the gang rape.&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite news |date=21 September 2012 |title=Texas: Four Get 15-Year Sentences in Gang Rape of 11-Year-Old Girl|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/us/four-sentenced-in-gang-rape-of-11-year-old-texas-girl.html|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=Associated Press|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two adult males requested trials, and juries handed each defendant a 99-year prison sentence. Eleven other adult males pleaded guilty to the charges against them and received 15-year sentences in exchange. All seven juveniles entered guilty pleas and received seven-year [[Probation|probated prison-sentences]].&lt;ref name=final&gt;{{cite news |last=Horswell  |first=Cindy   |date=11 October 2013|title=21st assailant sentenced in Cleveland gang rape|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/21st-assailant-sentenced-in-Cleveland-gang-rape-4889262.php|dead-url=no |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |location= |archiveurl= |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twenty-first and last defendant pleaded guilty after a year long investigation whereby a [[DNA profiling|DNA specimen]] identified him as being at the [[crime scene]]. The defendant received a reduced seven-year sentence in exchange for pleading guilty to [[Indecent exposure|indecently exposing]] himself to a child. All defendants sentenced to prison would be [[Sex offender registry|registered]] as [[sex offender]]s for ten years after completing the sentence.&lt;ref name=final/&gt;

==Aftermath==
When the investigation started, the victim's family moved to another town after police detectives told the parents that they were in danger,&lt;ref name=nightmare&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKinley|first1=James C.|last2=Goode|first2=Erica |date=28 March 2011 |title=3-Month Nightmare Emerges in Rape Inquiry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/us/29texas.html |dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the  girl who was reported as raped was placed by the [[Child Protective Services]] in the care of the Girls' Haven in [[Beaumont, Texas]]. In December 2011, she ran away from the residential facility and was "on the streets for about a week," as the [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]] prosecutor stated. He revealed that, at some point, she met a 30-year-old male with a prior conviction as a drug dealer in [[Fort Bend County]], who subsequently assaulted her at his apartment in Beaumont. The assailant was arrested and pleaded guilty in September 2012 to aggravated sexual assault of a child in exchange for deferred [[probation]].&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite news |last=Horswell  |first=Cindy   |date=29 December 2012|title=Defendant in Cleveland gang rape case gets life sentence|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Defendant-in-Cleveland-gang-rape-case-gets-life-4073766.php|dead-url=no |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |location= |archiveurl= |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the girl revealed she was pregnant, allegedly from her "15-year old boyfriend," and that they would keep the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=|first=   |date=22 May 2013|title=Girl, 14, now pregnant — was victim at age 11 of repeated gang rape|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/girl-14-pregnant-victim-age-11-repeated-gang-rape-article-1.1351930|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Daily News]] |location= |archiveurl= |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil society can be understood as the "third sector" of society, distinct from government and business, and including the family and the private sphere.&lt;ref name=CSI&gt;[http://www.civilsoc.org/whatisCS.htm ''What is Civil Society''] civilsoc.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502111725/http://www.civilsoc.org/whatisCS.htm |date=2 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By other authors, "civil society" is used in the sense of 1) the aggregate of non-governmental organizations and institutions that manifest interests and will of citizens or 2) individuals and organizations in a society which are independent of the government.&lt;ref name=diccom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/civil+society?r=66|title=Civil society – Define Civil society at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term ''civil society'' is used in the more general sense of "the elements such as freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, etc, that make up a democratic society" (''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'').&lt;ref&gt;"Civil Society". ''[[Collins English Dictionary]] – Complete and Unabridged 11th Edition''. Retrieved 2 August 2012 from CollinsDictionary.com website: http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/civil-society&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the discussions among thinkers of Eastern and Central Europe, civil society is seen also as a normative concept of civic values.

==Etymology==
The term ''civil society'' goes back to [[Aristotle]]'s phrase ''koinōnía politikḗ'' (κοινωνία πολιτική), occurring in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', where it refers to a ‘political community’, commensurate with the Greek [[city-state]] (''polis'') characterized by a shared set of norms and [[ethos]], in which free citizens on an equal footing lived under the [[rule of law]]. The ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' or end of civil society, thus defined, was [[eudaimonia]] (τὸ εὖ ζῆν ''tò eu zēn'') (often translated as human flourishing or common well-being), in as man was defined as a ‘political (social) animal’ (ζῷον πολιτικόν ''zōon politikón'').&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'', Bk. 1 passim, esp. 1252a1–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Jean L. Cohen,''Civil Society and Political Theory,'' MIT Press, 1994 pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Blumenfeld ''The Political Paul: Democracy and Kingship in Paul's Thought,'' Sheffield Academic Press, 2001 pp. 45–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Davis,''The Politics of Philosophy: A Commentary on Aristotle's Politics,'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield 1996 pp. 15–32&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was used by Roman writers, such as [[Cicero]], where it referred to the ancient notion of a [[republic]] (''res publica''). It re-entered into Western political discourse following one of the late medieval translations of Aristotle’s ''Politics'' into Latin by [[Leonardo Bruni]] who as a first translated ''koinōnía politikḗ'' into ''societas civilis''. With the rise of a distinction between monarchical autonomy and public law, the term then gained currency to denote the corporate estates (''Ständestaat'') of a feudal elite of land-holders as opposed to the powers exercised by the prince.&lt;ref name="Cohen p.86"&gt;Jean L. Cohen,''Civil Society and Political Theory,'' MIT Press, 1994 p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a long history in state theory, and was revived with particular force in recent times, in Eastern Europe, where dissidents such as [[Václav Havel]] as late as in 1990's employed it to denote the sphere of civic associations threatened by the intrusive holistic state-dominated regimes of Communist Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick W. Powell,''The Politics of Civil Society: Neoliberalism Or Social Left?,'' Policy Press, 2007. pp. 119–20, 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The first post-modern usage of civil society as denoting political opposition stems from writings of [[Aleksander Smolar]] in 1978-79.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However the term was not in use by [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] labor union in 1980-1981 and was popularized on a global scale by communist propaganda only in 1989 as a tool of legitimation of neoliberal transformation. &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Democracy==
The literature on relations between civil society and democratic [[state (polity)|political society]] have their roots in [[classical liberal]] writings of [[G.W.F. Hegel]] from whom they were adapted by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref name="zaleski" /&gt; [[Karl Marx]], and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]]. They were developed in significant ways by 20th century researchers [[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]], who identified the role of political culture in a democratic order as vital.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Almond, G., &amp; Verba, S.; 'The Civic Culture: Political Attitudes And Democracy In Five Nations; 1989; Sage&lt;/ref&gt;

They argued that the political element of political organizations facilitates better awareness and a more informed citizenry, who make better voting choices, participate in politics, and hold government more accountable as a result.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The statutes of these organizations have often been considered micro-constitutions because they accustom participants to the formalities of democratic decision making.

More recently, [[Robert D. Putnam]] has argued that even non-political organizations in civil society are vital for democracy. This is because they build [[social capital]], trust and shared values, which are transferred into the political sphere and help to hold society together, facilitating an understanding of the interconnectedness of society and interests within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Robert D.

Others, however, have questioned how democratic civil society actually is.

==Constitutional economics==
[[Constitutional economics]] is a field of [[economics]] and [[constitutionalism]] which describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy including [[budget process]]. The term "constitutional economics" was used by American economist [[James M. Buchanan]] as a name for a new [[budget]] planning and the latter's [[transparency in government|transparency]] to the civil society, are of the primary guiding importance to the implementation of the [[rule of law]]. Also, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive [[Impoundment of appropriated funds|impoundment]] of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova.

[[File:Civil Brainbar (1).jpg|thumb|Civil lecture at Budapest Brainbar]]
Critics and activists currently often apply the term ''civil society'' to the domain of social life which needs to be protected against [[globalization]], and to the sources of resistance thereto, because it is seen as acting beyond boundaries and across different territories.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Michael; 1984; "The Autonomous Power of The State: Its Origins, Mechanisms and Results"; ''European Journal of Sociology'' 25: pp. 185–213&lt;/ref&gt; However, as civil society can, under many definitions, include and be funded and directed by those businesses and institutions (especially donors linked to European and Northern states) who support [[globalization]], this is a contested use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/partners/civil_society/home.htm|title=NGOs NGO civil society partnerships UN United Nations|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid development of civil society on the global scale after the fall of the communist system was a part of neo-liberal strategies linked to the [[Washington Consensus]].&lt;ref name="globall" /&gt; Some studies have also been published, which deal with unresolved issues regarding the use of the term in connection with the impact and conceptual power of the international aid system (see for example Tvedt 1998).

On the other hand, others see [[globalization]] as a social phenomenon expanding the sphere of [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] values, which inevitably led to a larger role for civil society at the expense of politically derived state institutions.

Civil Societies also have become involved in the environmental policy making process.  These groups impact the environmental policies by setting an agenda on fixing the harms done to the environment. They also get the public informed about environmental issues, which increases the public demand for environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dodge|first1=Jennifer|title=Civil society organizations and deliberative policy making: interpreting environmental controversies in the deliberative system|journal=Policy Sciences|date=5 June 2014|volume=47|issue=2|pages=161–185|doi=10.1007/s11077-014-9200-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
From a historical perspective, the actual meaning of the concept of civil society has changed twice from its original, classical form. The first change occurred after the French Revolution, the second during the fall of communism in Europe.

===Western antiquity===
The concept of civil society in its pre-modern [[classical republicanism|classical republican]] understanding is usually connected to the early-modern thought of [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century.  However, it has much older history in the realm of political thought. Generally, civil society has been referred to as a political association governing social conflict through the imposition of rules that restrain citizens from harming one another.&lt;ref name = "Ed6"&gt;Edwards 2004. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the classical period, the concept was used as a synonym for the good society, and seen as indistinguishable from the state. For instance, [[Socrates]] taught that conflicts within society should be resolved through public argument using ‘[[dialectic]]’, a form of rational dialogue to uncover truth. According to Socrates, public argument through ‘dialectic’ was imperative to ensure ‘civility’ in the polis and ‘good life’ of the people.&lt;ref name = "O'Connell"&gt;O'Connell 1999&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Plato]], the ideal state was a just society in which people dedicate themselves to the common good, practice civic virtues of wisdom, courage, moderation and justice, and perform the occupational role to which they were best suited. It was the duty of the ‘[[philosopher king]]’ to look after people in civility. [[Aristotle]] thought the polis was an ‘association of associations’ that enables citizens to share in the virtuous task of ruling and being ruled.&lt;ref name = "Ed6"/&gt; His ''koinonia politike'' as political [[community]].

The concept of ''societas civilis'' is Roman and was introduced by [[Cicero]]. The political discourse in the classical period, places importance on the idea of a ‘good society’ in ensuring peace and order among the people. The philosophers in the classical period did not make any distinction between the state and society. Rather they held that the state represented the civil form of society and ‘civility’ represented the requirement of good citizenship.&lt;ref name = "Ed6"/&gt; Moreover, they held that human beings are inherently rational so that they can collectively shape the nature of the society they belong to. In addition, human beings have the capacity to voluntarily gather for the common cause and maintain peace in society. By holding this view, we can say that classical political thinkers endorsed the genesis of civil society in its original sense.

The [[Middle Ages]] saw major changes in the topics discussed by political philosophers. Due to the unique political arrangements of [[feudalism]], the concept of classical civil society practically disappeared from mainstream discussion. Instead conversation was dominated by problems of [[Just War|just war]], a preoccupation that would last until the end of [[Renaissance]].

===Pre-modern history===
The [[Thirty Years' War]] and the subsequent [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]] heralded the birth of [[Westphalian sovereignty|the sovereign states system]]. The Treaty endorsed states as territorially-based political units having sovereignty. As a result, the monarchs were able to exert domestic control by emasculating the feudal lords and to stop relying on the latter for armed troops.&lt;ref name = "Bro70"&gt;Brown 2001:70{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, monarchs could form national armies and deploy a professional bureaucracy and fiscal departments, which enabled them to maintain direct control and supreme authority over their subjects. In order to meet administrative expenditures, monarchs controlled the economy. This gave birth to [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]].&lt;ref name = "Knut80"&gt;Knutsen 1997:80–118{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the mid-eighteenth century, absolutism was the hallmark of Europe.&lt;ref name = "Knut80"/&gt;

The absolutist concept of the state was disputed in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period.&lt;ref name = "Chand88"&gt;Chandhoke 1995:88{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a natural consequence of Renaissance, Humanism, and the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment thinkers raised fundamental questions such as "What legitimacy does heredity confer?", "Why are governments instituted?", "Why should some human beings have more basic rights than others?", and so on. These questions led them to make certain assumptions about the nature of the human mind, the sources of political and [[moral authority]], the reasons behind absolutism, and how to move beyond absolutism. The Enlightenment thinkers believed in the inherent goodness of the human mind. They opposed the alliance between the state and the Church as the enemy of human progress and well-being because the coercive apparatus of the state curbed individual liberty and the Church legitimated monarchs by positing the theory of divine origin. Therefore, both were deemed to be against the will of the people.

Strongly influenced by the atrocities of Thirty Years' War, the political philosophers of the time held that social relations should be ordered in a different way from [[natural law]] conditions. Some of their attempts led to the emergence of [[social contract]] theory that contested social relations existing in accordance with human nature. They held that human nature can be understood by analyzing objective realities and natural law conditions. Thus they endorsed that the nature of human beings should be encompassed by the contours of state and established [[positive law]]s. [[Thomas Hobbes]] underlined the need of a powerful state to maintain civility in society. For Hobbes, human beings are motivated by self-interests (Graham 1997:23). Moreover, these self-interests are often contradictory in nature. Therefore, in [[state of nature]], there was a condition of a war of all against all. In such a situation, life was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short" (Ibid: 25). Upon realizing the danger of anarchy, human beings became aware of the need of a mechanism to protect them. As far as Hobbes was concerned, rationality and self-interests persuaded human beings to combine in agreement, to surrender sovereignty to a common power (Kaviraj 2001:289).{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}} Hobbes called this common power, state, [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]].

[[John Locke]] had a similar concept to Hobbes about the political condition in England. It was the period of the Glorious Revolution, marked by the struggle between the divine right of the Crown and the political rights of Parliament. This influenced Locke to forge a social contract theory of a limited state and a powerful society. In Locke’s view, human beings led also an unpeaceful life in the state of nature. However, it could be maintained at the sub-optimal level in the absence of a sufficient system (Brown 2001:73). From that major concern, people gathered together to sign a contract and constituted a common public authority. Nevertheless, Locke held that the consolidation of political power can be turned into autocracy, if it is not brought under reliable restrictions (Kaviraj 2001:291). Therefore, Locke set forth two treaties on government with reciprocal obligations. In the first treaty, people submit themselves to the common public authority. This authority has the power to enact and maintain laws. The second treaty contains the limitations of authority, i. e., the state has no power to threaten the basic rights of human beings. As far as Locke was concerned, the basic rights of human beings are the preservation of life, liberty and property. Moreover, he held that the state must operate within the bounds of civil and natural laws.

Both Hobbes and Locke had set forth a system, in which peaceful coexistence among human beings could be ensured through social pacts or contracts. They considered civil society as a community that maintained civil life, the realm where civic virtues and rights were derived from natural laws. However, they did not hold that civil society was a separate realm from the state. Rather, they underlined the co-existence of the state and civil society. The systematic approaches of Hobbes and Locke (in their analysis of social relations) were largely influenced by the experiences in their period. Their attempts to explain human nature, natural laws, the social contract and the formation of government had challenged the divine right theory. In contrast to divine right, Hobbes and Locke claimed that humans can design their political order. This idea had a great impact on the thinkers in the Enlightenment period.

The Enlightenment thinkers argued that human beings are rational and can shape their destiny. Hence, no need of an absolute authority to control them. Both [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], a critic of civil society, and [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that people are peace lovers and that wars are the creation of absolute regimes (Burchill 2001:33). As far as Kant was concerned, this system was effective to guard against the domination of a single interest and check the tyranny of the majority (Alagappa 2004:30).

===Modern history===

{{Communitarianism sidebar}}

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G. W. F. (1821), [[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|''PR'']] [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prethica.htm#PR157 § 157]&lt;/ref&gt; completely changed the meaning of civil society, giving rise to a modern [[liberalism|liberal]] understanding of it as a form of [[free market|market]] society as opposed to institutions of modern [[nation state]].&lt;ref name="zaleski"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Zaleski | first = Pawel Stefan | authorlink =   | title = Tocqueville on Civilian Society. A Romantic Vision of the Dichotomic Structure of Social Reality  | journal = Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte  | volume = 50  | issue =   | pages =   | publisher = Felix Meiner Verlag  | location =   | year = 2008  | url =  http://zaleski.wex.pl/2008%20tocqueville%20on%20civilian%20society.pdf | doi =   | id =   | accessdate = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[classical republicanism]] civil society where synonymous with [[political society]], Hegel distinguished political state and civil society, what was followed by Tocqueville's distinction between civil and political societies and associations,&lt;ref name="zaleski" /&gt; repeated by Marx and Tönnies.

Unlike his predecessors, Hegel considered civil society ({{lang-de|bürgerliche Gesellschaft}}) as a separate realm, a "system of needs", that is the, "[stage of] difference which intervenes between the family and the state."&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G. F. W., ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', edited by [[Allen W. Wood]] (Cambridge University Press, 1991), §184&lt;/ref&gt; Civil society is the realm of economic relationships as it exists in the modern industrial capitalist society,&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, Peter G. ''Hegel’s Civil Society: A Locus of Freedom'', appearing in Polity, Vol. 12, No. 4 (Summer 1980), pp. 622–46. p. 623&lt;/ref&gt; for it had emerged at the particular period of capitalism and served its interests: individual rights and private property.&lt;ref&gt;Dhanagare 2001:169{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, he used the German term "bürgerliche Gesellschaft" to denote civil society as "civilian society" – a sphere regulated by the [[civil code]]. This new way of thinking about civil society was followed by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Karl Marx]] as well.&lt;ref name="zaleski" /&gt; For Hegel, civil society manifested contradictory forces. Being the realm of capitalist interests, there is a possibility of conflicts and inequalities within it (ex: mental and physical aptitude, talents and financial circumstances). He argued that these inequalities influence the choices that members are able to make in relation to the type of work they will do. The diverse positions in Civil Society fall into three estates: the substantial estate (agriculture), the formal estate (trade and industry), and the universal estate (civil society).&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G. F. W., ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', edited by Allen W. Wood (Cambridge University Press, 1991), §202&lt;/ref&gt; A man is able to choose his estate, though his choice is limited by the aforementioned inequalities. However, Hegel argues that these inequalities enable all estates in Civil Society to be filled, which leads to a more efficient system on the whole.

[[Karl Marx]] followed the Hegelian way of using the concept of civil society. For Marx, the emergence of the modern state created a realm of civil society that reduced society to private interests competing against each other. Political society was autonomised into the state, which was in turn ruled by the bourgeois class (consider also that suffrage only belonged, then, to propertied men). Marx, in his early writings, anticipated the abolition of the separation between state and civil society, and looked forward to the reunification of private and public/political realms (Colletti, 1975). Hence, Marx rejected the positive role of state put forth by Hegel. Marx argued that the state cannot be a neutral problem solver. Rather, he depicted the state as the defender of the interests of the bourgeoisie. He considered the state to be the executive arm of the bourgeoisie, which would wither away once the working class took democratic control of society.&lt;ref&gt;See [[V. I. Lenin]], ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'', (2010), for a summary of Marx's thought on the State and an introduction to Marxist thought on the state up until 1917. For a detailed discussion of Marx's thought on the state and civil society see Draper, 1977 &amp; 1986 (Volumes 1 and 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

The above view about civil society was criticised by [[Antonio Gramsci]] (Edwards 2004:10). Departing somewhat from Marx, Gramsci did not consider civil society as a realm of private and alienated relationships. Rather, Gramsci viewed civil society as the vehicle for bourgeois hegemony, when it just represents a particular class. He underlined the crucial role of civil society as the contributor of the cultural and ideological capital required for the survival of the hegemony of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg 1999:208&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than posing it as a problem, as in earlier Marxist conceptions, Gramsci viewed civil society as the site for problem-solving. Misunderstanding Gramsci, the [[New Left]] assigned civil society a key role in defending people against the state and the market and in asserting the democratic will to influence the state.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg 1999:30&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, neo-liberal thinkers consider civil society as a site for struggle to subvert Communist and authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg 1999:33&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the term civil society occupies an important place in the political discourses of the New Left and neo-liberals.

===Post-modern history===
[[File:Nemzeti Ünnep - Kossuth tér 1989.03.15 (6).jpg|thumb|The street is ours again - Budapest, 1989.03.15]]
It is commonly believed{{by whom|date=August 2018}} that the post-modern way of understanding civil society was first developed by political opposition in the former Soviet bloc East European countries in the 1980s. However, research shows that communist [[propaganda]] had the most important influence on the development and popularization of the idea instead, in an effort to legitimize [[neo-liberalism|neoliberal]] transformation in 1989.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to theory of restructurization of welfare systems, a new way of using the concept of civil society became a [[neo-liberalism|neoliberal]] [[ideology]] legitimizing development of the third sector as a substitute for the [[welfare state]].  The recent development of the third sector is a result of this welfare systems restructuring, rather than of democratization.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

From that time stems a political practice of using the idea of civil society instead of [[State (polity)|political society]]. Henceforth, postmodern usage of the idea of civil society became divided into two main ones: as political society and as the third sector – apart from plethora of definitions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The [[Washington Consensus]] of the 1990s, which involved conditioned loans by the World Bank and IMF to debt-laden developing states, also created pressures for states in poorer countries to shrink.&lt;ref name="globall" /&gt;  This in turn led to practical changes for civil society that went on to influence the theoretical debate.  Initially the new conditionality led to an even greater emphasis on "civil society" as a panacea, replacing the state's service provision and social care,&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Stefan Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making," IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006[http://zaleski.wex.pl/2006%20global%20nongovernmental%20administrative%20system.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Hulme and Edwards suggested that it was now seen as "the magic bullet."

By the end of the 1990s civil society was seen less as a panacea amid the growth of the [[anti-globalization movement]] and the transition of many countries to democracy; instead, civil society was increasingly called on to justify its legitimacy and democratic credentials. This led to the creation by the UN of a high level panel on civil society.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002044238/http://www.un.org/reform/civilsociety/bios.shtml |title=Reforming the United Nations |date=2 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the 1990s with the emergence of the nongovernmental organizations and the [[new social movements]] (NSMs) on a global scale, civil society as a [[Voluntary sector|third sector]] became treated as a key terrain of strategic action to construct ‘an alternative social and world order.’ Post-modern civil society theory has now largely returned to a more neutral stance, but with marked differences between the study of the phenomena in richer societies and writing on civil society in developing states.

==Link to the public sphere==
[[Jürgen Habermas]] said that the [[public sphere]] encourages rational will-formation; it is a sphere of rational and democratic social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, J. (1974). The public sphere: an encyclopaedia article. ''New German Critique'', 3, 49–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas argues that even though society was representative of capitalist society, there are some institutions that were part of political society. Transformations in economy brought transformations to the public sphere. Though these transformations happen, a civil society develops when it emerges as non-economic and has a populous aspect, and when the state is not represented by just one political party. There needs to be a locus of authority, and this is where society can begin to challenge authority. Jillian Schwedler points out that civil society emerges with the resurrection of the public sphere when individuals and groups begin to challenge boundaries of permissible behaviour – for example, by speaking out against the regime or demanding a government response to social needs – civil society begins to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;Schwedler, 1995:5{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2017, social activist Himmat Bhandari in his lecture said at Civil Society, Rotary Club Bareilly,   
"Civilization need civilized societies, and civil societies need civilized citizens."

[[File:Net Neutrality Vigil (15727220061).jpg|thumb|Net Neutrality Vigil demonstrating, USA]]
A '''civil society campaign''' is one that is intended to mobilize public support and use democratic tools such as [[lobbying]] in order to instigate [[social change]]. [[Civil society]] campaigns can seek local, national or international objectives. They can be run by dedicated single-issue groups such as [[Infant formula|Baby Milk]] Action, or by professional [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs), such as the [[World Development Movement]], who may have several campaigns running at any one time. Larger coalition campaigns such as 2005's [[Make Poverty History]] may involve a combination of NGOs.

Effective campaigning can sometimes achieve much more than [[Divine grace|good works]] or giving to charity. For example, the [[Jubilee 2000]] debt campaign persuaded [[G7]] governments to cancel $100 billion of debt owned by poor countries, releasing more money for development than 1,000 years of [[Christian Aid]] in weeks. In the UK, ASH ([[Action on Smoking and Health]])’s campaign for a ban on smoking in public places in 2006 saved over 2,000 lives and billions of pounds a year. The [[Empty Homes Agency]] is working with UK [[Local government|local authorities]] to bring thousands of properties into use as a result of a successful amendment to the UK [[Housing Act 2004]].

Campaigning is increasingly recognised as an important way for NGOs to achieve their objectives. Many charities employ campaigners, produce campaigning materials and train their supporters to campaign. The [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]] says that “charities may undertake campaigning and political activity as a positive way of furthering or supporting their purposes.”&lt;ref&gt;Charity Commission, CC9 - Speaking Out - Guidance on Campaigning and Political Activity by Charities, &lt;www.charity-commission.gov.uk/publications/cc9.asp#2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisations, such as the [[Centre for Policy Studies]], want to keep charities and community groups out of politics. Many NGOs and community groups are wary of campaigning. They worry about being political or offending their funders.

The problems voluntary organisations deal with often need political action, as well as good works. Over 200 years ago there were charities for the welfare of slaves, but abolishing the institution of [[slavery]] was also necessary. There is still a lot wrong with the world about which to campaign. Not all problems can be solved by campaigning. Sometimes it is better to provide a service, as a private business, a [[social enterprise]] or a charity. But many problems are best solved by influencing the policies and actions of an industry, firm, public service or government rather than trying to fix them yourself.{{Says who|date=March 2011}}

Most campaigns are small, such as improving play space in a park, creating access for [[Disability|people with disabilities]] or changing work practices. Some tackle very big issues, like [[climate change]], world poverty and injustice. Many campaigns don’t get anywhere or make very slow progress. Some{{Who|date=March 2011}} even undermine their own cause, because they turn people off or make mistakes. Influencing others takes skill and knowledge as well as commitment.

== Lobbying ==
A key element of campaigning is researching and offering policy suggestions. A campaigning organisation will usually attempt to keep track of legislative processes, and mobilise its supporter base to provide mass lobbies at critical junctures. [1]

== Stunts and actions ==
While civil society campaigners may come from a range of political backgrounds, modern campaigning owes its largest debt to the ideas of the [[Situationists]], such as [[Guy Debord]], who recognised that as society falls increasingly under the thrall of the spectacle, it is impossible to generate political momentum without existing in the visual plane.
A frequent tactic of civil society campaigns is thus the deployment of high-profile stunts and actions to draw attention to their cause. An example of a stunt is the group [[Fathers4Justice]] dressing as popular superheroes and scaling tall buildings to draw attention to their cause. The occupation of the [[Brent Spar]] platform by [[Greenpeace]] to prevent [[exoskeleton|Shell]] dumping it at sea was an action rather than a stunt as it had intrinsic influence as well as generating publicity. [2]

== Direct Action ==
[[Direct action]] is politically motivated activity undertaken by individuals, groups, or governments to achieve political goals outside of normal social/political channels.

== Human Rights ==
[[Human rights]] refer to the "basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled." Campaigners use the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]], such as the [[right to life]] and liberty, [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], to further their cause.

== Using the Arts ==
Some campaigners use the arts to get their message across. For example, [[radical cheerleading]] is used at demonstrations to promote a radical message in a media-friendly, people-friendly way.

== Demonstrations ==
A [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] is a form of nonviolent action by groups of people in favor of a political or other cause, normally consisting of walking in a march and a meeting (rally) to hear speakers

== Petitions ==
A [[petition]] is a request to change something, most commonly made to a government official or public entity

== Social Media ==
The use of [[social media]] is helping campaigners to recruit members and communicate.  Social media can take many different forms, including [[Internet forums]], [[Blog|weblogs]], [[social blogs]], [[wikis]], [[podcasts]], pictures and video.

== Influencing Parliament ==
In the UK, Parliamentary Outreach works with NGOs to help them to understand Parliamentary processes

== Freedom of Information Legislation ==
Campaigners can now use [[Freedom of Information legislation]] to request Government held information and receive it freely or at minimum cost.

A '''complaint system''' (also known as a '''conflict management system''', '''internal conflict management system''', '''integrated conflict management system''',&lt;ref&gt;See Lynch, below{{full|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''dispute system''') is a set of procedures used in organizations to address complaints and resolve disputes. Complaint systems in the US have undergone several innovations especially since about 1970 with the advent of extensive workplace regulation. Notably in many countries, conflict management channels and systems have evolved from a major focus on labor-management relations to a much wider purview that includes [[labor union|unionized]] workers and also managers, non-union employees, professional staff, students, trainees, vendors, donors, customers, etc.

==History==

There is a substantial early history of scholarly work on [[due process]], and union and non-union [[grievance]] procedures within organizations. This work focused primarily on [[rights]]-based [[conflict resolution]] between union and non-union workers and their managers. Scholarly work has evolved to cover both a wider range of conflict management channels, and, also, a much wider range of disputants.

In the 1970s and 1980s much interest arose in the United States, in dealing with conflict informally as well as formally, and in learning from conflict and managing conflict. In contemporary language, these discussions centered on the "interests" of all who would consider themselves stake-holders in a given conflict—and on systems change—as well as resolving grievances.

These discussions led to questions of how to think about complaint systems and how to link different conflict management offices and processes within an organization. Papers by Ronald Berenbeimmason djordje bentions.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Berenbeim, Non-union Complaint Systems: A Corporate Appraisal (NY: The Conference Board, Report No 770, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary P. Rowe, PhD, "Are You Hearing Enough Employee Concerns?" with Michael Baker, in Harvard Business Review, Vol. 62, No. 3, (May–June, 1984), pp. 127–136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary P. Rowe, "The Non-Union Complaint System at MIT: An Upward-Feedback Mediation Model," in Alternatives to the High Cost of Litigation, Vol. 2, No. 4, (April, 1984), pp. 10–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many authors extended the work of Berenbeim, Rowe, and Rowe and Baker, on the topic of internal complaint systems. They included: Douglas M. McCabe,&lt;ref&gt;"Corporate Non-union Complaint Procedures and Systems" (NY: Praeger, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William L. Ury]], Jeanne M. Brett, and Stephen B. Goldberg.&lt;ref&gt;Ury, William J., Jeanne M. Brett, and Stephen B. Goldberg, Getting Disputes Resolved: Designing Systems to Cut the Costs of Conflict, the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, MA (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; (Ury, Brett and Goldberg in particular described conflict resolution within organizations in terms of interests, rights and power and the possibility of looping back from rights-based processes to interest-based solutions.) Cathy Costantino and Cristina S Merchant,&lt;ref&gt;Costantino, C. and C.S. Merchant. 1996, Designing conflict management systems. San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; and Karl A. Slaikeu and Ralph H. Hasson&lt;ref&gt;Slaikeu. K.A. and R.H. Hasson. 1998. Controlling the costs of conflict: How to design a system for your organization. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; extensively explored issues of designing conflict management systems.

The concept of an ''integrated'' conflict management system was conceived and developed by Mary Rowe, in numerous articles in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;See http://web.mit.edu/ombud/publications/ for a list&lt;/ref&gt; She saw the need to offer options for complainants and therefore a linked system of choices within an organizational system.&lt;ref&gt;See "People Who Feel Harassed Need a Complaint System with both Formal and Informal Options" in ''Negotiation Journal'', April, 1990, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 161–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a systems approach has endured well. In recent years however, there has been discussion as to whether conflict should be "managed" by the organization—or whether the goal is to understand, deal with and learn from conflict. There is also concern about practical and theoretical issues in "integrating" a system, with some observers{{Who|date=November 2010}} preferring the idea of "coordinating" a conflict system. However 2012 research by David Lipsky ''et al.'', suggests that an increasing number of corporations see themselves as having "integrated conflict management systems," or "ICMS."

There is also a major need{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} to collect, review and understand the nature of conflict management and complaint systems around the world. Studies and citations are needed about how complaint systems work for women as well as men. Research is needed as to how systems work for many different national groups, for people of different socio-economic classes, and different ages, and different religions, and especially for contract workers and immigrant workers, in every country. Studies (and citations) are needed about complaint systems in health care, in faith-based organizations, in schools, in political organizations, in the military and in many specialized occupations. Studies are needed{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} about important specialized issues like free speech.

A number of [[artificial intelligence]] technologies are helpful in complaint resolution process, understanding the attitudes of involved parties and reasoning about them, in particular, based on the [[belief–desire–intention model]]. Concept learning is an adequate formalism to reason about complaints.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Galitsky, B. and Josep Lluis de la Rosa ''"Concept-based learning of human behavior for customer relationship management"'' [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025510004007 Information Sciences] Volume 181, Issue 10, 15 May 2011, pp 2016-2035 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Close Relationships|types}}
'''Concubinage''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|n|ˈ|k|juː|b|ᵻ|n|ᵻ|dʒ}}) is an [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] and [[Intimate relationship|sexual relationship]] in which the couple are not or cannot be married. The inability to marry may be due to multiple factors such as differences in social rank status, an existing marriage, religious or professional prohibitions (for example Roman soldiers), or a lack of recognition by appropriate authorities. The woman or man in such a relationship is referred to as a '''concubine''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|ŋ|k|j|ᵿ|ˌ|b|aɪ|n}}).

The prevalence of concubinage and the status of rights and expectations of a concubine have varied among cultures, as have the rights of children of a concubine. Whatever the status and rights of the concubine, they were always inferior to those of the wife and typically neither she nor her children had rights of inheritance. Historically, concubinage was frequently entered into voluntarily (by the woman or her family) as it provided a measure of economic security for the woman. Involuntary or servile concubinage sometimes involved sexual slavery of one member of the relationship, usually the woman. Nevertheless, sexual relations outside marriage were not uncommon, especially among royalty and nobility, and the woman in such relationships was commonly described as a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. The children of such relationships were counted as [[illegitimate]] and were barred from inheriting the father's title or estates, even when there was an absence of legitimate heirs.

While forms of long-term sexual relationships and [[co-habitation]] short of marriage have become increasingly common in the Western world, these are generally not described as concubinage. The terms concubinage and concubine are used today primarily when referring to non-marital partnerships of earlier eras. In modern usage, a non-marital domestic relationship is commonly referred to as co-habitation (or similar terms), and the woman in such a relationship is generally referred to as a [[girlfriend]], [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], [[fiancée]], lover or [[life partner]].

==In Asia==
Concubinage was highly popular before the early 20th century all over Asia. The main function of concubinage was producing additional heirs, as well as bringing males pleasure. Children of concubines had lower rights in account to inheritance, which was regulated by the [[Dishu system]].

===China===
[[File:《万国来朝图》之乾隆后妃.jpg|thumb|Consorts and children of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], [[Qing dynasty]], 18th century]]
[[File:The Fourth Concubine of Hexing.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a concubine, by Chinese painter [[Lam Qua]], 1864]]
In China, [[Women in ancient and imperial China|successful men often had concubines]] until the practice was outlawed when the [[Communist Party of China]] came to power in 1949. The standard Chinese term translated as "concubine" was ''qiè'' {{lang|zh|妾}}, a term that has been used since ancient times, which means "concubine; I, your servant (deprecating self reference))". Concubinage resembled marriage in that concubines were recognized sexual partners of a man and were expected to bear children for him. Unofficial concubines ({{zh|t=婢妾|p=bì qiè}}) are of lower status, and their children are considered illegitimate. The English term concubine is also used for what the Chinese refer to as ''pínfēi'' ({{zh|t=嬪妃}}), or "consorts of emperors", an official position often carrying a very high rank.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Buckley Ebrey (2002): ''Women and the Family in Chinese History''. Oxford: Routledge, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In premodern China it was illegal and socially disreputable for a man to have more than one wife at a time, but it was acceptable to have concubines.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey 2002:39.&lt;/ref&gt; In the earliest records a man could have as many concubines as he could afford. From the [[Han dynasty#Eastern Han|Eastern Han]] period (AD 25–220) onward, the number of concubines a man could have was limited by law. The higher rank and the more noble identity a man possessed, the more concubines he was permitted to have.&lt;ref&gt;Shi Fengyi 史凤仪 (1987): Zhongguo gudai hunyin yu jiating 中国古代婚姻与家庭 ''Marriage and Family in Ancient China''. Wuhan: Hubei Renmin Chubanshe, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

A concubine's treatment and situation was variable and was influenced by the social status of the male to whom she was attached, as well as the attitude of his wife. In the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' chapter on "The Pattern of the Family" ({{zh|t=內則}}) it says, “If there were betrothal rites, she became a wife; and if she went without these, a concubine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/liji/nei-ze#n9964|title=Nei Ze|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051012/http://ctext.org/liji/nei-ze#n9964|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wives brought a [[dowry]] to a relationship, but concubines did not. A concubinage relationship could be entered into without the ceremonies used in marriages, and neither remarriage nor a return to her natal home in widowhood were allowed to a concubine.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2002: 60"&gt;Ebrey 2002: 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of the concubine was generally inferior to that of the wife. Although a concubine could produce heirs, her children would be inferior in social status to a wife's children, although they were of higher status than illegitimate children. The child of a concubine had to show filial duty to two women, their biological mother and their legal mother—the wife of their father.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey 2002: 54.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of a concubine, her sons would make an offering to her, but these offerings were not continued by the concubine's grandsons, who only made offerings to their grandfather’s wife.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey 2002: 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are early records of concubines allegedly being buried alive with their masters to "keep them company in the afterlife".&lt;ref name="Concubines of Ancient China"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concubines of Ancient China|url=http://www.beijingmadeeasy.com/beijing-history/concubines-of-ancient-china|work=Beijing Made Easy|publisher=Beijing Made Easy|accessdate=13 June 2012|year=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608030129/http://www.beijingmadeeasy.com/beijing-history/concubines-of-ancient-china|archive-date=8 June 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1276), it was considered a serious breach of social ethics to promote a concubine to a wife.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2002: 60"/&gt;

During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911), the status of concubines improved. It became permissible to promote a concubine to wife, if the original wife had died and the concubine was the mother of the only surviving sons. Moreover, the prohibition against forcing a widow to remarry was extended to widowed concubines. During this period tablets for concubine-mothers seem to have been more commonly placed in family ancestral altars, and genealogies of some lineages listed concubine-mothers.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2002: 60"/&gt;

Imperial concubines, kept by emperors in the [[Forbidden City]], had [[ranks of imperial consorts in China|different ranks]] and were traditionally guarded by [[eunuch]]s to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor.&lt;ref name="Concubines of Ancient China"/&gt; In [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] (1368-1644) there was an official system to select concubines for the emperor.

Despite the limitations imposed on Chinese concubines, there are several examples in history and literature of concubines who achieved great power and influence. Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], was arguably one of the most successful concubines in Chinese history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to [[Xianfeng Emperor]] and gave birth to his only surviving son, who later became [[Tongzhi Emperor]]. She eventually became the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of Qing China for 47 years after her husband's death.&lt;ref name=EmpressChina&gt;{{cite book|author= Sterling Seagrave, Peggy Seagrave|title=Dragon lady: the life and legend of the last empress of China|year=1993|publisher=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseon]] monarchs had a harem which contains concubines of different ranks. [[Empress Myeongseong]] managed to have sons, preventing sons of concubines getting power.

Children of concubines often have lower value in account of marriage. A daughter of concubine cannot be the wife of a wife-born son of the same class. For example, [[Jang Nok-su]] is a concubine-born daughter of a mayor, who was initially married to a slave-servant, later a high-rank concubine of [[Yeonsangun]].

In [[Ancient Greece]], the practice of keeping a slave concubine ({{lang-grc|παλλακίς}} ''pallakís'') was little recorded but appears throughout Athenian history.

===Ancient Roman ''concubinae'' and ''concubini''===
{{Details|Marriage in ancient Rome#Concubinage}}
Concubinage was an institution practiced in [[ancient Rome]] that allowed a man to enter into an informal but recognized relationship with a woman (''concubina'', plural ''concubinae'') who was not his wife, most often a woman whose lower [[social class in ancient Rome|social status]] was an obstacle to marriage. Concubinage was "tolerated to the degree that it did not threaten the religious and legal integrity of the family".&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Love in Ancient Rome (University of Oklahoma Press) 1986:111.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not considered derogatory to be called a ''concubina'', as the title was often inscribed on tombstones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kiefer, Sexual Life in Ancient Rome (Kegan Paul International) 2000:50.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''concubinus'' was a young male [[slavery in ancient Rome|slave]] [[Sexual slavery|sexually exploited]] by his master as a sexual partner (see [[homosexuality in ancient Rome]]). These relations, however, were expected to play a secondary role to marriage, within which institution an adult male demonstrated his masculine authority as head of the household (''[[pater familias]]''). In one of his [[epithalamium]]s, [[Catullus]] ({{floruit}} mid-1st century BC) assumes that the young bridegroom has a ''concubinus'' who considers himself elevated above the other slaves, but who will be set aside as his master turns his attention to marriage and family life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catullus]], ''Carmen'' 61; Amy Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men", ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), pp. 534–535.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Judaism ===
{{merge from|Pilegesh|date=November 2018}}
Among the [[Israelites]], men commonly acknowledged their concubines, and such women enjoyed the same rights in the house as legitimate wives.&lt;ref name="JewEncPil"&gt;{{cite web|title=PILEGESH (Hebrew, ; comp. Greek, παλλακίς).|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=313&amp;letter=P&amp;search=Pilegesh|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=13 June 2012|author=Staff|year=2002–2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In ancient Judaism====
The term concubine did not necessarily refer to women after the first wife. A man could have many wives and concubines. Legally, any children born to a concubine was considered to be the child of the wife to whom she was under. Sarah had to get Ishmael out of her house because legally Ishmael would always be the first born son even though Isaac was her natural child.
The concubine may not have commanded the exact amount of respect as the wife. In the [[Levitical]] rules on sexual relations, the Hebrew word that is commonly translated as "wife" is distinct from the Hebrew word that means "concubine". However, on at least one other occasion the term is used to refer to a woman who is not a wife{{snd}} specifically, the handmaiden of Jacob's wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|30:4|}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Levitical code, sexual intercourse between a man and a wife of a different man was forbidden and punishable by death for both persons involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was regarded as the highest blessing to have many children, wives often gave their maids to their husbands if they were barren, as in the cases of [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], and [[Rachel]] and [[Bilhah]]. The children of the concubine often had equal rights with those of the wife;&lt;ref name="JewEncPil" /&gt; for example, King [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] was the son of [[Gideon]] and his concubine.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|8:31|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later biblical figures such as Gideon, and [[Solomon]] had concubines in addition to many childbearing wives. For example, the [[Books of Kings]] say that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fiddlerandtaborer.png|thumb|Illustration from the [[Morgan Bible]] of the [[Benjamite]]s taking women of [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] as concubines.]]
The account of the unnamed Levite in Judges 19–20&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|19|NRVS}}, {{bibleverse||Judges|20|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that the taking of concubines was not the exclusive preserve of kings or patriarchs in Israel during the time of the Judges, and that the rape of a concubine was completely unacceptable to the Israelite nation and led to a [[civil war]]. In the story, the Levite appears to be an ordinary member of the tribe dedicated to the worship of God, who was undoubtedly dishonored both by the unfaithfulness of his concubine and her abandonment of him. However, after four months, he decides to make her fall in love with him again at her father’s house; he brings a servant and two asses to show off what glory he has. Her father seeks to keep him there until one day he refuses to remain and leaves. He is offered hospitality at Gibeah. The way in which his host's daughter is offered to the townsmen and the circumstances of his concubine's death at their hands describe a lawless time where visitors are both welcomed and threatened in equal measure. The Levite and his (male) host seek to protect themselves by offering their womenfolk, both the host’s virgin daughter and his companion’s concubine, to their aggressors for sex in exchange for their own safety. In the morning, the Levite tries to wake her up, but then realizes that she is dead. He dismembers her body and distributes her (body parts) throughout the nation of Israel to remind them of the blessing that God gave them of liberating them from the likewise sexually vicious and sadistic land of Egypt, and to inform them of the horribleness of the land of Gibeah. The sadistic rape of the concubine is considered outrageous by the Israelite tribesmen, who then wreak total retribution on the men of Gibeah and the surrounding tribe of Benjamin when they support the Gibeans, killing them without mercy and burning all their towns. The inhabitants of (the town of) Jabesh Gilead are then slaughtered as a punishment for not joining the eleven tribes in their war against the Benjaminites, and their four hundred unmarried daughters given in [[forced marriage]] to the six hundred Benjamite survivors. Finally, the two hundred Benjaminite survivors who still have no wives are granted a [[raptio|mass marriage by abduction]] by the other tribes.

====In modern Judaism====
In Judaism, concubines are referred to by the Hebrew term [[pilegesh]] ({{lang-he|פילגש}}). The term is a loanword from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|παλλακίς}},&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lieb, Milton and the culture of violence, p.274, Cornell University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agendas for the study of Midrash in the twenty-first century, Marc Lee Raphael, p.136, Dept. of Religion, College of William and Mary, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Clapp, Sheba: Through the Desert in Search of the Legendary Queen, p.297, Houghton Mifflin, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "a mistress staying in house".

According to the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]],&lt;ref name="JewEncPil" /&gt; the difference between a concubine and a full wife was that the latter received a [[ketubah]] and [[Jewish wedding|her marriage]] (''nissu'in'') was preceded by an [[erusin]] ("formal betrothal"). Neither was the case for a concubine. One opinion in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] argues that the concubine should also receive a ''marriage contract'', but without a clause specifying a divorce settlement.&lt;ref name="JewEncPil" /&gt;

Certain Jewish thinkers, such as [[Maimonides]], believed that concubines were strictly reserved for Royal leadership, kings and queens, and thus that a commoner may not have a concubine. Indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of [[human sexuality|sexual relations]] outside of a marriage.

Maimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage. For example, [[Leviticus Rabbah]] severely condemns the custom.&lt;ref&gt;''Leviticus Rabbah'', 25&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jewish thinkers, such as [[Nahmanides]], [[Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus]], and [[Jacob Emden]], strongly objected to the idea that concubines should be forbidden.

In the [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] of the contemporary [[Israel|State of Israel]], ''pilegesh'' is often used as the equivalent of the English word "[[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]"&amp;mdash;i.e., the female partner in extramarital relations&amp;mdash;regardless of legal recognition. Attempts have been initiated to popularise ''pilegesh'' as a form of premarital, non-marital or extramarital relationship (which, according to the perspective of the enacting person(s), is permitted by [[Halakha|Jewish law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kosher sex without marriage |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=16 March 2006 |author=Matthew Wagner |accessdate=13 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503230106/http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |archive-date=3 May 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Dickter, "ISO: Kosher Concubine", ''New York Jewish Week'', December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html Suzanne Glass, "The Concubine Connection"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.li/20130103033314/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html |date=3 January 2013 }}, ''The Independent'', London 20 October 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual slavery]] as concubinage in [[Islamic sexual jurisprudence]] is permitted in Islam which was not considered prostitution, and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] throughout the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]], when women and girls from the [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Europe]] were captured and served as [[concubine]]s in the [[harem]]s of the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Slavery in Islam|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521234122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|archive-date=21 May 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]] tells us several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122171200/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Slavery.html |date=2009-11-22 }}.

Concubinage is permitted and regulated in Islam. [[Al-Muminun]] 6 and [[Al-Maarij]] 30 both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and "those whom one's right hands possess" (concubine/sexual slaves), saying " أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ" (literally, "their spouses or what their right hands possess"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible.  Sayyid [[Abul Ala Maududi]] explains that "two categories of women have been excluded from the general command of guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in one's possession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?pagetitle=AL+-+MUMINOON&amp;sno=23&amp;tno=1324|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070311085024/http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?pagetitle=AL+-+MUMINOON&amp;sno=23&amp;tno=1324|deadurl=yes|title=Surah - AL - MUMINOON|date=11 March 2007|archivedate=11 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Concubine" (''surriyya'') refers to the female slave (''jāriya''), whether Muslim or non-Muslim, with whom her master engages in sexual intercourse.

Children of former concubines were generally declared as legitimate as they were born in wedlock, and the mother of a free child was considered free upon the death of the male partner.

She quotes the Oxford encyclopedia of modern Islamic world to differentiate between marriage (nikah) and Mut'ah, and states that while nikah is for procreation, mut'ah is just for sexual gratification.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lifting the Veil: The World of Muslim Women|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JKqkohMVPVsC|publisher = InterVarsity Press|date = 1 April 2003|isbn = 9780830856961|language = en|first = Philip L.|last = Parshall|first2 = Julie|last2 = Parshall}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zeyno Baran, this kind of temporary marriage provides Shi'ite men with a religiously sanctioned equivalent to prostitution.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Citizen Islam: The Future of Muslim Integration in the West|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hfdGAQAAQBAJ|publisher = A&amp;C Black|date = 21 July 2011|isbn = 9781441112484|language = en|first = Zeyno|last = Baran}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Elena Andreeva's observation published in 2007, Russian travellers to Iran consider mut'ah to be "legalized profligacy" which is indistinguishable from prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Andreeva, Elena (2007).

"Most of the travelers describe the Shi'i institution of temporary marriage (sigheh) as 'legalized profligacy' and hardly distinguish between temporary marriage and prostitution."&lt;/ref&gt; Religious supporters of mut'ah argue that temporary marriage is different from prostitution for a couple of reasons, including the necessity of [[iddah]] in case the couple have sexual intercourse. It means that if a woman marries a man in this way and has sex, she has to wait for a number of months before marrying again and therefore, a woman cannot marry more than 3 or 4 times in a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/temporary-marriage-islam-part-6-similarities-and Temporary Marriage in Islam Part 6: Similarities and Differences of Mut’a and Regular Marriage | A Shi'ite Encyclopedia | Books on Islam and Muslims | Al-Islam.org].

====Pre-modern times====
[[File:Cormon Fernand Le harem Oil On Canvas.jpg|thumb|left|''Scene from the Harem'' by [[Fernand Cormon]] (1845–1924)]]

In ancient times, two sources for concubines were permitted under an Islamic regime. Primarily, non-Muslim women taken as prisoners of war were made concubines as happened after the [[banu Qurayza#Battle of the Trench|Battle of the Trench]],&lt;ref name="Majlisi, M. B. 1966"&gt;Majlisi, M. B. (1966).

It was encouraged to [[manumit]] slave women who rejected their initial faith and embraced Islam, or to bring them into [[Marriage in Islam|formal marriage]].

====Modern times====
According to the rules of Islamic [[Fiqh]], what is ''halal'' (permitted) by Allah in the Quran cannot be altered by any authority or individual. Therefore, although the ''concept'' of concubinage is ''halal'', concubines are mostly no longer available in this modern era nor allowed to be sold or purchased in accordance with the latest human rights standards. However, as change of existing Islamic law is impossible, a concubine in this modern era, if existing,  must be given all the due rights that Islam had preserved in the past.

It is further clarified that all domestic and organizational female employees are not concubines in this era and hence sex is forbidden with them unless Nikah (formal marriage)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikah.com/marriage/definition_nikah.asp|title=Definition of Nikah (Islamic marriage)|author=|date=|work=nikah.com|accessdate=16 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040806052730/http://www.nikah.com/marriage/definition_nikah.asp|archive-date=6 August 2004|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Nikah mut‘ah]]&lt;ref name="Mutahhari7"&gt;Motahhari M.

==In the United States==
[[File:Free Woman of Color with daughter NOLA Collage.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Free people of color|Free woman of color]] with [[quadroon]] daughter; late 18th century collage painting, [[New Orleans]].]]

When [[slavery]] became institutionalized in the North American colonies, white men, whether or not they were married, sometimes took enslaved women and men as concubines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PQzmjgSObrEC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=u.s.+slavery+concubine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi60NTmsMLcAhVD7qwKHaV5AugQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=u.s.%20slavery%20concubine&amp;f=false|title=Race, Gender, and Work: A Multi-cultural Economic History of Women in the United States|last=Amott|first=Teresa L.|last2=Matthaei|first2=Julie A.|date=1996|publisher=South End Press|isbn=9780896085374|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage between the races was prohibited by law in the colonies and the later United States. Many colonies and states also had laws against [[miscegenation]], or any interracial relations. From 1662 the Colony of Virginia, followed by others, incorporated into law the principle that children took their mother's status, i.e., the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''. All children born to enslaved mothers were born into slavery, regardless of their father's status or ancestry.&lt;ref name="Kolchin17"&gt;[[Peter Kolchin]], ''American Slavery, 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; This led to generations of [[multiracial]] slaves, some of whom were otherwise considered legally white (one-eighth or less African, equivalent to a great-grandparent) before the [[American Civil War]].

In some cases, men had long-term relationships with enslaved women, giving them and their mixed-race children freedom and providing their children with apprenticeships, education and transfer of capital.  A purported [[Jefferson–Hemings controversy|relationship]] between [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Sally Hemings]] is an example of this.&lt;ref name="Hemings"&gt;[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html "Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430175449/http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html |date=30 April 2010 }}, Monticello Website, Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Retrieved 22 June 2011. Quote: "Ten years later [referring to its 2000 report], TJF and most historians now believe that, years after his wife's death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings ... Since then, a committee commissioned by the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society, after reviewing essentially the same material, reached different conclusions, namely that Sally Hemings was only a minor figure in Thomas Jefferson's life and that it is very unlikely he fathered any of her children. This committee also suggested in its report, issued in April 2001 and revised in 2011, that Jefferson's younger brother Randolph (1755-1815) was more likely the father of at least some of Sally Hemings's children."&lt;/ref&gt;   Such arrangements were more prevalent in the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] during the antebellum years.

===Plaçage===

{{main|Plaçage}}
In [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] and former French territories, a formalized system of concubinage called ''plaçage'' developed. European men took enslaved or [[free people of color|free women of color]] as mistresses after making arrangements to give them a dowry, house or other transfer of property, and sometimes, if they were enslaved, offering freedom and education for their children.&lt;ref name="everyculture.com"&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Creoles.html Helen Bush Caver and Mary T.

'''Conflict escalation''' is the process by which conflicts grow in severity over time. This may refer to conflicts between individuals or groups in interpersonal relationships, or it may refer to the escalation of hostilities in a political or military context.  In [[systems theory]], the process of conflict escalation is modeled by [[positive feedback]].

While the word ''escalation'' was used as early as in 1938, it was popularized during the [[Cold War]] by two  important books: ''On Escalation'' ([[Herman Kahn]], 1965) and ''Escalation and the Nuclear Option'' ([[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]], 1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=Lawrence|title=The evolution of nuclear strategy|year=1993|publisher=St Martin's press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-02843-1|pages=198–199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruAxF8SBR3IC&amp;lpg=PR6&amp;dq=%22The%20Impact%20of%20Atomic%20Weapons%20on%20Strategy%20and%20Tactics.%22&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these contexts, it especially referred to war between two states with [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]—the [[Cold War]].

Conflict escalation has a tactical role in military conflict, and is often formalized with explicit [[rules of engagement]]. Highly successful [[military tactics]] exploit a particular form of conflict escalation; for example, controlling an opponent's reaction time allows the tactician to pursue or trap his opponent. [[Napoleon]] and [[Heinz Guderian]] both advocated this approach. [[Sun Tzu]] elaborated it in a more abstract form, and additionally maintained that [[military strategy]] was about minimizing escalation, and [[diplomacy]] about eliminating it.

==Continuum of force==
{{Main|Use of force continuum}}
The United States Marine Corps' "Continuum of Force" (found in MCRP 3-02B){{clarify|date=August 2012}}&lt;!-- Huh? Be a little more specific --&gt; documents the stages of conflict escalation in combat for a typical subject. They are:

===Level 1: Compliant (cooperative)===
The subject responds to and obeys verbal commands. He refrains from close combat.

===Level 2: Resistant (passive)===
The subject resists verbal commands but complies to commands immediately upon contact controls. He refrains from close combat.

===Level 3: Resistant (active)===
Initially, the subject physically resists commands, but he can be made to comply by compliance techniques; these include come-along holds, soft-handed stunning blows, and techniques inducing pain by joint manipulation and pressure points.

===Level 4: Assaultive (bodily harm)===
The unarmed subject physically attacks his opponent. He can be controlled by certain defensive tactics, including blocks, strikes, kicks, enhanced pain compliance procedures, impact weapon blocks and [[Strike (attack)|blow]]s.

===Level 5: Assaultive (lethal force)===
The subject has a weapon and will likely kill or injure someone unless controlled. This is only possible by lethal force, which possibly requires firearms or weapons.

==Preventing==
A major focus of peace and conflict theory is concerned with curbing conflict escalation or creating a [[mindset]] to avoid such conflict in future, and instead engaging in [[peacemaking]]. Much nonviolent conflict resolution, however, involves conflict escalation in the form of [[protest]]s, [[Strike action|strike]]s, or other [[direct action]]s.

[[Mohandas Gandhi]], a major proponent of [[nonviolence]], used satyagraha to demonstrate that:
*Peacefully controlling a group of people with a common cause was possible.
*One could accomplish objectives through [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] without capitulating to violent attack.
*His method ensured mutual support.
*It was possible to desist from retributive justice.
*It was not ultimately desirable to inflict [[punishment]], even when grievously wronged.

With this method of escalation, Gandhi avoided [[technological escalation]] and demonstrated to those in power that:
* The group was held together by its own discipline, and not by any kind of authority using violence.
* Authority could surrender without being subjected to violence.
* Authority could depart safely.
* Authority could devolve without obstacles, for the [[dissent]] was well enough organized to constitute an effective [[political party]].

==Conflict escalation curve==
{{Original research section|date=September 2016}}
The conflict escalation curve is a concept created by [[Michael N. Nagler]].{{cn|date=September 2016}} The conflict escalation curve proposes that the intensity of a conflict is directly related to how far [[dehumanization]] has proceeded. In other words, conflicts escalate in the degree to which parties dehumanize one another (or one party is dehumanizing the other).

The curve conceptualizes a typical trajectory a conflict would have if it were plotted on an (x,y) graph with (x) being time elapsed and (y) being the intensity of dehumanization. Depending upon which stage a conflict is on the graph, a specific set of responses is needed.
 
The curve divides the appropriate responses into three stages.

===Stage 1: Conflict resolution===
In the first stage no serious dehumanization has occurred by either party. Attempts are made mainly to make one's views known, with the expectation that the other may respond right away or respond to conflict resolution or nonviolent communication to address the adversary. Tools used at this stage include: petitions, protest demonstrations, negotiation, mediation, and arbitration.

===Stage 2: Satyagraha===
The conflict escalates into [[satyagraha]], or nonviolent direct action, only when conflict resolution has been tried and the other party has not been persuaded by reason or the other tools used in Stage 1. Satyagraha invokes what Gandhi called "the law of suffering"—taking on rather than inflicting the suffering that is inherent in the situation.

Invoking satyagraha is a way to move the heart of the adversary, as opposed to appealing merely to the head, in Stage 1. Gandhi observed: "The conviction has been growing upon me that things of fundamental importance to the people are not secured by reason alone, but have to be purchased with their suffering. If you want something really important to be done, you must not merely satisfy the reason, you must move the heart also. The penetration of the heart comes from suffering."&lt;ref&gt;K. Shridharani, "War without Violence" P. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Tools used at this stage include: strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience, defiance of orders.

===Stage 3: Sacrifice: the last resort===
When the conflict has reached life-or-death intensity and when petition and nonviolent resistance have failed, a satyagrahi will sometimes deliberately court the possibility of death as a last resort to open the heart of the opponent. Gandhi's famous "fasts unto death" during the Indian freedom struggle is an example, as well as the courageous work of activists like [[Kathy Kelly]] who, when all else failed, have repeatedly gone into war zones to share the fate of the victims and awaken their oppressors.

The philosophy behind Stage 3 is that being willing to risk dying can often awaken a stubborn adversary even if death does not ensue. Fasting unto death, for example, when contrasted with self-immolation, gives the opponent a chance to respond and save the life of the satyagrahi in question. Self-immolation should perhaps be considered an extreme form of protest rather than the final stage in nonviolent persuasion.

===How to use the conflict escalation curve===
The conflict escalation curve helps those in a movement have a sense of where they are in their conflict and what is an appropriate response; it would be wrong to reach for an extreme method like fasting (which is Stage 3: Sacrifice) in a situation when all available tools in Stage 1 or 2 have not been tried.

For example, in 2003, US President [[George W. Bush]] dismissed the global anti-Iraq protests, the largest such protests since the Vietnam War, as "a focus group," saying: "Size of protest—it's like deciding, well, I'm going to decide policy based upon a focus group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stevenson|first1=Richard|title=Antiwar Protests Fail to Sway Bush on Plans for Iraq|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/19/international/middleeast/19IRAQ.html|accessdate=4 December 2014|agency=NY Times|date=2003-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President's lack of acknowledgement of protesters' demands as well as his unwillingness to engage in negotiations were an indication that it was necessary for the movement to quickly move to Stage 2 if they were to get any response. This was not forthcoming.

==Systems view==
Carol Moore, a later theorist, examined and described Gandhi's methods from the perspective of systems theory.{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[Jay Forrester]] and [[Donella Meadows]] observed that people in crisis would often push the [[twelve leverage points]] towards escalation in the first stage, and then reduce escalation when the resistance had weakened and it was impossible to maintain the status quo.{{cn|date=February 2007}}

'''Conflict management''' is the process of limiting the negative aspects of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] while increasing the positive aspects of conflict. The aim of conflict management is to enhance [[learning]] and group outcomes, including effectiveness or performance in an organizational setting.&lt;ref name="rahim 208"&gt;Rahim, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; Properly managed conflict can improve group outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Alpert, Tjosvaldo, &amp; Law, 2000; Bodtker &amp; Jameson, 2001; Rahim &amp; Bonoma, 1979; Kuhn &amp; Poole, 2000; DeChurch &amp; Marks, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict resolution==
[[Conflict resolution]] involves the reduction, elimination, or termination of all forms and types of conflict. Five styles for conflict management, as identified by Thomas and Kilmann, are: competing, compromising, collaborating, avoiding, and accommodating.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Brief for the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode, CPP Research Department, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses can benefit from appropriate types and levels of conflict. That is the aim of conflict management, and not the aim of conflict resolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Conflict management does not imply conflict resolution.

Conflict management minimizes the negative outcomes of conflict and promotes the positive outcomes of conflict with the goal of improving learning in an organization.&lt;ref name="rahim 208"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muddaser.com/conflict-management-resolution-strategies-process-steps/|title=Conflict management|last=Altaf|first=Muddaser|date=|website=muddaser.com/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly managed conflict increases [[organizational learning]] by increasing the number of questions asked and encourages people to challenge the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Luthans, Rubach, &amp; Marsnik, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organizational conflict]] at the interpersonal level includes disputes between peers as well as supervisor-subordinate conflict. [[Party-directed mediation]] (PDM) is a mediation approach particularly suited for disputes between co-workers, colleagues or peers, especially deep-seated interpersonal conflict, multicultural or multiethnic disputes. The mediator listens to each party separately in a pre-caucus or pre-mediation before ever bringing them into a joint session. Part of the pre-caucus also includes coaching and role plays. The idea is that the parties learn how to converse directly with their adversary in the joint session. Some unique challenges arise when organizational disputes involve supervisors and subordinates. The Negotiated Performance Appraisal (NPA) is a tool for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and is particularly useful as an alternate mediation model because it preserves the hierarchical power of supervisors while encouraging dialogue and dealing with differences in opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7conflict/ Party-Directed Mediation: Facilitating Dialogue Between Individuals''] (on-line 3rd Edition, 2014) by [[Gregorio Billikopf]], University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orientations to conflict==
There are three orientations to conflict: lose-lose, win-lose, and [[win-win]]. The lose-lose orientation is a type of conflict that tends to end negatively for all parties involved. A win-lose orientation results in one victorious party, usually at the expense of the other. The win-win orientation is one of the most essential concepts to conflict resolution. A win-win solution arrived at by integrative bargaining may be close to optimal for both parties. This approach engages in a [[Cooperation|cooperative]] approach rather than a competitive one.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Wood 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the win-win concept is the ideal orientation, the notion that there can only be one winner is constantly being reinforced in American culture:

"The win-lose orientation is manufactured in our society in athletic competition, admission to academic programs, industrial promotion systems, and so on. Individuals tend to generalize from their objective win-lose situations and apply these experiences to situations that are not objectively [[Lump of labour fallacy|fixed-pies]]".&lt;ref&gt;Spangle and Isenhart 14&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of mentality can be destructive when communicating with different cultural groups by creating barriers in negotiation, resolution and compromise; it can also lead the "loser" to feel mediocre. When the win-win orientation is absent in negotiation, different responses to conflict may be observed.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Early conflict management models===
Blake and Mouton (1964) were among the first to present a conceptual scheme for classifying the modes (styles) for handling interpersonal conflicts in five types: forcing, withdrawing, smoothing, compromising, and problem solving.

In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began using the intentions of the parties involved to classify the styles of conflict management that they included in their models. Both Thomas (1976) and Pruitt (1983) put forth a model based on the concerns of the parties involved in the conflict. The combination of the parties' concern for their own interests (i.e. [[assertiveness]]) and their concern for the interests of those across the table (i.e. cooperativeness) yielded a particular conflict management style. Pruitt called these styles yielding (low assertiveness/high cooperativeness), problem solving (high assertiveness/high cooperativeness), inaction (low assertiveness/low cooperativeness), and contending (high assertiveness/low cooperativeness). Pruitt argues that problem-solving is the preferred method when seeking mutually beneficial options (win-win).

===Khun and Poole's model===
Khun and Poole (2000) established a similar system of group conflict management. In their system, they split Kozan's confrontational model into two sub models: distributive and integrative.
* Distributive – Here conflict is approached as a distribution of a fixed amount of positive outcomes or resources, where one side will end up winning and the other losing, even if they do win some concessions.
* Integrative – Groups utilizing the integrative model see conflict as a chance to integrate the needs and concerns of both groups and make the best outcome possible. This model has a heavier emphasis on compromise than the distributive model. Khun and Poole found that the integrative model resulted in consistently better task related outcomes than those using the distributive model.

===DeChurch and Marks's meta-taxonomy===
DeChurch and Marks (2001) examined the literature available on conflict management at the time and Ni established what they claimed was a "meta-taxonomy" that encompasses all other models.

They argued that all other styles have inherent in them into two dimensions:
* activeness ("the extent to which conflict behaviors make a responsive and direct rather than inert and indirect impression"). High activeness is characterized by openly discussing differences of opinion while fully going after their own interest. 
* [[agreeableness]] ("the extent to which conflict behaviors make a pleasant and relaxed rather than unpleasant and strainful impression"). High agreeableness is characterized by attempting to satisfy all parties involved.

In the study DeChurch and Marks conducted to validate this division, activeness did not have a significant effect on the effectiveness of conflict resolution, but the agreeableness of the conflict management style, whatever it was, did have a positive impact on how groups felt about the way the conflict was managed, regardless of the outcome.

===Rahim's meta-model===

Rahim (2002) noted that there is agreement among management scholars that there is no one best approach to how to make decisions, lead or manage conflict.

In a similar vein, rather than creating a very specific model of conflict management, Rahim created a meta-model (in much the same way that DeChurch and Marks, 2001, created a meta-taxonomy) for conflict styles based on two dimensions, concern for self and concern for others.

Within this framework are five management approaches: integrating, obliging, dominating, avoiding, and compromising.
* Integration involves openness, exchanging information, looking for alternatives, and examining differences so solve the problem in a manner that is acceptable to both parties.
* Obliging is associated with attempting to minimize the differences and highlight the commonalities to satisfy the concern of the other party.
* Dominating in this style one party goes all out to win his or her objective and, as a result, often ignores the needs and expectations of the other party.
* Avoiding here a party fails to satisfy his or her own concern as well as the concern of the other party.
* Compromising involves give-and-take whereby both parties give up something to make a mutually acceptable decision.&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==International conflict management==

Special consideration should be paid to conflict management between two parties from distinct cultures. In addition to the everyday sources of conflict, "misunderstandings, and from this counterproductive, pseudo conflicts, arise when members of one culture are unable to understand culturally determined differences in communication practices, traditions, and thought processing".&lt;ref&gt;Borisoff &amp; Victor, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, this has already been observed in the business research literature.

Renner (2007) recounted several episodes where managers from developed countries moved to less developed countries to resolve conflicts within the company and met with little success due to their failure to adapt to the conflict management styles of the local culture.

As an example, in Kozan's study noted above, he noted that Asian cultures are far more likely to use a harmony model of conflict management. If a party operating from a harmony model comes in conflict with a party using a more confrontational model, misunderstandings above and beyond those generated by the conflict itself will arise.

International conflict management, and the cultural issues associated with it, is one of the primary areas of research in the field at the time, as existing research is insufficient to deal with the ever-increasing contact occurring between international entities.

==Application==

===Higher education===
With only 14% of researched universities reporting mandatory courses in this subject, and with up to 25% of the manager day being spent on dealing with conflict, education needs to reconsider the importance of this subject. The subject warrants emphasis on enabling students to deal with conflict management.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p.&amp;nbsp;240&lt;/ref&gt;

"Providing more conflict management training in undergraduate business programs could help raise the emotional intelligence of future managers." The improvement of emotional intelligence found that employees were more likely to use problem-solving skills, instead of trying to bargain.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p.&amp;nbsp;241&lt;/ref&gt;

Students need to have a good set of social skills. Good communication skills allow the manager to accomplish interpersonal situations and conflict. Instead of focusing on conflict as a behavior issue, focus on the communication of it.&lt;ref&gt;Myers &amp; Larson, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;307&lt;/ref&gt;

With an understanding of the communications required, the student will gain the aptitude needed to differentiate between the nature and types of conflicts. These skills also teach that relational and procedural conflict needs a high degree of immediacy to resolution. If these two conflicts are not dealt with quickly, an employee will become dissatisfied or perform poorly.&lt;ref&gt;Myers &amp; Larson, p.&amp;nbsp;313&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the responsibility of companies to react. One option is to identify the skills needed in-house, but if the skills for creating workplace fairness are already lacking, it may be best to seek assistance from an outside organization, such as a developmental assessment center.

According to Rupp, Baldwin, and Bashur, these organizations "have become a popular means for providing coaching, feedback, and experiential learning opportunities".&lt;ref&gt;Rupp, Baldwin &amp; Bashshur, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;145&lt;/ref&gt; Their main focus is fairness and how it impacts employees' attitudes and performance.

These organizations teach competencies and what they mean.&lt;ref name="rupp 146"&gt;Rupp et al., p.&amp;nbsp;146&lt;/ref&gt; The students then participate in simulations. Multiple observers assess and record what skills are being used and then return this feedback to the participant. After this assessment, participants are then given another set of simulations to utilize the skills learned. Once again they receive additional feedback from observers, in hopes that the learning can be used in their workplace.

The feedback the participant receives is detailed, behaviorally specific, and high quality. This is needed for the participant to learn how to change their behavior.&lt;ref name="rupp 146"/&gt; In this regard, it is also important that the participant take time to self-reflect so that learning may occur.

Once an assessment program is utilized, action plans may be developed based on quantitative and qualitative data.&lt;ref&gt;Rupp et al., p.&amp;nbsp;159&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counseling===
When personal conflict leads to [[frustration]] and loss of [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]], [[counseling]] may prove to be a helpful antidote. Although few [[organization]]s can afford the luxury of having professional counselors on the staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or "listening with understanding", is little more than being a good listener —
something every manager should be.&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry P Knowles; Börje O Saxberg|title= Personality and leadership behavior |publisher= Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|location=Reading, Mass.|year=1971|isbn=|oclc=118832|doi= |nopp=true |page=Chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the simple process of being able to vent one's feelings—that is; to express them to a concerned and understanding listener–is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for the frustrated individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind, better able to cope with a personal difficulty that is affecting his work adversely. The nondirective approach is one effective way for [[Management|managers]] to deal with frustrated subordinates and co-workers.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=148–142|isbn=978-0-87620-540-2|oclc=2299496|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other more direct and more diagnostic ways that might be used in appropriate circumstances. The great strength of the nondirective approach (nondirective counseling is based on the [[client-centered therapy]] of [[Carl Rogers]]), however, lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and the fact that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor's diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. No one has ever been harmed by being listened to sympathetically and understandingly. On the contrary, this approach has helped many people to cope with problems that were interfering with their effectiveness on the job.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

'''Cultural studies''' is a field of theoretically, politically, and empirically engaged cultural analysis that concentrates upon the political dynamics of contemporary culture, its historical foundations, defining traits, conflicts, and contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp.388-396. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/d2310?journalCode=epda &lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies researchers generally investigate how cultural practices relate to wider systems of [[power (social and political)|power]] associated with or operating through social phenomena, such as [[ideology]], [[class structure]]s, [[nationality|national formations]], [[ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender]], and generation.  Cultural studies views cultures not as fixed, bounded, stable, and discrete entities, but rather as constantly interacting and changing sets of practices and processes.&lt;ref&gt;"Cultural studies" is not synonymous with either "[[area studies]]" or "[[ethnic studies]]," although there are many cultural studies practitioners working in both area studies and ethnic studies programs and professional associations (e.g. [[American studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[African-American studies]], [[Latino studies|Latina/o Studies]], [[European studies]], [[Latin American studies]], etc.).&lt;/ref&gt; The field of cultural studies encompasses a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. Although distinct from the discipline of [[cultural anthropology]] and the interdisciplinary field of [[ethnic studies]], cultural studies draws upon and has contributed to each of these fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/cultural-studies|title=cultural studies {{!}} interdisciplinary field|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural studies was initially developed by British academics in the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and has been subsequently taken up and transformed by scholars from many different disciplines around the world.  Cultural studies is avowedly and even radically interdisciplinary and can sometimes be seen as antidisciplinary. A key concern for cultural studies practitioners is the examination of the forces within and through which socially organized people conduct and participate in the construction of their everyday lives.&lt;ref&gt;Pain, R. and Smith, S. eds., 2008. Fear: Critical geopolitics and everyday life. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Cultural Studies as a field of research is not concerned with the linguistically uncategorized experiences of individuals, or, in a more radical approach, holds that individual experiences do not exist, being always the result of a particular social-political context.

Cultural studies combines a variety of politically engaged critical approaches drawn including [[semiotics]], [[Marxism]], [[feminist theory]], [[ethnography]], [[critical race theory]], [[post-structuralism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[social theory]], [[political theory]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[literary theory]], [[Media influence|media theory]], [[film studies|film/video studies]], [[communication studies]], [[political economy]], [[translation studies]], [[museum studies]] and [[art history|art history/criticism]] to study cultural phenomena in various societies and historical periods. Cultural studies seeks to understand how meaning is generated, disseminated, contested, bound up with systems of power and control, and produced from the social, political and economic spheres within a particular social formation or conjuncture. Important theories of [[cultural hegemony]] and [[Structure or agency|agency]] have both influenced and been developed by the cultural studies movement, as have many recent major communication theories and agendas, such as those that attempt to explain and analyze the cultural forces related to processes of [[globalization]].

During the rise of [[neo-liberalism]] in Britain and the US, cultural studies both became a global movement, and attracted the attention of many conservative opponents both within and beyond universities for a variety of reasons.  Some left-wing critics associated particularly with Marxist forms of political economy also attacked cultural studies for allegedly overstating the importance of cultural phenomena.  While cultural studies continues to have its detractors, the field has become a kind of a worldwide movement that is to this day associated with a raft of scholarly associations and programs, annual international conferences, publications and students and practitioners from [[Taiwan]] to [[Amsterdam]] and from [[Bangalore]] to [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, Michael (2009), [http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-the-Matter-With/48334 "What's the Matter with Cultural Studies?"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cultstud.org/index.php?s=resources "Cultural Studies Associations, Networks and Programs"], extensive, but incomplete, list of associations, networks and programs as found on the website for the Association of Cultural Studies, Tampere, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;  Somewhat distinct approaches to cultural studies have  emerged in different national and regional contexts such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Italy.

==Characteristics==
In his 1994 book, ''Introducing Cultural Studies'', [[Ziauddin Sardar]] lists the following five main characteristics of cultural studies:&lt;ref&gt;Sardar, Ziauddin and Van Loon, Borin (1994). ''Introducing Cultural Studies.'' New York: Totem Books&lt;/ref&gt;

*The aim of cultural studies is to examine cultural practices and their relation to [[power (sociology)|power]]. For example, a study of a [[subculture]] (such as white working class youth in London) would consider their social practices against those of the dominant culture (in this example, the middle and upper classes in London who control the political and financial sectors that create policies affecting the well-being of white working class youth in London).
*The objective of cultural studies includes understanding culture in all its complex forms and analyzing the social and political context in which culture manifests itself.
*Cultural studies is a site of both study/analysis and political criticism/action. (For example, not only would a cultural studies scholar study an object, but s/he would connect this study to a larger, progressive political project.)
*Cultural studies attempts to expose and reconcile constructed divisions of [[knowledge]] that purport to be grounded in nature.
*Cultural studies has a commitment to an ethical evaluation of modern [[society]] and to a [[Radicalization|radical]] line of political action.

==History==
As Dennis Dworkin writes,&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Dennis. ''Cultural Marxism in Post-War Britain: History, the New Left, and the Origins of Cultural Studies'' (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1997), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; "a critical moment" in the beginning of cultural studies as a field was when [[Richard Hoggart]] used the term in 1964 in founding the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] (CCCS) at the [[University of Birmingham]] in the UK, which was to become home for the development of the intellectual orientation that has become known internationally as the "Birmingham School" of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;see also Corner, John (1991), "Postscript: Studying Culture—Reflections and Assessment: An Interview with Richard Hoggart." ''Media, Culture and Society'', Vol. 13, No. 2, April.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] at the university thus became the world's first institutional home of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/research/projects/cccs/about.aspx|title=About the Birmingham CCCS - University of Birmingham|website=www.birmingham.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoggart appointed [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] as his assistant, and Hall was effectively directing [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] by 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Davies, "British Cultural Marxism," ''International Journal of Politics, Culture and Society'' 4(3) (1991): 323-344, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall formally assumed the directorship of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] in 1971, when Hoggart left Birmingham to become Assistant Director-General of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hoggart, An Idea and Its Servants: UNESCO from Within.  Newark, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the field of cultural studies became closely associated with Hall's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morley &amp; Chen (eds.)|title=Stuart Hall: Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilroy, Grossberg and McRobbie (eds.)|title=Without Guarantees: In Honour of Stuart Hall|date=2000|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, Hall left Birmingham to accept a prestigious chair in Sociology at the Open University in the UK, and Richard Johnson took over the directorship of the Centre.

In the late 1990s, "restructuring" at the [[University of Birmingham]] led to the elimination of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] and the creation of a new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS) in 1999.  Then, in 2002, the University of Birmingham's senior administration abruptly announced the disestablishment of CSS, provoking a substantial international outcry.  The immediate reason for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's [[Research Assessment Exercise]] of 2001, though a dean from the university attributed the decision to "inexperienced ‘macho management.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Frank|title=Cultural Studies and Sociology at, and After, the Closure of the Birmingham School|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2004|volume=18|issue=6|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RAE, a holdover initiative of the [[Margaret Thatcher]]-led UK government of 1986,  determines research funding for university programs.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Polly (2002), [http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/socialsciences/story/0,,745058,00.html "Birmingham's cultural studies department given the chop"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous published accounts of the history of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Graeme|title=British Cultural Studies: An Introduction|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartley|first1=John|title=A Short History of Cultural Studies|date=2003|publisher=Sage|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1980|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stuart Hall's directorship of CCCS at Birmingham===
Beginning in 1964, after the initial appearance of the founding works of British Cultural Studies in the late 1950s, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]'s pioneering work at [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]], along with that of his colleagues and postgraduate students including [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Dick Hebdige]], David Morley, Charlotte Brunsdon, John Clarke, [[Richard Dyer]], Judith Williamson, Richard Johnson, Iain Chambers, Dorothy Hobson, Chris Weedon, Tony Jefferson, Michael Green and [[Angela McRobbie]], gave shape and substance to the field of cultural studies.  Many cultural studies scholars employed [[Marxist]] methods of analysis, exploring the relationships between cultural forms ([[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|the superstructure]]) and that of the political economy ([[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|the base]]).  By the 1970s, the work of [[Louis Althusser]] radically rethought the Marxist account of "base" and "superstructure" in ways that had a significant influence on the "Birmingham School."  Much of the work done at [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] studied youth subcultural expressions of antagonism toward "respectable" middle-class British culture in the post-WWII period.  Also during the 70s, the politically formidable British working classes were in decline.  Britain's manufacturing industries were fading and union rolls were shrinking.  Yet millions of working class Britons backed the rise of [[Margaret Thatcher]].  For Stuart Hall and his colleagues, this shift in loyalty from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had to be explained in terms of cultural politics, which they had been tracking even before Thatcher's victory.  Some of this work was presented in the cultural studies classic, ''Policing the Crisis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall, Critcher, Jefferson, Clarke &amp; Roberts|title=Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State, and Law and Order|date=1978|publisher=Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other later texts such as Hall's ''The Hard Road to Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|title=The Hard Road to Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left|date=1988|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''New Times: The Changing Face of Politics in the 1990s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall &amp; Jacques (eds.)|title=New Times: The Changing Face of Politics in the 1990s|date=1991|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To trace the development of British Cultural Studies, see, for example, the work of [[Richard Hoggart]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Raymond Williams]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Angela McRobbie]], [[Paul Gilroy]], David Morley, Charlotte Brunsdon, [[Richard Dyer]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uniteyouthdublin.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/john_storey_what_is_cultural_studies_a_readerbookzz-org.pdf|title=What is Cultural Studies?|last=Storey|first=John|date=1996|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural studies in the late-1970s and beyond===
By the late 1970s, scholars associated with [[The Birmingham School]] had firmly placed questions of gender and race on the cultural studies agenda, where they have remained ever since.  Also by the late 1970s, cultural studies had begun to attract a great deal of international attention.  It spread globally throughout the 1980s and 90s.  As it did so, it both encountered new conditions of knowledge production, and engaged with other major international intellectual currents such as poststructuralism, postmodernism and postcolonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas &amp; Erni (eds.)|title=Internationalizing Cultural Studies: An Anthology|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wide range of cultural studies journals now located throughout the world, as shown below, is one indication of the globalization of the field.

==Developments outside the UK==
In the US, prior to the emergence of British Cultural Studies, several versions of cultural analysis had emerged largely from pragmatic and liberal-pluralist philosophical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when British Cultural Studies began to spread internationally in the late 1970s, and to engage with feminism, poststructuralism, postmodernism and race in the late 70s and 1980s, critical cultural studies (i.e., Marxist, feminist, poststructuralist, etc.) expanded tremendously in US universities in fields such as communication studies, education, sociology and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|Nelson|Treichler|1992|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren &amp; Vavrus (eds.)|title=American Cultural Studies|date=2002|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartley &amp; Pearson (eds.)|title=American Cultural Studies: A Reader|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cultural Studies (journal)|Cultural Studies]]'', the flagship journal of the field, has been based in the US since its founding editor, [[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]], brought it there from Australia in 1987.

A thriving cultural studies scene has existed in [[Australia]] since the late 1970s, when several key CS practitioners emigrated there from the UK, taking British Cultural Studies with them, after [[Margaret Thatcher]] became Prime Minister of the UK in 1979.  A school of cultural studies known as "cultural policy studies" is one of the distinctive Australian contributions to the field, though it is not the only one.  Australia also gave birth to the world's first professional cultural studies association (now known as the Cultural Studies Association of Australasia) in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frow &amp; Morris (eds.)|title=Australian Cultural Studies: A Reader|date=1993|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner (ed.)|first1=Graeme|title=Nation, Culture, Text: Australian Cultural and Media Studies|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural studies journals based in Australia include ''[[International Journal of Cultural Studies]]'', ''[[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]]'' and ''Cultural Studies Review''.

In [[Canada]], cultural studies has sometimes focused on issues of [[technology and society]], continuing the emphasis in the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Harold Innis]], and others.  Cultural studies journals based in Canada include ''Topia: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies''.

In Africa, [[human rights]] and [[Third World]] issues are among the central topics treated.  Cultural Studies journals based in Africa include the ''[[Journal of African Cultural Studies]]''.

In [[Latin America]], cultural studies has drawn on thinkers such as [[José Martí]], [[Ángel Rama]] and other Latin American figures, in addition to the Western theoretical sources associated with cultural studies in other parts of the world.  Leading Latin American cultural studies scholars include [[Néstor García Canclini]], [[Jésus Martín-Barbero]], and [[Beatriz Sarlo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarto, Ríos &amp; Trigo (eds.)|title=The Latin American Cultural Studies Reader|date=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irwin &amp; Szurmuck (eds.)|title=Dictionary of Latin American Cultural Studies|date=2012|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the key issues addressed by Latin American cultural studies scholars are [[decoloniality]], [[urban culture]]s, and [[postdevelopment theory]].  Latin American cultural studies journals include the ''Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies''.

Even though cultural studies developed much more rapidly in the UK than in continental Europe, there is a significant cultural studies presence in countries such as France, Spain and Portugal.  The field is relatively undeveloped in Germany, probably due to the continued influence of the [[Frankfurt School]], which is now often said to be in its third generation, which includes notable figures such as [[Axel Honneth]].  Cultural studies journals based in continental Europe include the ''[[European Journal of Cultural Studies]]'', the ''Journal of Spanish Cultural Studies'', ''[[French Cultural Studies]]'', and ''Portuguese Cultural Studies''.

In Germany, the term ''cultural studies'' specifically refers to the field in the Anglo-sphere especially British Cultural Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=GEkqO--HndgC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314&amp;dq=cultural+studies+in+deutschen+Kontext&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MGHZhanE3M&amp;sig=QHeWMp6GMLv_WNbX3evkxYhTGcY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2756p493QAhUGtRQKHRQSDxgQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20studies%20in%20deutschen%20Kontext&amp;f=false|title=Normativität: Über die Hintergründe sozialwissenschaftlicher Theoriebildung|last=Ahrens|first=Johannes|last2=Beer|first2=Raphael|last3=Bittlingmayer|first3=Uwe H.|last4=Gerdes|first4=Jürgen|date=2011-02-10|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=9783531930107|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; to differentiate it from the German [[:de:Kulturwissenschaft|Kulturwissenschaft]] which developed along different lines and is characterized by its distance from political science. However, Kulturwissenschaft and cultural studies are often used interchangeably, particularly by lay persons.

Throughout Asia, cultural studies has boomed and thrived since at least the beginning of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen &amp; Huat (eds.)|title=The Inter-Asia Cultural Studies Reader|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural studies journals based in Asia include ''[[Inter-Asia Cultural Studies]]''. In India the Centre for Study of Culture and Society, Bangalore and the Department of Cultural Studies at The English and Foreign Languages University Hyderabad at two major institutional spaces for Cultural Studies.

==Issues, concepts and approaches==

===Marxism, feminism, race and culture===
As noted above, Marxism has been an important influence upon cultural studies. Those associated with [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] initially engaged deeply with the [[structuralism]] of [[Louis Althusser]], and later in the 1970s turned decisively toward [[Antonio Gramsci]]. Cultural studies has also embraced the examination of race, gender, and other aspects of identity, as is illustrated, for example, by a number of key books published collectively under the name of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] in the late 1970s and early 80s, including ''Women Take Issue: Aspects of Women's Subordination'' (1978), and ''The Empire Strikes Back: Race and Racism in 70s Britain'' (1982).

===Gramsci and hegemony===
To understand the changing political circumstances of class, politics and culture in the United Kingdom, scholars at [[The Birmingham School]] turned to the work of [[Antonio Gramsci]], an Italian thinker, writer and communist party leader of the 1910s, 20s and '30s.  Gramsci had been concerned with similar issues: why would Italian laborers and peasants vote for fascists?  What strategic approach is necessary to mobilize popular support in more progressive directions?  Gramsci modified [[classical Marxism]], and argued that culture must be understood as a key site of political and social struggle.  In his view, capitalists used not only brute force (police, prisons, repression, military) to maintain control, but also penetrated the everyday culture of working people in a variety of ways in their efforts to win popular "consent."  It is important to recognize that for Gramsci, historical leadership, or "hegemony," involves the formation of alliances between class factions, and struggles within the cultural realm of everyday common sense.  Hegemony was always, for Gramsci, an interminable, unstable and contested process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|author-link1=Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|title=Gramsci's Relevance for the Study of Race and Ethnicity |journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|date=June 1986|volume=10|issue=2 |pages=5–27|doi=10.1177/019685998601000202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Lash]] writes:
{{quote|text=In the work of Hall, Hebdige and McRobbie, popular culture came to the fore... What Gramsci gave to this was the importance of consent and culture.  If the fundamental Marxists saw power in terms of class-versus-class, then Gramsci gave to us a question of ''class alliance''. The rise of cultural studies itself was based on the decline of the prominence of fundamental class-versus-class politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lash|2007|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Edgar and Sedgwick write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The theory of [[hegemony]] was of central importance to the development of British cultural studies [particularly [[The Birmingham School]]. It facilitated analysis of the ways subordinate groups actively resist and respond to political and economic domination.  The subordinate groups needed not to be seen merely as the passive dupes of the dominant class and its ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar &amp; Sedgewick, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Structure and agency===
The development of hegemony theory in cultural studies was in some ways consonant with work in other fields exploring [[Structure and agency|agency]], a theoretical concept that insists on the active, critical capacities of subordinated peoples (e.g. the working classes, colonized peoples, women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giddens|first1=Anthony|title=The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration|date=1984|publisher=Polity Press|location=Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Stuart Hall famously argued in his 1981 essay, "Notes on Deconstructing 'the Popular'," "ordinary people are not cultural dopes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guins &amp; Cruz (eds.)|title=Popular Culture: A Reader|date=2005|publisher=Sage|location=London|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insistence on accounting for the agency of subordinated peoples runs counter to the work of traditional structuralists.  Some analysts have however been critical of some work in cultural studies that they feel overstates the significance of or even romanticizes some forms of popular cultural agency.

Cultural studies often concerns itself with agency at the level of the practices of everyday life, and approaches such research from a standpoint of radical contextualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grossberg|first1=Lawrence|title=Cultural Studies in the Future Tense|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, cultural studies rejects universal accounts of cultural practices,  meanings, and identities.

Judith Butler, an American feminist theorist whose work is often associated with cultural studies, wrote that

&lt;blockquote&gt;the move from a [[Structuralism|structuralist]] account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure. It has marked a shift from a form of [[Althusser]]ian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Judith|title=Further Reflections on Conversations of Our Time|journal=Diacritics|date=1997|volume=27|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Globalization===
In recent decades, as capitalist culture has spread throughout the world via contemporary forms of [[globalization]], cultural studies has generated important analyses of local sites and practices of negotiation with and resistance to Western hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization|date=1996|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural consumption===
Cultural Studies criticizes the traditional view of the passive consumer, particularly by underlining the different ways people ''read,'' receive and interpret cultural texts, or appropriate other kinds of cultural products, or otherwise participate in the production and circulation of meanings. On this view, a consumer can appropriate, actively rework or challenge the meanings circulated through cultural texts. In some of its variants, then, cultural studies has thus shifted the analytical focus from (traditional understandings of) production to consumption, which is nevertheless understood as a form of production (of meanings, of identities, etc.) in its own right. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[John Fiske (media studies)|John Fiske]], and others have been influential in these developments.

A special 2008 issue of the field's flagship journal, ''Cultural Studies'', examined "Anti-Consumerism" from a variety of cultural studies angles.  As Jeremy Gilbert noted in his contribution to this issue, cultural studies must grapple with the fact that “we now live in an era when, throughout the capitalist world, the overriding aim of government economic policy is to maintain consumer spending levels. This is an era when ‘consumer confidence’ is treated as the key indicator and cause of economic effectiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Jeremy|title=Against the Commodification of Everything|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2008|volume=22|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The concept of "text"===
Cultural studies, drawing upon and developing [[semiotics]], uses the concept of ''[[wikt:text|text]]'' to designate not only written language, but also [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[photography|photograph]]s, [[fashion]], [[hairstyle]]s, and so forth; the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture. This conception of textuality derives especially from the work of the pioneering and influential semiotician, [[Roland Barthes]], but also owes debts to other sources, such as [[Juri Lotman]] and his colleagues from [[Tartu–Moscow School]]. Similarly, the field widens the concept of "culture." "Culture," for a cultural studies researcher, includes not only  traditional [[high culture]] (the culture of [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]]s),&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail 1981. ''The Dialogic Imagination.'' Austin, TX: UT Press, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; but also everyday meanings and practices, which have, as noted above, become a central focus of cultural studies.  Cultural studies even approaches sites and spaces of everyday life, such as pubs, living rooms, gardens and beaches, as "texts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiske, Hodge and Turner|title=Myths of Oz: Reading Australian Popular Culture|date=1987|publisher=Boston|location=Allen &amp; Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Lewis (professor)|Jeff Lewis]] summarized much of the work on textuality and textual analysis in his cultural studies textbook and a post-9/11 monograph on media and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Lewis (2008) Cultural Studies, Sage, London; Jeff Lewis, (2005) Language Wars: The Role of Media and Culture in Global Terror and Political Violence, Pluto, London.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lewis, 'textual studies' use complex and difficult heuristic methods and require both powerful interpretive skills and a subtle conception of politics and contexts. The task of the cultural analyst, for Lewis, is to engage with both knowledge systems and texts, and observe and analyse the ways the two interact with one another.  This engagement represents the critical dimensions of the analysis, its capacity to illuminate the hierarchies within and surrounding the given text and its discourses.

==Academic reception==
Cultural studies has evolved through the confluence of various disciplines—anthropology, media and communication studies, literary studies, education, geography, philosophy, sociology, politics and others. While some have accused certain areas of cultural studies of meandering into political relativism and a kind of empty version of "postmodern" analysis, others hold that at its core, cultural studies provides a significant conceptual and methodological framework for cultural, social and economic critique.  This critique is designed to "deconstruct" the meanings and assumptions that are inscribed in the institutions, texts and practices that work with and through, and produce and re-present, culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2008|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}} Thus, while some scholars and disciplines like to dismiss cultural studies for its methodological openness and rejection of disciplinarity, its core strategies of critique and analysis have had a profound influence throughout the more progressive and critical areas of the social sciences and humanities. Cultural studies work on forms of social differentiation, control and inequality, identity, community-building, media, and knowledge production, for example, has had a substantial impact. Moreover, the influence of cultural studies has become increasingly evident in areas as diverse as [[translation studies]], health studies, international relations, development studies, computer studies, economics, archaeology, and neurobiology, as well as across the range of disciplines that initially shaped the emergence of cultural studies, including literature, sociology, communication studies, and anthropology.

Cultural studies has also diversified its own interests and methodologies, incorporating a range of studies on media policy, democracy, design, leisure, tourism, warfare and development. While certain key concepts such as ideology or discourse, class, hegemony, identity and gender remain significant, cultural studies has long engaged with and integrated new concepts and approaches such as deconstruction and postmodernism. The field thus continues to pursue political critique through its engagements with the forces of culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|During|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

The Blackwell ''Companion to Cultural Studies'', edited by leading cultural studies scholar Toby Miller, contains essays that analyze the development of cultural studies approaches within each of a wide range of disciplines across the contemporary social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2006|p=index}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary scholars===
Many cultural studies practitioners work in departments of English or Comparative Literature.  Nevertheless, some traditional literary scholars such as Yale professor [[Harold Bloom]] have been outspoken critics of cultural studies. On the level of methodology, these scholars dispute the theoretical underpinning of the movement's critical framework.

Bloom stated his position during the September 3, 2000 episode of [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Booknotes]]'', while discussing his book ''How to Read and Why'':

{{quote|text=[T]here are two enemies of reading now in the world, not just in the English-speaking world. One [is] the lunatic destruction of literary studies...and its replacement by what is called cultural studies in all of the universities and colleges in the English-speaking world, and everyone knows what that phenomenon is. I mean, the...now-weary phrase 'political correctness' remains a perfectly good descriptive phrase for what has gone on and is, alas, still going on almost everywhere and which dominates, I would say, rather more than three-fifths of the tenured faculties in the English-speaking world, who really do represent a treason of the intellectuals, I think, a 'betrayal of the clerks'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Read and Why|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?157968-1/read|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=April 19, 2017|date=September 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marxist literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] is not wholly opposed to cultural studies, but has criticised aspects of it and highlighted what he sees as its strengths and weaknesses in books such as ''After Theory'' (2003). For Eagleton, literary and cultural theory have the potential to say important things about the "fundamental questions" in life, but theorists have rarely realized this potential.

===Sociologists===
Cultural studies has also had a substantial impact on sociology.  For example, when Stuart Hall left [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] at Birmingham, it was to accept a prestigious professorship in Sociology at the Open University in Britain.  The subfield of cultural sociology, in particular, is disciplinary home to many cultural studies practitioners.  Nevertheless, there are some differences between sociology as a discipline and the field of cultural studies as a whole.  While sociology was founded upon various historic works purposefully distinguishing the subject from [[philosophy]] or [[psychology]], cultural studies has explicitly interrogated and criticized traditional understandings and practices of disciplinarity.  Most CS practitioners think it is best that cultural studies neither emulate disciplines nor aspire to disciplinarity for cultural studies. Rather, they promote a kind of radical interdisciplinarity as the basis for cultural studies.

One sociologist whose work has had a major influence upon cultural studies is [[Pierre Bourdieu]].  Bourdieu's work makes innovative use of statistics and in-depth interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Harker, Cheleen Mahar, Chris Wilkes (eds), ''An Introduction to the Work of Pierre Bourdieu: The Theory of Practice''. Houndmills: Macmillan, 1990, pp. 68-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourdieu|first1=Pierre|title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste|date=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although Bourdieu's work has been highly influential within cultural studies, and although Bourdieu regarded his work as a form of science, cultural studies has never embraced the idea that it should aspire toward "scientificity," and has marshalled a wide range of theoretical and methodological arguments against the fetishization of "scientificity" as a basis for cultural studies.

Two sociologists who have been critical of cultural studies, [[Chris Rojek]] and [[Bryan S. Turner]], argue in their article, "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn", that cultural studies, particularly the flavor championed by Stuart Hall, lacks a stable research agenda, and privileges the contemporary reading of texts, thus producing an ahistorical theoretical focus. Many, however, would argue, following Hall, that cultural studies has always sought to avoid the establishment of a fixed research agenda; this follows from its critique of disciplinarity.  Moreover, Hall and many others have long argued against the misunderstanding that textual analysis is the sole methodology of cultural studies, and have practiced numerous other approaches, as noted above.  Rojek and Turner also level the accusation that there is "a sense of moral superiority about the correctness of the political views articulated" in cultural studies&lt;ref&gt;Rojek, Chris, and Bryan Turner, "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn." ''The Sociological Review'' 48.4 (2000): 629-648.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physicist Alan Sokal===
{{Main article|Sokal affair}}
In 1996, physicist [[Alan Sokal]] expressed his opposition to cultural studies by [[Sokal affair|submitting a hoax article]] to a cultural studies journal, ''[[Social Text]]''. The article, which was crafted as a parody of what Sokal referred to as the "fashionable nonsense" of [[postmodernism]], was accepted by the editors of the journal, which did not at the time practice peer review. When the paper appeared in print, Sokal published a second article in a self-described "academic gossip" magazine, ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', revealing his hoax on ''[[Social Text]]''. Sokal stated that his motivation stemmed from his rejection of contemporary critiques of scientific rationalism:

{{quote|text="Politically, I'm angered because most (though not all) of this silliness is emanating from the self-proclaimed Left. We're witnessing here a profound historical ''volte-face''. For most of the past two centuries, the Left has been identified with science and against obscurantism; we have believed that rational thought and the fearless analysis of objective reality (both natural and social) are incisive tools for combating the mystifications promoted by the powerful -- not to mention being desirable human ends in their own right. The recent turn of many "progressive" or "leftist" academic humanists and social scientists toward one or another form of epistemic relativism betrays this worthy heritage and undermines the already fragile prospects for progressive social critique. Theorizing about "the social construction of reality" won't help us find an effective treatment for AIDS or devise strategies for preventing global warming. Nor can we combat false ideas in history, sociology, economics and politics if we reject the notions of truth and falsity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies"], [[Alan Sokal]], English translation of article from ''Lingua Franca'', 1996. Physics.nyu.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Founding works==
Hall and others have identified some core originating texts, or the original "curriculum", of the field of cultural studies:
* [[Richard Hoggart]]'s ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]''
* [[Raymond Williams]]' ''[[Culture and Society]]'' and ''[[The Long Revolution]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1980|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2015}}

{{More footnotes|date=May 2014}}

A '''cultural universal''' (also called an '''anthropological universal''' or '''human universal'''), as discussed by [[Emile Durkheim]], [[George Murdock]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] and others, is an element, pattern, trait, or institution that is common to all [[human culture]]s worldwide. Taken together, the whole body of cultural universals is known as the [[human condition]]. [[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.&lt;ref name="Psychology"&gt;Schacter, Daniel L, Daniel Wegner and Daniel Gilbert. 2007. ''Psychology''. Worth Publishers. pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Some anthropological and sociological theorists that take a [[cultural relativist]] perspective may deny the existence of cultural universals: the extent to which these universals are "cultural" in the narrow sense, or in fact biologically inherited [[ethology|behavior]] is an issue of "[[nature versus nurture]]".

==General==
The emergence of these universals dates to the [[Upper Paleolithic]], with the first evidence of full [[behavioral modernity]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Bold claim, no source...|date=July 2018}}

==Non-nativist explanations==
The observation of the same or similar behavior in different cultures does not prove that they are the results of a common underlying psychological mechanism. One possibility is that they may have been invented independently due to a common practical problem.&lt;ref&gt;Language: The cultural tool DL Everett - 2012 - Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;

Since any cultures that have been [[anthropology|studied by anthropologists]] have had contact with at least the anthropologists that studied it, and anthropological [[research ethics]] slows the studies down so that other groups unbound by such ethics, often at least locally represented by people of the same skin color as the supposedly isolated tribe but significantly culturally globalized, reach the tribe before the anthropologists do, no truly uncontacted culture has ever been scientifically studied.&lt;ref&gt;Fam Med. 2008 Jan;40(1) Continuing professional development in sensitive cultures. Huntington MK1.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows outside influence to be an explanation for cultural universals as well.&lt;ref&gt;Equal Recognition: The Moral Foundations of Minority Rights, Alan Patten 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This does not preclude multiple independent inventions of [[civilization]] and is therefore not the same thing as [[hyperdiffusionism]], it merely means that cultural universals are not proof of [[innateness]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultures and Globalization: Cultural Expression, Creativity and Innovation, Helmut K Anheier, Yudhishthir Raj Isar 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication bias in population level universals==
Anthropology's application of one ordinary evidence standard for data that agrees with its theories of cultural universals and one extraordinary standard of evidence for data that disagree with it raises issues with population level [[publication bias]]. While it is possible with strong enough evidence for the validity of one case study that disagree to pass [[peer review]], those that agree will statistically do so more often than those that disagree even if the level of evidence is the same. Since multiple field studies regarding the same culture are combined when statistical prevalences of behaviors are assessed, the result may cause appearances of behaviors having a supposedly universal statistical demographic even if it does not. Some anthropologists suggest that this may give an appearance of statistics such as more men than women hunting large prey being universal without actually being universal, for example that field studies in which more men than women hunted passed peer review while field studies for the same culture in which the genders were equal or inverted for hunting were not published. &lt;ref&gt;"Epidemiology and Culture: Anthropology, Anthropology", CTI Reviews, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Evaluating Scientific Research: Separating Fact from Fiction", Fred Leavitt, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cyber-dissident''' is a professional journalist, an activist or [[citizen journalist]] who posts news, information, or commentary on the [[internet]] that implies criticism of a [[government]] or [[regime]].

The practice of cyber-dissidence may have been inaugurated by Dr. Daniel Mengara, a [[Gabon]]ese scholar and activist living in political exile in [[New Jersey]] in the United States. In 1998, he created a website in French whose name ''Bongo Doit Partir'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bdpgabon.org Bongo Doit Partir]'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;/ref&gt; was clearly indicative of its purpose: it encouraged a revolution against the then 29-year-old regime of [[Omar Bongo]] in Gabon. The original URL, http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/|title=Bongo Doit Partir - Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau|website=www.globalwebco.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to redirect to http://www.bdpgabon.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdpgabon.org|title=Bongo Doit Partir - Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau|website=www.bdpgabon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 2000. Inaugurating what was to become common current-day practice in the politically involved [[blogosphere]], this movement's attempt at rallying the Gabonese around revolutionary ideals and actions has ultimately been vindicated by the 2011 [[Tunisia]]n and [[Egypt]]ian revolutions, where the Internet has proved to be an effective tool for instigating successful critique, opposition and revolution against dictators.

At least two [[Non-profit organizations|nonprofit organizations]] are currently working to raise awareness of the contributions of cyber-dissidents and to defend them against the [[human rights]] violations to which some of them are subjected:  [[Global Voices Online]] and [[Reporters Without Borders]].  The latter has released a ''Handbook For Bloggers and Cyber-Dissidents''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001152614/https://rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=542|title=Reporters sans frontières - Handbook for bloggers and cyber-dissidents|archivedate=1 October 2005|publisher=|url=https://rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains a roster of currently imprisoned cyber-dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206155535/http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=119|title=Reporters sans frontières - Cyberdissidents imprisoned|archivedate=6 February 2007|publisher=|url=http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee to Protect Bloggers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216041912/http://committeetoprotectbloggers.org/|title=Committee to Protect Bloggers|archivedate=16 December 2008|publisher=|url=http://committeetoprotectbloggers.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4278241.stm|title=Global blogger action day called|date=22 February 2005|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regions where [[Print media|print]] and [[Broadcast media|broadcast]] media are tightly controlled, [[Anonymity|anonymous]] online postings by cyber-dissidents may be the only source of information about the experiences, feelings, and opinions of ordinary citizens.  This advantage may be offset by the difficulty in assessing the [[good faith]] and accuracy of reports originating from anonymous sources.

Recently, social-media tools have been widely credited with igniting pervasive social upheavals, some of which have even brought down governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=John G.|date=2014-01-01|title=Sartre and Cyber-Dissidence: The Groupe en Fusion and the Putative We-Subject|url=https://www.berghahnjournals.com/abstract/journals/sartre-studies/20/1/ssi200102.xml|journal=Sartre Studies International|language=en-US|volume=20|issue=1|doi=10.3167/ssi.2014.200102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persecution==
{{Main|Political repression of cyber-dissidents}}

===Gabon===
In July 2003, [[Amnesty International]] reported the arrest of five Gabonese known to be members of the cyber-dissident group ''Bongo Doit Partir''. The five members were detained for three months (See: Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/001/2003/en|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/004/2003/en|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===China===
In 2003, [[Cai Lujun]] was imprisoned for posting a series of articles online under the pen name "盼民主"("expecting for democracy") criticizing the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/index.phpd?showsingle=45625] Cai Lujun, Imprisoned for Posting Internet Articles, Released at End of Sentence&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
In 2006, several [[blog]]gers in Egypt were arrested for allegedly defaming the president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and expressing critical views about Islam &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6164798.stm Egypt arrests another blog critic], ''[[BBC News]]'', 20 November 2006.  Retrieved on 29 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
In 2005, Mohamad Reza Nasab Abdolahi was imprisoned for publishing an open letter to [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]]; Mohamad's pregnant wife and other bloggers who commented on Mohamad's treatment were also imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, A. (2005), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4111330.stm Not just critics], ''[[BBC News]]'', 20 June 2005.  Retrieved on 29 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
When Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2006 called on his nation's women to have more children, journalist Vladimir Rakhmankov published a satiric article on the Internet calling Putin "''the nation's [[phallus|phallic symbol]]''". Rakhmankov was found guilty of offending Vladimir Putin, and fined by the court of the region he lived in to the sum equal of 680 USD. The overall story served as a good adversiting for Rakhmanov's article, that was republished by numerous Russian sources afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdf.ru/digest/digest/digest298e.shtml#part|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211509/http://www.gdf.ru/digest/digest/digest298e.shtml#part|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 September 2007|title=GLASNOST DEFENSE FOUNDATION'S DIGEST No. 298|date=27 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/6/DF7B2E15-2F9F-4A8B-AAF0-A7622F0D33F7.html Russia: 'Phallic' Case Threatens Internet Freedom] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111065759/http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/6/DF7B2E15-2F9F-4A8B-AAF0-A7622F0D33F7.html |date=11 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1071549.html|title=U.S. Media Watchdog Criticizes Russia|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Russian bloggers has supposed in 2003, that Russian state security service [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]], the main successor to the [[KGB]], created special teams of people who appear on various blogs to [[harass]] and [[intimidate]] [[political blog]]gers and thus effectively prevent free discussion of undesirable subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vestnik.com/issues/2003/0430/win/polyanskaya_krivov_lomko.htm|title=Анна ПОЛЯНСКАЯ, Андрей КРИВОВ, Иван ЛОМКО: ВИРТУАЛЬНОЕ ОКО СТАРШЕГО БРАТА [WIN]|website=www.vestnik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They referred to such tactics are known as "[[active measures]]". A Russian critic of this theory has noted in 2003, that security services have more important tasks than flooding in forums.&lt;ref name="Usup"&gt;[http://old.russ.ru/politics/20030426-yusup-pr.html Conspiracy theory], by Alexander Yusupovskiy, Russian Journal, 25 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The [[Digital Freedom Network]] has pointed out cases of imprisoning cyber-dissidents in Vietnam, such as the 2004 case of [[Pham Que Dong]], a former [[Vietnam People's Army|People's Army]] colonel, military [[historian]] who had quit the Communist Party in 1999.  For publicly discussing issues related to corruption in the official structures and encouraging democratic reforms, he was charged with "abuse of democratic freedoms" and imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Digital Freedom Network]] 30 July 2004: [http://www.dfn.org/VietnamsHumanRights.shtml Vietnam's Human Rights Situation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080737/http://www.dfn.org/VietnamsHumanRights.shtml |date=28 September 2007 }} by [[Alicia Burns]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">In the [[philosophy of technology]], the '''device paradigm''' is the way "[[Technology|technological]] [[tool|device]]s" are perceived and consumed in modern society, according to [[Albert Borgmann]]. It explains the intimate relationship between people, things and technological devices, defining most economic relations and also shapes [[social]] and [[moral]] relations in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral Fragments and Moral Community: A Proposal for Church in Society|last=Rasmussen|first=Larry|publisher=Fortress Press|year=1993|isbn=0800627571|location=Minneapolis|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the device paradigm is a critical response to the [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lovitt]], introduction to Heidegger's ''The Question Concerning Technology''&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely endorsed by philosophers of technology, including [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], and [[Eric Higgs (philosopher)|Eric Higgs]], as well as environmental philosopher [[David Strong]].

== Devices ==

For Borgmann, a '''device''' is a thing that is used as a means to an end. Therefore, a device is seen as "the compound of commodity and machinery" while "the distinctive pattern of division and connection of its components is the device paradigm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power Failure: Christianity in the Culture of Technology|last=Borgmann|first=Albert|publisher=Brazos Press|year=2003|isbn=1587430584|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is meant to signify or distinguish between technological devices and "focal things and practices," which matter to people in their everyday affairs.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p196.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A focal thing is something of ultimate concern and significance, which may be masked by the device paradigm, and must be preserved by its intimate connection with practice.&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann, (1984), p210.&lt;/ref&gt; Borgmann used the case of [[wine]] to explain this. He cited that the focal thing in [[winemaking]] involves the implements used to produce wine. Wine becomes a device when it employs technology and machinery not merely to produce wine but obtain specific qualities such as grapey, smooth, light, and fruity flavors or clean and clear appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Inquiry|last=Borgman|first=Albert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2009|isbn=0226066290|location=Chicago|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As technological devices increase the availability of a commodity or service, they also push these devices into the background where people do not pay attention to their destructive tendencies.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p41.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the technology of central heating means that warmth is readily available and family members can retreat into the solitude of their rooms instead of working to chop wood or stoke the fires. Social interaction is reduced and the family struggles to find activities that enable such nurturing and care for each other.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41" /&gt; The ubiquitous nature of information technology also makes it an important example of device paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XM7teVMRRQUC&amp;pg=PA352|title=Technology and the Good Life?|last=Higgs|first=Eric|last2=Light|first2=Andrew|last3=Strong|first3=David|date=2010-12-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226333885|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann (1984), p207.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''economy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] οίκος – "household" and νέμoμαι – "manage") is an area of the [[Production (economics)|production]], [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]], or [[trade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munim|first1=Ziaul Haque|last2=Schramm|first2=Hans-Joachim|title= The impacts of port infrastructure and logistics performance on economic growth  the mediating role of seaborne trade.|journal=Journal of Shipping and Trade|date=2018|pages=1–19|doi= 10.1186/s41072-018tr-0027-0|url= https://jshippingandtrade.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41072-018-0027-0|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[goods (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]] by different agents. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasises the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of resources'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London | page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain [[currency]]. However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain.

Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor, and capital.  It has changed over time due to [[technology]] (automation, accelerator of process, reduction of cost functions), [[innovation]] (new products, services, processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) such as, that which produces intellectual property and changes in [[industrial relations]] (for example, [[Child labour|child labor]] being replaced in some parts of the world with [[universal access to education]]).

A given economy is the result of a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure and legal systems, as well as its geography, natural resource endowment, and ecology, as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of human practices and transactions. It does not stand alone.

A [[market-based economy]] is one where [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]] are produced and exchanged according to [[demand]] and [[supply (economics)|supply]] between participants (economic agents) by [[barter]] or a [[medium of exchange]] with a [[credit (finance)|credit]] or [[debit]] [[value (economics)|value]] accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency.

A [[planned economy|command-based economy]] is one where political agents directly control what is produced and how it is sold and distributed.

A [[green economy]] is [[low-carbon]], resource efficient, and socially inclusive. In a green economy, growth in income and employment are driven by public and private investments that reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance energy and resource efficiency, and prevent the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="unep.org"&gt;http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/Portals/88/documents/ger/ger_final_dec_2011/1.0-Introduction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A gig economy is a term often used to describe when short-term jobs are assigned via online platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/10/06/how-governments-should-deal-with-the-rise-of-the-gig-economy|title=How governments should deal with the rise of the gig economy|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range==
Today the range of fields of the study examining the economy revolve around the [[social science]] of [[economics]], but may include [[sociology]] ([[economic sociology]]), [[history]] ([[economic history]]), [[anthropology]] ([[economic anthropology]]), and [[geography]] ([[economic geography]]). Practical fields directly related to the human activities involving [[Production (economics)|production]], [[distribution (economics)|distribution]], [[Trade|exchange]], and [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[goods and services]] as a whole, are [[engineering]], [[management]], [[business administration]], [[applied science]], and [[finance]].

All [[profession]]s, occupations, [[economic agent]]s or economic activities, contribute to the economy. [[Consumption (economics)|Consumption]], [[saving (money)|saving]], and [[investment]] are variable components in the economy that determine macroeconomic equilibrium. There are three main sectors of economic activity: [[Primary sector of the economy|primary]], [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary]], and [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary]].

Due to the growing importance of the economical sector in modern times,&lt;ref&gt;The volume of financial transactions in the 2008 global economy was 73.5 times higher than nominal world GDP, while, in 1990, this ratio amounted to "only" 15.3 ([http://www.wifo.ac.at/wwa/servlet/wwa.upload.DownloadServlet/bdoc/WP_2009_344$.PDF "A General Financial Transaction Tax: A Short Cut of the Pros, the Cons and a Proposal"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402082819/http://www.wifo.ac.at/wwa/servlet/wwa.upload.DownloadServlet/bdoc/WP_2009_344$.PDF |date=April 2, 2012 }}, Austrian Institute for Economic Research, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''real economy'' is used by analysts&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2009/07/23/meanwhile-in-the-real-economy/ "Meanwhile, in the Real Economy"], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', July 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/10/24/boes-haldane-bank-regulation-should-serve-real-economy/ "Bank Regulation Should Serve Real Economy"], ''Wall Street Journal'', October 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as well as politicians&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/08/15/perry-and-romney-trade-swipes-over-real-economy/ "Perry and Romney Trade Swipes Over ‘Real Economy'"], ''Wall Street Journal'', August 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the part of the economy that is concerned with the actual production of goods and services,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=real-economy "Real Economy"] definition in the ''Financial Times'' Lexicon&lt;/ref&gt; as ostensibly  contrasted with the ''paper economy'', or the financial side of the economy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://glossary.econguru.com/economic-term/real+economy "Real economy"] definition in the Economic Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; which is concerned with buying and selling on the financial markets.

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] words "economy" and "[[economics]]" can be traced back to the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|οἰκονόμος}} (i.e. "household management"), a composite word derived from {{lang|grc|οἶκος}} ("house;household;home") and νέμω ("manage; distribute;to deal out;dispense") by way of {{lang|grc|οἰκονομία}} ("household management").

The first recorded sense of the word "economy" is in the phrase "the management of œconomic affairs", found in a work possibly composed in a monastery in 1440. "Economy" is later recorded in more general senses, including "thrift" and "administration".

The most frequently used current sense, denoting "the economic system of a country or an area", seems not to have developed until the 1650s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/economy Dictionary.com], "economy." The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. [[Houghton Mifflin]] Company, 2004. October 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Ancient times ===
[[File:Pithoi in Knossos 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Storage room, Palace of Knossos.]]
{{See also|Palace economy}}
As long as someone has been making, supplying and distributing goods or services, there has been some sort of economy; economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complex. [[Sumer]] developed a large-scale economy based on [[commodity money]], while the [[Babylonians]] and their neighboring [[city states]] later developed the earliest system of [[economics]] as we think of, in terms of rules/laws on [[debt]], legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices, and private property.&lt;ref name=Sheila&gt;Sheila C. Dow (2005), "Axioms and Babylonian thought: a reply", ''Journal of Post Keynesian Economics'' '''27''' (3), p. 385-391.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics comparable to currently used civil society (law) concepts.&lt;ref name="yale2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hammint.htm|title=The Code of Hammurabi : Introduction|accessdate=September 14, 2007|publisher=Yale University|year=1915|author=Charles F. Horne, Ph.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records.

The ancient economy was mainly based on [[subsistence farming]]. The [[Shekel]] referred to an ancient unit of weight and currency. The first usage of the term came from [[Mesopotamia]] circa 3000 BC., and referred to a specific mass of [[barley]] which related other values in a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] such as silver, bronze, copper etc. A barley/shekel was originally both a unit of [[currency]] and a unit of weight, just as the British Pound was originally a unit denominating a one-pound mass of silver.

For most people, the exchange of goods occurred through social relationships. There were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces. In [[Ancient Greece]], where the present English word 'economy' originated, many people were [[bond slaves]] of the [[Freeholder (government)|freeholders]]. The economic discussion was driven by [[scarcity]].

=== Middle ages ===
[[File:German States Fugger 1621 10 Ducats.jpg|thumb|10 Ducats (1621), minted as circulating currency by the [[Fugger Family]].]]
In [[Medieval]] times, what we now call economy was not far from the subsistence level. Most exchange occurred within [[social groups]]. On top of this, the great conquerors raised [[venture capital]] (from ''ventura'', ital.; ''risk'') to finance their captures. The [[Capital (economics)|capital]] should be refunded by the goods they would bring up in the [[New World]]. Merchants such as [[Jakob Fugger]] (1459–1525) and [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]] (1360–1428) founded the first [[bank]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The discoveries of [[Marco Polo]] (1254–1324), [[Christopher Columbus]] (1451–1506) and [[Vasco da Gama]] (1469–1524) led to a first [[globalization|global]] economy. The first [[Company|enterprises]] were trading establishments. In 1513, the first [[stock exchange]] was founded in [[Antwerpen]]. Economy at the time meant primarily [[trade]].

=== Early modern times ===
The European captures became branches of the [[Europe]]an states, the so-called [[colonies]]. The rising [[nation-state]]s [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]] and the [[Netherlands]] tried to control the trade through [[custom duties]] and (from ''mercator'', lat.: [[merchant]]) was a first approach to intermediate between private wealth and [[public interest]].
The [[secularization]] in Europe allowed states to use the immense property of the church for the development of towns. The influence of the [[nobles]] decreased. The first [[Secretaries of State]] for economy started their work. [[Bankers]] like [[Amschel Mayer Rothschild]] (1773–1855) started to finance national projects such as wars and [[infrastructure]]. Economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the [[citizens]] of a state.

=== The Industrial Revolution ===
[[File:Hartmann Maschinenhalle 1868 (01).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Sächsische Maschinenfabrik]] in [[Chemnitz]], Germany, 1868]]
{{Main|Industrial Revolution}}

The first [[economist]] in the true modern meaning of the word was the Scotsman [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790) who was inspired partly by the ideas of  [[physiocracy]],  a reaction to mercantilism and also later Economics student, Adam Mari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/150712162/Physiocracy|title=An Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World- preview entry:Physiocrats &amp; physiocracy|publisher=Charles Scribner &amp; Sons|author=François Quesnay|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defined the elements of a [[national economy]]: [[Product (business)|products]] are offered at a [[natural price]] generated by the use of [[competition]] - [[supply and demand]] - and the [[division of labor]]. He maintained that the basic motive for [[free trade]] is human self-interest. The so-called self-interest hypothesis became the [[anthropological]] basis for economics. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] was a period from the 18th to the 19th century where major changes in [[agriculture]], [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], and [[transport]] had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions starting in the [[United Kingdom]], then subsequently spreading throughout [[Europe]], [[North America]], and eventually the [[world]]. The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human history; almost every aspect of daily life was eventually influenced in some way.
In Europe wild [[capitalism]] started to replace the system of [[mercantilism]] (today: [[protectionism]]) and led to [[economic growth]]. The period today is called [[industrial revolution]] because the system of [[Production (economics)|Production]], production and [[division of labor]] enabled the [[mass production]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]].

=== The invention of the economy ===
The contemporary concept of "the economy" wasn't popularly known until the American [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="invention"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Jacob|title=The Invention Of 'The Economy'|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/02/28/283477546/the-invention-of-the-economy|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=NPR - Planet Money|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the chaos of two [[World War]]s and the devastating Great Depression, policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy. This was explored and discussed by [[Friedrich August von Hayek]] (1899–1992) and [[Milton Friedman]] (1912–2006) who pleaded for a global [[free trade]] and are supposed to be the fathers of the so-called [[neoliberalism]]. However, the prevailing view was that held by [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946), who argued for a stronger control of the [[markets]] by the state. The theory that the state can alleviate economic problems and instigate economic growth through state manipulation of aggregate demand is called [[Keynesianism]] in his honor. In the late 1950s, the economic growth in America and Europe—often called [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (ger: ''economic miracle'') —brought up a new form of economy: [[mass consumption economy]]. In 1958, [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] (1908–2006) was the first to speak of an [[affluent society]]. In most of the countries the economic system is called a [[social market economy]].

=== Late 20th – beginning of 21st century ===
[[File:Aupark Tower 2009.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|[[ESET]] (IT security company) headquarters in [[Bratislava]], Slovakia.]]
With [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] and the transition of the countries of the Eastern Block towards democratic government and market economies, the idea of the [[post-industrial society]] is brought into importance as its role is to mark together the significance that the [[service sector]] receives at the place of the industrialization, as well
the first usage of this term, some relate it to Daniel Bell's 1973 book, ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'', while other - to social philosopher Ivan Illich's book, ''[[Tools for Conviviality]]''. The term is also applied in philosophy to designate the fading of [[postmodernism]] in the late 90s and especially in the beginning of the 21st century.

With the spread of [[Internet]] as a mass media and communication medium especially after 2000-2001, the idea for the Internet and [[information economy]] is given place because of the growing importance of ecommerce and electronic businesses, also the term for a global information society as understanding of a new type of "all-connected" society is created. In the late 2000s, the new type of economies and economic expansions of countries like China, Brazil, and India bring attention and interest to different from the usually dominating Western type economies and economic models.

== Economic phases of precedence ==
The economy may be considered as having developed through the following Phases or Degrees of Precedence.

* The [[Ancient history|ancient economy]] was mainly based on [[subsistence]] farming.
* The [[industrial revolution]] phase lessened the role of [[subsistence]] farming, converting it to more [[extensive farming|extensive]] and [[monoculture|mono-cultural]] forms of agriculture in the last three centuries. The economic growth took place mostly in mining, construction and manufacturing industries. [[Commerce]] became more significant due to the need for improved exchange and distribution of produce throughout the community.
* In the economies of modern [[consumer society|consumer societies]] phase there is a growing part played by [[Service (economics)|services]], [[finance]], and [[technology]]—the [[knowledge economy]].
In modern economies, these phase precedences are somewhat differently expressed by the [[three-sector theory]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
* '''[[Primary sector of the economy|Primary stage/degree of the economy]]:''' Involves the extraction and production of [[raw materials]], such as [[corn]], [[coal]], [[wood]] and [[iron]]. (A coal miner and a fisherman would be workers in the primary degree.)
* '''[[Secondary sector of the economy|Secondary stage/degree of the economy]]:''' Involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g. manufacturing steel into [[cars]], or [[textiles]] into clothing. (A builder and a dressmaker would be workers in the secondary degree.) At this stage the associated industrial economy is also sub-divided into several [[economic sectors]] (also called [[industries]]). Their separate evolution during the [[Industrial Revolution]] phase is dealt with elsewhere.
* '''[[Tertiary sector of the economy|Tertiary stage/degree of the economy]]:''' Involves the provision of services to consumers and businesses, such as [[baby-sitting]], [[film|cinema]] and [[banking]]. (A shopkeeper and an accountant would be workers in the tertiary degree.)
* '''[[Quaternary sector of the economy|Quaternary stage/degree of the economy]]:''' Involves the research and development needed to produce products from natural resources and their subsequent by-products. (A logging company might [[research]] ways to use partially burnt wood to be processed so that the undamaged portions of it can be made into pulp for paper.) Note that '''education''' is sometimes included in this sector.

Other sectors of the developed community include :

* the [[Public Sector]] or state sector (which usually includes: parliament, law-courts and government centers, various emergency services, public health, shelters for impoverished and threatened people, transport facilities, air/sea ports, post-natal care, hospitals, schools, libraries, museums, preserved historical buildings, parks/gardens, nature-reserves, some universities, national sports grounds/stadiums, national arts/concert-halls or theaters and centers for various religions).
* the [[Private Sector]] or privately run businesses.
* the [[Social sector]] or [[Voluntary sector]].

== Economic measures ==
There are a number of ways to measure economic activity of a nation. These methods of measuring economic activity include:

* [[Consumer spending]]
* [[Exchange rate]]
* [[Gross domestic product]]
* [[GDP per capita]]
* [[GNP]]
* [[Stock Market]]
* [[Interest rate]]
* [[Government debt]]
* [[Inflation|Rate of Inflation]]
* [[Unemployment]]
* [[Balance of Trade]]

=== GDP ===
The [[GDP]] - Gross domestic product of a country is a measure of the size of its economy. The most conventional economic analysis of a country relies heavily on economic indicators like the GDP and [[GDP per capita]]. While often useful, GDP only includes economic activity for which money is exchanged.

== Informal economy ==

[[File:Харьк.наб.л.8 Спекулянт VizuIMG 3671.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Black market peddler on graffiti, [[Kharkiv]]]]
{{Main|Informal economy}}

An informal economy is economic activity that is neither taxed nor monitored by a government, contrasted with a formal economy. The informal economy is thus not included in that government's [[gross national product]] (GNP). Although the informal economy is often associated with [[developing countries]], all economic systems contain an informal economy in some proportion.

Informal economic activity is a dynamic process which includes many aspects of economic and social theory including exchange, regulation, and enforcement. By its nature, it is necessarily difficult to observe, study, define, and measure. No single source readily or authoritatively defines informal economy as a unit of study.

The terms "under the table" and "off the books" typically refer to this type of economy. The term [[black market]] refers to a specific subset of the informal economy. The term "informal sector" was used in many earlier studies, and has been mostly replaced in more recent studies which use the newer term.

The informal sector makes up a significant portion of the economies in developing countries but  it is often stigmatized as troublesome and unmanageable. However the informal sector provides critical economic opportunities for the poor and has been expanding rapidly since the 1960s. As such, integrating the informal economy into the formal sector is an important policy challenge.

Economic research is conducted in fields as different as [[Economics]], [[Economic sociology]], [[Economic anthropology]], or [[Economic history]].

== Notes and commentaries within the ''Encyclopedia'' projects ==
The ''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential'' contains nearly 500 pages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/319419 Expanding Resources on International Organizations], a review by Chadwick F. Alger, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; of introductory notes and commentaries. Some of them just provide readers with usual information about the work content and its organization. Most of them, however, represent extensive reports on the exploratory work done by the editors in eight projects (also called research areas, or sections). Here are those projects, with illustrative examples of key ideas figuring in the notes and commentaries.

=== Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project ===
A first objective of the editors in that project&lt;ref name=encycintro&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/164014 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is to collect and present information on the following topics: the problems with which humanity perceives itself to be faced; the organizational, human, and intellectual resources it believes it has at its disposal; the values by which it is believed any change should be guided; the concepts of human development considered to be either the means or the end of any such social transformation. A second objective is to clarify the conceptual challenge of interrelating such plentiful and disparate or even contradictory information. A third objective is to enable alternation between viewpoints from different cultures, ideologies, beliefs and even "facts", as a way for individuals and societies to become empowered with an appropriate response to the problematic conditions of the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=5 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: significance]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=4 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: objectives].

Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the disagreement amongst the advocates of different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the ''Encyclopedia'' uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing an increasing number of people is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=2 World problems project – Significance: constraints on a problem-focused approach]. Uia.be (21 May 1973). Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=23 World problems project – Comments: general]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia'' databases are much about how problems, strategies, values, development concepts, and organizations are linked together. As a result, the possibility of focusing on [[feedback|feedback loops]] has proven to be an important feature of the ''Encyclopedia'', and a program has been carried out to identify "''vicious problem loops''". A vicious problem loop is a chain of problems, each aggravating the next, and with the last looping back to aggravate the first in the chain.  Here is an example: Man-made disasters, Vulnerability of ecosystem niches, Natural environment degradation, Shortage of natural resources, Unbridled competition for scarce resources, Man-made disasters. Solutions that focus on only one problem in a chain may fail or even be harmful, because the cycle has the capacity to regenerate itself, and also because several cycles may interlock, forming tangled skeins of interlinked global problems. The loop detection program detected more than 50,000 loops (of up to 9 elements) in more than 12,000 problem profiles. It is thought that a similar work could be done about mutually facilitating or constraining strategy loops, so as to constitute a dynamic response to aggravating or reducing loops of problems through a circle of matching strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=19 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: feedback loops and dependent co-arising].

=== World problems and global issues ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/285958 World problems project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; endeavors to present all the phenomena in society that are perceived negatively by groups transcending national frontiers. Those phenomena constitute a challenge to creative remedial action. Groups are strongly motivated by the [[problem]]s that infringe their values and arouse their indignation. As such, problems are a major stimulus driving the development of society. Although there is agreement that problems are numerous and that many are really serious, little effort has been made to determine how many problems there are. Likewise, while it is becoming increasingly evident that problems interact with one another, and constitute complex networks or systems, little effort has been made to map that [[complexity]]. The perceptions documented in that project raise useful questions concerning the nature and existence of problems, especially when other groups consider that one perception or another is irrelevant, misleading or misinformed. An aim of that research area, then, is to assemble information whose significance is collectively repressed, displaced onto some less threatening problems, or projected in the form of blame onto some other social group.&lt;ref name=sections&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=11 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Content: sections and sub-sections].

Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Views concerning problems are extremely varied. Several pages in the notes and commentaries deal with that variety. Problems are agenda items for assemblies or conferences; action targets for organizations; issues for political parties or governments; events or topics for the media; markets for businesses; sins for religions; puzzles for sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=8 World problems project – Criteria: problem disguises and problem evasion]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems can be viewed as synonymous with chaos and disorder, or as elements in an ordered array; as static or dynamic entities; as discrete or continuous phenomena; as objective things or subjective experiences; as directly experienceable phenomena or as indirect implications of seemingly innocent phenomena; as inherently comprehensible or incomprehensible entities; as the results of due processes or as spontaneous phenomena. For many people in the West problems may be considered as artifacts of concerned minds, about which reason, principles, or history are relevant, while in the East to conceive of life as presenting problems to be solved may be seen as a misconception of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=7 World problems project – Criteria: assumptions]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other pages of notes and commentaries deal extensively with the variety of points of view under headings such as ''Approaches to problems'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=24 World problems project – Comments: approaches to problems].

=== Global strategies and solutions ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/190 Global strategies project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; aims at identifying the complete range of [[strategy|strategies]] perceived by constituencies acting at the international level.

The conventional way of addressing any problem situation is to elaborate a strategy, but given the number, variety and interrelationships of the problems, it is uncertain whether any conventional strategy could be adequate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/304593 Global strategies project – Rationale]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, many groups have "answers" to the current crisis. The proponents of each such answer naturally attach special importance to their own as being of crucial relevance at this time, or even as being the only appropriate basis for a viable world society in the future. However, that focus on "answer production", a vital moving force in society, obscures the manner in which such answers, in the absence of integration between them, undermine each other’s significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=1 World problems project – Significance: acknowledgement of the universe of problems]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears to the editors that the elements of the strategic challenge at this time include:
*a vast and changing network of perceived problems, on which no single body has (or possibly could have) adequate control;
*a vast and changing network of conceptual tools and knowledge resources, which is not (and possibly could not be) controlled by any single body;
*a vast and changing [[social network|network]] of agencies, organizations, groups and active individuals spanning every conceivable human interest and extending from the community level to the international level, and on which no single body has (or possibly could or should have) adequate control.
The strategic problem therefore is how to ensure that the appropriate organizational resources emerge, and are supported with appropriate conceptual tools, in response to emerging problem complexes. But it would seem that this must be achieved without organizing such response – for to the extent that any part of the network is organized, other parts will develop (and probably should develop) which favor alternative approaches. The challenge is therefore to clarify the conditions of a network strategy, i.e. an approach which facilitates or catalyses (rather than organizes) the development of organizational networks in response to problem networks, in the light of values perceived in various parts of the social system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=20 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: network strategy]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Face-Negotiation Theory''' was a theory first proposed by [[Penelope Brown|Brown]] and [[Stephen Levinson|Levinson]] (1978) to understand how people from different cultures manage rapport and disagreements. The theory posits "face", or self-image, as a universal phenomenon that pervades across cultures. In conflicts, one's face is threatened; and thus the person tends to save or restore his or her face. This set of communicative behaviors, according to the theory, is called "facework".  Since people frame the situated meaning of "face" and enact "facework" differently from one culture to the next, the theory poses a cultural-general framework to examine facework negotiation.

==Background==
Face-negotiation theory is primarily based on the research of Brown and Levinson. In this theory, "face" is a metaphor for self-image, which originates from two Chinese conceptualizations: lien and mien-tzu. Lien is the internal moral face that involves shame, integrity, debasement, and honor issues. Mien-tzu, on the other hand, is the external social face that involves social recognition, position, authority, influence and power.&lt;ref&gt;Hu, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ting-1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ting-Toomey|last2=Kurogi|title=Facework competence in intercultural conflict: An updated face-negotiation theory|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|date=1998|volume=22|issue=2|pages=187–225|doi=10.1016/s0147-1767(98)00004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erving Goffman]] situated [[Face (sociological concept)|"face"]] in contemporary Western research and conceptualized the terms lien and mien-tzu as identity and ego..&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  He noted that face is a concern for one's projected image that is both immediate and spontaneous and is tied to the dynamics of social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Rogan &amp; Hammer, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  Correspondingly, "facework" denotes actions taken to maintain consistency between the self and public line. Further research by Penelope Brown and [[Stephen Levinson]] on [[Politeness theory|politeness]] suggests that the desire for face is a universal concern.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Levinson, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, Turner &amp; Zhao, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and Levinson further suggest that face can refer to two wants of the individual- the positive face that necessitates approval by others and the negative face that requires that one's actions or thoughts are unimpeded by others. Thus participants wants are of more importance than the interaction itself in face saving view of politeness. In fact, researchers Brown and Levinson posit that face is something that "is emotionally invested, and can be lost, maintained, or enhanced, and must be constantly attended to in interaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.604.3117&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ting-Toomey expands this thinking and conceptualizes face as an individual's claimed sense of favorable social self-image in a relational and network context.&lt;ref name=Ting-1988&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ting-Toomey|authorlink1=Intercultural conflict styles: A face negotiation theory|editor1-last=Kim|editor1-first=Y.Y.|editor2-last=Gudykunst|editor2-first=W.B.|title=Theories in intercultural communication|date=1988|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|pages=213–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facework is defined as clusters of communicative behaviors that are used to enact self-face and to uphold, challenge/threaten, or support the other person's face.&lt;ref name="Ting-1998"/&gt;

With these concepts and frameworks, face-negotiation theory investigates intercultural conflict styles. The perceived or actual conflict differences revolve around three issues: content, relational, and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot &amp; Hocker, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Content conflict refers to the substantive issues external to the individual involved. Relational conflict refers to how individuals define, or would like to define, the particular relationship in that particular conflict episode. Identity-based conflict concerns issues of issues of identity confirmation-rejection, respect-disrespect, and approval-disapproval.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ting-Toomey|authorlink1=The matrix of face: An updated face-negotiation theory|editor1-last=Gudykunst|editor1-first=W.B.|title=Theorizing about intercultural communication|date=2005|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|pages=71–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, identity issues are tided closely to culture-based face-orientation factors. A face-threatening episode is an identity expectancy violation episode. Thus, the face-negotiation theory views conflict, intercultural conflict in particular, as a situation that demands active facework management from the two interdependent conflict parties.

The theory has gone through multiple iterations since its creation. There is a 1988 version of seven assumptions and 12 propositions,&lt;ref name="Ting-1988"/&gt; a 1998 version of seven assumptions and 32 propositions,&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt; and most recent the 2005 version of seven assumptions and 24 propositions.&lt;ref name="Ting-2005"/&gt;

==Components==

===Assumptions===
Face and facework are universal phenomena.&lt;ref name=Ting-handbook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ting-Toomey|authorlink1=Translating conflict face-negotiation theory into practice|editor1-last=Landis|editor1-first=Dan|editor2-last=Bennett|editor2-first=Janet M.|editor3-last=Bennett|editor3-first=Millton J.|title=Handbook of Intercultural Training|date=2004|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=217–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Face-Negotiation Theory perspective stresses the impact of culture on the situated meaning of face and the enactment of facework. Thus, the theory assumes that:&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;
#Communication in all cultures is based on maintaining and negotiating face.
#Face is problematic when identities are questioned.
#Differences in individualistic vs. collectivistic and small vs. large power distance cultures profoundly shape face management.
#Individualistic cultures prefer self oriented facework, and collectivistic cultures prefer other oriented facework.
#Small power distance cultures prefer an "individuals are equal" framework, whereas large power distance cultures prefer a hierarchical framework.
#Behavior is also influenced by cultural variances, individual, relational, and situational factors.
#Competence in intercultural communication is a culmination of knowledge and mindfulness.

===Taxonomies===
Face-negotiation theory primarily deals with five sets of themes: face orientation or concerns, face movements, facework interaction strategies, conflict communication styles, and face content domains.&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ting-1988 /&gt; In the 2005 version of theory, the five thematic clusters are referred as "core taxonomies".&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;

====Face orientations====

The orientation of face determines the focus with which the face negotiator will direct her or his attention and energy of the conflict messages.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt; Because of different concerns, caused by different underlying cultural values, face negotiators may orient towards self-face (one's own image), other face (the other conflict party's image) or mutual face (both parties' image and/or the image of the relationship).&lt;ref name=Ting-1988 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ting-Toomey, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in [[Individualism|individualist]] cultures, such as the United States, Germany, and Great Britain, there is great value on personal rights, freedoms and the "do it yourself" attitude.  In [[Collectivism|collectivist]] cultures such as Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia, more value is placed on "we" vs. "I".  The needs of the group outweigh the needs of the individual.  One-third of the world lives in an individualist society, while the other two thirds are identified with collectivist cultures.

Face orientation also involves the concept of [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|power distance]].  People from large power distance cultures accept unequal power distributions, are reliant on established hierarchy, and understand that rewards and sanctions are based on social position.  People from small power distance cultures value equal power distributions, symmetric relations, and rewards and sanctions based on performance.  The United States is an example of a small power distance culture, while Japan embodies a large power distance culture.

Drawing on research of [[Geert Hofstede]], face-negotiation theory notes that while individualism and power distance are two separate dimensions, they are correlated. Highly individualistic cultures tend to be low in power distance, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

====Face movements====

Face movement refers to the options that a negotiator faces in choosing whether to maintain, defend and/or upgrade self-face versus other-face in a conflict episode. There are four opportunities a mediator has in regards to their concern for self-face, your personal image and other-face, the counterpart's image of themselves that define face movements:
#If there is a high level of concern for both self-face and other-face, the result is mutual-face protection.
#If there is a low level of concern for both self-face and other-face, the result is mutual-face obliteration.
#If there is a high level of concern for self-face but a low level of concern for other-face, the result is self-face defense.
#If there is a high level of concern for other-face but a low level of concern for self-face, the result is other-face defense.

Ting-Toomey asserts that several conditions must be perceived as severe in order for a negotiator to feel his face is threatened; the importance of the culturally approved facework that is violated, feelings of mistrust because of a large distance between cultures, the importance of the conflict topic, the power distance between the two parties, and the perception of the parties as outgroup members are all conditions which must be made salient for face-threatening communication to occur.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt; Whether or not a person engages in a conflict depends on how face-threatening the situation is perceived.

In an individualistic culture, the more self-face threatening the conflict, the more likely the individual will engage in an attack.  In a collectivistic culture, where mutual-face concern is important, avoidance of conflict may prevail in order for the situation to be defused. Collectivistic communicators may also require a third-party negotiation to make progress in finding a resolution.

====Facework interaction strategies====

On a broad level, individualistic cultures operate with a more direct, low-context facework with importance placed on verbal communication and nonverbal gestures for emphasis.  Collectivistic cultures operate in a more indirect, high context facework emphasizing nonverbal subtleties.  There are three prevalent facework strategies: dominating, avoiding, and integrating.  Dominating facework is characterized by trying to maintain a credible image with the goal of winning the conflict.  Avoiding facework attempts to preserve harmony in the relationship by dealing with the conflict indirectly.  Integrating facework focuses on content resolution and maintaining the relationship.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;

Along the face concern/orientation dimension, facework is at play before (preventative), during, and after (restorative) the situation.  Preventative facework is an attempt to minimize face-loss before the threat occurs.  Preventative strategies include credentialing, appealing for suspended judgment, pre-disclosure, pre-apology, hedging, and disclaimers.&lt;ref name="Culpach"&gt;Culpach &amp; Metts, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  Collectivistic cultures tend to employ more preventative strategies than individualistic cultures.  Restorative facework attempts to repair face that was lost.  Restorative strategies include excuses, justifications, direct aggression, humor, physical remediation, passive aggressiveness, avoidance, and apologies.&lt;ref name="Culpach" /&gt;  Individualistic cultures are more likely to use restorative facework than collectivistic cultures.

Facework differs from conflict styles by employing face-saving strategies which can be used prior to, during, or after a conflict episode and can be used in a variety of identity-threatening and identity-protection situations.  These strategies are focused on relational and face identity beyond conflict goal issues.  Conflict styles are specific strategies used to engage or disengage from a conflict situation.  Preventative and restorative face-work strategies are typically employed when one's face is being threatened.

====Conflict communication styles====

Conflict style consists of learned behaviors developed through socialization within one's culture.  Rahim&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; based his classification of conflict styles into two dimensions.  The first dimension demonstrates the concern for self, how important it is for the individual to maintain their own face or that of their culture (this is rated on a high to low continuum) and the second is concern for others, how important is it to the individual to help them maintain their own face (also rated on a high to low continuum). The two dimensions are combined to create five styles for dealing with conflict. The individual will choose a style of handling conflict based on the importance of saving their face and that of the face of the other. 
#'''Dominating''': One person's position or goal above the other.
#'''Avoiding''': Eluding the conflict topic, the conflict party, or the conflict situation altogether.
#'''Obliging''': High concern for the other person's conflict interest above a person's own interest. 
#'''Compromising''': A give-and-take concession approach in order to reach a midpoint agreement.
#'''Integrating''': A solution closure that involves high concern for one's self and high concern for the other.

In 2000 Ting-Toomey, Oetzel, and Yee-Jung incorporated three additional conflict communication styles to the original five.&lt;ref&gt;Ting-Toomey et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These three have further enhanced conflict communication across cultures.

#'''Emotional Expression'''-Articulating a persons feelings in order to deal with and control conflict.
#'''Third Party Help'''-Resolving conflicts by enlisting additional help to manage communication.
#'''Passive Aggressive'''-Reacting to conflict in a roundabout way, placing blame indirectly.

Other researchers used a different way to group the conflict tactics. Ting-Toomey (1983) grouped strategies into three categories of tactics for handling conflict; integrative, distributive and passive-indirect.

Integrative conflict tactics incorporated integrating and compromising styles and is reflective of mutual-face and the need for a solution. Those who chose this tactic work with the other person involved in the conflict to get the best possible solution for both parties. Examples of Integrative tactics may include listening to the other, respecting their feelings, and providing their own personal viewpoints in a manner that assists in the negotiation.

Distributive conflict tactics use the dominating style of handling conflict, and emphasizes the individuals own power over the other. This style reflects self-face. Passive-indirect conflict tactics are consistent with obliging and avoiding styles of handling conflict and reflects other-face.

====Face content domains====

Face content domains refer to the different topics an individual will engage in facework on. Individuals have different face wants or face needs in a diverse range of communicative situations.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt; There are six domains that an individual will operate in:
#'''Autonomy'''-represents our need for others to acknowledge our independence, self-sufficiency, privacy, boundary, nonimposition, control issues, and our consideration of other's autonomy face needs
#'''Inclusion'''-our need to be recognized as worthy companions, likeable, agreeable, pleasant, friendly, cooperative
#'''Status'''-need for others to admire our tangible and intangible assets or resources: appearance, attractiveness, reputation, position, power, and material worth
#'''Reliability'''-need for others to realize that we are trustworthy, dependable, reliable, loyal, and consistent in words and actions
#'''Competence'''-need for others to recognize our qualities or social abilities such as intelligence, skills, expertise, leadership, team-building, networking, conflict mediation, facework, and problem-solving skills
#'''Moral'''-need for others to respect our sense of integrity, dignity, honor, propriety, and morality

===Theoretical propositions===
The heart of Face Negotiation Theories are 24 propositions.  They are based on the seven assumptions and five taxonomies that have been proven in numerous cases and studies.  They describe facework on three levels of communication: cultural, individual, and situational.

''Cultural-level propositions&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;''

#Individualistic cultures predominantly express self-face maintenance interests than collectivistic culture members do.
#Collectivistic cultures are more concerned with other-face maintenance than members of individualistic cultures.
#Members of collectivist cultures are more concerned with mutual-face maintenance than individualistic cultures.
#Members of individualistic cultures predominantly use direct and dominating facework strategies in conflict
#Collectivistic cultures tend to use avoidance strategies more than individualistic cultures do.
#Members of collectivistic cultures use more integrative facework strategies than individualistic culture members do.
#Individualistic cultures prefer dominating/competing conflict styles more than collectivistic cultures do.
#Individualistic cultures use more emotionally expressive conflict styles than collectivistic cultures do.
#Individualistic cultures use more aggressive conflict styles than members of collectivistic cultures.
#Collectivistic cultures use more avoidance techniques than members of individualistic cultures.
#Collectivistic cultures use more obliging conflict styles than members of individualistic cultures.
#Collectivistic cultures utilize compromising styles of conflict more than members of individualistic cultures.

''Individual-level propositions&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;''

#Independent self is positively associated with self-face concern.
#Interdependent self is positively associated with other-/mutual-face concern.
#Self-face maintenance is associated with dominating/competing conflict style.
#Other-face maintenance is associated with avoiding/obliging conflict style.
#Other-face maintenance is associated with compromising/integrating conflict style.
#Independent self–construal is associated with dominating/competing conflict style.
#Interdependent self-construal is associated with obliging/avoiding.
#Interdependent self-construal is associated with compromising/integrating.
#Bi-construal is associated with compromising/integrating.
#Ambivalent is associated with neglect/third-party.

''Situational-level propositions&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;''

#Individualist or independent-self personalities tend to express a greater degree of self-face maintenance concerns and less other-face maintenance concern in dealing with both ingroup and outgroup conflicts situations.
#Collectivist or interdependent-self personalities express a greater degree of other-face concerns with ingroup members and a greater degree of self-face maintenance concerns with outgroup members in intergroup conflict situations.

===Intercultural facework competence===
Reflecting on the final assumption, intercultural facework competence consists of another component of face-negotiation theory. 
Facework competence is conceptualized as an optimal integration of knowledge, mindfulness and communication skills in managing self's and other's face-related concerns.&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt; To act competently in an intercultural conflict episode, the theory posits that individuals have to enhance their cultural knowledge and mindfulness in applying context-sensitive facework interaction skills.

====Knowledge dimension====

Knowledge here refers to the process of in-depth understanding of  phenomenon via a range of information gained through conscious learning and personal experiences. Building block concepts include: (1) individualism-collectivism, (2) power distance. (3) two contrastive "self/face" models, and (4) facework communication styles.&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt;

====Mindfulness dimension====

Mindfulness means attending to one's internal assumptions, cognitions and emotions and simultaneously attuning attentively to the other's assumptions, cognitions and emotions while focusing the five senses.&lt;ref&gt;Thich, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; To be mindful of intercultural facework differences, we have to learn to see the unfamiliar behavior from a fresh context.&lt;ref name=Ting-handbook /&gt; Thus, on a general level, mindfulness demands creative thinking and living.

==Applications==
As an intercultural communication theory, face-negotiation theory was first tested in and applied to the field of intercultural training and conflicts. However, researchers from other areas also find this theory applicable and relevant. Recent applications and examinations of the theory include following studies.

===Intercultural conflict training===

One direct application of face-negotiation theory is the design of intercultural conflict training frameworks. Part of the objective of face-negotiation theory, according to Ting-Toomey, is in fact to translate the theory into a viable framework for mindful intercultural conflict training.&lt;ref name=Ting-handbook /&gt;

More specifically, intercultural conflict training revolves around international business negotiation, intercultural conflict mediation, managing intercultural miscommunication, and developing intercultural conflict competencies. Adapting face-negotiation theory, and also in combination with various communication researches such as Critical Incident, Intergroup Negotiation Simulation etc., Ting-Toomey designed a detailed three-day training session. Agenda outline, along with in class activities, lecture themes, and exercises, is provided in her design as well.

===Face concerns in interpersonal conflict===

This study by the author of the theory Stella Ting-Toomey and, Department of communication and Journalism at the University of New Mexico, John G. Oetzel was done in order to discover if face was indeed a factor in determining "culture's influence on conflict behavior" (Ting-Toomey &amp; Oetzel, 2003).  There were 768 people from four different countries who partook in the study. The cultures represented were China, Germany, Japan, and the United States. China and Japan representing the collectivist countries and Germany and the United States as the individualist countries. Each contributor was given a survey in which they were to explain interpersonal conflict.&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey"&gt;Ting-Toomey &amp; Oetzel, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
The largest findings are as follows.
#"Cultural individualism-collectivism had direct and indirect effects on conflict styles."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;
#"Independent self-construal related positively with self-face and interdependent self-construal related positively with other-face."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;
#"Self-face related positively with dominating conflict styles and other-face related positively with avoiding and integrating styles."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;
#"Face accounted for all of the total variance explained (100% of 19% total explained) in dominating, most of the total variance explained in integrating (70% of 20% total explained) when considering face concerns, cultural individualism-collectivism, and self-construals."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;

===Face and facework in conflicts with parents and siblings===

This study implemented by the author of this theory Stella Ting-Toomey, John Oetzel, Martha Idalia Chew-Sanchez, Richard Harris, Richard Wilcox, and Siegfried Stumpf observed how facework in conflict with parents and siblings is affected by culture, self-concept, and power distance. There were 449 people from four different countries and cultures that participated. Germany, Japan, Mexico, and the United States were the countries used in the study. The survey looked at 3 apprehensions of face and 11 behaviors of "facework". The results are as follows.
#"Self-construals had strong effects on face concerns and facework with independence positively associated with self-face and dominating facework and interdependence positively associated with other- and mutual-face and integrating and avoiding facework behaviors."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel"&gt;Ting-Toomey, Oetzel, Chew-Sanchez, Harris, Wilcox, &amp;Stumpf, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Power distance had small, positive effects on self-face, other-face, avoiding facework, and dominating facework."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"National culture had small to medium effects with individualistic, small power distance cultures having more self-face and mutual-face and using more dominating and integrating facework and less avoiding facework."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"Germans have more self-face and used defending more than U.S. Americans."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"Japanese used more expression than Mexicans."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"Individuals in conflict with parents were more likely to use respect and expression and less likely to use aggression, pretend, and third party than individuals in conflict with siblings."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;

===Face negotiation with mothers===

Motherhood of the Construction of "Mommy Identity" – Heisler &amp; Ellis Face Negotiation Theory suggests that, "USA culture simultaneously encourages connection and autonomy among individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Heisler &amp; Ellis, 2008, pp. 448.&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers do not want to be vulnerable so there is a "face" that is developed in the culture of mothers. Heisler and Ellis did a study on the "face" and reasons for face in motherhood. The results portrayed that the main reasons for keeping "face" in a culture of mothers are:

# Acceptance and approval: There is a fear of criticism and rejection by others. There is the avoidance face which deflects others attention. Acceptance face attracts attention.
# Personal Reasons: There are many internal pressures that mothers face. These include the guilt that they do not spend enough time with their children, insecurities and values they have are not being in met, and their self-esteem is low because of the fear of judgment.
# Mentoring/helping others: Mothers put on a face in order to appear as a good mother figure to younger mothers that look up to them. There are cultural expectations that can contribute to personal expectations for how mothers should act. Women's thoughts on mothering are not their own original ideas. They take on a lot of societal pressures. An example would be, if a mother's child acts poorly in public, it makes the mother look bad.

Motherhood and "face": Results from the same study showed that mothers participate in "Mommy face work." Depending on who they are talking to or interacting with. Mothers said to put on their highest face with friends, spouses, mothers and other family members.

===Physician communication in the operating room===
Kristin Kirschbaum applied face-negotiation theory to the [[health communication]] context, and specifically in the operating room environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschbaum, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the research, a survey was administered to anesthesiologists and surgeons at a teaching hospital in the southwestern United States to measure three variables commonly associated with face-negotiation theory: conflict-management style, face concern, and self-construal.
The results strongly support the theory, and significant positive correlations were found between independent self-construal and self-face concern for anesthesiologists and surgeons. Specific to this health communication context, the research shows differences between the two groups of operating-room physicians: surgeons are potentially more other-face oriented and that anesthesiologists are potentially more independently oriented. Further, both anesthesiologists and surgeons recognize the importance of collaboration as surgical team members.

The survey also finds that specific terms were contextually inappropriate for this population, e.g. the terms pride, dignity, or credibility demonstrated a need for error correlation. This suggests unique considerations of language. Along this line of thinking, the research recommends physician communication training to address both unique language considerations and different orientations to face concern and self-construal.

===Safe sex negotiation===
Gust Yep, noticing the potential vulnerability and emotional volatility of sexual interaction, applied face-negotiation theory to the safe sex negotiation context.&lt;ref&gt;Yep, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The study integrates various components of face-negotiation theory, and eight propositions are derived from empirical testing in intimate communication scenarios including East-West romantic dyads. The research is based on preliminary observations on personal interviews with two Asian women, aiming to predict intimate communication patterns between Asian women and Euro-American men. Specifically, low-high context and individualism-collectivism frameworks are used to draw the eight propositions.

'''&lt;big&gt;Face Saving in Business Request Emails&lt;/big&gt;'''

A study conducted on the exchange of business emails between Chinese &amp; American business associates presented how the structure of email requests affected the person's face &amp; impacted how the associates viewed the request. It was observed that direct requests in an email threatened the face of the recipient &amp; sender. It resulted in loss of face because the recipient was denied autonomy and acted in a socially unacceptable manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=8f3e42a6-3912-425a-b23f-0ea1e50e4b18@sessionmgr4009|title=Saving Face: Reactions to Cultural Norm Violations in Business Request Emai...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face Threat &amp; Disability ===
A research was conducted to gauge how disabled persons interact with able bodied individuals with regards to protecting one’s face and self-identity. The study considered students with not only physical disability but also disabilities not visually identifiable such as heart conditions and hearing impairment. Those with disabilities were threatened by the way others treated them and hence they chose more face-saving strategies. For instance, communication apprehension was noted in students with a hearing impairment and they reported less disclosure in the conversation. In fact, the study found that disabled students viewed asking help from able bodied individuals as a face threatening act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2994eace-95ee-4ef4-836b-8bc5e3f9b6c9@sessionmgr4010|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responding to Unethical Communication ===
A research in people’s reaction to unethical communication revealed that people use Face Threatening Acts in order to counter the apprehension in communication. According to Bisel et al. (2011), ‘denying unethical communication challenges both positive and negative face of the hearer”. An expression of disapproval threatens a person’s positive face which indicates the hearer’s need for approval and it impacts the person’s negative face because it affects the person’s autonomy. 

The study put forth a research question of associating politeness strategies and unethical communication. The strategies considered were don’t’ do the face threatening act, negative politeness, positive politeness and bald on strategy. The unethical communication was classified as one that was either deceptive, manipulative, exploitative, intrusive or coercive. The ideal strategic responses have been highlighted in the figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=aa4d04da-073a-41a5-8b98-5e9a8ff68e7c@sessionmgr4009|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face Saving in Artwork Reviews ===
A research was conducted to study the use of face saving and face threatening acts in reviewing artwork. For the study, twelve reviews from the periodical Literatūra ir menas (Literature and Art) were randomly selected. The source for the research analysis was between 1970 -1975.

It was observed that reviewers generally had the face of the artist in mind before presenting their reviews. When presenting a negative review, reviewers threatened the positive face of the artist and hence also presented positive feedback in order to ‘save face’ of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=dbcd0891-58af-4084-a3ba-49718c0532fc@sessionmgr4006|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face Concerns and the Intent to Apologize ===
A study was conducted among 317 Chinese and American participants to determine how the cultural variation between the two affected the intention to apologize. The cultural norms were categorized as the individualistic and collectivist cultures. According to Hofstede (1980), an individualistic culture lays emphasis on the identity of the “I” while collectivist cultures place more importance on the “we” and the harmony in groups. 

Apology, according to Goffman (1971), is the “offender’s device to remedy a social breach and to re-establish social harmony”. This study also took into account culture when trying to understand the intention to apologize. 

The cultural differences were more prominent especially as the intention took into account if the member (whose face was threatened by an act and thus necessities an apology) was an in-group or an out-group member. The study thus found that Chinese participants had a greater intention to apologize especially if their act threatened the positive face of the other individual. On the other hand, the U.S participants had the intention to apologize when their act threatened the negative face of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=9e9b619e-dd86-400d-a1dc-0de0aa7dd4b9@sessionmgr4007|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Faith Community Nursing''', also known as '''Parish Nursing''', '''Parrish Nursing''', '''Congregational Nursing''' or '''Church Nursing''', is a movement of over 15,000 [[registered nurse]]s, primarily in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nursingworld.org |title=American Nurses Association |publisher=Nursingworld.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also Parish nurses in [[Australia]], the Bahamas, Canada, England, Ghana, India, Kenya, [[Korea]], Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, [[New Zealand]], Nigeria, Palestine, Pakistan, Scotland, Singapore, [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], Ukraine, Wales, Zambia and [[Zimbabwe]].  Faith community nursing is a practice specialty that focuses on the intentional care of the spirit, promotion of an integrative model of health and prevention and minimization of illness within the context of a [[community of faith]]. The intentional integration of the practice of faith with the practice of [[nursing]] so that people can achieve wholeness in, with, and through the population which faith community nurses serve.

Parish nursing began in the mid-1980s in Chicago through the efforts of Rev. Dr. [[Granger E. Westberg|Granger Westberg]] as a reincarnation of the faith community nursing outreach done by religious orders, such as the "Parish Deaconesses" in Europe and America in the 1800s.  Parish nursing is rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition, and the historic practice of professional nursing, and is consistent with the basic assumptions of many faiths that we care for self and others as an expression of God's love. However, it is not only available to Christian congregations.  There are Jewish Congregational Nurses, Muslim Crescent Nurses, and RNs serving in similar capacities within other faith traditions.

Faith Community Nursing (FCN) is recognized as a [[Nursing specialties|specialty nursing practice]]. ''Faith Community Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice'' was approved by the [[American Nurses Association]] in 2005 (and updated in 2012) and define the specialty as "...the specialized practice of professional nursing that focuses on the intentional care of the spirit as part of the process of promoting holistic health and preventing or minimizing illness in a faith community." (American Nurses Association, 2012, Faith Community Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, Silver Springs, MD: Author, p1). The 16 standards of Faith Community Nursing Practice reflect the specialty's professional values and priorities and provide practice directions and the framework for practice evaluation.  Each standard is measurable by a set of specific competencies that serve as evidence of minimal compliance with that standard.

To become a faith community nurse, the registered nurse must have a minimum of 2 years experience, must have a current license in the state where the faith community is located, and have completed a parish nurse foundations course for the specialty practice as recognized by the American Nurses Association.  There are several different curriculum offerings for the faith community nurse which have been developed by a panel of nursing faculty.  These are offered though a partnership with the International Parish Nurse Resource Center (IPNRC) at more than 130 nursing schools and health systems around the US and abroad.

Faith community nurses serve in several roles, including:
•	Health advisor
•	Educator on health issues
•	Visitor of church members at home or in the hospital
•	Provider of referrals to community resources and provide assistance in obtaining needed health services
•	Developer of support groups within the church
•	Trainer and coordinator of volunteers
•	Provider of health screenings

It is important to note that faith community nurses are not expected to provide patient care in the church or at a patient's home but rather to be a source of referrals for services in the community.  They coordinate existing services and supplement them with a holistic dimension of health and caring.
A parish nurse program or faith community nurse program can operate in several different ways.  Models include: 1) one church supporting its own full or part-time nurse, 2) several churches supporting one nurse, 3) a group of volunteer nurses supporting one or several churches or 4) a nurse related to a hospital or clinic who supports a church or churches as part of his or her job.  Of the several thousand faith community nurses, only about 35% in the US are compensated financially for their ministry. In the United States, faith community nurses typically belong to the Health Ministries Association which is the national professional membership organization for faith community nurses.  They also have available the International Parish Nurse Resource Center and the American Nurses Association, among others.

The Caribbean has joined the community of Parish Nursing and Health Care Ministry with the launching of Health Care Ministry in The Bahamas.  It began with an initial course spanning a three-week period and brought together nurses from various denominations who were commissioned on 27 February 2005. Initially, the Canadian and Australian models of Parish Nursing were introduced to The Bahamas as an extension of the Pastoral Care Ministries of Diocese 2000 &amp; Beyond, a programme of the Anglican Diocese of The Bahamas and Turks &amp; Caicos Islands. To date, more than 60 people have been trained and actively engaged in the ministry as either Parish Nurses or Health &amp; Wellness Carers.

Since the ministry began in 2005 it has grown steadily and was known as the Anglican Diocesan Health Care Ministry [Parish Nursing] Council.  However, effective 7 March 2008 the name changed to the Ecumenical Health Care Ministry Council. It is intended that there will be continued training and that the programme will spread throughout the Commonwealth of The Bahamas and the Caribbean.  To this end, the ministry will be recognised by the Bahamas Christian Council and by extension the Caribbean Council of Churches (Ecumenical Health Care Ministry, Bahamas).

'''Frances Elizabeth Hoggan''' (''née'' '''Morgan'''; 20 December 1843 – 5 February 1927) was a Welsh doctor and the first British woman to receive a doctorate in [[medicine]] from any university in [[Europe]]. She was also a pioneering medical practitioner, researcher and social reformer – and the first female doctor to be registered in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Frances Hoggan|url=https://www.learnedsociety.wales/medals/hoggan-medal/frances_hoggan/|website=Learned Society of Wales|accessdate=20 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025133745/https://www.learnedsociety.wales/medals/hoggan-medal/frances_hoggan/|archivedate=2017-10-25|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband opened the first husband-and-wife medical practice in Britain.

==Life==
Frances Hoggan was born in [[Brecon]], [[Wales]], where her father, Richard Morgan, was a curate.  She was brought up and educated at [[Cowbridge]] in Glamorgan and later at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].  During her teens, she gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, who was brought up with her mother and passed off as Frances' sister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/women/pages/mothers_of_industry.shtml BBC – Wales History – Mothers of Industry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  She went on to study at [[Paris]] and [[Düsseldorf]]. 

She obtained her medical doctorate from the [[University of Zurich]] in March 1870, completing the six-year course in three years, becoming the first British woman to obtain a European MD degree.&lt;ref&gt;Elston&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 she married Dr George Hoggan.  She later practised in London as a specialist in women's and children's diseases, including a period at [[North London Collegiate School]].  Together with her husband, she opened the first husband-and-wife general medical practice in the UK.  

In 1882, she called for a publicly funded women's medical service for female patients in India. This helped pave the way for the [[Countess of Dufferin Fund|Dufferin Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medical Women for India|last=Hoggan|first=Frances|publisher=J.W. Arrowsmith|year=1882|isbn=|location=Bristol|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoggan became a campaigner and social reformer, and toured the [[United States]] lecturing. She had a particular interest in racial issues, and was a speaker at the Universal Race Congress in London in 1911.

Her cremated remains are buried, with her husband's, in [[Woking]] cemetery.

== Education ==
Upon the exclusion of women by the Council of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]] from its professional exams in 1867, Frances Elizabeth Morgan sought her medical education at the [[University of Zurich]], whence [[Nadezhda Suslova]], Russia's first woman physician, had received her degree in December 1867. There, Morgan completed the medical course in three years rather than the expected five, and in March 1870 became only the second woman to gain an MD (with a thesis on progressive muscular atrophy) at Zürich University.&lt;ref&gt;Elston&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, at a clinic in Vienna she undertook study on operative midwifery and became a pupil of surgeon Gustav Braun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Frances Elizabeth Hoggan|last = Thomas|first = Onfel|publisher = R.

{{Intellectual property}}

'''Freedom of panorama''' ('''FOP''') is  a provision in the [[copyright]] laws of various jurisdictions that permits taking photographs and video footage and creating other images (such as paintings) of buildings and sometimes sculptures and other art works which are permanently located in a [[public place]], without infringing on any copyright that may otherwise subsist in such works, and the publishing of such images.&lt;ref name="seiler"&gt;Seiler, D.: ''[http://www.fotorecht.de/publikationen/hundertwasserhaus3.html Gebäudefotografie in der EU – Neues vom Hundertwasserhaus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930160856/http://www.fotorecht.de/publikationen/hundertwasserhaus3.html |date=2007-09-30 }}'', in ''Photopresse'' 1/2 (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;16.

It is an exception to the normal rule that the copyright owner has the exclusive right to authorize the creation and distribution of [[derivative work]]s. The phrase is derived from the [[German language|German]] term ''{{lang|de|Panoramafreiheit}}'' ("panorama freedom").

==Laws around the world==
Many countries have similar provisions restricting the scope of copyright law in order to explicitly permit photographs involving scenes of public places or scenes photographed from public places. Other countries, though, differ widely in their interpretation of the principle.&lt;ref name="seiler"/&gt;

====Litigation====
An example of litigation due to the heterogeneous EU legislation is the ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Hundertwasserentscheidung|Hundertwasserentscheidung]]}}'' (Hundertwasser decision), a case won by [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]] in Germany against a German company for use of a photo of an Austrian building.&lt;ref&gt;https://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?Text=I%20ZR%20192/00 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820052628/https://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?Text=I%20ZR%20192%2F00 |date=2016-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Romania]], the heirs of [[Anca Petrescu]], the architect of the colossal [[Palace of the Parliament]], sued the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]] for selling photos and other [[Souvenir|souvenirs]] with the image of the iconic building. The [[copyright infringement]] trial is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dpvue.com/2018/10/taking-photos-of-palace-of-parliament.html|title=Why taking photos of the Palace of the Parliament can be considered illegal|work=dpvue|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
Since 7 October 2016, article L122-5 of the French Code of Intellectual Property provides for a limited freedom of panorama for works of architecture and sculpture.  The code authorizes "reproductions and representations of works of architecture and sculpture, placed permanently in public places (''voie publique''), and created by [[natural person]]s, with the exception of any usage of a commercial character".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=5DD8F8800CB25AA883378CE851D89A7D.tpdila13v_2?idArticle=LEGIARTI000033219336&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069414&amp;categorieLien=id&amp;dateTexte=|title=Article 5, section 11  of Code on Intellectual Property|accessdate=December 26, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127170315/https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do|archivedate=January 27, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limits to freedom of panorama in France have a drastic effect on Wikipedia articles about French architecture. Wikimedia Commons editors routinely delete any images of recent French architecture, despite the changes in the law, because Commons does not allow images where commercial use is prohibited.

===Australia===

In [[Australia]], freedom of panorama is dealt with in the federal [[Copyright law of Australia#Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act 1968]], sections 65 to 68. Section 65 provides: "The copyright in a work ... that is situated, otherwise than temporarily, in a public place, or in premises open to the public, is not infringed by the making of a painting, drawing, engraving or photograph of the work or by the inclusion of the work in a cinematograph film or in a television broadcast". This applies to any "artistic work" as defined in paragraph (c) of section 10: a "work of artistic craftsmanship" (but not a circuit layout).&lt;ref name="AU"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca1968133|Copyright Act 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 66 of the Act provides exceptions to copyright infringement for photos and depictions of buildings and models of buildings.&lt;ref name="AU" /&gt;

===Canada===
Section 32.2(1) of the Copyright Act (Canada) states the following:
{{quote|It is not an infringement of copyright
{{block indent|(b) for any person to reproduce, in a painting, drawing, engraving, photograph or cinematographic work
{{block indent|(i) an architectural work, provided the copy is not in the nature of an architectural drawing or plan, or}}
{{block indent|(ii) a sculpture or work of artistic craftsmanship or a cast or model of a sculpture or work of artistic craftsmanship, that is permanently situated in a public place or building;}}}}}}
The Copyright Act also provides specific protection for the incidental inclusion of another work seen in the background of a photo. Photos that "incidentally and not deliberately" include another work do not infringe copyright.

===United States===
{{further|Copyright in architecture in the United States}}
[[copyright law of the United States|United States copyright law]] contains the following provision:
{{quote|The copyright in an architectural work that has been constructed does not include the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public display of pictures, paintings, photographs, or other pictorial representations of the work, if the building in which the work is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place.|[[:s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 1/Section 120|17 U.S.&amp;nbsp;Code §&amp;nbsp;120(a)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=17 U.S. Code § 120 - Scope of exclusive rights in architectural works|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/120|access-date=4 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419101318/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/120|archivedate=19 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Former USSR===
Almost all countries from the former [[Soviet Union]] lack freedom of panorama. Exceptions are three countries whose copyright laws were amended recently. The first was [[Republic of Moldova]] in July 2010, when the law in question was approximated to EU standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authors = Eugene Stuart, Eduardo Fano, Linda Scales, Gerda Leonaviciene, Anna Lazareva | title = Intellectual Property Law and Policy.

==Two-dimensional works==
The precise extent of this permission to make pictures in public places without having to worry about copyrighted works being in the image differs amongst countries.&lt;ref name="seiler"/&gt; In most countries, it applies only to images of three-dimensional works&lt;ref name="uk_2"&gt;See ''e.g.'' Lydiate.&lt;/ref&gt; that are permanently installed in a public place, "permanent" typically meaning "for the natural lifetime of the work".&lt;ref name="ch"&gt;Rehbinder, M.: ''Schweizerisches Urheberrecht'' 3rd ed., p.&amp;nbsp;158, Stämpfli Verlag, Berne, 2000. {{ISBN|3-7272-0923-2}}.

==Public space==
Many laws have subtle differences in regard to public space and private property. Whereas the photographer's location is irrelevant in Austria,&lt;ref name="seiler"/&gt; in Germany the permission applies only if the image was taken from public ground, and without any further utilities such as ladders, lifting platforms, airplanes etc.&lt;ref name="de"/&gt; Under certain circumstances, the scope of the permission is also extended to actually private grounds, e.g. to publicly accessible private parks and castles without entrance control, however with the restriction that the owner may then demand a fee for commercial use of the images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=pm&amp;Datum=2010&amp;Sort=3&amp;nr=54399&amp;pos=0&amp;anz=241 |title=Decision of the German Federal Court in favour of the Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten, December 17, 2010 |publisher=Juris.bundesgerichtshof.de |date=2010-12-17 |accessdate=2012-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014190054/http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=pm&amp;Datum=2010&amp;Sort=3&amp;nr=54399&amp;pos=0&amp;anz=241 |archivedate=October 14, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Eastern European countries the copyright laws limit this permission to non-commercial uses of the images only.&lt;ref name="elst"&gt;See e.g. for Russia: Elst, M.: ''Copyright, Freedom of Speech, and Cultural Policy in the Russian Federation'', p.&amp;nbsp;432f; Martinus Nijhoff, Leiden/Boston, 2005; {{ISBN|90-04-14087-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also international differences in the particular definition of a "public place". In most countries, this includes only outdoor spaces (for instance, in Germany),&lt;ref name="de"/&gt; while some other countries also include indoor spaces such as public museums (this is for instance the case in the UK&lt;ref name="uk"/&gt; and in [[Russia]]).&lt;ref name="ru"&gt;Elst p. 432, footnote 268. Also see [http://www.consultant.ru/popular/gkrf4/ article 1276 of part IV of the Civil Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607021156/http://www.consultant.ru/popular/gkrf4/ |date=2012-06-07 }} (in force as of January 1, 2008), clarifying this.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a controversy among Filipino photographers and establishment managements. On June 12, 2013, [[Philippine Independence Day]], pro-photography group, Bawal Mag-Shoot dito, launched at the Freedom to Shoot Day protest at [[Luneta Park]]. The group is protesting for their right to take photos on historical and public places, especially in Luneta and [[Intramuros]]. The park management imposes a fee for D-SLR photographers to shoot images for commercial purposes but it was also reported that security guards also charge 500 pesos to shoot photos even for non-commercial purposes, an act which the advocacy group branded as "extortion". The group also claimed that there is discrimination against Filipino photographers and claimed that the management is lenient on foreign photographers. There is no official policy on taking photographs of historical places and the group has called legislators to create a law on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nadezhda |last=Tanola |url=http://www.remate.ph/2013/06/photographers-to-declare-june-12-as-freedom-to-shoot-day/#.UuMvkxAhLIU |title=Photographers to declare June 12 as ‘Freedom to Shoot Day’ - Remate &amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2014-02-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202220640/http://www.remate.ph/2013/06/photographers-to-declare-june-12-as-freedom-to-shoot-day/#.UuMvkxAhLIU |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-terrorism laws==
Tension has arisen in countries where freedom to take pictures in public places conflicts with more recent [[anti-terrorism legislation]]. In the United Kingdom, the powers granted to police under section 44 of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] have been used on numerous occasions{{fact|date=August 2016}} to stop amateur and professional photographers from taking photographs of public areas. Under such circumstances, police are required to have "reasonable suspicion" that a person is a terrorist.&lt;ref name="photo-homeoffice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-strategy/home-office-circulars/circulars-2009/012-2009/|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130125102358/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-strategy/home-office-circulars/circulars-2009/012-2009/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 January 2013|title=Photography and Counter-Terrorism legislation |date=18 August 2009|publisher=The Home Office|accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Act does not prohibit photography, critics have alleged that these powers have been misused to prevent lawful public photography.&lt;ref name="bbc-terrorist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7351252.stm|title= Innocent photographer or terrorist?|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom |date=17 April 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable instances have included the investigation of a schoolboy,&lt;ref name="schoolboy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/photo-news/terrorism-act-photography-fears-spark-police-response-25025|title=Terrorism Act: Photography fears spark police response|date=30 October 2008|publisher=Amateur Photographer Magazine|accessdate=2 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713150716/http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/photo-news/terrorism-act-photography-fears-spark-police-response-25025|archivedate=13 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Member of Parliament]]&lt;ref name="pelling"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/4144210/Tory-MP-stopped-and-searched-by-police-for-taking-photos-of-cycle-path.html|title=Tory MP stopped and searched by police for taking photos of cycle path|date=6 January 2009|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=30 November 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223201420/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/4144210/Tory-MP-stopped-and-searched-by-police-for-taking-photos-of-cycle-path.html|archivedate=23 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[BBC]] photographer.&lt;ref name="overs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23776068-bbc-man-in-terror-quiz-for-photographing-st-pauls-sunset.do |title=BBC man in terror quiz for photographing St Paul's sunset |last=Davenport |first=Justin |date=27 November 2009 |publisher=Evening Standard |accessdate=30 November 2009 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130161651/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23776068-bbc-man-in-terror-quiz-for-photographing-st-pauls-sunset.do |archivedate=30 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/bbc-man-in-terror-quiz-for-photographing-st-pauls-sunset-6714008.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023085953/http://www.standard.co.uk/news/bbc-man-in-terror-quiz-for-photographing-st-pauls-sunset-6714008.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 October 2012|title=BBC man in terror quiz for photographing St Paul's sunset - News - London Evening Standard|date=23 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of these powers has since been reduced, and guidance around them issued to discourage their use in relation to photography, following litigation in the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="sec44"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/justice-and-fair-trials/stop-and-search/section-44-terrorism-act |title=Section 44 Terrorism Act |publisher=Liberty |accessdate=23 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707060834/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/justice-and-fair-trials/stop-and-search/section-44-terrorism-act |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians also study them, as they are important in understanding the [[social structure]] of [[agrarian society|agrarian]], and even [[industrial society|industrial]], societies. Agriculture provides lots of job opportunities and livelihoods around the world. It can also reflect gender inequality and uneven distribution of resources and privileges among  gender&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://agecon.unl.edu/cornhusker-economics/2018/does-gender-matter-agriculture|title=Does Gender Really Matter in Agriculture? {{!}} Agricultural Economics|last=Network|first=University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{!}} Web Developer|website=agecon.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the Institute of [https://agecon.unl.edu/ Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Nebraska-Lincoln], women are usually harder to obtain land, tools and knowledge than men, especially in developing countries.

==North America==
===United States===
The "classical" farm [[gender role]]s in the [[United States]], although varying somewhat from region to region, were generally based on a division of [[Manual labour|labor]] in which men participated in "field" tasks (animal care, [[plowing]], [[harvest]]ing [[crop]]s, using [[farm machinery]], etc.), while most women participated primarily in "farmhouse" tasks (preparing and preserving food and feedstuffs, and maintaining the farm compound).

According to agro-historian [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02218564 Jane Adams], the middle 20th century brought a change in which the centralization of agriculture eliminated many of the tasks considered part of the "female" role. This changed the perception of women from being active "housekeepers" to passive "homemakers". Some began working off the farm, or joined their husbands in fieldwork, but the majority, per Dr. Adams, simply became more like urban housewives. This trend continued until the 1980s [[farm crisis]], in which [[economic downturn]]s obliged many of them to take jobs off-farm.

===Canada===
Gender roles in [[Agriculture in Canada|Canadian agriculture]] vary greatly according to the region and community.

[[Alberta]], and particularly [[Southern Alberta]], has traditionally had highly defined gender roles similar to the late 19th-century United States. Men worked together and women worked together, but there were few tasks in which both men and women participated together. On most Alberta farms up until the 1970s, decisions about matters such as planning and insurance were done by [[fiat]] of the husband, rather than by joint venture of husband and wife. Some writers have considered Alberta's highly gendered division of farm life to be not only inefficient from an agricultural standpoint, but deleterious to the integrity of marriage relationships as well.

In the agricultural tradition of [[Central Canada]] there is an emphasis on [[Marriage|conjugal]] (husband-and-wife) collaboration. Major decisions are normally made together, with each spouse having equal decisive power. When extended families live and farm together, couples within the extended family are considered as working "units". This style of family farm management is rather common in the rest of Canada as well.

[[Quebec]] agriculture is based on the historic [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurial system]], vestiges of which exist today in the organized district system. Gender roles are sometimes more pronounced in areas where the [[Catholic]] influence is strong.

In [[Southern Ontario]] the history of agricultural gender roles parallels that of the U.S.A. almost precisely.

Besides these regional generalities, traditions vary among different ethnic and religious communities, such as [[First Nations]] (aboriginal), [[Anabaptist]], or historic immigrant settlements.

Across Canada, and also in the United States, the assignment of roles tends to be more [[egalitarian]] on [[Organic farming|organic]] and [[Certified Naturally Grown]] farms than on "conventional" ones.

==Europe==
===C.I.S. (former U.S.S.R.)===
Agricultural society in what is now the [[C.I.S.]] goes back thousands of years, and entails numerous distinct cultures. [[Slavonic language|Slavonic]]-speaking societies tended to follow the general [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-European]] pattern of [[patrilineality]], passing down property and rights from father to son. In agriculture this meant [[farmland|land]] and [[livestock]]. The gender roles on the farm presumed that the farm and all its contents belonged to the father or grandfather. [[Uralic language|Uralic]]-speaking societies, on the other hand, had a relatively egalitarian system in which land was considered to be the domain of a larger extended family or [[folk group]], without rigid boundaries between individual [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]]s. Division of labour was not rigid, and spouses often worked alongside each other, or helped each other with various tasks.

During the [[Russian Empire]] period, Slavonic patriarchy was emphasized and promoted to a greater extent across the board. This was especially the case in southern and central Russia during the 18th and 19th centuries, where every farmer or farm labourer was considered to hold a position in the [[feudal]] [[hierarchy]] of the Empire, until this system was modified in the later 19th century. Men were the official landowners and decision-makers, though women often had a significant amount of unofficial influence in decision-making (on the free [[peasant]] farmsteads).

In the years leading up to the [[Revolution]], as the remnants of feudalism disintegrated, many Russian farm families joined ''artels'' (артели), or cooperatives. The cooperatives practised (at least in theory) equal consideration of men's and women's opinions in making collective decisions, which was a sharp contrast to the feudal method. Moreover, as the Empire became more connected by rail and road, the [[rural]] residents of central and southern Russia gained knowledge of Uralic-based farm operation systems (which had survived in the north and east). These northern and eastern traditions contributed to the emerging cooperative practices.

After the Revolution, the government was initially supportive toward the [[artel]] movement (since it is "[[collectivist]]"). When the [[Stalinist]] government took power, however, many of the artels were superseded by [[Sovkhoz|state farm]] units (''sovkhozy'' or Совхоэӣ) under control of the central government. The effect on gender roles varied: workers of both sexes were assigned to do similar tasks, but [[Management|managers]] and [[wikt:overseer|overseer]]s were mostly male, though there was no fixed rule or custom that established this as absolute. Fieldworkers often worked in mixed-gender teams, though in the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] and Middle [[Asia]]n republics an informal segregation by sex was maintained, following local (and ultimately [[Islamic]]) traditions. Throughout the Union, state-farm [[administrator (business)|administrator]]s tended to have little regard for [[marital]] relationships: marriage was considered part of the workers' personal lives, which needed not enter into the world of [[economic]] labour. Children born or conceived on a state farm were considered "bound" to it, in a concept lent from feudalism.

Later governments, from Krushchev's onward, eased the central control of farms, though certain republics (such as [[Tajikistan]]) took up this control into their own state governments, and retain much of it even to this day.

With the 1960s loosening of central administration over agriculture, the cooperative system became once again the main system of large-scale farmland operations in much of the U.S.S.R. This condition has remained ever since, with only minor changes.

Where small and extended family farms exist in the C.I.S., consensus is often a major mode of decision-making, and cooperation a major mode of work. On collective farms as well, conjugal collaboration is a respected and encouraged part of the overall dynamic, and couples often work as units within the larger framework. Exceptions include the [[Chechenya]]/[[Dagestan]]/[[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Naxcivan]] region, where all areas of life are highly sex-segregated, and marriage is often an arranged contract by the parents.

===Finland===
[[Agriculture in Finland|Finnish agriculture]] tends to follow a modern form of what is recognizably the Uralic system, though the influence of [[western Europe]] (particularly in [[Finland]]'s west half) has brought a greater consciousness of [[private property]]. Conjugal collaboration and joint venture are major characteristics of the Finnish farming tradition.

==Latin America==
===Mexico===
In Mexico, the most important crop has been and still is [[maize]]. It is the main ingredient in [[tortillas]], which is a staple in Mexican cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;Maize diversity and gender: research from Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, for many Mexicans, especially those living in rural farming communities, maize symbolizes the origin of life. Women, therefore, are usually the ones responsible for tending the maize crops, although it is not unusual for a man to farm the maize.&lt;ref&gt;"Si No Comemos Tortilla, No Vivimos:” Women, Climate Change, and Food Security in Central Mexico&lt;/ref&gt;

Although women have traditionally been responsible for the entire tortilla process, from farming the maize to grinding the maize into flour and cooking the tortillas, this takes a substantial amount of time. Because of this, recently some women have been purchasing bags of tortilla flour or even pre-made tortillas in local markets to better fit their busy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Maize diversity and gender: research from Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; This has been controversial among individuals living in rural communities, as many people see the tortilla making process as having high importance in the traditions of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;Maize diversity and gender: research from Mexico&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent controversy in Mexico has to do with the type of maize being grown and consumed. Maíz criollo, or [[landrace]] maize, is the most common type of maize grown in Mexico, although recently [[genetically modified crops]] are becoming more widespread. In a focus group meeting conducted among Mexican farmers, the men tended to feel that the [[genetically modified maize]] was better, as it was easier to farm, while the women tended to say that the landrace maize was better because it was more nutritional and better tasting than the genetically modified maize.&lt;ref&gt;Maize diversity and gender: research from Mexico&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], large [[plantation]]s and [[finca]]s are often worked by several families. Fieldwork is a large portion of the workers' time, in the case both of men and of women.

In areas of more scattered agriculture, [[running water]] is often unavailable. It is usually women who must carry large water containers home from the stream or well in these cases, even though it is men who usually lift most other heavy loads on the Brazilian ranch, such as [[harvest]] sacks.

Among inland [[indigenous people]]s, varying forms of the pan-[[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] (or pan-Amazon-basin) gender role construct are seen. In these societies, especially those in which [[polygynous]] marriage has been practiced, the family unit is considered on two levels, the [[matrifocal]] and the [[patrifocal]]. [[Crop]] plots are owned by the brothers of any patrifocal family collectively; thus, if a man plants a field of any crop, all of his brothers and paternal half-brothers are considered to automatically own an equal share of the harvest.&lt;ref&gt;Chagnon, N. 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile and Argentina===
Agriculture is varied but consists largely of [[ranch]]ing activity. There is very little emphasis on gender roles in [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]], compared to the rest of [[South America]]. Names for most agricultural "job descriptions" and individual roles are [[Gender-specific job title|gender-neutral]], with only the final letter changing according to the sex of the individual. The [[@]] symbol is sometimes used, in lieu of either "o" or "a", to describe the general occupation without specifying gender, as in ''Buscamos puester@s para...'' (as might be written in a help-wanted [[poster]]).

== Africa ==
In a lot of African countries nowadays, women rights are secondary in the sense that males dominant in assets, ownership, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.keg.lu.se/en/research/research-projects/current-research-projects/afrint|title=AFRINT|date=2014-09-12|work=The Department of Human Geography|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are usually in charge of light farming or crop processing, while males have more opportunities to work with livestock and stay out of their household duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/publications/sofa/the-state-of-food-and-agriculture/en/|title=The State of Food and Agriculture {{!}} FAO {{!}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it also vary with ethnic groups, age and production cycles.

'''Green Maps''' are locally created environmentally themed maps with a universal [[symbol]] set and map-making resources provided by the non-profit Green Map System. Based on the principles of [[cartography]] a Green Map plots the locations of a community's natural, cultural and sustainable resources such as recycling centers, heritage sites, community gardens, toxic waste sites and socially [[conscious business]]es.

== History ==
Green Maps are an educational and environmental communication tool for advocacy and public awareness first created for New York City by eco-designer Wendy Brawer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecocultural.info|title=Wendy E. Brawer|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Modern World Design in 1992 as seen at the [http://www.GreenAppleMap.org Green Apple Map] website. The global Green Map System was formed as a result of the response to this first Green Map. Since 1995, Green Mapmaking has grown steadily around the world.

[[File:About us staff.jpg|thumb|Green Map System's staff]]
Green Map’s office in New York City is the resource development, outreach and support center. Due to the growth in the number of projects a decentralized or "hub" based management system has been adopted. Green Map System has encouraged various regions to form local support networks. Green Map System and its network of regional hubs and community-led Green Map projects share their outcomes.

The website GreenMap.org is the gathering point for both the makers and the users of Green Maps. GreenMap.org went online in 1995 and it was re-launched in May 2007, with a resource center for Mapmakers all over the world to communicate and exchange their Green Map making experience. This content management system is named as [[Greenhouse]], symbolizing its ability to cultivate and present a “garden of Green Maps”.

Although Green Map System authorizes local mapmakers to use its  [http://www.greenmap.org/greenhouse/participate Green Mapmaking] icons and tools, every project is independent and locally led. Grassroots and established non-profits, universities and schools, governmental and tourism agencies use the icons and adaptable methodologies to develop and publish their own community's Green Map in a way that meets the needs of residents and visitors.

== Branding and spelling ==
While Green Map System prefers and promotes the spelling "Green Map" to preserve trademark claims,&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Brawer, e-mail message to Jerrad Pierce, November 21, 2004 regarding word choice in [http://cambridgema.greenmap.org/misc/Thesis.pdf "Improving the Cartographic Quality of Green Maps"]&lt;/ref&gt;
"green map" and "greenmap" are often used by local Green Map projects. Green Map System is concerned with maintaining control of copyright and trademark in order to preserve the perceived integrity of the system; they wish to prevent the use of Green Maps in [[greenwash]]ing&lt;ref&gt;Brawer, Wendy. "Copyright &amp; Icon updating".  11 December 2004. [http://www.greenmap.com/gm/forum/viewtopic.php?p=90 http://www.greenmap.com/gm/forum/viewtopic.php?p=90] (31 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and do not allow public use of their assets.&lt;ref&gt;Green Map System, "Mapmaker Checklist". 22 September 2003. [http://www.greenmap.org/report/checklist03.txt http://www.greenmap.org/report/checklist03.txt](31 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Map tagline is “Think Global, Map Local!”. It’s a play on the familiar think global - act local, and implies the same depth of local involvement for positive change.

All Green Maps use a set of globally designed [http://www.greenmap.org/greenhouse/about/iconintro Green Icons], developed collaboratively by the network of local project leaders. Allegedly this is the world’s only universal symbol set for maps. The globally designed icons ensure that all Green Maps engage and guide a diversity of users. Because concepts of sustainability are continually evolving, Green Mapmakers have developed the third version of the symbols, released in March 2008. Provided as a font for ease of use or as stickers for youth/computer-less Green Mapmakers.

'''''Homo homini lupus''''', or in its unabridged form '''''Homo homini lupus est''''', is a [[Latin proverb]] meaning "A man is a wolf to another man," or more tersely "Man is wolf to man." It has meaning in reference to situations where people are known to have behaved in a way comparably in nature to a [[wolf]]. The wolf as a creature is thought, in this example, to have qualities of being predatory, cruel, inhuman i.e. more like an animal than civilized.

==History==
A variation of the proverb appeared as line 495 in the play ''[[Asinaria]]'' by [[Plautus]]: "''Lupus est homo homini, non homo, quom qualis sit non novit''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Titus Maccius Plautus|author-link=Plautus|title=Asinaria|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/plautus/asinaria.shtml|website=The Latin Library|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[wikiquote:Plautus#Asinaria_.28The_One_With_the_Asses.29|has been translated]] as "Man is no man, but a wolf, to a stranger," or more precisely "A man is a wolf, not a man, to another man which he hasn't met yet."

As a counterpoint, [[Seneca the Younger]] wrote, in his ''[[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium]]'' (specifically, Epistula XCV, paragraph 33), "''homo, sacra res homini''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lucius Annaeus Seneca|author-link=Seneca the Younger|title=Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep14-15.shtml|website=The Latin Library|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[wikisource:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 95|has been translated]] as "man, an object of reverence in the eyes of man".

[[Erasmus]] included the proverb in his ''[[Adagia]]'', writing of the variation by Plautus, "Here we are warned not to trust ourselves to an unknown person, but to beware of him as of a wolf."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erasmus|first=Desiderius|author-link=Desiderius Erasmus|year=2001|orig-year=1500-1536|editor-last=Barker|editor-first=William|title=The Adages of Erasmus|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0802048749|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmJn6IFMyicC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SvHxgZrDwC&amp;sig=EOZUjNww1ezfCBfkNQLPZekbB1c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0JSQVbDEMoOwsAWI0oPoBA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher, theologian, and jurist [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (in Latin, Franciscus de Victoria) [[wikisource:De Indis De Jure Belli/Part_2|wrote in one of his ''Relectiones Theologicae'']] that the poet [[Ovid]] disagreed with the proverb: "'Man,' says Ovid, 'is
not a wolf to his fellow man, but a man.'"

[[Thomas Hobbes]] drew upon the proverb in his ''[[De Cive]]'', [[wikisource:De Cive|writing in the dedication]] "To speak impartially, both sayings are very true; That Man to Man is a kind of God; and that Man to Man is an arrant Wolfe. The first is true, if we compare Citizens amongst themselves; and the second, if we compare Cities." Hobbes was describing the tendency of people to act fairly and generously toward other people in the same society and the tendency of societies to act deceptively and violently toward other societies, or [[wikisource: De Cive|as he put it]], "In the one, there's some analogie of similitude with the Deity, to wit, Justice and Charity, the twin-sisters of peace: But in the other, Good men must defend themselves by taking to them for a Sanctuary the two daughters of War, Deceipt and Violence."

[[Sigmund Freud]] agreed with the proverb, writing in his ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', "Men are not gentle creatures, who want to be loved, who at the most can defend themselves if they are attacked; they are, on the contrary, creatures among whose instinctual endowments is to be reckoned a powerful share of aggressiveness. As a result, their neighbor is for them not only a potential helper or sexual object, but also someone who tempts them to satisfy their aggressiveness on him, to exploit his capacity for work without compensation, to use him sexually without his consent, to seize his possessions, to humiliate him, to cause him pain, to torture and to kill him. ''Homo homini lupus.'' Who in the face of all his experience of life and of history, will have the courage to dispute this assertion?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|author-link=Sigmund Freud|title=Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930 (excerpt)|url=http://historyguide.org/europe/freud_discontents.html|website=The History Guide|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primatologist and ethologist [[Frans de Waal]] disagreed with the proverb, writing that it "contains two major flaws. First, it fails to do justice to canids, which are among the most gregarious and cooperative animals on the planet (Schleidt and Shalter 2003). But even worse, the saying denies the inherently social nature of our own species."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Waal|first=Frans|author-link=Frans de Waal|year=2006|title=Primates and Philosophers: How Morality Evolved|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691124477|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PccMuO2pcOcC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;1pg=PA3&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI1OW82OnbxgIVEEGICh1KXgTY#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sacco and Vanzetti|Bartolomeo Vanzetti]], after being convicted of murder, along with Nicolo Sacco, in 1927, said that their pending execution would become an emblem "of a cursed past in which man was wolf to the man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/saccov/courtspeech.html|title=Speeches by Sacco and Vanzetti to the Court at the Time of Sentencing|last=Linder|first=Douglas O.|access-date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Business Communication Standards''' ('''IBCS''') are practical proposals for the design of business communication published for free use under a [[Creative Commons|Creative-Commons-Lizenz]] (CC BY-SA). In most cases, applying IBCS means the proper conceptual, perceptual and semantic design of [[charts]] and [[table (database)|table]]s.

== Requirements ==
Business Communication meets the IBCS Standards if it complies with the three rule sets comprising the three pillars of IBCS:
# Conceptual rules help to clearly relay content by using an appropriate storyline. They are based on the work of authors such as [[Barbara Minto]].&lt;ref&gt;Minto, Barbara: The Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing and Thinking [1987, reissued in London 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; They owe wide acceptance to their scientific, experimental, or practical experience basis. &lt;BR&gt; They correspond with [[SUCCESS - a rule set for business communication]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hichert.com/en/success/ SUCCESS - a rule set for business communication]&lt;/ref&gt; SAY and STRUCTURE. 
# Perceptual rules help to clearly relay content by using an appropriate visual design. They are based on the work of authors such as [[William Playfair]], [[Willard Cope Brinton]],&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, Willard Cope: Graphic Methods for Presenting Facts, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Zelazny]],&lt;ref&gt;Zelazny, Gene: 
Say It With Charts: The Executive's Guide to Visual Communication Hardcover – March 15, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Tufte]] and [[Stephen Few]].&lt;ref&gt;Few, Stephen: Show Me the Numbers, 2. edition, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Again, these rules owe wide acceptance to their scientific, experimental, and/or practical experience basis.&lt;BR&gt;They correspond with the SUCCESS rule sets EXPRESS, SIMPLIFY, CONDENSE, and CHECK.
# Semantic rules help to clearly relay content by using a uniform notation (IBCS Notation). They are based on the work of [[Rolf Hichert]]&lt;ref&gt;Hichert, R.: Sprache der Controller, Interview in: Controller Magazin, Ausgabe September/Oktober 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and other contributors of the IBCS Association. As they are manifested by convention, semantic rules must first be more widely accepted to become a standard.&lt;BR&gt;They correspond with the SUCCESS rule set UNIFY.

== IBCS Notation ==
IBCS Notation is the designation for the semantic rule set suggested by IBCS. IBCS Notation covers the unification of terminology (e.g. words, abbreviations, and number formats), descriptions (e.g. messages, titles, legends, and labels), dimensions (e.g. measures, scenarios, and time periods), analyses (e.g. scenario analyses and time series analyses), and indicators (e.g. highlighting indicators and scaling indicators).

== IBCS Association ==
The review and further development of the IBCS is an ongoing process controlled by the IBCS Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibcs-a.org/ IBCS Association]&lt;/ref&gt; The IBCS Association is a non-profit organization that publishes the Standards for free and engages in extensive consultation and discussion prior to issuing new versions. This includes worldwide solicitation for public comment. Release of IBCS Version 1.0: The active members accepted the released Version 1.0 of the IBCS Standards at the General Assembly of June 18, 2015 in [[Amsterdam]]. Current themes of the further development of the IBCS standards were discussed at the Annual Conference in [[Warsaw]] of June 3, 2016. The version 1.1 of the standards were confirmed by the active members at the Annual Conference in [[Barcelona]] of June 1, 2017. More than 80 professionals of 12 counties attended the Annual Conference.
The Annual Conference in [[London]] of June 8, 2018 took place at the Headquarters to The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

[[Internet]] technologies are used for cause-related [[fundraising]], [[community building]], [[lobbying]], and [[organizing (management)|organizing]]. A digital activism campaign is "an
organized public effort, making collective claims on a target authority, in which civic initiators or supporters use digital media."&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-activism.org/download/1270/ Edwards, Frank, Philip N.

== Types ==
Sandor Vegh divides online activism into three main categories: '''Awareness/advocacy''', '''organization/mobilization''', and '''action/reaction'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KHCjMkNRAkYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=sandor%20vegh%20online%20activism%20categories&amp;ots=NvYT6OGWNj&amp;sig=vT1cUU7btaEJh4kHpNpW459UzCs#v=onepage&amp;q=sandor%20vegh%20online%20activism%20categories&amp;f=false|title=Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice|first1=Martha|last1=McCaughey|first2=Michael D.|last2=Ayers|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other ways of classifying types of online activism, such as by the degree of reliance on the Internet. Thus, Internet sleuthing or hacking could be viewed as purely online forms of activism, whereas the Occupy Wall Street movement was only partially online.

The Internet is a key resource for independent activists, or E-activists, particularly those whose message may run counter to the mainstream. "Especially when a serious violation of [[human rights]] occurs, the Internet is essential in reporting the atrocity to the outside world."&lt;ref&gt;"Classifying Forms of Online Activism: The Case of Cyberprotests Against the World Bank" in ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and PRACTICE,'' Eds. Ayers, Michael D., [[Martha McCaughey|Mccaughey, Martha]], pp. 72-73. Copyright 2003, Routledge, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; [[Listserv]]s like BurmaNet and Freedom News Group help distribute news that would otherwise be inaccessible in these countries.

Internet activists also pass on E-petitions to be sent to the government and public and private organizations to protest against and urge for positive policy change in areas from the [[arms industry|arms trade]] to [[animal testing]]. Many non-profits and charities use these methods, emailing petitions to those on their email list and asking people to pass them on. The Internet also enables organizations such as [[NGO]]s to communicate with individuals in an inexpensive and timely manner. Gatherings and [[protest]]s can be organized with the input of the organizers and the participants. [[Lobbying]] is also made easier via the Internet, thanks to [[e-mail bomb|mass e-mail]] and its ability to broadcast a message widely at little cost. Vegh's concept of organization/mobilization, for example, can refer to activities taking place solely online, solely offline but organized online, or a combination of online and offline. Mainstream [[social networking websites|social-networking sites]], most noticeably [[Facebook.com]], are also making e-activist tools available to their users.  An active participatory culture is enabled by the communities on social networking sites because they permit communication between groups that are otherwise unable to communicate. In the article "Why We Argue about Virtual Community: A Case Study of the Phish.net Fan Community," Nessim Watson stresses the necessity of communication in online communities. He even goes as far as to say that "Without ongoing communication among its participants, a community dissolves". The constant ability to communicate with members of the community enriches online community experiences and redefines the word community.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Nessim "Why We Argue about Virtual Community: A Case Study of the Phish.net Fan Community" pp. 103-104. SAG Publications 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[denial-of-Service attack]]s, the taking over and vandalizing of a website, uploading [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]], and sending out [[e-mail bomb]]s (mass e-mailings) are also examples of Internet activism. For more examples of these types of subversive action, see [[hacktivism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Classifying Forms of Online Activism" in ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice,'' pp. 71-95. Copyright 2003, Routledge, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hashtag activism===
{{Main article|Hashtag activism}}
Hashtag activism is the use of [[hashtag]]s for fighting or supporting a cause through the usage of social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29047/hashtag-activism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use has been associated with the [[2014 Chibok kidnapping]], with hopes that it would help keep the story in the news and raise international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/10/michelle-obama-nigeria-presidential-address | title=Michelle Obama raises pressure over kidnapped schoolgirls | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hashtag itself has received 2 million retweets.

One example of the powerful rise of hashtag activism can be seen in the black feminist movement's use of hashtags to convey their cause. The famous hashtag "IamJada" was an internet backlash to the mocking "#Jadapose" that went viral, ensuing after a sixteen-year-old girl Jada Smart was photographed following her gang rape &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Digital Defense: Black Feminists Resist Violence With Hashtag Activism|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, a hashtag was employed to convey a powerful anti-rape message.

== Development processes ==

Exploring the dynamics of online activism for expressing resistance to a powerful organization, a [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772714000426 study] published in [http://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-organization/ Information and Organization] developed a critical mass approach to online activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghobadi, S., Clegg, S.|title=‘these days will never be forgotten’: Critical Mass Approach to Online Activism|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772714000426|website=Information and Organization|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.infoandorg.2014.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were integrated in a four-year longitudinal process model that explains how online activism started, generated societal outcomes, and changed over time. The model suggests that online activism helped organize collective actions and amplify the conditions for revolutionary movements to form. Yet, it provoked elites’ reactions such as Internet filtering and surveillance, which do not only promote self-censorship and generate digital divide, but contribute to the ultimate decline of activism over time. The process model suggests a complex interplay among stakeholders’ interests, opportunities for activism, costs and outcomes that are neither foreseen nor entirely predictable. The authors challenge universal access to the Internet as a convenient and cost-free forum for practicing social activism by organizational stakeholders (customers, employees, outside parties). In fact, the technology enablers of social activism also enable its filtering and repression and thus more extreme states of information asymmetry may result in which powerful elites preserve their status and impose a greater digital divide.

In one study, a discussion of a developmental model of political mobilization is discussed. By citizens joining groups and creating discussion, they are beginning their first stage of involvement. Progressively, it is hoped that they will begin signing petitions online and graduating to offline contact as long as the organization provides the citizen with escalating steps of involvement (Vitak et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Vitak, J., Zube, P., Smock, A., Carr, C. T., Ellison, N., &amp; Lampe, C. (2011). It's Complicated: Facebook Users' Political Participation in the 2008 Election. Cyberpsychology, Behavior &amp; Social Networking, 14(3), 107-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of the mass media's centrality has been highly contested, with some people arguing that it promoted the voices of marginalized groups while others believe it sends forth the messages of the majority alone, leaving minority groups to have their voices robbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Apparently They Don’t Like Succinct and Articulate’: Journalists, Activists, and the Battle over News|journal=Soundbitten: The Perils of Media-Centered Political Activism|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of early activism ==
One of the earliest known uses of the Internet as a medium for activism was that around Lotus MarketPlace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpsr.org/prevsite/conferences/cfp91/culnan.html/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1990, [[Lotus Software|Lotus]] announced a [[direct mail marketing|direct-mail marketing]] [[database]] product that was to contain name, address, and spending habit information on 120 million individual U.S. citizens. While much of the same data was already available, privacy advocates worried about the availability of this data within one database. Furthermore, the data would be on [[CD-ROM]], and so would remain fixed until a new CD-ROM was issued.

In response, a mass e-mail and E-bulletin-board campaign was started, which included information on contacting [[Lotus Software|Lotus]] and [[form letter]]s. Larry Seiler, a [[New England]]-based computer professional, posted a message that was widely reposted on newsgroups and via e-mail: "It will contain a LOT of personal information about YOU, which anyone in the country can access by just buying the discs. It seems to me (and to a lot of other people, too) that this will be a little too much like [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|big brother]], and it seems like a good idea to get out while there is still time."Over 30,000 people contacted Lotus and asked for their names to be removed from the database. On January 23, 1991, Lotus announced that it had cancelled MarketPlace.&lt;ref&gt;Gurak, L.J. (1997). Persuasion and Privacy in Cyberspace: The Online Protests over Lotus MarketPlace and the Clipper Chip. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, a survey article about online activism around the world, from [[Croatia]] to the [[United States]], appeared in ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine, with several activists being quoted about their projects and views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The earliest example of mass emailing as a rudimentary form of [[DDoS]] occurred on Guy Fawkes Day 1994, when the [[Intervasion of the UK]] began email-bombing John Major's cabinet and UK parliamentary servers in protest against the [[Criminal Justice Bill]], which outlawed outdoor rave festivals and "music with a repetitive beat"

In 1995–1998, Z magazine offered courses online through Left Online University, with lessons on "Using the Internet for Electronic Activism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/pen-l@galaxy.csuchico.edu/msg06511.html |title=(PEN-L:700) USE the INTERNET to CHANGE THE WORLD: An Online Course for Activists |publisher=Mail-archive.com |date=1995-10-08 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of [[cyber-dissidence]] and activism per se, that is, in its modern-day form, may have been inaugurated by Dr. Daniel Mengara, a Gabonese scholar and activist living in political exile in New Jersey in the United States. In 1998, he created a Website in French whose name ''Bongo Doit Partir'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bdpgabon.org/ Bongo Doit Partir]'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;/ref&gt; was clearly indicative of its purpose: it encouraged a revolution against the then 29-year-old regime of Omar Bongo in Gabon. The original URL, http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/ |title=Bongo Doit Partir &amp;#124; Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau |publisher=Globalwebco.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to redirect to http://www.bdpgabon.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdpgabon.org |title=Bongo Doit Partir &amp;#124; Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau |publisher=Bdpgabon.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 2000. Inaugurating what was to become common current-day practice in the politically involved blogosphere, this movement's attempt at rallying the Gabonese around revolutionary ideals and actions has ultimately been vindicated by the 2011 Tunisian and Egyption revolutions, where the Internet has proven to be an effective tool for instigating successful critique, opposition, and revolution against dictators. In July 2003, Amnesty International reported the arrest of five Gabonese known-to-be members of the cyber-dissident group ''Bongo Doit Partir''. The five members were detained for three months (See: Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/001/2003/en |title=Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2003-08-12 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/004/2003/en |title=Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2003-10-15 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Another well-known example of early Internet activism took place in 1998, when the [[Mexico|Mexican]] rebel group [[EZLN]] used decentralized communications, such as cell phones, to network with [[developed world]] activists and help create the [[anti-globalization]] group [[Peoples Global Action]] (PGA) to protest the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-bulletin.org/IBMEF_1_word%206%20files/pablo_rev.htm |title=A world of many worlds |publisher=Iran-bulletin.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PGA continued to call for "global days of action" and rally support of other anti-globalization groups in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/en/pgainfos/history.htm |title=www.agp.org – Brief history of PGA |publisher=Nadir.org |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, a worldwide network of Internet activist sites, under the umbrella name of [[Indymedia]], was created "for the purpose of providing grassroots coverage of the WTO protests in [[Seattle]]" in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org/en/static/about.shtml |title=Independent Media Center – www.indymedia.org – ((( i ))) |publisher=Indymedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line --&gt; |url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2005/03/11/17262451.php |title=Media Activism, Indymedia History, Mar. 11, 2005 |publisher=Indybay.org |date=2005-03-11 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Jackie|date=2001|title=Globalizing Resistance: The Battle of Seattle and the Future of Social Movements|url=|journal=Mobilization: An International Journal|volume=6(1)|pages=1-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dorothy Kidd quotes Sheri Herndon in a July 2001 telephone interview about the role of the Internet in the anti-[[WTO]] protests: "The timing was right, there was a space, the platform was created, the Internet was being used, we could bypass the corporate media, we were using [[open publishing]], we were using [[multimedia]] platforms. So those hadn't been available, and then there was the beginning of the [[anti-globalization movement]] in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;"Indymedia.org: A New Communications Common in ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice'' pp. 59. Eds. Ayers, Michael D., Mccaughey, Martha. Copyright 2003, Routledge, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, in 1999, the Government introduced a new employment tax called IR35. One of the first online trade associations was created to campaign against it. Within weeks they had raised £100,000 off the Internet from individuals who had never even met. They became a fully formed trade association called the Professional Contractors Group, which two years later had 14,000 members all paying £100 each to join. They presented the first ever e-petition to Parliament and organized one of the first flash mobs when using their database, to their surprise and others, 1,000 came in their call to lobby Parliament. They later raised £500,000 from the Internet to fund an unsuccessful High Court challenge against the tax, though ultimately they secured some concessions. Their first external affairs director, Philip Ross, has written a history of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomtofreelance.blogspot.co.uk/ Freedom to Freelance – the online revolution and the fight against IR35] (Philip Ross, Lulu June 2012), {{ISBN|978-1-4717-3575-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engagement in the practice of strategic voting was another development that came with Internet activism.

== The possibilities of online activism ==

Internet activism has had the effect of causing increased collective action among people, as found by Postmes and Brunsting (2002), who discovered a tendency among internet users to rely on internalized group memberships and social identities in order to achieve social involvement online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rodrigo_Sandoval_Almazan/publication/264827018_Towards_cyberactivism_20_Understanding_the_use_of_social_media_and_other_information_technologies_for_political_activism_and_social_movements/links/565bcad908aeafc2aac622a0.pdf|title=Towards cyberactivism 2.0? Understanding the use of social media and other information technologies for political activism and social movements}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Internet is "tailor-made for a populist, insurgent movement," says [[Joe Trippi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slais.ubc.ca/courses/libr500/06-07-wt1/www/M_Holle-WWW/votepairing.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204150800/http://www.slais.ubc.ca/COURSES/libr500/06-07-wt1/www/M_Holle-WWW/votepairing.htm |archivedate=2008-02-04 |format=PDF |title=Citizen 2.0: How the Internet Shapes Citizen Participation}}&lt;/ref&gt; who managed the [[Howard Dean presidential campaign, 2004|Howard Dean campaign]]. In his campaign memoir, ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,'' Trippi notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Internet's] roots in the [[open-source]] [[ARPAnet]], its [[hacker culture]], and its decentralized, scattered architecture make it difficult for big, establishment candidates, companies and media to gain control of it. And the establishment loathes what it can't control. This independence is by design, and the Internet [[community]] values above almost anything the distance it has from the slow, [[homogeneous]] stream of [[United States|American]] commerce and culture. Progressive candidates and companies with forward-looking vision have an advantage on the Internet, too. [[Television]] is, by its nature, a nostalgic [[Media (communication)|medium]]. Look at [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980|Ronald Reagan's campaign]] ads in the 1980s – they were masterpieces of nostalgia promising a return to America's past glory and [[prosperity]]. The Internet, on the other hand, is a forward-thinking and forward-moving medium, embracing change and pushing the envelope of [[technology]] and [[communication]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Use in political campaigns ===

When discussing the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]] candidates, Carol Darr, director of the [[Institute for Politics, Democracy &amp; the Internet]] at [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], said of the candidates which benefited from use of the Internet to attract supporters: "They are all charismatic, outspoken mavericks and insurgents. Given that the Internet is interactive and requires an affirmative action on the part of the users, as opposed to a passive response from TV users, it is not surprising that the candidate has to be someone people want to touch and interact with."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.meetup.com/archives/000456.html  "Website Reels In Political Newbies"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20031005042314/http://press.meetup.com/archives/000456.html |date=2003-10-05 }} Hanstad, Chelsie Salisbury, Bill Pioneer Press, St. Paul, MO accessed February 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A more decentralized approach to campaigning arose, in contrast to a top-down, message-focused approach usually conducted in the mainstream. "The mantra has always been, 'Keep your message consistent. Keep your message consistent,'" said John Hlinko, who has participated in Internet campaigns for [[MoveOn.org]] and the electoral primary campaign of [[Wesley Clark]]. "That was all well and good in the past. Now it's a recipe for disaster ... You can choose to have a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] structure that's really doctrinaire and that's really opposed to grassroots. Or you can say, 'Go forth. Do what you're going to do.' As long as we're running in the same direction, it's much better to give some freedom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.meetup.com] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040924185855/http%3A//press.meetup.com/|date=2004-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-thirds of Internet users under the age of 30 have a SNS, and during the 2008 election, half of them used a SNS site for candidate information (Hirzalla, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Hirzalla, F., van Zoonen, L., &amp; de Ridder, J. (2011). Internet Use and Political Participation: Reflections on the Mobilization/Normalization Controversy. Information Society, 27(1), 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-traditional activism ===

The Internet has become the catalyst for protests such as [[Occupy Wall Street]] and the [[Arab Spring]] as those involved have increasingly relied on social media to organize and stay connected.
In [[Myanmar]], online news paper Freedom News Group has leaked some government corruption and fuel to protests.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/nyregion/wall-street-occupiers-protesting-till-whenever.html?_r=1&amp;ref=occupywallstreet | work=The New York Times | first1=N.

In 2017, the [[Sleeping Giants]] cyberactivist group, among others, launched a boycott campaign against controversial, conservative webpage [[Breitbart News]], getting more than 2,000 organizations to remove it from ad buys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40411086/activists-push-back-against-the-platforms-that-quietly-empower-hate-groups|title=Activists Are Pushing Back Against Tech Platforms That Quietly Empower Hate Groups|date=2017-05-09|work=Fast Company|access-date=2017-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/boycott-breitbart-lyft-hewlett-packard-t-mobile-autodesk-uber-amazon/|title=Lyft, HP won't advertise on Breitbart.

=== Corporate activism ===
Corporations are also using Internet activist techniques to increase support for their causes. According to Christopher Palmeri with ''BusinessWeek'' Online, companies launch sites with the intent to positively influence their own public image, to provide negative pressure on competitors, to influence opinion within select groups, and to push for policy changes.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Palmeri, [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_02/c3865004_mz003.htm Up Front: How To Make A Corporate Cause Click], BusinessWeek Online, January 12, 2004.  retrieved October 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clothing manufacturer, [[American Apparel]] is an example: The company hosts a website called [[Legalize LA]] that advocates [[immigration reform]] via blog, online advertising, links to news stories and educational materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanapparel.net/contact/legalizela/ |title=Legalize LA subpage |publisher=Americanapparel.net |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723013143/http://americanapparel.net/contact/legalizela/ |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news

Corporate methods of information dissemination is labelled "[[astroturfing]]," as opposed to "grassroots activism," due to the funding for such movements being largely private.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/2.01/960105-astroturf.html Anderson, Walter T.

=== Religious activism ===

[[Cybersectarianism]] is a new organizational form which involves: "highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader.  Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders.  Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in collective study via email, on-line chat rooms and web-based message boards."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Thornton, "The New Cybersects: Resistance and Repression in the Reform era. " In Elizabeth Perry and Mark Selden, eds., ''Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance'' (second edition) (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 149-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental activism===
One of the earliest books on activism was Don Rittner's "Ecolinking - Everyone's Guide to Online Environmental Information," Published by Peachpit Press in 1992.  Rittner, an environmental activist from upstate New York, spent more than 20 years researching and saving the Albany Pine Barrens.  He was a beta tester for America Online and ran their Environmental Forum for the company from 1988 to when it launched in 1990.  He took his early environmental knowledge and computer savvy and wrote what was called the bible of the online environmental community.  It showed new Net users how to get online, find environmental information, connect to environmentalists around the world, and how to use those resources to save the planet.

=== Sexual Assault activism ===
Activism against sexual assault can be led on the internet, where individuals may feel comfortable talking about controversial topics. One such movements is the #NotGuilty movement. This movement began in April 2015 with Ione Wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://notguiltycampaign.co.uk/about/|title=About - #NotGuilty|work=#NotGuilty|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; She shared a "letter to her attacker" in her college paper. The letter described how she was sexually assaulted and how she chose to respond and build from that point in her life. At the end of the letter she urged readers to send a letter back describing their own sexual assault experience with the hashtag #notguilty. She received so many letters from locals that she decided to create a website, this caused global attention and inspired many to share their stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wells|first=Ione|title=How we talk about sexual assault online|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/ione_wells_how_we_talk_about_sexual_assault_online|language=en|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Me Too movement]] is a similar movement that started in Hollywood. [[Tarana Burke]] created the phrase to "empower women through empathy" and [[Alyssa Milano]] helped spread the use of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://metoomvmt.org/|title=You Are Not Alone|last=Alone|first=You Are Not|website=You Are Not Alone|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/10/19/the-woman-behind-me-too-knew-the-power-of-the-phrase-when-she-created-it-10-years-ago/|title=The woman behind ‘Me Too’ knew the power of the phrase when she created it — 10 years ago|last=Ohlheiser|first=Abby|date=2017-10-19|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase was first used to demonstrate the amount of sexual assault that happens to young actresses and actors in Hollywood. It soon spread to apply to all forms of sexual assault, especially in the work place. These movements were intended to create an outlet for men and women to share their experiences with those with similar views without blame or guilt. They brought widespread attention to sexual assault and caused much controversy about changes that should be made accordingly. &lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fonda|first=Jane|date=January 1, 2018|title=After #metoo|url=|journal=Nation|volume=306|pages=22-25|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism around movements such as these centers on concerns about whether or not participants are being dishonest for their own gain or are misinterpreting acts of kindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://womensenews.org/2018/01/beware-the-metoo-backlash-it-masks-ugly-lies-about-women/|title=Beware the #MeToo Backlash—It Masks Ugly Lies About Women|work=Women's eNews|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on everyday political discussions ==

According to some observers, the Internet may have considerable potential to reach and engage opinion leaders who influence the thinking and behavior of others. According to the Institute for Politics, Democracy &amp; the Internet, what they call "Online Political Citizens" (OPCs) are "seven times more likely than average citizens to serve as opinion leaders among their friends, relatives and colleagues… Normally, 10% of Americans qualify as Influentials. Our study found that 69% of Online Political Citizens are Influentials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdi.org/UploadedFiles/political%20influentials.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407090353/http://www.ipdi.org/UploadedFiles/political%20influentials.pdf |archivedate=2004-04-07 |format=PDF |title=Political Influentials in the 2004 Presidential campaign |publisher=Institute for Politics, Democracy and the Internet, Graduate School of Political Management |date=February 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information communication technologies ==
Information communication technologies (ICTs) make communication and information readily available and efficient. There are millions of Facebook accounts, Twitter users and websites, and one can educate oneself on nearly any subject. While this is for the most part a positive thing, it can also be dangerous. For example, people can read up on the latest news events relatively easily and quickly; however, there is danger in the fact that apathy or fatigue can quickly arise when people are inundated with so many messages, or that the loudest voice on a subject can often be the most extreme one, distorting public perception on the issue.

These social networks which occupy ICTs are simply modern forms of political instruments which pre-date the technological era.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Laura|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics|year=2010|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can now go to online forums or Twitter instead of town hall meetings. People can essentially mobilize worldwide through the Internet. Women can create transnational alliances and lobby for rights within their respective countries; they can give each other tips and share up-to-date information. This information becomes "hyper textual", available in downloadable formats with easy access for all.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010" /&gt; The UN organizations also use "hyper textual" formats. They can post information about upcoming summits, they can post newsletters on what occurred at these meetings, and links to videos can be shared; all of this information can be downloaded at the click of a button.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010" /&gt; The UN and many other actors are presenting this information in an attempt to get a certain message out in the cyber sphere and consequently steer public perception on an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Laua|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics|year=2010|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With all this information so readily available, there is a rising trend of "slacktivism" or "clicktivism".  While it is positive that information can be distributed so quickly and efficiently all around the world, there is negativity in the fact that people often take this information for granted, or quickly forget about it once they have seen it flash across our computer screens.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010" /&gt;  Viral campaigns are great for sparking initial interest and conversation, but they are not as effective in the long term—people begin to think that clicking "like" on something is enough of a contribution, or that posting information about a current hot topic on their Facebook page or Twitter feed means that they have made a difference.

== Fundraising capability ==

The Internet has also made it easier for small donors to play a meaningful role in financing political campaigns. Previously, small-donor fundraising was prohibitively expensive, as costs of printing and postage ate up most of the money raised.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}} Groups like [[MoveOn.org|MoveOn]], however, have found that they can raise large amounts of money from small donors at minimal cost, with credit card transaction fees constituting their biggest expense. "For the first time, you have a door into the political process that isn't marked 'big money,' " says Darr. "That changes everything.

== Ethical Considerations ==
With [[internet]] technology vastly changing existing and introducing new mechanisms by which to attain, share and employ information, internet activism raises ethical issues for consideration. Proponents contend internet activism serves as an outlet for social progress but only if personal and professional ethics are employed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/articles_papers_reports/770|title=Ethics in Online Activism: False Senses of Social Action or Effective Source of Change?|last=Jaber|first=Rimah|date=February 22, 2016|work=Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs|access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of online activism claim new information and communications technologies help increase the political power of activist groups that would otherwise have less resources. Proponents along this line of thinking claim the most effective use of online activism is its use in conjunction with more traditional or historical activism activities.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Pickerill, "Rethinking political participation: Experiments in internet activism in Australia and Britain." Curtin University of Technology, July, 2002. Retrieved 2017-3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, critics worry about facts and beliefs becoming indistinct in online campaigns and about "sectors of online activism [being] more self-interested than socially interested."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These critics warn against the manipulation commonplace to online activism for private or personal interests such as exploiting charities for monetary gain, influencing voters in the political arena and inflating self-importance or effectiveness. In this sense, the ethical implication is that activism becomes descriptive rather than transformative of society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  One of these reviewers suggests seven pitfalls to beware of in internet activism: "self-promotion at the expense of the movement... unsolicited bulk [[email]]... [[Hacktivism]]... violating [[copyright]]... nagging... violating privacy... and being scary." &lt;ref&gt;Tom Head, "A Short Guide to the Ethics and Etiquette of Online Activism." Pearson, August 4, 2010. Retrieved 2017-3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ethical criticisms against the prevalence of online activism are further discussed in the criticisms section of this article.

== Criticism ==

=== Demographic issues ===
Critics argue that Internet activism faces the same challenges as other aspects of the [[digital divide]], particularly the [[global digital divide]]. Some say it gives disproportionate representation to those with greater access or technological ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shulman.ucsur.pitt.edu/doc/Papers/gendiff.pdf |title=IRMJ01mcmanus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210154058/http://shulman.ucsur.pitt.edu/doc/Papers/gendiff.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen |first=Jakob |url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/digital-divide.html |title=Digital Divide: The Three Stages (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox) |publisher=Useit.com |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups that may be disadvantaged by the move to activist activity online are those that have limited access to technologies, or lack the technological literacy to engage meaningfully online; these include ethnic and racial minorities, those of lower socioeconomic status, those with lower levels of education, and the elderly.

A study looked at the impact of Social Networking Sites (SNS) on various demographics and their political activity. Not surprisingly college students used SNS for political activity the most but this was followed by a more unlikely group, those that had not completed high school. In addition the probability for non-White citizens to consume political information was shown to be higher than that of Whites. These two outcomes go in the face of normal predictors of political activity. Despite these surprising findings older generations, men and whites showed the highest levels of political mobilization. Acts of political mobilization, such as fundraising, volunteering, protesting require the most continued interest, resources and knowledge (Nam, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Nam, T. (2011). Whose e-democracy? The democratic divide in American electoral campaigns. Information Polity: The International Journal of Government &amp; Democracy in the Information Age, 16(2), 131-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Real debate? ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;The experience of the echo chamber is easier to create with a computer than with many of the forms of political interaction that preceded it," Sunstein told the ''[[New York Times]]''. "The discussion will be about strategy, or [[horse race journalism|horse-race issues]] or how bad the other candidates are, and it will seem like debate. It's not like this should be censored, but it can increase acrimony, increase extremism and make mutual understanding more difficult.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Scott Duke Harris of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' noted that "the Internet connects [all sides of issues, not just] an ideologically broad anti-war constituency, from the leftists of [[Act Now to Stop War and End Racism|ANSWER]] to the pressed-for-time '[[soccer moms]]' who might prefer [[moveon.org|MoveOn]], and conservative activists as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216042234/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archivedate=2003-02-16 |format=PDF |title=Scott Duke Harris: Anti-war Movement Marshals Forces Online |author=Scott Duke Harris |date=February 3, 2003 |quote=The Internet connects an ideologically broad anti-war constituency, from the leftists of A.N.S.W.E.R. to the pressed-for-time "soccer moms" who might prefer MoveOn, and conservative activists as well. And for its part, MoveOn is itself part of an anti-war coalition that includes the NAACP, the Sierra Club, the National Organization for Women and the National Council of Churches.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern, according to University of California professor Barbara Epstein, is that the Internet "allows people who agree with each other to talk to each other and gives them the impression of being part of a much larger network than is necessarily the case." She warns that the impersonal nature of communication by computer may actually undermine the human contact that always has been crucial to social movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216042234/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archivedate=2003-02-16 |format=PDF |title=Scott Duke Harris: Anti-war Movement Marshals Forces Online |author=Scott Duke Harris |date=February 3, 2003 |quote=All the Internet traffic may represent an "echo chamber" of virtual activism rather than meaningful protest, warns Barbara Epstein, a University of California-Santa Cruz professor of the history of consciousness. The Internet, she says, "allows people who agree with each other to talk to each other and gives them the impression of being part of a much larger network than is necessarily the case."  The impersonal nature of communication by computer, Epstein suggests, may have a more insidious effect, undermining important human contact that always has been crucial to social movements. During the Vietnam War, "a large sector of a generation got drawn in, in a very personal way. They went to a protest because their roommate was going. The movement became the center of social life. It became the most exciting place on campus."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern, expressed by author and law professor [[Cass Sunstein]], is that online political discussions lead to "[[cyberbalkanization]]"—discussions that lead to fragmentation and polarization rather than consensus, because the same medium that lets people access a large number of news sources also enables them to pinpoint the ones they agree with and ignore the rest.

=== Moving to offline action ===

Famed activist [[Ralph Nader]] has stated that "the Internet doesn't do a very good job of motivating action", citing that the [[United States Congress]], corporations and [[the Pentagon]] do not necessarily "fear the civic use of the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lasar |first=Matthew |url=https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/05/ralph-nader-internet-not-so-hot-at-motivating-action.ars |title=Ralph Nader: Internet not so hot at "motivating action" |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethan Zuckerman]] talks about "[[slacktivism]]", claiming that the Internet has devalued certain currencies of activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.causebuilder.info |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124121745/http://www.causebuilder.info/ |archivedate=2012-11-24 |title=Causebuilder Resources and Information |publisher=Causebuilder.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens may "like" an activist group on [[Facebook]], visit a website, or comment on a blog, but fail to engage in political activism beyond the Internet, such as volunteering or canvassing. This critique has been criticized as Western-centric, however, because it discounts the impact this can have in authoritarian or repressive contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV2E2T9GFaE |title=Cyberactivism and the Arab Revolt: Battles Waged Online and Lessons Learned (Part 1 of 9) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Courtney C. Radsch]] argued that even this low level of engagement was an important form of activism for [[Arab]] youth because it is a form of free speech, and can spark mainstream media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bakerinstitute.org/publications/ITP-pub-CyberactivismAndWomen-051712.pdf |title=Unveiling the Revolutionaries: Cyberactivism and Women's Role in the Arab Uprisings|author=Radsch, Courtney|publisher=Rice University | date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slacktivism ===

Scholars are divided as to whether the Internet will increase or decrease political participation, including online activism. Those who suggest political participation will increase believe the Internet can be used to recruit and communicate with more users, and offers lower-costs modes of participation for those who lack the time or motivation to engage otherwise. Those concerned that the Internet will decrease activism argue that the Internet occupies free time that can no longer be spent getting involved in activist groups, or that Internet activism will replace more substantial, effortful forms of in-person activism.

=== Clicktivism ===

Another criticism is clicktivism. According to techopedia, clicktivism is a controversial form of digital activism. Proponents believe that applying advertising principles such as A/B testing increases the impact of a message by leveraging the Internet to further its reach. Opponents believe that clicktivism reduces activism to a mere mouse-click, yielding numbers with little or no real engagement or commitment to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Janssen |first=Cory |url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/28184/clicktivism |title=What is Clicktivism? - Definition from |publisher=Techopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Micah M. White]] argues, "Political engagement becomes a matter of clicking a few links. In promoting the illusion that surfing the web can change the world, clicktivism is to activism as McDonalds is to a slow-cooked meal. It may look like food, but the life-giving nutrients are long gone."&lt;ref name="commondreams1"&gt;{{cite web|last=White |first=Micah |url=https://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/08/12-4 |title=Clicktivism is Ruining Leftist Activism |publisher=Common Dreams |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that political engagement becomes a matter of clicking a few links and neglects the vital, immeasurable inner-events and personal epiphanies that great social ruptures are actually made of. It reduces activism to a mere mouse click.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bath.ac.uk/hss-placements/2012/12/02/clicktivism/ |title=Humanities &amp; Social Sciences' Placements |publisher=Blogs.bath.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Micah M. White]] goes on to argue that "... clicktivism reinforces the fear of standing out from the crowd and taking a strong position. It discourages calling for drastic action. And as such, clicktivism will never breed social revolution. To think that it will is a fallacy. One that is dawning on us".&lt;ref name="commondreams1" /&gt;

=== State repression ===

In ''Net Delusion'', author Evgeny Morozov argues against cyberutopianism. He describes how the Internet is successfully used against activists and for the sake of state repression.&lt;ref&gt;Morozov, E. (2011). The Net Delusion The Dark Side of Internet Freedom. New York: Public Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13006">'''Monsignor John O'Grady''', Ph.D. (March 31, 1886 – January 2, 1966) was a sociologist, economist, social reformer. O’Grady served as executive secretary of the National Conference of Catholic Charities (now [[Catholic Charities USA]]) from 1920 to 1961.

== Life ==
John O'Grady, the son of Francis O'Grady and Margaret (Hayes) O'Grady, was born on March 31, 1886 in Annagh Feakle, County Clare, Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;"O'Grady, Right Rev. Msgr. John". ''Washington Post'', January 3, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in Ireland and attended seminary at the [[All Hallows College]] in Dublin, where he was ordained on June 24, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.lib.cua.edu/findingaid/ogrady.cfm "Msgr. John J. O'Grady"] American Catholic History Research Center and Archives, Catholic University of America. Retrieved February 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; After ordination, O'Grady was assigned to serve in the diocese of Omaha, Nebraska.

In 1912, O'Grady was sent to Catholic University of America to pursue a graduate degree. He completed a doctorate in sociology and economics in 1915, with a dissertation called "The Legal Minimum Wage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/exhibits/show/immigration/documents/bio-o-grady "Biography: John O'Grady"] American Catholic History Classroom, Catholic University of America. Retrieved February 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady, John. [https://archive.org/details/legalminimumwage00ograrich "The Legal Minimum Wage."] Ph.D. dissertation. Catholic University of America (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; During his study, O'Grady also took summer courses at Johns Hopkins University and Chicago University. In Chicago, O'Grady became fascinated by Jane Addams and the [[settlement movement]]. He later wrote that “I came to regard [[Jane Addams|Jane Adams]] [sic] as one of the great leaders of American life.”&lt;ref&gt;Hansan, Jack.

== Work ==

===Academics===
O'Grady became a professor of economics at [[Catholic University of America]] in 1915 and taught at the school for several decades in the sociology and economics departments. He also taught sociology at Trinity College in Washington, D.C. (now called [[Trinity Washington University]]).&lt;ref&gt;“Msgr. John O'Grady; Social Reform Leader.” ''Washington Daily News'', January 3, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, O’Grady helped to found Catholic University’s School of Social Work and served as its dean from 1934 to 1938.&lt;ref&gt;“Msgr. John O'Grady; Social Reform Leader.” ''Washington Daily News'', January 3, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The National Conference of Catholic Charities===
While at Catholic University, O'Grady was mentored by Monsignor [[William J. Kerby]], who was a professor and a founder of the recently formed National Conference of Catholic Charities (NCCC), later called [[Catholic Charities USA]]. Kerby encouraged O'Grady to become involved in the work of the NCCC.&lt;ref&gt;Hansan, Jack. [http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/organizations/catholic-charities-usa/ "Catholic Charities USA"], Social Welfare History Project.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, O'Grady was elected to be Kerby's successor as executive secretary of the NCCC, a position he would hold until 1961.&lt;ref&gt;"Proceedings of the Sixth Biennial Meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Charities, 1920." Catholic University of America Archives, Catholic Charities USA Collection.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.lib.cua.edu/findingaid/ogrady.cfm "Msgr. John J. O'Grady"] American Catholic History Research Center and Archives, Catholic University of America. Retrieved February 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

As secretary of the NCCC, O’Grady worked to professionalize Catholic social services and staff by developing and training diocesan organizations, improving communication across agencies, and training workers.&lt;ref&gt;Sadowski, Dennis. [http://catholiccharitiesusa.org/history-accessible/ “Msgr. O’Grady Defined Catholic Charities as Advocate of the Poor.”] Catholic News Service, September 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

O’Grady also advocated for social justice measures and lobbied for “widespread social reform based on Catholic principles,” on a wide variety of issues, including: support of New Deal relief measures, the [[Social Security Act]], housing legislation, measures for [[displaced persons]] following World War II, and immigration reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/exhibits/show/immigration/documents/bio-o-grady "Biography: John O'Grady"] American Catholic History Classroom, Catholic University of America. Retrieved February 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, O’Grady served as managing-editor and eventually editor at ''The Catholic Charities Review''. At the ''Review'', O’Grady worked alongside [[John A. Ryan]], who served as editor-in-chief and eventually contributing editor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009996818 ''The Catholic Charities Review'']&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Review'', itself the successor to the ''St. Vincent’s Quarterly'', was the “clearinghouse of material and information related to the work of Catholic Charities.” The publication ceased production in 1975 and was succeeded by Catholic Charities USA’s publication ''Charities. '' &lt;ref&gt;Hansan, Jack.

Retrieved February 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As managing editor and editor, O’Grady authored editorials in the monthly publication that took positions on everything from unemployment relief efforts in the Great Depression to social work practices.

===Advocacy===
O’Grady served as an advocate for many social reform measures, working behind the scenes with congressmen and testifying before Congress on issues such as: unemployment relief, immigration, migrant labor, and public housing measures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980DE0D9103BEF34BC4B53DFB766838D679EDE “Msgr. O’Grady, 79, Social Reformer: Catholic Charities Aide Dies—Helped 40,000 DPs”]. ''New York Times'', January 3, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, O’Grady developed strong relationships behind the scenes, becoming a resource for legislators such as Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]] (D-NY) and administrators such as [[Harry Hopkins]] and [[Aubrey Willis Williams]].

In 1919, O'Grady was appointed as secretary of the Committee of Reconstruction and After War Activities of the National Catholic War Council (later the [[National Catholic Welfare Council]]). It was in this position that O'Grady persuaded [[John A. Ryan]] to write the Bishop's Program on Social Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, Phillip. "Contending With Modernity: Catholic Higher Education in the Twentieth Century." (Oxford University Press: 1995) 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, O’Grady helped create the first National Public Housing Conference. He served as chairman of the Housing Legislative Information Service, “a group which brings together representatives of all organizations in the United States interested in housing,” from 1945 to 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Padgett. "Monsignor John O’Grady: Lover of People". Catholic University Archives: John O’Grady Collection, Box 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

O’Grady was vocally opposed to restrictive immigration reform laws that were proposed in the wake of [[World War II]]. In 1952, O’Grady was named as a member of the [[Presidential Commission (United States)|President’s Commission]] on Immigration and Naturalization by President [[Harry S. Truman]]. During that time, O’Grady was outspoken in his opposition to the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|McCaran-Walter Act]]. He was particularly critical of the bill’s inclusion of a literacy test and the continuation of the national quota system that favored immigrants from Western European nations, which O’Grady believed was prejudiced and would perpetuate “the doctrine of Nordic superiority.”&lt;ref&gt;Msgr. John O'Grady, [http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/exhibits/show/immigration/documents/nordic "The McCarran Immigration Bill: the Perpetuation of the Doctrine of Nordic Superiority is the Basic Question,"] Commonweal, June 20, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; O’Grady said that America “can't discriminate against two-thirds of the world and still presume to be the leader of the Western democracies.”&lt;ref&gt;“Msgr. O’Grady, Is Dead at 79.” ''Washington Post'', January 3, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

O’Grady befriended [[Saul Alinsky]], the pioneer of community organizing, in the 1940s. In 1952, Alinsky contracted with a publisher to write a biography of O’Grady’s life. Though the manuscript was drafted, it was never published.&lt;ref&gt;Alinsky, Saul. ''Unpublished Biography''. Catholic University Archives: John O’Grady Collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
O’Grady died from a kidney ailment on January 2, 1966 at Carroll Manor, a retirement home for clergy in [[Hyattsville, Maryland]]. Archbishop [[Patrick Aloysius O'Boyle|Patrick O’Boyle]] celebrated a pontifical mass in O’Grady’s honor on January 5, 1966 at St. Mathew’s Cathedral in Washington, DC. Archbishop Boyle said in a tribute to O’Grady that “his influence on charitable work of the Church in this country and throughout the world for widespread social reform will long be remembered. He was truly a modern apostle of Christian charity.” O’Grady was buried at Mt. Olivet Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;“Msgr. John O'Grady; Social Reform Leader.” ''Washington Daily News'', January 3, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several remembrances of O’Grady following his death, including a speech by then-[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]], [[John William McCormack]], who said: “We may well mourn that such a man has left us, but the occasion of his death is truly, in the long view, the occasion for rejoicing, both in the splendor of his Christian soul, and in the lasting benefits which his career has brought to our Nation [sic] and to the world. May his soul rest in peace and may his example inspire generations yet to come.”&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Record'', January 20, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SwissKeroseneLamp.jpg|thumb|upright|Swiss flat-wick kerosene lamp. The knob protruding to the right adjusts the wick, and hence the flame size.]]

A '''kerosene lamp''' (also known as a '''paraffin lamp''' in some countries) is a type of [[lighting]] device that uses [[kerosene]] (paraffin) as a [[fuel]]. Invented by the [[Poles|Polish]] pharmacist [[Ignacy Łukasiewicz]] in 1853, kerosene lamps have a [[Candle wick|wick]] or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held [[lantern]]s may be used for portable lighting. Like [[oil lamp]]s, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without [[rural electrification]], in [[electrification|electrified]] areas during [[power outage]]s, at [[campsite]]s, and on [[boat]]s. There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat-wick, central-draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp. Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead-flame, hot-blast, and cold-blast variants.

Pressurized kerosene lamps have a [[gasification|gas generator]] and [[gas mantle]]; these are known as [[Petromax]], [[Tilley lamp]]s, or [[Coleman Lantern|Coleman]] lamps, among other manufacturers. They produce more light per unit of fuel than wick-type lamps, but are more complex and expensive in construction and more complex to operate. A hand-pump pressurizes air, which forces liquid fuel from a reservoir into a gas generator. Vapor from the gas generator burns, heating a mantle to incandescence and also providing heat to the gas generator.

The first description of a simple lamp using crude mineral oil was provided by [[History of Iran|Persian]] alchemist [[al-Razi]] (Rhazes) in 9th century [[Baghdad]], who referred to it as the "naffatah" in his ''Kitab al-Asrar'' (''Book of Secrets'').&lt;ref&gt;Zayn Bilkadi ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), "The Oil Weapons", ''[[Saudi Aramco World]]'', January–February 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–27.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846 [[Abraham Pineo Gesner]] invented a substitute for [[whale oil]] for lighting, distilled from coal. Later made from petroleum, kerosene became a popular lighting fuel. Modern and most popular versions of the kerosene lamp were later constructed by Polish inventor and pharmacist Ignacy Łukasiewicz. 

Kerosene lamps are widely used for lighting in rural areas of Africa and Asia, where electricity is not distributed or is too costly. Kerosene lamps consume an estimated 77 billion litres of fuel per year, equivalent to 1.3 million barrels of oil per day,&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Bolay, Alexandre Schmid, Gabriela Tejada ''Technologies and Innovations for Development: Scientific Cooperation for a Sustainable Future'', Springer, 2012
{{ISBN|2-8178-0267-5}} page 308.&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to annual U.S. jet-fuel consumption of 76 billion litres per year.&lt;ref&gt;^ Energy Information Administration.

== Types ==

=== Flat-wick lamp ===
[[File:Railway Lamp.jpg|thumb|NZR lamp on the Weka Pass Railway]]
A flat-wick lamp is a simple type of [[kerosene]] lamp, which burns kerosene drawn up through a wick by [[capillary action]]. If this type of lamp is broken, it can easily start a fire. A flat-wick lamp has a fuel tank (fount), with the lamp burner attached. Attached to the fuel tank, four prongs hold the glass chimney, which acts to prevent the flame from being blown out and enhances a thermally induced [[Chimney#Chimney draught or draft|draft]]. The glass chimney needs a "throat", or slight constriction, to create the proper draft for complete [[combustion]] of the fuel; the draft carries more air (oxygen) past the flame, helping to produce a smokeless light, which is brighter than an open flame would produce.

The lamp burner has a flat wick, usually made of [[cotton]]. The lower part of the wick dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene; the top part of the wick extends out of the wick tube of the lamp burner, which includes a wick-adjustment mechanism. Adjusting how much of the wick extends above the wick tube controls the flame. The wick tube surrounds the wick and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp burner.  Adjustment is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric, which is a toothed metal [[sprocket]] bearing against the wick.  If the wick is too high, and extends beyond the burner cone at the top of the wick tube, the lamp will produce [[smoke]] and [[soot]] (unburned carbon). When the lamp is lit, the kerosene that the wick has absorbed burns and produces a clear, bright, yellow [[flame]].  As the kerosene burns, [[capillary action]] in the wick draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank. All kerosene flat-wick lamps use the dead-flame burner design, where the flame is fed cold air from below, and hot air exits above.

This type of lamp was very widely used by railways, both on the front and rear of trains and for hand signals, due to its reliability.  At a time when there were few competing light sources at night outside major towns, the limited brightness of these lamps was adequate and could be seen at sufficient distance to serve as a warning or signal.

=== Central-draft (tubular round wick) lamp ===
{{Main article|Argand lamp}}
[[File:Idealbrenner.JPG|thumb|"Central-draught" tubular-wick kerosene lamp]]

A central-draught lamp, or [[Argand lamp]], works in the same manner as the flat-wick lamp. The burner is equipped with a tall glass chimney, of around {{convert|12|in}} tall or taller, to provide the powerful draft this lamp requires to burn properly. The burner uses a wick, usually made of [[cotton]], that is made of a wide, flat wick rolled into a tube, the seam of which is then stitched together to form the complete wick. The tubular wick is then mounted into a "carrier", which is some form of a toothed rack that engages into the gears of the wick-raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered. The wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes; the inner wick tube (central draft tube) provides the "central draft" or draft that supplies air to the flame spreader. When the lamp is lit, the central draft tube supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of [[fire]] and allows the lamp to burn cleanly.

=== Mantle lamp ===
{{Main article|Gas mantle}}
[[File:Sumburgh Lighthouse Lamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A 85&amp;nbsp;mm Chance Brothers ''Incandescent Petroleum Vapour Installation'', which produced the light for the [[Sumburgh Head Lighthouse|Sumburgh Head lighthouse]] until 1976. The lamp (made around 1914) burned vaporized [[kerosene]] (paraffin); the vaporizer was heated by a [[denatured alcohol]] (methylated spirit) burner to light. When lit, some of the vaporised fuel was diverted to a [[Bunsen burner]] to keep the vaporizer warm and the fuel in vapor form. The fuel was forced up to the lamp by air; the keepers had to pump the air container up every hour or so.  This in turn pressurized the paraffin container to force the fuel to the lamp. The "white sock" is in fact an unburnt mantle, on which the vapor burned.]]

A variation on the "central-draught" lamp is the mantle lamp. The mantle is a roughly pear-shaped mesh made of fabric placed over the burner.  The mantle typically contains [[thorium]] or other [[rare-earth]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]; on first use the cloth burns away, and the rare-earth salts are converted to oxides, leaving a very fragile structure, which [[incandescence|incandesces]] (glows brightly) upon exposure to the heat of the burner flame. Mantle lamps are considerably brighter than flat- or round-wick lamps, produce a whiter light and generate more [[heat]]. Mantle lamps typically use fuel faster than a flat-wick lamp, but slower than a center-draught round-wick, as they depend on a small flame heating a mantle, rather than having all the light coming from the flame itself.

Mantle lamps are nearly always bright enough to benefit from a lampshade, and a few mantle lamps may be enough to heat a small building in cold weather. Mantle lamps, because of the higher [[temperature]] at which they operate, do not produce much odor, except when first lit or extinguished.  Like flat- and round-wick lamps, they can be adjusted for brightness; however, caution must be used, because if set too high, the lamp chimney and the mantle can become covered with black areas of soot. A lamp set too high will burn off its soot harmlessly if quickly turned down, but if not caught soon enough, the soot itself can ignite, and a "runaway lamp" condition can result.

One popular model of mantle lamp uses only a wick and is unpressurized.

Pressurized mantle lamps contain a gas generator and require preheating the generator before lighting.  An air pump is used to deliver fuel under pressure to the gas generator.

Large fixed pressurized kerosene mantle lamps were used in [[lighthouse]] beacons for navigation of ships, brighter and with lower fuel consumption than oil lamps used before.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis L. Noble ''Lighthouses &amp; Keepers: The U.S. Lighthouse Service and Its Legacy'', Naval Institute Press, 2004 {{ISBN|1-59114-626-7}}, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kerosene lantern ===
[[File:Kerosene-lamp-01.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|Dead-flame]]
[[File:Tranby house 49 gnangarra.jpg|thumb|upright|Hot-blast]]
[[File:Kerosine lamp.jpg|thumb|upright|Cold-blast]]

A kerosene lantern, also known as a "barn lantern" or "hurricane lantern", is a flat-wick lamp made for portable and outdoor use. They are made of soldered or crimped-together sheet-metal stampings, with tin-plated sheet steel being the most common material, followed by brass and copper. There are three types: dead-flame, hot-blast, and cold-blast. Both hot-blast and cold-blast designs are called tubular lanterns and are safer than dead-flame lamps, as tipping over a tubular lantern cuts off the oxygen flow to the burner and will extinguish the flame within seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tubular Oil Lanterns&amp;nbsp;— Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.lanterns.us/faqs.htm |publisher=W. T. Kirkman Lanterns, Inc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192016/http://www.lanterns.us/faqs.htm |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest portable kerosene "glass globe" lanterns, of the 1850s and 1860s, were of the dead-flame type, meaning that it had an open wick, but the airflow to the flame was strictly controlled in an upward motion by a combination of vents at the bottom of the burner and an open topped chimney.  This had the effect of removing side-to-side drafts and thus significantly reducing or even eliminating the flickering that can occur with an exposed flame.

Later lanterns, such as the hot-blast and cold-blast lanterns, took this airflow control even further by partially enclosing the wick in a "deflector" or "burner cone" and channeling the airflow through that restricted area, creating a brighter and even more stable flame.

The hot-blast design, also known as a "tubular lantern" due to the metal tubes used in its construction, was invented by John Irwin and patented on January 12, 1868. The hot-blast design collected hot air from above the globe and fed it through metal side tubes to the burner, to make the flame burn brighter.

The cold-blast design is similar to the hot-blast, except that cold fresh air is drawn in from around the top of the globe and is then fed though the metal side tubes to the flame, making it burn brighter. This design produces a brighter light than the hot-blast design, because the fresh air that is fed to the flame has plenty of oxygen to support the combustion process.

== Fuels ==
Generic lamp oil is available clear or in a choice of several colors and in scented and unscented forms. Although more expensive, lamp oil is highly refined and burns more cleanly and with less odor than kerosene. "Lamp oil" must not be liquid paraffin{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. "Water-clear" K-1 kerosene is the next grade of preferred fuel for kerosene wick lamps. In some locations "[[Kerosene#Red Kerosene|red kerosene]]" is sold, which is dyed red and is slightly less expensive than K-1 kerosene, as no [[Fuel tax|motor-fuel taxes]] are collected on it. Red kerosene is not recommended because the dye will gradually clog the lantern wick, causing odor and reduced performance. "Klean-Heat" brand is another highly refined, cleaner-burning, nicer-smelling{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} kerosene substitute sold at many [[hardware store]]s during winter. Citronella-scented lamp oil containing [[citronella oil|lemongrass oil]] is sold for its [[insect repellent]] properties. Citronella fuels should only be used outdoors. Liquid paraffin-based "lamp oil" should only be used in round-wick lamps with a wick diameter of less than {{convert|5/8|in}}. Used in larger wicks, this fuel causes the wicks to clog.{{fact|date=December 2015}}

Flat-wick kerosene lamps should only be operated with kerosene, lamp oil or Klean-Heat, but alternative fuels can be used in an emergency. Such fuels may produce additional smoke and odor and may not be usable indoors. [[Tractor vaporizing oil]] is made from kerosene with some additive to make a [[motor fuel]] for tractors. No. 1 [[diesel fuel]] (also called winter diesel) is about the same as [[kerosene]] but with the additives to make it a [[motor fuel]]. [[Jet fuel|Jet A]] jet-engine fuel is essentially kerosene with a few additives. [[RP-1]] (Rocket Propellant-1) is a highly refined form of kerosene outwardly similar to jet fuel, used as rocket fuel.

Round-wick center-draft lamps must only burn either Klean-Heat or low-odor mineral spirits.

Any liquid with a low [[flash point]] presents a high risk of fire or explosion if used in a kerosene wick lamp. Such liquids are dangerous and should not be used in a kerosene lamp or lantern. Examples include:
* [[charcoal lighter fluid]],
* [[gasoline]] ([[petrol]]),
* [[naphtha]], [[white gas]] or [[Coleman fuel]],
* mineral spirits, paint thinner, [[white spirit]] (Stoddard solvent),
* other hydrocarbon solvents such as [[turpentine]], [[benzene]], [[xylene]], [[toluene]], [[acetone]], [[camphene]], lacquer thinner,
* [[denatured alcohol]].

Contamination of lamp fuel with even a small amount of gasoline results in a lower flash point and higher vapor pressure for the fuel, with potentially dangerous consequences.  Vapors from spilled fuel may ignite; vapor trapped above liquid fuel may lead to excess pressure and fires. Kerosene lamps are still extensively used in areas without electrical lighting; the cost and dangers of combustion lighting are a continuing concern in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.galcit.caltech.edu/EDL/publications/reprints/KeroseneLampCookstove.pdf Joseph E. Shepherd, Frank A. Perez, ''Kerosene Lamps and Cookstoves&amp;nbsp;— the Hazards of Gasoline Contamination'' 2007 retrieved 2012 Feb 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance ==
Flat-wick lamps have the lowest light output, center-draft round-wick lamps have 3–4 times the output of flat-wick lamps, and pressurized lamps have higher output yet; the range is from 8 to 100 [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]]. A kerosene lamp producing 37 lumens for 4 hours per day consumes about 3 litres of kerosene per month.&lt;ref&gt;Narasimha Desirazu Rao ''Distributional Impacts of Energy Policies in India: Implications for Equity'' Stanford University, 2011 page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mediology''' (French: ''médiologie''), broadly indicates a wide-ranging method for the analysis of [[cultural transmission]] in society and across societies, a method which challenges the conventional idea that 'technology is not culture'. The mediological method pays specific attention to the role of organisations and technical innovations, and the ways in which these can ensure the potency of cultural transmission - and thus the transformation of ideas into a civilisational worldview capable of sustained action.

==Overview==
The term was first coined and introduced in French as "médiologie" by the French intellectual [[Régis Debray]] in the "Teachers, Writers, Celebrities" section of his book ''Le pouvoir intellectuel en France'', (Editions Ramsay, 1979). The English form of the term became more widely known and respected in the English-speaking world with the publication of the key text on mediology in English, Debray's ''Transmitting Culture'' (University of Columbia Press, 2004). Mediology was taught for the first time in the Sorbonne (Paris) in 2007.

The practice of mediology is not a science, and thus is able to range across academic disciplines. The main areas involved are those of longitudinal history (the history of technologies, the history of the book, the histories and theories of aesthetics) and also research in communications and information theory.

Mediology is not a narrow specialist area of contemporary academic knowledge (as [[media sociology]] is), nor does it aspire to be a precise science of signs (as [[semiotics]] does). It differs from the models put forward by [[communication studies]], in that its focus is not isolated individuals and a fleeting few moments of communication. Instead mediologists study the cultural transmission of [[religion]]s, ideologies, the arts and political ideas in society, and across societies, over a time period that is usually to be measured in months, decades or millennia. Debray argues that mediology "would like to bring to light the function of [[Media (communication)|medium]] in all its forms, over a long time span - since the birth of writing. And without becoming obsessed by today's media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314|title=Qu'est-ce que la médiologie ?, par Régis Debray (Le Monde diplomatique, août 1999)|publisher=Monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mediology must thus closely examine the methods used for the memorising, transmission, and displacement of cultural knowledge in any [[milieu]]. But it must balance its understanding of these with an equally close study of our individual modes of belief, thoughts, and competing social organisations. Mediology must further understand that such transmission is not simply happening within a lofty [[linguistic]] or textual discourse, but that transmission takes an equally valid concrete form in which "material technologies and symbolic forms"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314|title=Qu'est-ce que la médiologie ?, par Régis Debray (Le Monde diplomatique, août 1999)|publisher=Monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; combine to produce things such as [[rituals]], [[architecture]], [[flags]], special sites, customs, [[typefaces]] and [[book binding]]s, smells and sounds, [[body language|bodily gestures and postures]], all of which have a potent anchoring role in cultural transmission among ordinary people.

Debray further points to the need to consider the role in transmission of all manner of non-media technical-cultural inventions, especially those of new forms of transportation. He gives the historical example of the [[bicycle]], which he suggests was historically associated with: the rise of a democratic rational individualism; a new role for women in advanced societies; and the new kinetic ideas expressed in early [[modernist]] art and cinema.

A mediologist might thus make an examination "within a system" (e.g. of systems of book production, of authors and publishers), or of "the interaction between systems" (e.g. how [[painting]] and [[early photography]] influenced each other), or even of "the interactions across systems" (e.g. the ways in which symbolic transmission of systematic knowledge is brought to intersect with the material history of actual transportation - such as desert trading routes and ancient religion, [[telegraph]] and railroad, the radio and airplanes, television and satellites, mobile phones and cars).

Debray is generally critical of some of the ideas of [[Marshall McLuhan]] (whom he sees as being overly [[Technological determinism|technologically determinist]]), and of the French [[sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. He also tries to step beyond [[Antonio Gramsci]], in that he suggests that an ideology cannot be comprehended in ideological terms alone.

==Criticisms==
Criticisms of mediology in English so far have been found in two short book reviews and one article.  The first, by the screenwriter [[Yvette Biro|Yvette Bíró]] (''Wide Angle'' magazine, Vol.18, No.1, January 1996), was a four-page book review of Debray's ''Vie et Mort de l'Image'', in which she claimed to have discerned "traces of a strong, vulgar [[Marxist]] school of thought".

The second review, by [[Pramod Nayor]] of the University of Hyderabad (''Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory'', Vol.8, No.1, Winter 2006) was a review of the English translation of ''Transmitting Culture'' (2004).  In concluding the review Nayor notes the similarities of some aspects and directions of mediology to [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School cultural studies]] ranging from "[[Raymond Williams]] through [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]". Nayor also notes that recent philosophers and historians of science - he cites [[Bruno Latour]], [[Eugene Thacker]] and [[Dwight Atkinson]] - have also examined science in relation to "intersecting cultural, ethnic, economic and iconographic 'bases' of the transmission of culture"

An article by Steven Maris in ''Fibreculture'' No.12 [http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue12/issue12_maras.html] similarly suggests that Debray is too firmly embedded in "the French academic scene" and that thus "Debray's explicit engagement with other national scholarly traditions of media, communications and cultural studies in the works mentioned above is minimal". Maris also notes that mediology "predates much of the [current academic] interest in networked cultures and new media".

Physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] have criticized Debray's work for using [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] as a metaphor without understanding its basic ideas, in their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]''. Debray engaged in dialogue with Bricmont in a 2003 book titled "À l'ombre des lumières : Débat entre un philosophe et un scientifique", which so far has not been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alencon.fr/alencon/Main;jsessionid=DCNAOEIEBKEB?ISUM_ID=center&amp;ISUM_SCR=nwExternalServiceScr&amp;ISUM_CIPH=T9aJnOHAgwQV8T2hIQ5D3Du3v4I5zbXVbG3CxvkJy7s_&amp;ISUM_URL=rtE--JVQ7nRU10QjZURxmHAxjLLIW3DXPzmc29-XDq1dc8FTO2YT0563J3xcF8aK |accessdate=August 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816160928/http://www.alencon.fr/alencon/Main |archivedate=August 16, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such criticisms, the six-volume ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' (2004) wrote of Debray that "His achievement is to have synthesized these earlier arguments into a practice with a powerful political project ahead of it." (Vol.4, page 1394).

'''Military democracy''' is a term used to describe the war-based society of historical peoples. An example is [[Frederick Engels]]' characterization:

{{cquote|"The military commander, the council, and the popular assembly formed the organs of military democracy, military because war and the organization of war were now the regular functions of life of the people. The wealth of their neighbors excited the greed of the peoples, who began to regard acquisition of wealth as one of the main purposes in life. They were barbarians: plunder appeared to them easier and even more honorable than productive work. War, once waged simply to avenge aggression or as a means of enlarging territory that had become inadequate, was now waged for the sake of plunder alone, and became a regular profession. . . . The growth of slavery had already begun to brand working for a living as slavish and more ignominious than engaging in plunder."&lt;ref name=Helfen-191&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Maenchen-Helfen|title=The World of the Huns: Studies in Their History and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrUdgzSICxcC&amp;pg=PA191|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01596-8|pages=191–}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

According to Engels, the [[Greek Heroic Age]] was a typical example of military democracy.&lt;ref name=Helfen-191/&gt; [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] spoke of two features: "the military state of society, and the system of administration consisting of an elective and removable supreme chief, a council of elders and a popular assembly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yu.

'''Organizational behavior''' ('''OB''') or '''organisational behaviour''' is "the study of [[human behavior]] in organizational settings, the interface between human behavior and the organization, and the organization itself".&lt;ref name = "Moorhead"&gt;Moorhead, G., &amp; Griffin, R. W. (1995). ''Organizational behavior: Managing people and organizations'' (5th edition). Boston. Houghton Mifflin, (p.4)&lt;/ref&gt; OB research can be categorized{{by whom?|date=October 2017}} in at least three ways, including the study of:&lt;ref&gt; Management which is the process of stated Objectives, Planning, Organizing, Directing, Controlling, and Staffing to achieve stated (formalized) objectives.

&lt;/ref&gt;

* work groups (meso-level)
* how organizations behave (macro-level)

==Overview==
[[Chester Barnard]] recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their organizational role than when acting separately from the organization.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938 /&gt; Organizational behavior researchers study the behavior of individuals primarily in their organizational roles. One of the main goals of organizational behavior is "to revitalize organizational theory and develop a better conceptualization of organizational life".&lt;ref&gt;Simms, L.M., Price, S.A., &amp; Ervin, N.E. (1994). ''The professional practice of nursing administration''. Albany, NY: Delmar Publishers. (p. 121)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to industrial and organizational psychology==

Miner (2006) mentioned that "there is a certain arbitrariness" in identifying a "point at which organizational behavior became established as a distinct discipline" (p.&amp;nbsp;56), suggesting that it could have emerged in the 1940s or 1950s.&lt;ref name = "Miner"&gt;Miner, J.B. (2006). ''Organizational behavior, Vol. 3: Historical origins, theoretical foundations, and the future''. Armonk, NY and London: M.E. Sharpe.&lt;/ref&gt; He also underlined the fact that the industrial psychology division of the American Psychological Association did not add "organizational" to its name until 1970, "long after organizational behavior had clearly come into existence" (p.&amp;nbsp;56), noting that a similar situation arose in sociology. Although there are similarities and differences between the two disciplines, there is still confusion around differentiating organizational behavior and organizational psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Jex, S. &amp; Britt, T. (2008). ''Organizational psychology: A scientist-practitioner approach. 2nd ed''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As a multi-disciplinary , organizational behavior has been influenced by developments in a number of related disciplines including: [[Sociology]], [[industrial/organizational psychology]], and [[economics]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] is a period from the 1760s where new technologies resulted in the adoption of new manufacturing techniques and increased mechanization. In his famous [[iron cage]] metaphor, [[Max Weber]] raised concerns over the reduction in religious and vocational work experiences. Weber claimed that the Industrial Revolution's focus on efficiency constrained the worker to a kind of "prison" and "stripped a worker of their individuality".&lt;ref&gt;Weber, M. (1993). ''The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism'' (T. Parsons, Trans.). London, England: Routledge. (Original work published 1904–1905)&lt;/ref&gt; The significant social and cultural changes caused by the Industrial Revolution also gave rise to new forms of organization. Weber analyzed one of these organizations and came to the conclusion that bureaucracy was "an organization that rested on [[rational-legal]] principles and maximized technical efficiency."&lt;ref name="Weber1947"&gt;[[Weber, Max]]. The Theory of Social and Economic Organization. Translated by A.M. Henderson and Talcott Parsons. London: Collier Macmillan Publishers, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of OB practitioners documented their ideas about management and organisation. The best known theories today originate from [[Henri Fayol]], [[Chester Barnard]], and [[Mary Parker Follet]]. All three of them drew from their experience to develop a model of effective organizational management, and each of their theories independently shared a focus on human behavior and motivation.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938&gt;{{cite book |title= The Functions of the Executive |last= Barnard |first= Chester I. |authorlink= Chester Barnard |year= 1938 |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, MA |oclc= 555075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fayol1917 &gt;{{citation | last=Fayol | first=Henri | year=1917 | title=Administration industrielle et générale; prévoyance, organisation, commandement, coordination, controle | publisher =Paris, H. Dunod et E. Pinat | language=French | oclc=40224931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dynamic Administration: The Collected Papers of Mary Parker Follett|last=Follett|first=Henry C.|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0415279852}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first [[management consulting|management consultants]], [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]], was a 19th-century engineer who applied an approach known as the [[scientific management]]. Taylor advocated for maximizing task efficiency through the scientific method.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911"&gt;{{Citation | last = Taylor | first = Frederick Winslow | authorlink = Frederick Winslow Taylor | year = 1911 | title = The Principles of Scientific Management | publisher = Harper &amp; Brothers | location = New York, NY, USA and London, UK | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HoJMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;f=false | oclc = 233134 | doi =   | ref = harv | postscript =. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6435 Also available from Project Gutenberg].'' | lccn = 11010339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method was further refined by [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian]] and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]], who utilized [[time and motion study]] to further improve worker efficiency.&lt;ref name="price1989"&gt;Price, B 1989, ‘Frank and Lillian Gilbreth and the Manufacture and Marketing of Motion Study, 1908-1924’, Business and Economic History, vol. 18, no. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the idea of [[Fordism]] emerged. Named after automobile mogul [[Henry Ford]], the method relied on the standardization of production through the use of assembly lines. This allowed unskilled workers to produce complex products efficiently. Sorenson later clarified that Fordism developed independently of Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, C. E. (1956). ''My forty years with Ford''. New York, NY: Collier Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Fordism can be explained as the application of bureaucratic and scientific management principles to whole manufacturing process. The success of the scientific method and Fordism resulted in the widespread adoption of these methods.

In the 1920s, the [[Hawthorne Works]] [[Western Electric]] factory commissioned the first of what was to become known as the [[Hawthorne Studies]]. These studies initially adhered to the traditional scientific method, but also investigated whether workers would be more productive with higher or lower lighting levels. The results showed that regardless of lighting levels, when workers were being studied, productivity increased, but when the studies ended, worker productivity would return to normal. In following experiments, [[Elton Mayo]] concluded that [[job performance]] and the so-called [[Hawthorne Effect]] was strongly correlated to social relationships and job content.&lt;ref name = "Cullen"&gt;Cullen, David O'Donald. ''A new way of statecraft: The career of Elton Mayo and the development of the social sciences in America, 1920–1940.'' ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; 1992; ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Full Text.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Hawthorne Studies [[motivation]] became a focal point in the OB community. A range of theories emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and include theories from notable OB researchers such as: [[Frederick Herzberg]], [[Abraham Maslow]], [[David McClelland]], [[Victor Vroom]], and [[Douglas McGregor]]. These theories underline employee motivation, [[work performance]], and [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name = "Miner"/&gt;

[[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]]'s ''[[Administrative Behavior]]'' introduced a number of important OB concepts, most notably decision-making. Simon, along with [[Chester Barnard]], argued that people make decisions differently inside an organization when compared to their decisions outside of an organization. While classical economic theories assume that people are rational decision-makers, Simon argued a contrary point. He argued that cognition is limited because of [[bounded rationality]] For example, decision-makers often employ [[satisficing]], the process of utilizing the first marginally acceptable solution rather than the most optimal solution.&lt;ref name = "Simon1997"&gt;[[Simon, Herbert A.]] (1997) ''Administrative Behavior: A Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organizations, 4th ed., The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] for his work on organizational decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: Studies of decision-making lead to prize in economics|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1978/press.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=11 May 2014|date=16 October 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, the field started to become more [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[resource dependence|resource dependent]]. This gave rise to [[contingency theory]], [[institutional theory]], and [[organizational ecology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Starting in the 1980s, cultural explanations of organizations and organizational change became areas of study, in concert with fields such as [[anthropology]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]].

==Current state of the field==
Research in and the teaching of OB primarily takes place in university [[management]] departments in colleges of business. Sometimes OB topics are taught in [[industrial and organizational psychology]] graduate programs.

{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
There have been additional developments in OB research and practice. [[Anthropology]] has become increasingly influential, and led to the idea that one can understand firms as communities, by introducing concepts such as [[organizational culture]], organizational rituals, and symbolic acts.&lt;ref name="Moorhead"/&gt; [[Leadership studies]] have also become part of OB.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} OB researchers have shown increased interest in ethics and its importance in an organization.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Some OB researchers have become interested in the aesthetic sphere of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = S. | last2 = Hansen | first2 = H. | year = 2005 | title = Finding form: Looking at the field of organizational aesthetics drawing on theories and methods from the humanities, including theater, literature, music, and art. | url = | journal = Journal of Management Studies | volume = 42 | issue = 6| pages = 1211–1231 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6486.2005.00539.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research methods used==
A variety of methods are used in organizational behavior, many of which are found in other social sciences.

===Quantitative methods===
{{Main article|Quantitative research}}
Statistical methods used in OB research commonly include [[correlation]], [[analysis of variance]], [[meta-analysis]], [[multilevel model]]ing, [[multiple regression]], [[structural equation modeling]], and [[time series analysis]]&lt;ref name = "Brewerton"&gt;Brewerton, P.M., &amp; Millward, L.J. (2010). ''Organizational research methods: A guide for students and researchers. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/organizational-research-methods/journal200894#description ''Organizational Research Methods'' (journal)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer simulation===
{{Main article|Computer simulation and organization studies}}

Computer simulation is a prominent method in organizational behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Lin, Carroll, &amp; Carley, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While there are many uses for [[computer simulation]], most OB researchers have used computer simulation to understand how organizations or firms operate. More recently, however, researchers have also started to apply computer simulation to understand individual behavior at a micro-level, focusing on individual and interpersonal [[cognition]] and [[behavior]]&lt;ref name="Hughes et al (2012) JOOP"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = H.

===Qualitative methods===
{{Main article|Qualitative research}}
Qualitative research&lt;ref name = "Brewerton"/&gt; consists of a number of methods of inquiry that generally do not involve the quantification of variables. Qualitative methods can range from the [[content analysis]] of interviews or written material to written narratives of observations. Common methods include [[ethnography]], [[case study|case studies]], historical methods, and interviews.

==Topics==

=== Consulting ===
Consultants use principles developed in OB research to assess clients' organizational problems and provide high quality services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ob.blogsite.org/index.php/2018/02/06/how-to-work-with-a-demanding-client/|title=How to work with a demanding client – Organizational Behavior Guide for Consultants|date=2018-02-06|work=Organizational Behavior Guide for Consultants|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterproductive work behavior===
{{Main article|Counterproductive work behavior}}
Counterproductive work behavior is employee behavior that harms or intends to harm an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, P. E., &amp; Fox, S. (2005). The Stressor-Emotion Model of Counterproductive Work Behavior. In S. Fox, P. E. Spector (Eds.), ''Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets'' (pp. 151-174). Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/10893-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision-making===
{{Main article|Decision-making}}

Many OB researchers embrace the [[rational planning model]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Decision-making research often focuses on how decisions are ordinarily made (normative decision-making), how thinkers arrive at a particular judgement (descriptive decision-making), and how to improve this decision-making (prescriptive decision-making).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Employee mistreatment===

There are several types of mistreatment that employees endure in organizations including: Abusive supervision, bullying, incivility, and sexual harassment.

====Abusive supervision====
{{Main article|Abusive supervision}}

Abusive supervision is the extent to which a [[supervisor]] engages in a pattern of behavior that harms subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B. J. | year = 2000 | title = Consequences of abusive supervision | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 178–190 | doi = 10.2307/1556375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bullying====
{{Main article|Workplace bullying}}
Although definitions of workplace bullying vary, it involves a repeated pattern of harmful behaviors directed towards an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Keashly, L. (2005). Bullying at Work: A Perspective From Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P. E. Spector (Eds.), Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets. (pp. 271-296). Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a behavior to be termed bullying, the individual or individuals doing the harm have to possesses (either singly or jointly) more power than the victim.

====Incivility====
{{Main article|Workplace incivility}}

Workplace incivility consists of low-intensity discourteous and [[rude]] behavior and is characterized by an ambiguous intent to harm, and the violation of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] governing appropriate workplace behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = C. M. | year = 1999 | title = Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace | doi = 10.5465/amr.1999.2202131 | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 452–471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual harassment====
{{Main article|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is behavior that denigrates or mistreats an individual due to his or her gender, often creating an offensive workplace that interferes with job performance.&lt;ref&gt;Rospenda, K. M., &amp; Richman, J. A. (2005). Harassment and discrimination. In J. Barling, E. K. Kelloway &amp; M. R. Frone (Eds.), Handbook of work stress (pp. 149-188). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teams===
{{Main article|Team}}

===Job-related attitudes and emotions===
Organizational behavior deals with employee attitudes and feelings, including [[job satisfaction]], [[organizational commitment]], and [[emotional labor]]. Job satisfaction reflects the feelings an employee has about his or her job or facets of the job, such as pay or supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Balzer, W. K. &amp; Gillespie, J. Z. (2007). Job satisfaction. In Rogelberg, S. G. (Ed.). Encyclopedia of industrial and organizational psychology Vol. 1 (pp. 406-413). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational commitment represents the extent to which employees feel attached to their organization.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, N. J. Organizational commitment. In Rogelberg, S. G. (Ed.). Encyclopedia of industrial and organizational psychology Vol. 2 (pp. 548-551). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional labor concerns the requirement that an employee display certain emotions, such smiling at customers, even when the employee does not feel the emotion he or she is required to display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ashkanasy | first1 = N. M. | last2 = Härtel | first2 = C. E. J. | last3 = Daus | first3 = C. S. | year = 2002 | title = Diversity and emotion: The new frontiers in organizational behavior research | url = | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 307–338 | doi=10.1177/014920630202800304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
{{Main article|Leadership}}
There have been a number of theories that concern leadership. Early theories focused on characteristics of leaders, while later theories focused on leader behavior, and conditions under which leaders can be effective. Among these approaches are [[contingency theory]], the [[consideration and initiating structure]] model, [[leader-member exchange theory|leader-member exchange or LMX theory]], [[path-goal theory]], and [[transformational leadership theory]].

Contingency theory indicates that good leadership depends on characteristics of the leader and the situation.&lt;ref name="Fielder1"&gt;Fiedler, F. E. (1978). The contingency model and the dynamics of the leadership process. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (pp. 59-112). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ohio State Leadership Studies identified dimensions of leadership known as consideration (showing concern and respect for subordinates) and initiating structure (assigning tasks and setting performance goals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleishman | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Harris | first2 = E. F. | year = 1962 | title = Patterns of leadership behavior related to employee grievances and turnover | url = | journal = Personnel Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 43–56 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1962.tb01845.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy, P. E. (2006). Industrial/organizational psychology: Understanding the workplace.

===Managerial roles===

{{Main article|Mintzberg's managerial roles}}
In the late 1960s [[Henry Mintzberg]], a graduate student at MIT, carefully studied the activities of five executives. On the basis of his observations, Mintzberg arrived at three categories that subsume managerial roles: interpersonal roles, decisional roles, and informational roles.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, S. P. (2009). Organizational behaviour. Cape Town, Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation===
Baron and Greenberg (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Robert A., and Greenberg, Jerald. ''Behavior in organizations'' &amp;ndash; 9th edition. Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey: 2008. p.248&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that motivation involves "the set of processes that arouse, direct, and maintain human behavior toward attaining some goal." There are several different theories of motivation relevant to OB, including [[equity theory]],&lt;ref name="Adams1965"&gt;Adams, J. S. (1965). Inequity in social exchange. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (pp. 276-299). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[expectancy theory]],&lt;ref name="Vroom1964"&gt;Vroom, V. H. (1964).

M. (1960). The human side of enterprise. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National culture===

National culture is thought to affect the behavior of individuals in organizations. This idea is exemplified by [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory]]. Hofstede surveyed a large number of cultures and identified six dimensions of national cultures that influence the behavior of individuals in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, Geert, Gert Jan Hofstede and Michael Minkov.Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind, 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These dimensions include power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs. femininity, long-term orientation vs. short term orientation, and indulgence vs. restraint.

===Organizational citizenship behavior===
{{Main article|Organizational citizenship behavior}}

Organizational citizenship behavior is behavior that goes beyond assigned tasks and contributes to the well-being of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Organ, D. W. (1988). Organizational citizenship behavior: The good soldier syndrome. Lexington, MA, England: Lexington Books/D C Heath and Com.f&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational culture===
{{Main article|Organizational culture}}

Organizational culture reflects the values and behaviors that are commonly observed in an organization. Investigators who pursue this line of research assume that organizations can be characterized by cultural dimensions such as beliefs, values, rituals, symbols, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Shein, Edgar (1992). Organizational Culture and Leadership: A Dynamic View. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have developed models for understanding an organization's culture or developed typologies of organizational culture. [[Edgar Schein]] developed a model for understanding organizational culture. He identified three levels of organizational culture: (a) artifacts and behaviors, (b) espoused values, and (c) shared basic assumptions. Specific cultures have been related to organizational performance&lt;ref&gt;Kotter, John and Heskett, James L. (1992) Corporate Culture and Performance, Free Press; {{ISBN|0-02-918467-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Denison, Daniel R. (1990) Corporate culture and organizational effectiveness, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
{{Main article|Personality}}
Personality concerns consistent patterns of behavior, [[cognition]], and [[emotion]] in individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, W., Shoda, Y., &amp; Smith, R. E. (2004). ''Introduction to personality: Toward an integration''. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; The study of personality in organizations has generally focused on the relation of specific traits to employee performance. There has been a particular focus on the [[Big Five personality traits]], which refers to five overarching personality traits.

===Occupational stress===
{{Main article|Occupational stress}}

There are number of ways to characterize occupational stress. One way of characterizing it is to term it an imbalance between job demands (aspects of the job that require mental or physical effort) and resources that help manage the demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Demerouti | first1 = E. | last2 = Bakker | first2 = A. B. | last3 = Nachreiner | first3 = F. | last4 = Schaufeli | first4 = W.

===Work-family===
{{Main article|Work-family conflict}}
[[Chester Barnard]] recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their work role than when acting in roles outside their work role.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938 /&gt; Work-family conflict occurs when the demands of family and work roles are incompatible, and the demands of at least one role interfere with the discharge of the demands of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenhaus | first1 = J. H. | last2 = Beutell | first2 = N. J. | year = 1985 | title = Sources and conflict between work and family roles | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 76–88 | doi=10.5465/amr.1985.4277352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization theory==
{{Main article|Organizational theory}}
Organization theory is concerned with explaining the workings of an organization as a whole or of many organizations. The focus of organizational theory is to understand the structure and processes of organizations and how organizations interact with each other and the larger society.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Bureaucracy===

{{Main article|Bureaucracy}}

[[Max Weber]] argued that bureaucracy involved the application of [[rational-legal]] authority to the organization of work, making bureaucracy the most technically efficient form of organization.&lt;ref name="Weber1947"/&gt; Weber enumerated a number of principles of bureaucratic organization including: a formal organizational hierarchy, management by rules, organization by functional specialty, selecting people based on their skills and technical qualifications, an "up-focused" (to organization's board or shareholders) or "in-focused" (to the organization itself) mission, and a purposefully impersonal environment (e.g., applying the same rules and structures to all members of the organization). These rules reflect Weberian "ideal types," and how they are enacted in organizations varies according to local conditions. [[Charles Perrow]] extended Weber's work, arguing that all organizations can be understood in terms of bureaucracy and that organizational failures are more often a result of insufficient application of bureaucratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;Perrow, C. (1986). ''Complex organizations: A critical essay'' (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic theories of organization===

At least three theories are relevant here, [[theory of the firm]], [[transaction cost economics]], and [[agency theory]].

===Theories pertaining to organizational structures===

Theories pertaining to organizational structures and dynamics include [[complexity theory and organizations|complexity theory]], [[French and Raven's five bases of power]],&lt;ref&gt;French, J. R. P., Jr., &amp; Raven, B. (1959). The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright (Ed.), Studies in social power (pp. 150-167). Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt; [[hybrid organization|hybrid organization theory]], [[informal organization|informal organizational theory]], [[resource dependence theory]], and [[Mintzberg]]'s [[organigraph]].

===Institutional theory===

{{Main article|Institutional theory}}

===Systems theory===

{{Main article|Systems theory}}
The systems framework is also fundamental to organizational theory. [[Organization]]s are complex, goal-oriented entities.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, D., &amp; Kahn, R. L. (1978). ''The social psychology of organizations'' (2 ed.). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Bogdanov]], an early thinker in the field, developed his [[tectology]], a theory widely considered a precursor of [[Bertalanffy]]'s [[general systems theory]]. One of the aims of general systems theory was to model human organizations. [[Kurt Lewin]], a social psychologist, was influential in developing a systems perspective with regard to organizations. He coined the term "systems of ideology," partly based on his frustration with behaviorist psychology, which he believed to be an obstacle to sustainable work in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ash | first1 = M.G. | year = 1992 | title = Cultural contexts and scientific change in psychology: Kurt Lewin in Iowa | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 198–207 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.47.2.198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niklas Luhmann]], a sociologist, developed a sociological systems theory.

===Organizational ecology===

{{Main article|Organizational ecology}}
Organizational ecology models apply concepts from [[evolutionary theory]] to the study of populations of organisations, focusing on birth (founding), growth and change, and death (firm mortality). In this view, organizations are 'selected' based on their fit with their operating environment.

===Scientific management===
{{Main article|Scientific management}}

Scientific management refers to an approach to management based on principles of [[engineering]]. It focuses on incentives and other practices empirically shown to improve productivity.

[[File:Cast of the Flash at 2015 PaleyFest.jpg|thumb|Panel with the cast of ''[[The Flash]]'' at 2015 PaleyFest]]

A '''panel discussion''', or simply a '''panel''', involves a group of people gathered to discuss a topic in front of an audience, typically at scientific, business, or [[academic conference]]s, [[fan convention]]s, and on television shows. Panels usually include a moderator who guides the discussion and sometimes elicits audience questions, with the goal of being informative and entertaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panel Discussions|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/panel-discussions-13909630|publisher=Nature Education|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirsner|first1=Scott|title=How To Moderate a Panel Like a Pro|url=https://hbr.org/2013/05/how-to-moderate-a-panel-like-a|date=30 May 2013|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film panels at fan conventions have been credited with boosting box office returns by generating advance [[Marketing buzz|buzz]].

==Format==

[[File:Chris Hardwick, Andrew Lincoln, Steven Yeun, Lauren Cohan, Michael Cudlitz &amp; Danai Gurira (14793892763).jpg|thumb|''The Walking Dead'' panel host [[Chris Hardwick]] takes a photo with actors [[Andrew Lincoln]], [[Steven Yeun]], [[Lauren Cohan]], [[Michael Cudlitz]], and [[Danai Gurira]] at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]].]]
The typical format for a discussion panel includes a moderator in front of an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inside Our Schools: Teen-Age Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o00EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT12|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=12 April 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television shows in the English-speaking world that feature a discussion panel format include ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', ''[[Loose Women]]'', ''[[The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore]]'', as well as segments of the long-running ''[[Meet the Press]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hruby|first1=Patrick|title=Bill Maher’s ‘Real Time’: The survival manual for conservative panelists|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/mar/28/how-conservatives-survive-a-stint-on-bill-mahers-r/?page=all|work=[[Washington Times]]|date=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quiz shows featuring this format, such as ''[[QI]]'' and ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'', are called [[panel game]]s. The host of a panel is typically expected to bring a token refreshment or snack to the discussants.

==Fan conventions==

Panels at sci-fi [[fan convention]]s, such as  [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] and [[New York Comic-Con]], have become increasingly popular; there are typically long lines to get access to the panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sacks|first1=Ethan|title=New York Comic Con will start with 10-day ‘Super Week’ as convention grows in size and popularity|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/n-y-comic-bigger-previous-years-start-10-day-super-week-article-1.1955449|accessdate=16 April 2015|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panels often feature advance looks at upcoming films and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamar|first1=Cyriaque|title=4 Miserable Experiences You Can't Avoid at Comic-Con|url=http://www.cracked.com/blog/4-miserable-experiences-you-cant-avoid-at-comic-con/|accessdate=16 April 2015|work=[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panels and the early screenings at conventions have been credited as increasing the popularity of blockbuster films in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burke|first1=Liam|title=The Comic Book Film Adaptation: Exploring Modern Hollywood’s Leading Genre|date=2015|publisher=Univ.

One of the earliest film panels was at the 1976 San Diego Comic-Con, when publicist Charles Lippincott hosted a slideshow—in front of a "somewhat skeptical" audience—for an upcoming film called ''[[Star Wars]]''. Five years later,  the ''[[Blade Runner]]'' panel at the 1981 San Diego Comic-Con featured a film [[featurette]], before featurettes were popular. At the 2000 event, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' preview panel ushered in today's era of hugely popular panels.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite news|title=The 10 Most Memorable Panels In Comic-Con History|url=http://www.film.com/movies/the-most-memorable-panels-in-comic-con-history|accessdate=16 April 2015|work=Film.com|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally beginning in 2015, Phandeeyar provides funding and training for emerging [[startups]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar's Internet innovators emerge amid connectivity boom|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Myanmar-s-Internet-innovators-emerge-amid-connectivity-boom|website=Nikkei Asian Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phandeeyar also conducts trainings, hosts workshops, and holds competitions for startups within the digital sector.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Lanmadaw, Yangon, Myanmar (Burma) - panoramio (3).jpg|upright|thumb|175px|Yangon, Myanmar]]

In 2014, Phandeeyar emerged from a [[hackathon]] named "Code for Change Myanmar"&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lack of risk capital in Myanmar: David Madden, Phandeeyar|url=https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/we-believe-very-deeply-in-the-potential-of-the-tech-community-phandeeyars-david-madden-41822/|website=www.dealstreetasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; where its founder and current CEO, [[David Madden (entrepreneur)|David Madden]], wanted to promote the growth of Myanmar's digital sector. Through this hackathon, politics and elections were addressed. 

Madden states the need for better financial support for emerging start-ups in Myanmar which also led to the creation of the accelerator.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=(http://www.hydrant.co.uk)|first1=Site designed and built by Hydrant|title=David Madden, Founder &amp; CEO, Phandeeyar: Myanmar Innovation Lab: Interview|url=https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/interview/david-madden-founder-ceo-phandeeyar-myanmar-innovation-lab/myanmar-2017|website=Oxford Business Group|language=en|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Phandeeyar hosted a two week event event called "MaePaySoe" (translating to "let's vote")&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hackers in programming meet to prepare for the vote|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/business/technology/16485-hackers-in-programming-meet-to-prepare-for-the-vote.html|website=The Myanmar Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where more than one hundred web developers gathered to create technology which informs the general public about potential political candidates in Myanmar and the country's voting process.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt;
===Seed Funding===
In 2016, around fifteen to twenty startups were projected to be accepted into the accelerator in a three year span.&lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; Phandeeyar also plans to invest around $2 million into startups in the near future. &lt;ref name=":100"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar: Phandeeyar sets up accelerator, to invest $200k in 8 startups in 2016 - DealStreetAsia|url=https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/phandeeyar-to-seed-fund-up-to-200000-through-their-first-tech-startup-accelerator-43871/|website=www.dealstreetasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the startups accepted, Phandeeyar would claim a 12 percent ownership of the companies. 
Those selected for Phandeeyar's 6 month training program would receive a funding of $25,000 to launch their ventures in addition to business partnerships to help with the early stages of their startups. &lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; These partnerships include leaders from regional companies such as the Myanmar Information Technology, CarsDB, [[Muru-D]]. and Golden Gate Ventures. &lt;ref name=":100"/&gt; Towards the end of the program, companies have the opportunity to pitch their startup ideas to [[venture capitalists]] and [[angel investors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Roundup (February 25)|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/business/business-roundup-february-25.html|website=The Irrawaddy|date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production and distribution of [[pornographic film]]s are both activities that are lawful in many, but by no means all, countries so long as the [[pornography]] features performers aged [[Age of majority|above a certain age]], usually eighteen years. Further restrictions are often placed on such material.

== Africa ==

=== Botswana ===
The possession of "Indecent and obscene material such as pornographic books, magazines, films, videos, DVDs and software" is prohibited in [[Botswana]]. Possession or import of such material is illegal and punishable by a fine or up to 4 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botswanatourism.co.bw/getting_in/entry_requirements.html Botswana Tourism Board], "Entry Requirements". botswanatourism.co.bw.

=== Egypt ===
In [[Egypt]], it is illegal to distribute pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian MP sends porn to fellow parliamentarians over WhatsApp, blames 'hackers'|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/egyptian-mp-sends-porn-fellow-parliamentarians-over-whatsapp-blames-hackers-1567718|publisher=International Business Times|date=27 June 2016|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possession and import of pornography are offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Court in Egypt Declares Internet Pornography Illegal|publisher=ValueWalk|author=Paul Shea|date=28 March 2012|accessdate=16 July 2017|url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2012/03/a-court-in-egypt-declares-internet-pornography-illegal/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike numerous African nations which have no laws against child pornography, [[Internet in Egypt|Egypt blocks child pornography websites]] and dealing in child pornography carries a minimum sentence of five years and fines of US$29,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pornography and The Criminal Justice System|author=Carmen M.

In 2012 the country's Prosecutor General ordered government ministries to block the websites,&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt bans online porn, causing split in society|url=https://www.rt.com/news/egypt-pornography-society-ban-204/|publisher=RT News|date=7 November 2012|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Administrative Court repeated its order for the Cabinet to block pornographic websites in 2015.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; However, the cost of blocking large numbers of pornographic websites has prevented the full implementation of the court's ruling.&lt;ref name=RT/&gt; Egypt has the highest viewing figures for pornography in the [[Middle East]] according to a survey of access to [[Pornhub]].&lt;ref name=Cole&gt;{{cite news|title='Everyone should be free to watch porn films': Actress faces jail in Egypt for inciting immorality after urging the country's unmarried men to view explicit films 'to cool down'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3310127/Actress-faces-jail-Egypt-inciting-immorality-urging-country-s-unmarried-men-use-porn-cool-down.html|author=Brendan Cole|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=9 November 2015|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethiopia ===
All forms of pornography is illegal in Ethiopia, its production in that country is rare. The legal status of Internet pornography in Ethiopia is uncertain.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Morocco ===
In 2004, Morocco introduced severe punishment for promoting pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Countries at the Crossroads: A Survey of Democratic Governance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ebjEVjJ-DcAC|first1=Sanja|last1=Tatic|first2=Christopher|last2=Walker|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2006|isbn=9780742558014|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producing pornography of any kind is illegal in Morocco. However, it does not apply much on Internet pornography; porn websites are widely accessible in Morocco.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Nigeria ===
Nigeria has no national laws prohibiting pornography, although the public display of graphic sexual material is illegal in Lagos. The country has a small indigenous pornography industry which produces exclusively heterosexual pornography as [[LGBT rights in Nigeria|homosexual activity in Nigeria is illegal]]. Some Muslim politicians in the national government have proposed a nationwide block on pornographic websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigeria's Porn Industry Is Getting Ready To Overtake America's|url=http://www.konbini.com/ng/lifestyle/nigeria-is-home-to-the-newest-porn-economy/|website=Konbini|author=Odunayo Eweniyi|date=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is significant piracy of pornography in Nigeria, with pirated pornographic DVDs being sold from roadside stalls in [[Lagos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Criminology: The Core|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzGSWLTPguAC|first=Larry J.|last=Siegel|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=9780495809838|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pornography is also sold in Nigerian [[sex shop]]s and some [[pornographic magazine]]s are produced in the country, often reproducing pictures from foreign magazines. The first officially acknowledged [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] film produced in Nigeria was ''Better Lover Valentine Sex Party''. It was not submitted to the National Film and Video Censors Board for classification and it was immediately banned on the grounds of obscenity and immorality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Perspectives on Social Issues: Pornography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCwR-WxI0x0C|first1=Richard|last1=Procida|first2=Rita James|last2=Simon|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2007|isbn=9780739120927|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet pornography is widely viewed in Nigeria. In 2015 the monthly average for the number of searches for pornography was 135,000, and in December 2014 and 2015 the proportion of searches for pornography (relative to other searches) was higher in Nigeria than in the United States. In 2013 Nigeria ranked second globally for Internet searches for [[gay pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigeria, We’ve Got A Sexuality Problem!|url=http://subomiplumptre.com/porn/|author=Subomi Plumptre|date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
Pornography rated X18 is permitted by the law only if sold to persons over the age of 18 in registered stores. It is an offense to host a pornographic web site in South Africa because of the difficulty of age-verification and the requirement that pornography only be distributed from designated, licensed physical premises. It is also unlawful to visually represent bestiality (also rated XX), but not in text descriptions. Supplying violent pornography is an offence in any form, but the law allows the production of pornography that is not prohibited.

Distribution of pornography is regulated by the Films and Publications Act of 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Government Gazette|url=http://www.gov.za/sites/www.gov.za/files/Act65of1996.pdf|publisher=Republic of South Africa|date=8 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is enforced by the Films and Publications Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Classification Query Engine|publisher=Films and Publication Board|url=http://www.fpb.gov.za/home_page.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103025901/http://www.fpb.gov.za/home_page.asp |archive-date=3 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sudan ===
Pornography is prohibited in Sudan and the laws are strict. Pornographic websites are blocked by the government, pornography is largely inaccessible, and porn possession, production, distribution and sale can lead to fines, prison or [[corporal punishment]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Uganda ===
Pornographic DVDs have in the past been sold on the streets in [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name=Fallon&gt;{{cite news|title=Confusion over Uganda's 'miniskirt ban' leads to public attacks on women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/feb/28/uganda-miniskirt-ban-attacks-women|author=Amy Fallon|date=28 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an Anti-Pornography Act (popularly known as the "Anti-Miniskirt Law") was signed into law in 2014 with the stated objectives of defining what constitutes the offence of pornography and establishing a Pornography Control Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Girls Rising: Progress and Resistance Around the World|editor1=Ellen Chesler|editor2=Terry McGovern|publisher=Routledge|date=2015|ISBN=9781317482666|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZJrwCQAAQBAJ|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee is responsible for the implementation of the law and for taking measures to detect, prohibit, collect and destroy pornographic materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Museveni Signs Anti-Pornography Bill into Law|url=http://www.redpepper.co.ug/museveni-signs-anti-pornography-bill-into-law/|magazine=Red Pepper|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law broadly defines pornography as "any representation of the sexual parts of a person for primarily sexual excitement".&lt;ref name=Fallon/&gt; The law says that "a person shall not produce, traffic in, publish, broadcast, procure, import, export, sell or abet any form of pornography".

=== China ===
{{Main|Pornography in China}}
It is illegal to sell or distribute pornography in China, but it is not illegal to own or to watch it. Google, Yahoo, YouTube and other websites do not allow users in China to perform searches related to sex.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Pornographic material in China comes from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, or Japan.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==== Hong Kong ====
Hong Kong is the primary source of Chinese-language erotica.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Pornographic films in Hong Kong are referred to as [[List of Hong Kong Category III films|Category III films]], after the territory's motion picture rating system. Category III films would generally be considered softcore by American and Japanese standards, often featuring more elaborate and comical plots than foreign equivalents. In the early 21st century many of the roles involving sex scenes are actually performed by Japanese actresses, with any dialogue dubbed into Chinese, rather than by Chinese women.

Hardcore pornographic videos and films, in both physical and digital forms, can be legally sold in the territory.

The possession and viewing of pornography by an adult in a private residence is legal in India.

Possession of pornography became widespread among elites during the late 1990s. Political and army elites are the most active consumers of pornography. Locally produced pornography initially appeared during the reign of [[Kim Jong-il]]. A typical North Korean-made [[pornographic film]] involves nude or scantily clad women dancing with music.&lt;ref name="Moon2007"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Porno Became Widespread in '90s, Thanks to the Dear Leader | author = Moon Sung Hwee | work = Daily NK | date = 23 December 2007 | accessdate = 21 September 2016 | url = http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01300&amp;num=3042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Korea ===
{{Further information|Internet censorship in South Korea}}
Pornography is banned by the government in South Korea, with laws strictly enforced. The distribution, sale or display of obscene materials via the Internet can be punished with up to two years' imprisonment, although there is no penalty for watching or possessing Internet pornography. The exception is child pornography, the possession of which carries a maximum one-year prison sentence, and the maximum sentence for distributing, selling or displaying it for commercial purposes is ten years. Many foreign pornographic websites are blocked, and those found to be operating from within the country are shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Hyung-Jin Kim|title=South Korea's porn fight 'like shoveling in a blizzard'|url=http://sys03-public.nbcnews.com/technology/south-koreas-porn-fight-shoveling-blizzard-1C7511844|accessdate=1 August 2014|publisher=NBC News|agency=Associated Press|date=10 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140806004953/http://sys03-public.nbcnews.com/technology/south-koreas-porn-fight-shoveling-blizzard-1C7511844|archivedate=6 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korea Internet Safety Commission is responsible for instructing [[Internet service provider]]s to block access to "pornography and nudity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Comparing Online Activities in China and South Korea: The Internet and the Political Regime|first=Jongpil|last=Chung|journal=[[Asian Survey]]|volume=48|number=5|date=September–October 2008|pages=727–751|doi=10.1525/as.2008.48.5.727}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Search]] in South Korea filters search results for around 700 terms considered by the government to be adult in nature unless the user demonstrates that they are aged over 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/searching-for-an-adult-topic-youll-have-to-prove-your-age-to-google-korea-11246|title=Searching For An Adult Topic?

===Pakistan===
{{See also|Pornography in Pakistan}}
Pornography in Pakistan is illegal and is subject to several legal provisions. The Government has put a 100% ban on internet website containing such material since November 2011. The list of banned pornographic websites is updated on an ongoing basis.

===Philippines===
{{See also|Pornography in the Philippines}}
The Philippine penal code prohibits the production and distribution of obscene publications. There is a ban on pornography, but the law enforcement is relaxed and doesn't enforce the prohibition. Pornographic movies are available on [[Television in the Philippines|Philippine cable television]]. Since 2014 there was a little local production.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Some ISPs in the Philippines have blocked access to pornographic websites since January 2017, due to the Republic Act 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Law.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Items considered pornographic by Saudi Arabian standards are forbidden in the country. Customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning the importation of pornographic items into Saudi Arabia. Such items may be confiscated on arrival and the owner may be subject to a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Americans Traveling Abroad: What You Should Know Before You Go|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLnhH1ImoaMC|first=Gladson I.|last=Nwanna|publisher=Frontline Publishers, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=9781890605100|edition=3rd|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accessing pornographic websites can lead to imprisonment, fine, deportation or any other severe punishment by the government.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Even though the legal status of pornography in Turkmenistan is unknown, a law, passed on 1 January 2015, banning citizens to access pornography on the internet&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/pasaulis/turkmenijoje-uzdrausta-internete-izeidineti-prezidenta-ir-ziureti-pornografija-57-475592 Turkmėnijoje uždrausta internete įžeidinėti prezidentą ir žiūrėti pornografiją]&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that pornography may be illegal in Turkmenistan.

== Europe ==
{{Main|Pornography in Europe}}
European hardcore pornography is dominated by a few pan-European producers and distributors, the most notable of which is the [[Private Media Group]]. Most European countries also have local pornography producers, from Portugal (''Naturalvideo'') to Romania (''Floyd-Agency''), all of which compete with larger, international organizations with varying levels of success.

Many U.S.-based pornography websites distribute European pornography as a [[genre]]. These actresses (often advertised as "Eurobabes")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eurobabeindex.com | title=Eurobabeindex | accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; may conform more to a look usually seen in U.S. actresses than European ones, although they may still be considered to look "more natural". European pornography typically de-emphasizes [[breast implant]]s, among other aesthetic factors.

=== Belarus ===
Production, dissemination and assembly of pornography is banned, with laws strictly enforced. Breaking the law is punishable with up to four years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sk.gov.by/ru/news-ru/view/razmeschenie-pornografii-v-sotsialnyx-setjax-vlechet-ugolovnuju-otvetstvennost-1323/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320024054/http://sk.gov.by/ru/news-ru/view/razmeschenie-pornografii-v-sotsialnyx-setjax-vlechet-ugolovnuju-otvetstvennost-1323/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 March 2016|title=Размещение порнографии в социальных сетях влечет уголовную ответственность|author=|date=24 June 2016|work=sk.gov.by|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
In France, pornography is overall permitted, but with distinctions: 
* Hardcore pornography must not be sold to minors under the age of 18.
* Softcore porn is allowed for people 16 and over. 
* Extremely violent or graphic pornography is considered [[X rating|X-rated]], and so may be shown only in specific theaters, and may not be displayed to [[minor (law)|minors]].
* Some pornography has a special ([[value-added tax]]) VAT: a 33% tax is levied on X-rated movies, and a 50% excise is placed on pornographic online services.

The ratings system has caused controversy; e.g., in 2000 the sexually explicit and violent film ''[[Baise-moi]]'' was initially rated only as "restricted" by the French government. This classification was overturned by a ''[[Conseil d'État (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' ruling in a lawsuit brought by associations supporting [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[family values]].

Some movies are forbidden to minors under 18, without the X rating, like ''[[Baise-moi]]'', ''[[Ken Park]]'' or ''[[Saw III|Saw 3]]'', so that these movies can be viewed in theaters and not attract VAT.

=== Germany ===
The constitution and law are very strict about [[hardcore pornography]], especially when compared to very liberal laws about [[softcore pornography]], [[prostitution]] and [[sex shop]]s. Supplying hardcore pornography to people who are less than 18 years old is an offence, and shops selling it must keep people under the age of 18 from entering their premises. If only a part of the shop is dedicated to pornography, it must be completely closed off from the rest of the premises. Alternatively, shops may choose not to display their goods or advertise that they sell them, in which case minors may be admitted. Websites hosting pornographic material within Germany must comply with very strict rules about verifying that viewers are over 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/BGH-reicht-Check-der-Ausweisnummer-als-Zugangshuerde-fuer-Online-Pornos-nicht-aus--/meldung/97651|title=BGH reicht Check der Ausweisnummer als Zugangshürde für Online-Pornos nicht aus|first=Stefan|last=Krempl|date=19 October 2007|work=heise.de|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft porn is less restricted, and may even be broadcast on TV at night. The age threshold is usually FSK-16. In contrast many uncut action films or video games easily reach the FSK-18 rating.

=== Hungary ===
{{Main|Pornography in Hungary}}
In Hungary, pornography is unlawful if sold or shown to children under 18 years of age. Displaying the genitals openly, as on the cover of a magazine, is not prohibited.

=== Iceland ===
The production or sale of pornography is prohibited in Iceland. Heavy fines were applied in 2001 and ten years earlier a fine was applied to the first manager of the first private TV-station (and the only case to present) in Iceland for showing the Danish "mainstream" [[Zodiac-films]], ''[[I Tvillingernes tegn]]'' and ''[[I Tyrens tegn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=2677| title=Hvað er klám? |accessdate=31 August 2015 |language=is}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013 there was a draft proposal by [[Ögmundur Jónasson]], the [[Minister of the Interior (Iceland)|Minister of the Interior]], to extend the ban to online pornography to protect children from violent sexual imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Associated Press | author-link = Associated Press | title = Iceland seeks internet pornography ban | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/25/iceland-seeks-internet-pornography-ban | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 25 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan has been stalled since the change in government during the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2013|parliamentary election on 27 April 2013]]. Since then, there have been no changes to the relevant legislation, and no changes have been formally proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Iceland: Key developments: June 2014-May 2015, limits on content | url = https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2015/iceland | website = freedomhouse.org | publisher = [[Freedom House]] | date = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Helgadóttir | first = Ásta Guðrún | author-link = Ásta Helgadóttir | title = The Icelandic initiative for pornography censorship | journal = [[Porn Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 285–298 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/23268743.2014.928462 | date = July 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23268743.2014.928462 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
{{Main|Pornography in Italy}}
In Italy, it is illegal to distribute pictorial or video pornography to persons under the age of 18. However, persons over 18 years of age are permitted to view pornographic material.

=== Russia ===
According to Russian law, consumption of pornography is allowed though the production of it is not. The illegal production, distribution, and "public demonstration" of pornography is punishable by a 2- to 6-year prison term. [[Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media|Roskomnadzor]], the Russian government's media overseer, has the power to order the blocking of pornographic websites. In 2015 the agency required the blocking of the Russian-language version of [[Pornhub]] and 10 other pornographic sites on the basis of a court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia Blocks Access to Popular Porn Sites|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/26316-russia-pornhub-roskomnadzor-blacklist-media.html|date=15 September 2016|work=Transitions Online|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is nevertheless some uncertainty concerning the legal status of pornography in Russia. The law criminalizes only the 'illegal' production and selling of pornography (which implies that it sometimes can be legal), but two circumstances make enforcement of the law difficult: (1) the lack of a legal definition of pornography, and (2) no law defining when production or selling is permitted.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Ukraine ===
Pornographic production, distribution, broadcasting (both audio and video), transportation, import and advertisement is forbidden by law in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1296-15|title=Закон України "Про захист суспільної моралі"|date=5 March 2015|publisher=Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main|Pornography in the United Kingdom}}
In [[England and Wales]], the main legislation on pornographic materials is the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]], the [[Obscene Publications Act 1964]], and the [[Indecent Displays (Control) Act 1981]]. Video-oriented depictions of hardcore material (with certain exceptions for works considered primarily 'artistic' rather than pornographic) were banned until 1999, when the removal of trade barriers with other [[European Union]] member states allowed for the relatively free movement of such goods for personal use. [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18-rated]] videos are only available in licensed sex shops, but hardcore pornographic magazines are available in shops selling newspapers and magazines. In 2008, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] unsuccessfully prosecuted a man under the Obscene Publications Act (the ''[[R v Walker]]'' trial) for a textual story on a pornography website involving [[Girls Aloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/7649231.stm|title=Girls Aloud in 'murder' blog case|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-10-02|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, the [[Home Office]] introduced legislation to criminalize possession of what it has labelled [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|extreme pornography]]; these laws are now contained in sections 63 to 68 of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_9#pt5-pb1-l1g63|title=Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|author=|date=|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Pornography in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], pornography is not unlawful at the federal level, but is subject to the [[Miller test|''Miller'' test]], which was developed in the 1973 case ''[[Miller v. California]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/printer_friendly.pl?page=us/413/15.html Text of the decision and dissents], from findlaw.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Miller test was an effort to differentiate between pornography and 'obscenity.' It has three parts:

* Whether "the average person, applying contemporary [[community standards]]", would find that the [[Work of art|work]], taken as a whole, appeals to the [[wiktionary:prurient|prurient]] interest,
* Whether the work depicts or describes, in a [[patently offensive]] way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law,
* Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious [[Literature|literary]], [[art]]istic, [[Politics|political]], or [[Science|scientific]] value.&lt;ref&gt;This is also known as the ''(S)LAPS test''—[Serious] Literary, Artistic, Political, Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is considered obscene only if ''all three'' conditions are satisfied. Local areas are permitted to develop their own laws on the issue, as long as they do not conflict with federal law.

Pornography is a large industry that involves major entertainment companies, which offer pornography films through cable channels and in-room movies in hotels. Pornography distribution changed radically during the 1980s, with [[VHS]] and [[cable television]] largely displacing X-rated theaters. VHS distribution, in turn, has been replaced by [[DVD]] and Internet distribution for [[niche market]]s. Pornography generates billions of dollars in sales in the United States alone. An estimated 211 new pornographic films are made every week in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,947880,00.html With pot and porn outstripping corn, America's black economy is flying high], ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is illegal to sell, exhibit or rent X-rated pornographic material in most [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]], including [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]], [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Queensland]]. In contrast, it is legal to sell, exhibit, or rent X-rated pornographic material in some [[States and territories of Australia|territories]] including the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. As the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]] prohibits states from regulating interstate commerce, the law permits the purchase of pornography from stores in either territory and also bringing it interstate. This means that the majority of Australian mail-order operations for adult material operate from the ACT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kathy Marks|title=Canberra reborn as capital of sex|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/canberra-reborn-as-capital-of-sex-5371392.html|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|date=29 April 2000|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the offenses under state laws, stores selling X-rated material are abundant in major cities, advertising openly, as these laws are rarely enforced.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In [[Papua New Guinea]], the possession, import, export, and sale of pornography are all offenses. Control is strict. According to the government, all websites containing pornography, [[nudity]] or depictions of sex are blocked and the government has been blocking such sites since early 2009.

'''Postgenderism''' is a social, political and cultural movement which arose from the eroding of the cultural, biological, psychological and social role of gender, and an argument for why the erosion of binary gender will be liberatory.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author = [[George Dvorsky|Dvorsky, George]]|title=Postgenderism: Beyond the Gender Binary|year=2008|url=http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2008/03/postgenderism-beyond-gender-binary.html|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Postgenderists argue that gender is an arbitrary and unnecessary limitation on human potential, and
foresee the elimination of involuntary biological and psychological gendering in the human species
as a result of social and cultural evolution and through the application of [[neurotechnology]], [[biotechnology]] and [[Assisted reproductive technology|assistive reproductive technologies]].&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author = [[George Dvorsky|Dvorsky, George]]|title=Postgenderism: Beyond the Gender Binary|year=2008|url=http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2008/03/postgenderism-beyond-gender-binary.html|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of postgenderism argue that the presence of [[gender roles]], [[social stratification]], and [[gender differences|cogno-physical disparities and differences]] are generally to the detriment of individuals and society. Given the radical potential for advanced assistive reproductive options, postgenderists believe that sex for [[sexual reproduction|reproductive]] purposes will either become obsolete, or that all post-gendered humans will have the ability, if they so choose, to both carry a pregnancy to term ''and'' 'father' a child, which, postgenderists believe, would have the effect of eliminating the need for definite genders in such a society.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

==Cultural roots==
Postgenderism as a cultural phenomenon has roots in [[feminism]], [[masculism]], along with the [[androgyny]], [[metrosexual]]/[[technosexual]] and [[transgender]] movements. However, it has been through the application of [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosophy that postgenderists have conceived the potential for actual morphological changes to the members of the human species and how future humans in a postgender society will reproduce. In this sense, it is an offshoot of transhumanism, [[posthumanism]],&lt;ref name="Ferrando 2014"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Ferrando | first=Francesca |title = Is the Post-Human a Post-Woman? Robots, Cyborgs and the Futures of Gender| journal=European Journal of Futures Research | volume=2 |year = 2014 |url =  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40309-014-0043-8| accessdate=2016-06-22| doi=10.1007/s40309-014-0043-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[futurism]].&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

One of the earliest expressions of postgenderism was [[Shulamith Firestone]]'s ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]''. It argues, &lt;blockquote&gt;[The] end goal of feminist revolution must be, unlike that of the first feminist movement, not just the elimination of [[male privilege]] but of the sex distinction itself: genital differences between human beings would no longer matter culturally. (A reversion to an unobstructed pansexuality Freud's 'polymorphous perversity'—would probably supersede hetero/homo/bi-sexuality.) The reproduction of the species by one sex for the benefit of both would be replaced by (at least the option of) artificial reproduction: children would born to both sexes equally, or independently of. either, however one chooses to look at it; the dependence of the child on the mother (and vice versa) would give way to a greatly shortened dependence on a small group of others in general, and any remaining inferiority to adults in physical strength would be compensated for culturally.&lt;ref&gt;The Dialectic of Sex, publ. The Women's Press, 1979. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another important and influential work in this regard was [[socialist feminism|socialist feminist]] [[Donna Haraway]]'s essay, "[[A Cyborg Manifesto]]: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century", in Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature (New York; Routledge, 1991), pp.&amp;nbsp;149–181. In this work, Haraway is interpreted as arguing that women would only be freed from their biological restraints when their reproductive obligations were dispensed with. This may be viewed as Haraway expressing belief that women will only achieve true liberation once they become [[postbiological]] organisms, or postgendered.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;  However, Haraway has publicly stated that their use of the word "post-gender" has been grossly misinterpreted.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Dale Carrico|Carrico, Dale]]|title="Post-Gender" or Gender Poets? |year=2008|url=http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2008/04/post-gender-or-gender-poets.html|accessdate=2008-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postgenderism is also often used by [[George Dvorsky]] to describe the diverse social, political, and cultural movement that affirm the voluntary elimination of gender in the human species by applying advanced biotechnology and assisted reproductive technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices|last=Aggrawal|first=Anil|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008|isbn=9781420043082|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Dvorsky wrote with [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] that "dyadic gender roles and [[sexual dimorphism]] are generally to the detriment of individuals and society" and that "greater biological fluidity and psychological [[androgyny]] will allow future persons to explore both masculine and feminine aspects of [[personality]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro-Blackness|last=Anderson|first=Reynaldo|last2=Jones|first2=Charles|publisher=exington Books|year=2015|isbn=9781498510509|location=Lanham, MD|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

Postgenderists are not exclusively advocates of androgyny, although most believe that a "mixing" of both masculine and feminine traits is desirable—essentially the creation of androgynous individuals who exhibit the best of what males and females have to offer in terms of physical and psychological abilities and proclivities. Just what these traits are exactly is a matter of great debate and conjecture.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

Postgenderism is not concerned solely with the physical sex or its assumed traits. It is focused on the idea of eliminating or moving beyond gendered identities. In a traditional gender construct one is either a man or woman, but in postgenderism one is neither a man nor woman nor any other assumed gender role. Thus an individual in society is not reduced to a gender role but is simply an agent of humanity who is to be defined (if at all) by one's actions.

However, not all postgenderists are against the existence of gender roles in some form; some only argue for the deemphasization of gender roles. People in this form of postgender world would be able to identify as a gender if they decided to, but identifying as one would not be mandatory, and gender roles would have little bearing on how people actually act or are treated in society.

==Future technologies==

In regard to potential assistive reproductive technologies, it is believed that reproduction can continue to happen outside of conventional methods, namely [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] and [[artificial insemination]]. Advances such as [[human cloning]], [[parthenogenesis]] and [[artificial womb]]s may significantly extend the potential for human reproduction.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

Many argue that [[posthuman]] space will be more virtual than real. Individuals may consist of [[mind transfer|uploaded minds]] living as data patterns on [[supercomputer]]s or users engaged in completely [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive virtual realities]]. Postgenderists contend that these types of existences are not gender-specific thus allowing individuals to morph their [[Avatar (virtual reality)|virtual appearances]] and sexuality at will.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

==Sexuality==

Postgenderists maintain that a genderless society does not imply the existence of a species uninterested in [[sex]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. It is thought that sexual relations and interpersonal intimacy can and will exist in a postgendered future, but that those activities may take on different form.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt; For example, this theory raises the relationship between gender and technologies such as the latter's role in the dismantling of the conventional gender order.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Designing and Conducting Gender, Sex, and Health Research|last=Oliffe|first=John|last2=Greaves|first2=Lorraine|publisher=SAGE|year=2011|isbn=9781412982436|location=Los angeles, CA|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postgenderism, however, is not directly concerned with the physical action of sex or with sexuality. It is believed to offer a more egalitarian system where individuals are classified according to factors such as age, talents, and interests instead of gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Feminism==
In the 1970 book ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'', [[radical feminist]] [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote that differences in biological reproductive roles are a source of [[gender inequality]]. Firestone singled out pregnancy and childbirth, making the argument that an [[artificial womb]] would free "women from the tyranny of their reproductive biology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|title=What Do Artificial Wombs Mean for Women?|url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/02/23/what-do-artificial-wombs-mean-women/|newspaper=RH Reality Check|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Christine|title=Why Not Artificial Wombs?|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/docLib/TNA03-Rosen.pdf|newspaper=The New Atlantis|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People in societies with a high power distance are more likely to conform to a hierarchy where "everybody has a place and which needs no further justification".&lt;ref name="GH-1" /&gt; In societies with a low power distance, individuals tend to try to distribute power equally. In such societies, inequalities of power among people would require additional justification.&lt;ref name="GH-1" /&gt;

==Development and studies on the theory==

===Geert Hofstede===

====Cultural dimensions theory====
Hofstede, the famous business anthropologist, developed the [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|cultural dimensions theory]], used widely as a crucial framework for cross-cultural communication. It is the earliest theory that could be quantified and used to explain perceived differences between cultures and has been applied extensively in many fields, especially in cross-cultural psychology, international business, and cross-cultural communication. It was driven by the statistical procedure (also called 'factor analysis') to make the development, based on the result of a global survey of the values of IBM employees conducted  from 1967 and 1973. Hofstede's theory identified six dimensions of culture, which are power distance, individualism vs collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs femininity, short-term vs long-term orientation, and indulgence vs self-restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An Interview with Geert Hofstede|last = Hoppe|first = Michael|date = Feb 2004|journal = The Academy of Management Executive (1993–2005)|volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=75–79|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Power Distance Index (PDI) ====
The Power Distance Index is designed to measure 'the extent to which power differs within the society, organization and institutions (like the family) are accepted by the less powerful members'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Hofstede|first = Geert H.|year = 1997|title = Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind |edition=second |location = New York |publisher = McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-707474-6|page= 27}} Originally published in 1991 as ''Cultures and organizations: software of the mind: intercultural cooperation and its importance for survival''.&lt;/ref&gt; It indicates the level of power distance and dependent relationships in a country by assigning a score to each country. The PDI also represents society's level of inequality that is defined from below rather than from above. As Hofstede stressed, there is no absolute value and PDI is useful only as a method to compare countries.&lt;ref name="Velo-26"&gt;{{harvnb|Velo|2011|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstede derived the power distance scores for three regions and fifty countries from the answers given by IBM employees in the same type of positions to the same questions. The detailed steps to calculate the PDI is as follows:

1. Prepare three survey questions:
* How frequently, in their experience, are they afraid to express disagreement with their managers? (mean score on a 1-5 scale from &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;very frequently' to 'very seldom')&lt;ref name="GHH-25"&gt;{{harvnb|Hofstede|1997|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinates' perception of their boss's actual decision-making style (percentage choosing either the description of an autocratic or of a paternalistic style, out of four possible styles plus a 'none of these alternatives')&lt;ref name="GHH-25" /&gt;
* Subordinates' preference for their boss's decision-making style (percentage preferring an autocratic or a paternalistic style, or, on the contrary, as type based on majority vote, but not a consultative style)&lt;ref name="GHH-25" /&gt;
2. Pre-code the answers so that they are represented by a number (e.g. 1,2,3,4...)

3. Compute the mean score for the answers of equal sample of people from each country or percentage for choosing particular answers

4. Sort the questions into groups which are called clusters or factors by using a statistical procedure

5. Add or subtract the three scores after multiplying each with a fixed number

6. Add another fixed number
* '''Lower PDI Culture: '''Low PDI cultures: In lower PDI cultures, the emotional distance is relatively small. There are more democratic or consultative relations between expecting and accepting power. People are relatively interdependent to the power holders, and there is relatively low inequality of power distributed among the people. Under these circumstances, the decentralized authority and flat management structure is common though not universal. It means that both managers and subordinates will, on average, be relatively less concerned with status, and the distribution of decision-making responsibility is extensive. Thus, the 'open door' policy is more easily used then elsewhere, which means the individuals in superior positions are not only more likely to be open to listen to those in inferior positions, but subordinates are also more likely to be willing to challenge or give suggestions to their superiors. For example, in this culture, if one wants to get a promotion, one would prefer to get their ideas across to their boss directly. Examples of countries with low PDI are the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and the Nordic countries.&lt;ref name="Smit"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Smit, Chris |date=26 April 2012 |title = Power Distance or PDI|url = http://culturematters.com/power-distance-or-pdi/|website = culturematters.com|accessdate =14 September 2015}} (self-published)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''High PDI Cultures:''' These are cultures in which the power relations are paternalistic and autocratic, and where there is centralized authority. In other words, there is a wide gap or emotional distance which is perceived to exist among people at different levels of the hierarchy. There is considerable dependence of people on power holders, which, in psychology, is known as counter-dependence (denounce, but with negative sign). In the workplace, the subordinates are willing to accept their inferior positions. The boss, in turn, may be not asked for broad participation in the process of decision making. Thus, unlike in lower PDI cultures, the 'open door' policy has been replaced by an autocratic leadership style, which means subordinates may be unlikely to approach and contradict their bosses directly.&lt;ref name="GHH-25" /&gt; For instance, even though employees may want to be promoted, it is entirely their boss's decision and they have no say in it.  Generally, countries with high power distance cultures hold that there is nothing wrong with inequality and thus, everyone could be in specific positions. Additionally, people in higher positions  usually display and promote the use of status symbols: powerful individuals would not eat lunch at the same cafeteria as people in lower positions, and there are large numbers of supervisors who are entitled to special privileges, for example. Belgium, France, Malaysia, and the Arab World can be regarded as examples of countries or regions with high PDI cultures.&lt;ref name="Smit" /&gt;

==== Limitation of Hofstede's model on power distance ====
Hofstede's study made a great contribution to the establishment of the research tradition in cross-cultural psychology. However, limitations still exist.

Firstly, each stage of the research process reappears as a political act of neutralization—of making the unneutral seem neutral. The questionnaire reflects a large power distance: its questions were explicitly designed to resolve the normative concerns of researchers. To further explain, it primarily served the concerns of those who needed to do comparative analysis and created it through "coercing a culturally distinct axis of comparison" on a variety of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Ailon|first = Galit|year=2008 |title =Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: Culture's consequences in a value test of its own design|journal = Academy of Management Review |doi=10.2307/20159451 |jstor=20159451 |volume=33 |pages=885–904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, the questionnaire adopted an obviously western methodology to analyze non-western countries and it is also relatively selective in representing the inequality within the western countries. For example, the PDI concentrated on the boss and subordinate relationship, which could be seen as biased, as it ignores other forms of western inequality. Apparently, the questions failed to measure  the racial, colonial, and broader class inequalities which should be taken into account into the  measurement of power distance.

===Other notable studies===

====Early studies====

=====Haire, Ghiselli, and Porter=====
In the middle of the last century, Haire, Ghiselli, and Porter&lt;ref name="Haire"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haire|first1=Mason|last2=Ghiselli|first2=Edwin E. |last3=Porter|first3=Lyman W. |title=Managerial Thinking: An international study |series=Research program of the Institute of Industrial Relations, University of California |publisher=Wiley|location=New York |oclc=925871372}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored the differences in preferences for power among different cultures with remarkable outcomes, even though they did not mention the concept of power distance. The methodology they adopted was by questionnaire, which was based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs with some modification. The aim of the questionnaire was to evaluate how managers from 14 countries were satisfied regarding their needs when they were in their current positions. The dimensions that were linked to power distance across cultures in their questionnaire were autonomy and self-actualization.
Autonomy
* The authority that comes with their management position.
* The degree to which independent thinking and action are allowed in their management positions.

Self-Actualization
* The chance for personal progress and advancement in management positions.
* The sense of self-achievement one derives from being in a management position.
* The sense of achievement from being in a management position.

In accordance with the responses to the questions in their questionnaire, the 14 countries were clustered into five main groups, which they labeled Nordic-European (Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden), Latin-European (Belgium, France, Italy, and Spain), Anglo-American (England and the United States), Developing (Argentina, Chile, and India), and Japan (by itself). One important thing from this analysis is the various mean standardized scores that the five groups presented with respect to autonomy and self-actualization. For these figures, positive ones mean greater satisfaction of need than for the average manager across all 14 countries, while negative ones mean lesser satisfaction. Their results are presented in Table 1.

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
|{{harvnb|Haire|1966}} || Autonomy || Self-Actualization
|-
| Nordic European || .36 || .25
|-
| Latin European || -.16 || .23
|-
| Anglo American || -.14 || -.09
|-
| Developing || -.25 || -.11
|-
| Japan || -.25 || -.11
|}

Upon the figures listed in the table, some implications are drawn. They are complicated, and summarized as follows:
– Nordic-Europeans who were surveyed were extremely contented with the satisfaction of their desire for power;
– Anglo-Americans were rather discontented; and
– the other clusters desired more power than they currently had in their positions

One important implication from this study is that countries can be clustered according to their preference for power. Besides this, some of their differences can be explained by the influence of the following factors: the predominant religion or philosophy, an established tradition of democracy, the long-term existence of a middle class, and the proportion of immigrants in each country.

=====Mulder=====
Another major study of power distance was the one that was undertaken by Mauk Mulder.&lt;ref name="Mulder"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Mulder|first1=Mauk |year=1977 |title=The Daily Power Game |series=International series on the quality of working life |publisher=Martinus Nihoff Social Sciences Division|location=Leiden, the Netherlands |isbn=978-1-4684-6953-0 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-6951-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the premise that as societies become weaker in power distance, the underprivileged will tend to reject their power dependency. Mulder's laboratory experiments in the social and organizational context of the Netherlands, a low power distance culture, concluded that people attempted to seek “power distance reduction”.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; He found that:
# More privileged individuals tend to try to preserve or to broaden their power distance from  subordinates.
# The larger their power distance is from a subordinate, the more the power holder would try to increase that distance.
# Less powerful individuals try to decrease the power distance between themselves and their superiors.
# The smaller the power distance, the more likely is the occurrence of less powerful individuals trying to reduce that distance.

From these findings, he concluded that a condition of quasi-equilibrium had arisen. In this condition, power holders have achieved a certain distance from people who lack power, and this distance is hard for the powerless to bridge.

====After Hofstede – The GLOBE Study====
Following Hofstede,&lt;ref name="Hofstede-2001"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hofstede|first1=Geert H. |year=2001 |title=Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviours, institutions and organisations across nations |publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, California |edition=second |isbn=978-0-8039-7323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the GLOBE project defined "power distance" as “the degree to which members of an organization or society expect and agree that power should be shared unequally.”&lt;ref&gt;Note that this is different from the definition of "power distance" used by other authors, see {{harvnb|Mulder|1977}}, as the relative difference in power between the powerful and the powerless.&lt;/ref&gt; Power distance was then further analyzed as one of the nine cultural dimensions explained in the “Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness” (GLOBE) Research Program, which was conceived in 1990 by Robert J. House of the Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=House|first1=Robert J.|last2=Hanges|first2=Paul J. |last3=Javidan|first3=Mansour|last4=Dorfman|first4=Peter W.|last5=Gupta|first5=Vipin |year=2004 |title=Culture, Leadership, and Organizations The GLOBE Study of 62 Societies|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-0-7619-2401-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the major premise that leader effectiveness is contextual, the research was conducted by believing that the social and organizational values, norms and beliefs of those who are being led are closely connected to the effectiveness of the leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoppe|first1=Michael H. |year=2007 |title=Culture and Leader Effectiveness: The GLOBE Study |url=http://www.inspireimagineinnovate.com/pdf/globesummary-by-michael-h-hoppe.pdf|website=Inspire!Image!Innovate!|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLOBE measures the practices and values that exist at the levels of industry (financial services, food processing, telecommunications), organization (several in each industry), and society (62 cultures).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are presented in the form of quantitative data based on responses of about 17,000 managers from 951 organizations functioning in 62 societies throughout the world, which shows how each of the 62 societies scores on nine major attributes of cultures, including Power Distance, and six major global leader behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding power distance, GLOBE researches cultural influences on power distance values, practices and other aspects, including 'Roots of Power Distance', 'The Psychological Stream and Power' and 'The Cross-Cultural Stream and Power Distance'. It also investigates how family power values are taught, and makes a comparison of high versus low power distance societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When discussing 'The Cross-Cultural Stream and Power Distance', four primary factors affecting a society's level of power distance are explained separately, and they are the predominant religion or philosophy, the tradition of democratic principles of government, the existence of a strong middle class, and the proportion of immigrants in a society's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the four fundamental phenomena, there always exists connections; however, it is concluded that a society's main beliefs, values, and religion, will have the strongest and longest lasting influence on power distance. Then, this will be moderated by a democratic tradition and the existence of a strong middle class to some extent. Moreover, the two factors are both expected to affect narrowing power distance. Therefore, for a Roman Catholic society, which is exposed to democracy and a middle class, would be on the way to narrowing power distance. Though its level of power distance could be reduced over time, it would still be higher than a Protestant country, which has a democratic tradition and a large middle class. Finally, a large proportion of immigrants in a given society makes the low power distance trend stronger in all circumstances presented above. In addition, it is concluded that regardless of religion, any society that does not have a tradition of democracy or a significant middle class will have a substantially high power distance levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications and effects ==
Power distance is such a significant dimension in cross-cultural environments that it is unconsciously influencing people's behaviour in different countries, which contributes to so–called 'cultural norms'. These 'cultural norms', shaped by perceptions and acceptance of power inequality to a certain degree, lead to various reactions when facing same situations or in the same environment. However, there are some consequences resulting from acquiescence in inequality in organizations and societies, especially for high power distance countries.&lt;ref name="Ji" /&gt;

=== The workplace ===

==== Effects on management style ====
In organisations with high power distance, employees acknowledge their lesser standing, and are respectful and submissive towards their superiors; who in turn, are more likely to give orders rather than consult with their employees while making decisions. Status symbols are often displayed and flaunted. Employers or managers would not have meals together with their subordinates, and might have private facilities such as rooms, parking lots, and elevators. Having a high level of education is important to climb the corporate ladder, and the higher-ranking members of the organization are often paid much more than their employees in comparison with companies with lower power distance.&lt;ref name="Velo"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Veronica|last=Velo |year = 2011|title = Cross-Cultural Management |location = New York |publisher = Business Expert Press |isbn = 978-1-60649-350-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in businesses with low power distance, bosses are not as concerned with status symbols and would be more open to employee discussion and participation. Employees are less submissive to their superiors, and are more likely to make themselves heard or to challenge the management.&lt;ref name="Velo" /&gt;

==== Effects on employees' behaviour of help seeking ====
In high power distance regions, people in the higher positions hold great amounts of power with little challenge. The hierarchy and authority empower employers and supervisors with more rights of resource allocation, rewards and punishment, which in turn reinforce their status, as well as enable them to lead and guide their subordinates autocratically. The hierarchical differentiation between the top and the bottom gradually creates an invisible gap in the workplace, where the subordinates tend to build greater sensitivity and cautiousness when communicating with their supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kirkman B.

It is a common phenomenon that junior employees turn to their seniors for help and advice when getting into a new environment. Yet, some researchers recently attested that employees and junior staff from high power distance countries are less likely to seek help from their supervisors.&lt;ref name="Ji" /&gt; One of the reasons is that lower ranking staff have few chances and time to meet the high ranking managers in person. The hierarchical system is far more sophisticated and restricted that subordinates are usually only able to reach their immediate supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Lonner|first1=Walter J. |last2=Berry |first2=John W. |last3=Hofstede |first3=Geert H. |year=1980 |title=Culture's Consequences: International Differences in Work-Related Values |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Historical Research Reference in Entrepreneurship }} [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1496209 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is widely believed that the action of asking for help is equivalent to incompetence or lack of ability, which subdues themselves into an unfavourable circumstance. What is worse is that some of the supervisors who are incapable of solving more complicated problems will become suspicious of his or her subordinates, regarding the problems as a challenge to their status and capabilities, or even as humiliation from the lower ranking staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee |first=Fiona |year=2002 |title=The Social Costs of Seeking Help |journal=The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=17–35 |doi=10.1177/0021886302381002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such climates have gradually reinforced employees to think that it is more effective and efficient to deal with difficulties by themselves, rather than talking to their managers. The indisputability of power and authority widens the gap between different levels, while the acceptance of inequality consolidates the endurance among the bottom, stopping the subordinates seeking help from the top.

There is another main perspective that leads to a larger gap between the supervisors and subordinates. In a high power distance environment, supervisors tend to pay more attention on tasks rather than human beings that are the main focus for supervisors in a low power distance environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bochner S. |author2=Hesketh B. | year = 1994 | title = Power distance, individualism/collectivism, and job-related attitudes in a culturally diverse work group | url = http://doi.org/czwm4x | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 233–257 | doi=10.1177/0022022194252005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, task orientation emphasizes heavily on daily work completion and performance efficiency, yet the top-bottom relationship grows far more slowly since there is a lack of communication beyond work, which in turn reduces subordinates' willingness of seeking help from supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Madlock P. E. | year = 2012 | title = The influence of power distance and communication on Mexican workers | url = http://doi.org/3d2 | journal = International Journal of Business Communication | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 169–184 | doi=10.1177/0021943612436973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to low power distance countries, equality is embraced by the society that power is minimized to a large extent, where authority and hierarchy are not highlighted and supervisors are accessible and willing to build close relationship with subordinates, whose worries of any harm are turned down when seeking help from the top.&lt;ref name="Ji"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Ji, Yang |author2=Zhou, Erhua |author3=Li, Caiyun |author4=Yan, Yanling  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2015 |title=Power Distance Orientation and Employee Help Seeking: Trust in Supervisor as a Mediator |journal=Social Behaviour &amp; Personality: An International Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1043–1054 |doi=10.2224/sbp.2015.43.6.1043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In charitable behaviour ===
According to research, people from high power distance countries are generally less responsible towards charitable behaviours than people from low power distance countries.&lt;ref name="Winterich"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Winterich, Karen Page  |author2=Zhang, Yinlong  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2014 |title= Accepting Inequality Deters Responsibility: How Power Distance Decreases Charitable Behavior |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=274–293 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Winterich/publication/262403906_Accepting_Inequality_Deters_Responsibility_How_Power_Distance_Decreases_Charitable_Behavior/links/0c9605379fd62f31c2000000.pdf |subscription=yes |doi=10.1086/675927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for this phenomenon is that the rooted perception and acceptance of inequality somehow blinds their eyes to any unfair or inappropriate situations, which they may consider as a normal social circumstance and simply accept it rather than making a change.&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Cummings, William H. |author2=Venkatesan, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1976 |title=Cognitive Dissonance and Consumer Behavior: A Review of the Evidence |journal=Journal of Marketing Research |volume=13 |issue=3  |pages=303–308 |jstor=3150746 |doi=10.2307/3150746 }} republished from {{Cite book|author1=Cummings, William H. |author2=Venkatesan, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1975 |chapter=Cognitive Dissonance and Consumer Behavior: A Review of the Evidence |title=Advances in Consumer Research, Volume 2 |editor=Schlinger, Mary Jane |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |publisher=Association for Consumer Research|pages=21–32 |url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=5742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Festinger"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Festinger Leon |author2=Carlsmith James M | year = 1959 | title = Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 203–210 | doi=10.1037/h0041593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumulatively, the more inequality they accept, the less inconformity they will notice, and the less responsibilities they will take eventually. The consequence is high power distance enlarging the gap between human beings in terms of relations and wealth conditions. Conversely, people in low power distance countries are more sensitive towards any unequal phenomena. Their unacceptance of dissonance endows them with a greater sense of responsibility for adjusting or correcting the problems in person.&lt;ref name="Cummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Festinger" /&gt;

==== Influence of controllable/uncontrollable needs ====
The types of needs are influencing people's charitable behaviour regardless of their power distance backgrounds. The needs generated are classified into controllable and uncontrollable categories, where the occurrence of the former is due to lack of effort while the occurrence of the latter is due to unforeseeable events such as natural disasters. The ability of whether individuals are able to control the situations affects how they will react to the raising needs.&lt;ref name="Betancourt"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betancourt |first=Hector |year=1990 |title=An Attribution–Empathy Model of Helping Behavior: Behavioral Intentions and Judgments of Help-Giving |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=573–591|doi=10.1177/0146167290163015 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Brickman, Philip |author2=Rabinowitz, Vita Carulli |author3=Karuza, Jurgis, Jr. |author4=Coates, Dan |author5=Cohn, Ellen |author6=Kidder, Louise  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1982 |title=Models of Helping and Coping |journal=American Psychologist |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=368–384 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.37.4.368}} [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ262702 ERIC number EJ262702]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shaver, Kelly G. |year=1985 |title=The Attribution of Blame: Causality, Responsibility, and Blameworthiness |location=New York |publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=978-0-387-96120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand, the level of power distance does have an influence over a society's reaction towards controllable needs. People with high power distance background perceive most of the issues as rightful inequality, hence are reluctant to get themselves involved with 'troubles', and therefore most of the time they choose to turn a blind eye on such petty things. Conversely, low power distance societies are intolerant with unfairness and thus their higher sense of responsibility motivates people to make an effort in eliminating dissonance in every possibility.&lt;ref name="Winterich" /&gt; Yet, there seems to be an exception. It is found that people are not sympathetic at all to those in trouble due to internal-controllable reasons. In other words, it is most likely that people reckon those who are lazy, careless, greedy or indulgent, deserve such hardship and punishment, instead of giving a hand to them to go through the difficulties.&lt;ref name="Skitka"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Skitka, Linda J. |author2=Tetlock, Philip E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1992 |title=Allocating Scarce Resources: A Contingency Model of Distributive Justice |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=491–522 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(92)90043-J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, even if there is an evident unequal phenomenon emerging, the willingness of charitable behaviours are attenuated to the least in both high and low power distance countries.

On the other hand, people tend to be more responsible in terms of uncontrollable needs, whereby they are more willing to offer aid to. It is assumed that people consider that the aid for uncontrollable needs will not greatly change societal rightful inequality, and hence generous assistance and help will be offered to those in need regardless of power distance background.&lt;ref name="Betancourt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skitka" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karasawa"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Karasawa, Kaori |year=1991 |title=The Effects of Onset and Offset Responsibility on Affects and Helping Judgments |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=482–499 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1991.tb00532.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lerner Melvin J. |author2=Reavy Patricia | year = 1975 | title = Locus of Control, Perceived Responsibility for Prior Fate, and Helping Behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1016/0092-6566(75)90029-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such circumstances, a sense of duty is more likely to be raised, where people tend to undertake charitable behaviours.&lt;ref name="Winterich" /&gt;

==== Influence of communal/exchange relationship norms ====
The relationship norms behind the needs also affect the sense of responsibility. The types of relationships are mainly classified as exchange relationships, in which people are expecting a reasonable privilege or benefit in return for offering aid; and communal relationships, where those giving assistance are wholeheartedly and generously taking care of those in need without any expectation of material return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aggarwal Pankaj |author2=Law Sharmistha | year = 2005 | title = Role of Relationship Norms in Processing Brand Information | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 453–64 | doi=10.1086/497557}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Clark, Margaret S. |author2=Ouellette, Robert |author3=Powell, Martha C. |author4=Milberg, Sandra  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1987 |title=Recipient's Mood, Relationship Type, and Helping |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=94–103 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.1.94 |pmid=3612495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research, people are more likely to refuse to aid when encountering needs associated with exchange relationships rather than needs with communal relationships, which has proved to alleviate the influence of power distance belief and increase the willingness and responsibility of assistance.&lt;ref name="Winterich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Brockner, Joel |author2=Paruchuri, Srikanth |author3=Idson, Lorraine Chen |author4=Higgins, E. Tory  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Regulatory Focus and the Probability Estimates of Conjunctive and Disjunctive Events |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=35–66 |url=https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/399/Regulatory_Focus_and_the_probability_estimates.pdf |doi=10.1006/obhd.2000.2938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Johnson, Jennifer Wiggins  |author2=Grimm, Pamela E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |title=Communal and Exchange Relationship Perceptions as Separate Constructs and Their Role in Motivations to Donate |journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=282–294 |doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2010.06.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, Winterich recommended that charitable organizations in high power distance countries should stress the significance of uncontrollable needs or salient communal relationship norms, through which the populace are more easily motivated to make a difference on social inequality.&lt;ref name="Winterich" /&gt;

=== Examples of cultures with high and low power distance ===
Malaysia has one of the highest levels of power distance, with a score of 100 on Hofstede's Power Distance Index (PDI).&lt;ref name="GH-2"&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2015|reason=The Geert-hofstede.com ''website cannot be used as a reference.

They would perceive hierarchy in organisations as mirroring intrinsic inequalities. Leaders are expected to be autocratic, and to instruct their subordinates on what to do. Malaysian society is often centralised, and opposition to authority is generally not welcomed.&lt;ref name="GH-2" /&gt;

With a PDI score of 11, Austria is one of the countries with the lowest levels of power distance. Austrians believe in independence, equal rights, approachable leaders, that chain of command should only be for convenience, and that supervision should facilitate and empower. Power is typically decentralised, with leaders often consulting or relying on their subordinates. First names are usually used even with superiors, and communication is direct and two-way.&lt;ref name="GH-3"&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2015|reason=The Geert-hofstede.com ''website cannot be used as a reference.

== Linked factors ==

=== Climate ===

It has been hypothesized that there is a link between climate and power distance, with societies in warmer climates more likely to have a higher power distance than societies in colder climates. As food and other necessities are relatively easier to come by in warm, comfortable climates, survival is not as difficult, and thus there is no need for rigorous discipline, preparation, or hardship. It has been argued that these conditions would give rise to a situation whereby it is beneficial for strict organisation and direction to come from superiors in order to propel people to cooperate effectively, even if it goes against the will of some people.&lt;ref name="Velo" /&gt;

On the other hand, in colder, harsher climates, it is imperative for individuals to have discipline and prudence to work hard and make the right decisions in order to survive. In these societies, if one were to be lazy and rest for a day instead of searching for food, they might not be able to survive. Therefore, self-discipline and restraint is paramount in these climates. With these qualities ingrained in the people, social order does not need to be enforced externally.&lt;ref name="Velo" /&gt;

=== Democracy ===

It has been asserted that democratic governments occur most commonly among low power distance societies, where it is not ingrained into the minds of the people since young age that there are unquestionable hierarchies in life that should not be disputed. It has been found that the 'ideological breach between labour and conservatives' is exceedingly polarised in high power distance socieites, while in low power distance cultures, people would tend to try to attain balance between the two extremes in order to avoid damaging and draining conflicts. This is why unions in high power distance cultures are usually formed by corporations or governments, while those in lower power distance societies are usually less 'ideological' and more 'practical'.&lt;ref name="Velo" /&gt;

'''Public awareness of science''' ('''PAwS'''), '''public understanding of science''' ('''PUS'''), or more recently, '''Public Engagement with Science and Technology''' ('''PEST''') are terms relating to the attitudes, behaviours, opinions, and activities that comprise the relations between the general public or lay society as a whole to scientific knowledge and organisation. It is a comparatively new approach to the task of exploring the multitude of relations and linkages [[science]], [[technology]], and [[innovation]] have among the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savaget|first1=Paulo|last2=Acero|first2=Liliana|title=Plurality in understandings of innovation, sociotechnical progress and sustainable development: An analysis of OECD expert narratives|journal=Public Understanding of Science|year=2017|doi=10.1177/0963662517695056}}&lt;/ref&gt; While earlier work in the discipline had focused on augmenting public knowledge of scientific topics, in line with the [[information deficit model]] of [[science communication]], the discrediting of the model has led to an increased emphasis on how the public [[uses and gratifications theory|chooses to use]] scientific knowledge and on the development of interfaces to mediate between [[expertise|expert]] and [[layperson|lay]] understandings of an issue.{{examples|date=October 2015}}

== Major themes ==
The area integrates a series of fields and themes such as:
* [[Science communication]] in the [[mass media]], [[Internet]], [[radio]] and [[television]] programmes
* [[Science museums]], [[aquarium|aquaria]], [[planetarium|planetaria]], [[zoo|zoological parks]], [[botanical garden]]s, etc.
* Public controversies over science and technology
* Fixed and mobile science exhibits
* [[Science festival]]s
* [[Science fair]]s in schools and social groups
* [[Science education]] for adults
* Science and [[social movement]]s
* Media and science ([[Mediatization (media)|medialisation]] of science)
* [[Consumer education]]
* [[Citizen science]]
* Public tours of [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) parks, manufacturing companies, etc.
* [[Science in popular culture]]
* Science in text books and classrooms
* Science and art

How to raise public awareness and public understanding of science and technology, and how the public feels and knows about science in general, and specific subjects, such as [[genetic engineering]], [[bioethics]], etc., are important lines of research in this area. Professor of communication, Matthew Nisbet, points up the challenge, for example, in terms of the paradox of the success of science and engineering creating the conditions that have led to the trust or distrust of experts among certain populations and that the correlation appears to be more socioeconomic than religious or ideological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Divided Expectations: Why We Need a New Dialogue about Science, Inequality, and Society |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=18-19 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619185052/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/divided_expectations |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bodmer report==
The publication of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society's]]' report ''The Public Understanding of Science&lt;ref name=RS-Bodmer-report&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Royal Society|title=The Public Understanding of Science|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/publications/1985/public-understanding-science/|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' (or ''Bodmer Report'') in 1985 is widely held to be the birth of the Public Understanding of Science movement in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD004707.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report led to the foundation of the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]] and a cultural change in the attitude of scientists to outreach activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3805.htm#n26|title=House of Lords - Science and Technology - Third Report|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contextualist model ==
In the 1990s, a new perspective emerged in the field with the classic study of [[Cumbria]]n Sheep Farmers' interaction with the Nuclear scientists in [[England]], where [[Brian Wynne]] demonstrated how the experts were ignorant or disinterested in taking into account the lay knowledge of the sheep farmers while conducting field experiments on the impact of the [[Chernobyl]] Nuclear fall out on the sheep in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wynne|first=Brian|date=1996|chapter=Misunderstood Misunderstandings: Social Identities and the Public Uptake of Science|url=|editors=Alan Irwin and Brian Wynne |title=Misunderstanding Science? The Public Reconstruction of Science and Technology |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=19–46|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this shortcoming from the side of the scientists, local farmers lost their trust in them. The experts were unaware of the local environmental conditions and the behaviour of sheep and this has eventually led to the failure of their experimental models. Following this study, scholars have studies similar micro-sociological contexts of expert-lay interaction and proposed that the context of knowledge communication is important to understand public engagement with science. Instead of large scale public opinion surveys, researchers proposed studies informed by [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK)]]. The contextualist model focuses on the social impediments in the  bidirectional flow of scientific knowledge between experts and laypersons/communities.

== The deliberative turn ==
The scholarly debate on public engagement with science developed further into analyzing the deliberations on science  through various institutional forms, with the help of the theory of deliberative democracy. Public deliberation of and participation in science practiced through public spheres became a major emphasis. Scholars like [[Sheila Jasanoff]] argues for wider public deliberation on science in democratic societies which is a basic condition for decision making regarding science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jasanoff|first=Sheila|date=2003|title=Breaking the Waves in Science Studies: Comment on H.M. Collins and Robert Evans, 'The Third Wave of Science Studies'|url=|journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=389–400|doi=10.1177/03063127030333004|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also attempts to develop more inclusive participatory models of technological governance in the form of consensus conferences, citizen juries, extended peer reviews, and deliberative mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lövbrand, Eva, Roger Pielke, Jr. and Silke Beck|first=|date=2011|title=A Democracy Paradox in Studies of Science and Technology|url=|journal=Science, Technology and Human Values |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=474–496|doi=10.1177/0162243910366154|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring public understanding of science ==
Social scientists use various metrics to measure public understanding of science, including:

=== 1. Factual knowledge ===
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Recognition: Answering a specific question by selecting the correct answer out a list&lt;ref name="Eveland"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eveland|first1=William|title=How Web Site Organization Influences Free Recall, Factual Knowledge, and Knowledge Structure Density|journal=Human Communications Research|volume=30|issue=2|pages=208–233|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2004.tb00731.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Recall (memory)#Types|Cued Recall]]: Answering a specific question without a list of choices &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
*[[Recall (memory)#Types|Free Recall]]: After exposure to information, the study participant produces a list of as much of the information as they can remember &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Key assumptions: ==== 
* The more individual pieces of information a person is able to retrieve, the more that person is considered to have learned &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

=== 2. Self-reported knowledge, perceived knowledge, or perceived familiarity ===
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Scaled survey responses to questions such as "How well informed you would say you are about this topic?"&lt;ref name ="Ladwig"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ladwig|first1=Peter|title=Perceived familiarity or factual knowledge? Comparing operationalizations of scientific understanding|journal=Science and Public Policy|volume=39|pages=761–774|doi=10.1093/scipol/scs048}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Key assumptions: ==== 
* Emphasizes the value of knowledge of one’s knowledge &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt;

=== 3. Structural knowledge: ===
The nature of connections among different pieces of information in memory &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Asking study participants to assess relationships among concepts. For example, participants free recall concepts onto the first row and column of a matrix, then indicate whether the concepts are related to each other by placing an “X” in the cell if they are not. Participants then rank the remaining open cells by their relatedness from 1 (only very weakly) to 7 (very strongly related) &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
* Study participants answer questions designed to measure elaboration involved in a task, such as “I tried to relate the ideas I read about to my own past experiences” &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Key Assumptions: ====
* The use of [[Elaborative interrogation|elaboration]] increases the likelihood of remembering information &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

=== Mixed use of the three measures ===
* While some studies purport that factual and perceived knowledge can be viewed as the same construct, a 2012 study investigating public knowledge of nanotechnology supports separating their use in communications research, as they “do not reflect the same underlying knowledge structures." &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt; Correlations between them were found to be low, and they were not predicted by the same factors. For example different types of science media use (television versus online) predicted different constructs &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt;
* Factual knowledge has been shown to be empirically distinct from structural knowledge &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

== Project examples ==
Government and private-led campaigns and events, such as [[Dana Foundation]]'s "[[Brain Awareness Week]]," are becoming a strong focus of programmes which try to promote public awareness of science.

The UK PAWS Foundation dramatically went as far as establishing a Drama Fund with the BBC in 1994. The purpose was to encourage and support the creation of new drama for television, drawing on the world of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=PAWS off science?|journal=Physics Education|date=January 1998|volume=33|issue=1|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/33/1/011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vega Science Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vega.org.uk|title=The Vega Science Trust - Science Video - Homepage|work=vega.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 1994 to promote science through the media of television and the internet with the aim of giving scientists a platform from which to communicate to the general public.

The [[Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science]] chair at [[The University of Oxford]] was established in 1995 for the [[Ethology|ethologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship/professor-richard-dawkins|title=Professor Richard Dawkins - The Simonyi Professorship|work=ox.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514025233/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship/professor-richard-dawkins|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by an endowment from [[Charles Simonyi]]. Mathematician [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has held the chair since Dawkins' retirement in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/professor-marcus-du-sautoy|title=Professor Marcus du Sautoy - The Simonyi Professorship|work=ox.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181656/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/professor-marcus-du-sautoy|archivedate=2010-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar professorships have since been created at other British universities. Professorships in the field have been held by well-known academics including [[Richard Fortey]] and [[Kathy Sykes]] at the [[University of Bristol]], [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] at [[Manchester University]], [[Tanya Byron]] at [[Edge Hill University]], [[Jim Al-Khalili]] at the [[University of Surrey]] and [[Alice Roberts]] at the [[University of Birmingham]].

{{Tort law}}

In [[English law|English]] [[criminal law]], '''public nuisance''' is a class of [[common law offence]] in which the injury, loss, or damage is suffered by the public, in general, rather than an individual, in particular.

==In Australia==
In ''Kent v Johnson'' the [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory|Supreme Court of the ACT]] held that Public nuisance is "an unlawful act or omission ... which endangers the lives, safety, health, property or comfort of the public or by which the public are obstructed in the exercise or enjoyment of any right common to all".&lt;ref name="Kent v Johnson"&gt;''Kent v Johnson (Minister of State for Works)'' (1973) 2 [[ACT Law Reports|ACTR]] 1; (1973) 21 [[Federal Law Reports|FLR]] 177, [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory|Supreme Court]] (ACT, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; And also, Public Nuisance is a criminal offense at some common law and by statute under some states.&lt;ref name="Kent v Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Qld|act|cc189994|Criminal Code|230}} Common nuisance.&lt;/ref&gt; To establish  a prima facie case of public nuisance, a private individual will have to prove: (1) title to sue, (2) that the interference is with a public right and  (3) that the defendant's interference is substantial and unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carolyn|first1=Sappideen|last2=Prue|first2=Vines|last3=Penelope|first3=Watson|title=Torts: commentary and Materials|publisher=Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Limited |isbn=9780455230436|pages=754, 755|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* (1): title to sue
In the case ''Walsh v Ervin'',&lt;ref name="Walsh v Ervin"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicLawRp|47|1952|litigants=Walsh v Ervin |parallelcite=[1952] [[Victorian Law Reports|VLR]] 361 at p. 368 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as the general principle is usually stated, an individual cannot sue alone for relief in respect of a nuisance to a public highway unless he has sustained some particular damage, in the sense of some substantial injury, direct and not merely consequential, beyond that suffered by the public generally.
* (2): interference is with a public right
In the case ''Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd'',&lt;ref name="A-G v PYA Quarries"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd |year=1958 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1 |courtname=auto |parallelcite=[1957] 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 169 at p. 179}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a nuisance which is so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect that it would not be reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large
* (3): interference is substantial and unreasonable
The interference must be substantial and unreasonable in order to establish public nuisance. In modern world, daily inconveniences and annoyances are part of unreasonable and substantial interference. 
However, there are some examples that shows even if it could cause interference to the public, there is no public nuisance. For example, in ''Maitland v Raisbeck'', "it would seem that every driver of a vehicle on the road would be turned into an insurer in respect of latent defects in this machines", even if a danger was created because of moral use of vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;''Maitland v Raisbeck'' [1944] 1 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 689 at p. 692&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Harper v Haden'' [1933] [[Chancery Division Law Reports |Ch]] 298.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case  ''Silservice Pty Ltd v Supreme Bready Pty Ltd'',&lt;ref name="Silservice v Supreme Bready"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWStRp|29|1949|litigants=Silservice Pty Ltd v Supreme Bready Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1950) 50 [[State Reports New South Wales|SR (NSW)]] 127 at p. 129 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest David Roper|Roper]] Chief Judge in Equity stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;it appears that in cases of this kind if the defendant has available to him reasonable means of removing or avoiding the obstruction, he is responsible for the nuisance if he does not adopt those means. The test is not whether an obstruction has been caused, but whether the obstruction could reasonably have been avoided. I think, however, that this is not the sole test of whether a person is responsible for the nuisance caused by the assembly of a crowd of people, and that a more absolute liability rests upon the person whose business involves the gathering together of a crowd, or who, apart from any consideration of the bona fide conduct of his business, deliberately continues to gather the crowd. (citations omitted).&lt;ref name="Silservice v Supreme Bready"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discussion==
The nuisance action began in twelfth century England as a criminal writ, belonging only to the Crown. It was used in cases that involved encroachments upon the King’s land or the blocking of public roads or waterways. The King sought to punish these criminal infringements, commonly known as “purprestures,” through criminal proceedings. Over time, activities prosecuted as public nuisances included everything from embezzling public funds to having a tiger pen next to a highway, from assisting a homicidal maniac to escape to placing a mutilated corpse on a doorstep, and from selling rotten meat to “subdividing houses to the point where they become ‘overpestered’ with the poor.” As these examples demonstrate, early authority to commence public nuisance actions was derived from the sovereign’s “police power."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuisancelaw.com/learn/historical Public Nuisance: A Historical Discussion]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spencer (1989 at 59) describes the offence as, "...a rag-bag of odds and ends which we should nowadays call 'public welfare offences'".&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, J. R. (1989). "Public Nuisance - A Critical Examination". ''Cambridge Law Journal'' 55.&lt;/ref&gt; But the common feature of the crime is that members of the public suffer a common injury through interference with rights which they enjoy as citizens. The modern definition is found in paras 31-40 Archbold (2005):

{{quote|A person is guilty of a public nuisance (also known as common nuisance), who (a) does an act not warranted by law, or (b) omits to discharge a legal duty, if the effect of the act or omission is to endanger the life, health, property, morals, or comfort of the public, or to obstruct the public in the exercise or enjoyment of rights common to all Her Majesty's subjects.&lt;ref&gt;*Archbold. (2005). ''Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Attorney General v PYA Quarries Ltd'' &lt;ref name="A-G v PYA Quarries"/&gt; the issue was whether quarrying activities—which showered the neighbourhood with stones and splinters, and caused dust and vibrations—were a private nuisance affecting some of the residents (which would have been civil), but not a public nuisance affecting all Her Majesty's liege subjects living in the area.&lt;ref name="A-G v PYA Quarries"/&gt; In his judgment [[Charles Romer|Romer LJ]] concluded at p 184:

{{quote|I do not propose to attempt a more precise definition of a public nuisance than those which emerge from the textbooks and authorities to which I have referred. It is, however, clear, in my opinion, that any nuisance is 'public' which materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty's subjects. The sphere of the nuisance may be described generally as 'the neighbourhood'; but the question whether the local community within that sphere comprises a sufficient number of persons to constitute a class of the public is a question of fact in every case. It is not necessary, in my judgment, to prove that every member of the class has been injuriously affected; it is sufficient to show that a representative cross-section of the class has been so affected for an injunction to issue.}}

[[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Denning LJ.]] agreed at p 191

{{quote|that a public nuisance is a nuisance which is so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect that it would not be reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large.}}

In ''R v Madden'' (1975) 1 WLR 1379 the defendant telephoned a bomb hoax to a steel works whose business was disrupted for about an hour. James LJ. accepted that hoax telephone calls falsely asserting the presence of explosives could amount to an offence of public nuisance but the few employees whose day was disrupted were not a sufficiently wide class of the public. But in ''R v Norbury'' (1978) Crim. LR 435 the defendant made 605 obscene telephone calls to 494 different women over a period of four years. This repetitive behaviour over a long period, intended to cause offence and alarm, was held the kind of behaviour which the public has an interest in condemning. This is not without its problems because each telephone call lacks the element of common injury. As a comparison, the cases of ''R v Ruffell'' (1991) 13 Cr. App. R. (S) 204 and ''R v Shorrock'' (1994) QB 279 involved the prosecution of the organisers of "acid house" parties at night in fields adjacent to residential accommodation with liability confirmed because they knew, or ought to have known, that there was a real risk of creating the sort of nuisance that in fact occurred. At each party there was major traffic disruption and the noise of music, with clean-up operations required the following day. While ''R v Ong'' (2001) 1 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr. App. R. (S)]] 404 involved a betting scam in which the floodlights at a Premier Division football match between Charlton Athletic and Liverpool were to be sabotaged which was inherently dangerous to the thousands within the ground.

In ''R v Soul'' (1980) 70 Cr. App. R. 295 a group who agreed to secure the unlawful release of a restricted Broadmoor patient was convicted of [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to effect a public nuisance. The court seems to have assumed that the public would have been exposed to danger had the plan been put into effect. That the Crown had failed to prove any actual danger or common injury was not considered (see the critical commentary at (1980) Crim. LR 234 suggesting that the courts were improperly reintroducing "public mischief" into the law despite the ruling by the House of Lords in ''R v Withers'' (1975) AC 842). Similarly, in ''R v Millward'' (1986) 8 Cr. App R(S) 209 the defendant made hundreds of telephone calls (636 in a single day) to a young woman police officer with whom he had become infatuated, at the police station where she worked. As to the requirement of common injury, Glidewell LJ, said:

{{quote|Quite apart from anything else, this disrupts the whole operation of the police station to which these calls are directed, because a member of the public may wish to report an urgent matter such as a criminal offence, and cannot do so or is delayed in doing so because of this kind of behaviour on the part of the appellant.}}

In ''R v Johnson (Anthony)'' (1997) 1 WLR 367, the Court of Appeal confronted the problem head-on. The defendant had made hundreds of obscene telephone calls to at least thirteen women. The defence argued each telephone call was a single isolated act to an individual. Tucker J, rejected the argument at pp370–371:

{{quote|In our judgment it is permissible and necessary to look at the cumulative effect of these calls, made to numerous ladies on numerous occasions in the case of each lady, and to have regard to the cumulative effect of the calls in determining whether the appellant's conduct constituted a public nuisance. In our opinion it was conduct which materially affected the reasonable comfort and convenience of a class of Her Majesty's subjects: see per Romer LJ in ''Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd''.&lt;ref name="A-G v PYA Quarries"/&gt; It was a nuisance which was so widespread in its range, or so indiscriminate in its effect, that it would not be reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on her own responsibility, but that they should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large: see Denning LJ ... It was proved by the Crown that the public, meaning a considerable number of persons or a section of the public, was affected, as distinct from individual persons.}}

This was followed in a number of cases such as ''R v Holliday and Leboutillier'' (2004) EWCA Crim 1847&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2004/1847.html R v Holliday and Leboutillier] [2004] EWCA Crim 1847&lt;/ref&gt; in which two animal liberation activists made a large number of telephone calls to employees and shareholders of certain companies whose activities the appellants opposed. The calls were designed to jam the company telephone switchboards, and some of them were threatening and intimidating.

==The law reviewed==
In ''R v Goldstein and Rimmington'' (2005) UKHL 63 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/UKHL_2005_63.html Rimmington, R v (2005) UKHL 63 (21 July 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; two separate appeal cases were considered together. The Lords began their judgment with a detailed review of the law and its history. Two arguments were raised by the defence. The first was that most of the factual situations that might otherwise have been criminal public nuisances, had now been covered by statutes. Thus, for example, s1 [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]] would now be used in cases involving multiple telephone calls, and s63 [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] confers powers on the police to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave "at which amplified music is played during the night (with or without intermissions) and is such as, by reason of its loudness and duration and the time at which it is played, is likely to cause serious distress to the inhabitants of the locality". These statutes had, in effect, made the common law offence redundant and it should no longer be considered an offence in English law. The Lords agreed that, as a matter of practice, all alleged offences falling within the remit of statutes would now be charged under those statutes. It also accepted that this left only a very small scope for the application of the common law offence. But, just as the courts had no power to create new offences (''R v Withers''), and could not widen existing offences so as to retrospectively criminalise conduct (''R v Misra and Srivastava'' (2004) EWCA Crim 2375), it equally had no power to abolish existing offences. However, cases such as ''R v Norbury'' and ''R v Johnson (Anthony)'' would now be charged under the relevant statutes.

The second argument raised by the defence was that the law lacked the certainty to be valid under Article 7 [[European Convention on Human Rights]].
:"No punishment without law
::(1)  No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed."
Of all the common law offences considered at Strasbourg, only the criterion of "''contra bonos mores''" had been held to lack the appropriate quality of certainty (see ''Hashman and Harrup v United Kingdom'' (1999) 30 EHRR 241). The Lords therefore held that, as defined in Archbold, the offence did have sufficient certainty so that any legal practitioner asked to advise on whether proposed conduct was likely to be criminal, would be able to give an accurate answer.

===Goldstein's appeal===
As a cultural reference, Goldstein sent an envelope to a friend of his containing a small quantity of salt. Some of this salt escaped from the envelope at a postal sorting office, which was closed as a precaution so that tests could be carried out to determine whether the material spilt was dangerous. The Lords accepted that a significant number of people were disadvantaged by the closure of the sorting office and the loss of delivery on that day, but held that the appellant did not have the appropriate ''mens rea'' because he did not know or reasonably should have known (because the means of knowledge were available to him) that the salt would escape in the sorting office or in the course of postal delivery.

==In popular culture==
In the [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', [[Groucho Marx]] plays the president of the mythical land of Freedonia. One day while in his office, he hears a noisy peanut vendor ([[Chico Marx]]) out in the street. "Do you want to be a public nuisance?" Groucho asks. "Sure," Chico replies, "how much does the job pay?"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24208">'''Public participation''' ('''citizen participation''') is a political principle or practice, and may also be recognised as a right. The terms public participation, often called P2 by practitioners, is sometimes used interchangeably with the concept or practice of [[stakeholder engagement]] and/or popular participation.

Generally public participation seeks and facilitates the involvement of those potentially affected by or interested in a decision. This can be in relation to individuals, governments, institutions, companies or any other entities that affect public interests.  The principle of public participation holds that those who are affected by a decision have a right to be involved in the decision-making process. Public participation implies that the public's contribution will influence the decision.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iap2.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=4 |title=IAP2 Core Values for the Practice of Public Participation |publisher=Iap2.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co-intelligence.org/CIPol_publicparticipation.html |title=Principles of Public Participation |publisher=Co-intelligence.org |date=2008-05-23 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public participation may be regarded as a way of [[empowerment]] and as vital part of democratic governance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In the context of [[knowledge management]] the establishment of ongoing '''participatory processes''' is seen by some in the facilitator of [[collective intelligence]] and inclusiveness, shaped by the desire for the participation of the whole community or society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Public participation is part of "people centred" or "human centric" principles, which have emerged in [[Western world|Western]] culture over the last thirty
years, and has had some bearings of [[education]], [[business]], [[public policy]] and international relief and development programs. Public participation is advanced by the [[humanism|humanist]] movements. Public participation may be advanced as part of a "people first" paradigm shift. In this respect public participation may challenge the concept that "big is better" and the logic of centralized
hierarchies, advancing alternative concepts of "more heads are better than one" and arguing that public participation can sustain productive and durable change.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/pubs/ptdv1000.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711143102/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/pubs/ptdv1000.pdf |date=July 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of public participation in economic and human development was enshrined in the 1990 [[African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and Transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africaaction.org/african-initiatives/chartall.htm African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and Transformation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502170947/http://www.africaaction.org/african-initiatives/chartall.htm |date=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 practitioners established the International Association for Public Practitioners in order to respond to the increasing interest in the practice, and in turn established the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Association for Public Participation|url = http://www.iap2.org/|website = www.iap2.org|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is well established globally and the International Association of Public Participation now has affiliate organizations across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Association for Public Participation - Affiliates|url = http://www.iap2.org/?page=Affiliates|website = www.iap2.org|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Budgeting ===
{{Main|Participatory budgeting}}

Participatory budgeting is a process of democratic deliberation and decision-making, in which ordinary city residents decide how to allocate part of a municipal or public budget. Participatory budgeting is usually characterized by several basic design features: identification of spending priorities by community members, election of budget delegates to represent different communities, facilitation and technical assistance by public employees, local and higher level assemblies to deliberate and vote on spending priorities, and the implementation of local direct-impact community projects.
Participatory budgeting may be used by towns and cities around the world, and has been widely publicised in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]], were the first full participatory budgeting process was developed starting in 1989.

=== Development ===
{{Main|Participatory development|Participatory planning|Participatory rural appraisal}}

In economic development theory, there is a school of [[participatory development]]. The desire to increase public participation in humanitarian aid and development has led to the establishment of a numerous context-specific, formal methodologies, matrices, pedagogies and ad hoc approaches. These include conscientization and praxis; [[Participatory action research]] (PAR), [[Participatory rural appraisal|rapid rural appraisal]] (RRA) and participatory rural appraisal (PRA); [[appreciation influence control analysis]] (AIC); "open space" approaches; [[Objectives Oriented Project Planning]] (ZOPP); [[vulnerability analysis]] and [[capacity analysis]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

=== Public policy ===
{{See also|Participatory democracy}}

In some countries public participation has become a central principle of [[public policy]] making. In the UK it has been observed that all levels of [[government]] have started to build [[citizen]] and [[stakeholder engagement]] into their policy-making processes. This may involve large-scale [[Public consultation|consultation]]s, [[focus group]] research, online discussion forums, or deliberative citizens' juries. There are many different public participation mechanisms, although these often share common features (for a list over 100, and a typology of mechanisms, see Rowe and Frewer, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, G. and Frewer, L.J. (2005) A typology of public engagement mechanisms, Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, 30 (2), 251-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public participation is viewed as a tool, intended to inform planning, organising or funding of activities. Public participation may also be used to measure attainable objectives, evaluate impact, and identify lessons for future practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.involve.org.uk/evaluation/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927001316/http://www.involve.org.uk/evaluation/ |date=September 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States public participation in administrative rulemaking refers to the process by which proposed rules are subject to public comment for a specified period of time. Public participation is typically mandatory for rules promulgated by executive agencies of the US government.  Statutes or agency policies may mandate [[public hearing]]s during this period.&lt;ref name="Ali Assari"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Assari|first=Ali|author2=T.M.

== Public trust ==
In recent years loss of [[public trust]] in authorities and politicians  has become a widespread concern in many democratic societies. Public participation is a regarded as one potential solution to the crisis in public trust and governance, particularly in the UK, Europe, and other democracies. The idea is that public should be involved more fully in the policy process in that authorities seek public views and participation, instead of treating the public as simply passive recipients of policy decisions.

The underlying assumption by political theorists, social commentators, and even politicians is that public participation increase public trust in authorities, improving citizen political efficacy, enhancing democratic ideals and even improving the quality of policy decisions. However, the assumed benefits of public participation in restoring public trust are yet to be confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, G. and Frewer, L.J. (2000) Public participation methods: A framework for evaluation, Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, 25 (1), 3-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, G. and Gammack, J.G. (2004) Promise and perils of electronic public engagement, Science and Public Policy, 31 (1), 39-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifr.ac.uk/Science/Partnership/RCS/public_perception.html |title=Public participation (science in society) |publisher=Ifr.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accountability and transparency==
{{main|Radical transparency}}
Public participation may also be viewed as accountability enhancing. The argument being that public participation can be a means for the participating communities to hold public authorities accountable for implementation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Nazrul Islam, Nazrul Isable Martinez and Wang Xi, "Environmental Law in Developing Countries: Selected Issues, IUCN, 2002, pg.7&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom citizens are used to ensure the fair and humane detention of prisoners. Volunteers comprise the [[Independent Monitoring Board]] that reports on the fair and humane detention of prisoners and detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roffee|first=James A.|date=2017-01-01|title=Accountability and Oversight of State Functions: Use of Volunteers to Monitor Equality and Diversity in Prisons in England and Wales|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2158244017690792|journal=SAGE Open|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2158244017690792|doi=10.1177/2158244017690792|issn=2158-2440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environment and sustainable development ==
In recent years public participation has become to be seen as a vital part of addressing environmental problems and bringing about [[sustainable development]]. In this context the limits of solely relying on technocratic bureaucratic monopoly of decision making, and it is argued that public participation allows governments to adopt policies and enact laws that are relevant to communities and take into account their needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Public participation is recognised as an environmental principle, see [[Environmental Principles and Policies]], and has been enshrined in the [[Rio Declaration]].

=== Public participation in environmental governance ===
With growing complexities of the environmental issues, public participation has come to the fore in academic analysis concerning the contemporary debates about [[environmental governance]].

There have emerged a number of arguments in favour of a more participatory approach, which stress that public participation is a crucial element in environmental governance that contributes to better [[Decision-making|decision making]]. It is recognised that environmental problems cannot be solved by government alone.&lt;ref&gt;Pring, G. and Noé, S.Y. (2002) 'The Emerging International Law of Public Participation Affecting Global Mining, Energy, and Resource Development' in Zillman, D.M., Lucas, A. and Pring, G.(eds) ''Human Rights in Natural Resource Development: Public Participation in the Sustainable Development of Mining and Energy Resources'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, P 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in environmental decision-making effectively links the public to environmental governance. By involving the public, who are at the root of both causes and solutions of environmental problems, in environmental discussions, transparency and accountability are more likely to be achieved, thus secures the democratic legitimacy of decision-making that good environmental governance depends on.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Bulkeley, H. and Mol, A.P.J. (2003), 'Participation and Environmental Governance: Consensus, Ambivalence and Debate', ''Environmental Values'' '''12''' (2): 143–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20080721-149784/Public-participation-in-Environmental-Governance |title=Ramos, G. Public participation in Environmental Governance |publisher=Globalnation.inquirer.net |date=2008-07-21 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, a strong public participation in environmental governance could increase the commitment among stockholders, which strengthens the compliance and enforcement of environmental laws. GIS can provide a valuable tool for such work (see [[GIS and environmental governance]]). In addition, some opponents argue that the right to participate in environmental decision-making is a procedural right that "can be seen as part of the fundamental right to environmental protection".&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Du Plessis, A. (2008), 'Public Participation, Good Environmental Governance and Fulfillment of Environmental Rights', ''Potchefstroom Electronic Law Journal'', '''11'''(2): 170-201.(4)&lt;/ref&gt; From this ethical perspective, environmental governance is expected to operate within a framework coinciding the "constitutional principle of fairness (inclusive of equality)", which inevitably requires the fulfillment of "environmental rights" and ultimately calls for the engagement of public.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; Further, in the context of considerable scientific uncertainties surrounding environmental issues, public participation helps to counter such uncertainties and bridges the gap between scientifically-defined environmental problems and the experiences and values of stakeholders.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, F. (2000) ''Citizens, Experts and the Environment'', Durham, NC: Duke University Press, p.222.&lt;/ref&gt; Through joint effort of the government and scientists in collaboration with the public, better governance of environment is expected to be achieved by making the most appropriate decision possible.

Although broad agreements exist, the notion of public participation in environmental decision-making has been subject to a sustained critique concerning the real outcome of participatory environmental governance. Critics argue that public participation tends to focus on reaching a consensus between actors who share the same values and seek the same outcomes. However, the uncertain nature of many of the environmental issues would undermine the validity of public participation, given that in many cases the actors come to the table of discussion hold very different perceptions of the problem and solution which are unlikely to be welded into a consensus due to the incommensurability of different positions.&lt;ref&gt;Pellizzoni, L. (2003): 'Uncertainty and Participatory Democracy', ''Environmental Values'' '''12'''(2): 195-224.&lt;/ref&gt; This may run the risk of expert bias, which generates further exclusion as those who are antagonistic to the consensus would be marginalised in the environmental decision-making process, which violates the assumed advantage of participatory approach to produce democratic environmental decisions. This raises the further question of whether consensus should be the measure of a successful outcome of participation.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, S. (2000). 'Engaging the public: information and deliberation in environmental policy', ''Environment and Planning A'', 32: 1141–8.&lt;/ref&gt; As Davies suggests, participative democracy could not guarantee the substantive environmental benefits 'if there are competing views of what the environment should be like and what it is valuable for'.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, A. (2001). 'What silence knows – planning, public participation and environmental values', ''Environmental Values'', 10: 77–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, who should be involved at what points in the process of environmental decision-making and what is the goal of this kind of participation become central to the debates on public participation as a key issue in environmental governance.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

=== Citizen science ===
{{Main|Citizen science}}

Citizen science is a coined term commonly used to describe the participation of non-scientists in scientific research.

Liz Richardson, a Visiting Fellow in the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion (CASE) at the London School of Economics and an editor for the journal Local Government Studies, has long advocated for the greater inclusion of non-professional scientists in policy research. She emphasizes that it is academia's responsibly to facilitate the "democratization of policy research" noting several benefits of having citizens involved in not just the contribution of data, but also the framing and development of research itself (2014). She notes that the biggest disadvantage of citizen science is the reliance on using citizens as only contributing members of the scientific endeavors and pushes for a more community-based participatory research method which would include laypeople in the entirety of the research process while emphasizing the scientific method popularized by citizen science.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Liz. "Engaging the Public in Policy Research: Are Community Researchers the Answer?" Politics and Governance, vol. 2, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2017 article, Colin Chapman and Crona Hodges outline what they believe to be the key to success in applying citizen science to policy development: data which is "suitable, robust, and of a known quality for evidence-based policy making" (2017). They identified several barriers to applying citizen science to policy development including a lack of suitability between the data collected and the policy in question and skepticism regarding the data collected by non-experts.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Colin and Crona Hodges. "Can Citizen Science Seriously Contribute to Policy Development?: A Decision Maker's View." Analyzing the Role of Citizen Science in Modern Research. IGI Global, 2017. 246-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Right to public participation ==
In some jurisdictions the right to public participation is enshrined by law. The right to public participation may also be conceived of as [[human right]], or as manifestation of the right to [[freedom of association]] and [[freedom of assembly]]. As such the [[Netherlands]], Germany, Denmark and Sweden, have public participation and [[freedom of information]] provisions in their legal systems since before the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encora.eu/coastalwiki/Public_participation_legislation |title=Public participation legislation - Coastal Wiki |publisher=Encora.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Democracy]] and public participation are closely connected democratic societies have incorporated public participation rights into their laws for centuries. For example, in the US the right to petition has been part of the first Amendment of the [[US constitution]] since 1791.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; More recently, since the 1970s in New Zealand numerous laws (e.g.: health, local government, environmental management) require government officials to "consult" those affected by a matter and take their views into consideration when making decisions.

Effective public participation depends on the public having accessing to accurate and comprehensive information. Hence laws regarding public participation often deal with the issue of the [[right to know]], access of information and [[freedom of information]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The right to participation may also be advanced in the context of [[Equality of opportunity|equality]] and [[group rights]], meant to ensure equal and full participation of a designated group in society. For example, in the context of disabled people.

===Rio Declaration on Environment and Development===
{{main|Rio Declaration on Environment and Development}}
The [[Rio Declaration]] of 1992 enshrines public participation in its 27 principles. Principle 10 states that "environmental issues are best handled with participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level". The [[Rio Declaration]] continues, drawing a close link between access to [[information]] and public participation: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities, including information on hazardous materials and activities in their communities, and the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. States shall facilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by making information widely available. Effective access to judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=78&amp;ArticleID=1163 |title=Rio Declaration - Rio Declaration on Environment and Development - United Nations Environment Programme |publisher=UNEP |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ===
{{main|Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities}}
The 2006 [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] recognised that "disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others" and that "persons with disabilities continue to face barriers in their participation as equal members of society."

The Convention makes participation of disabled one of its principles, stating "The principles of the present Convention shall be:...Full and effective participation and inclusion in society;", subsequently    enshrining the right of disabled to participate fully and equally in the community, education, all aspect of life (in the context of habilitation and [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]]), political and public life, cultural life, leisure and sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml |title=Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |publisher=Un.org |date=2007-03-30 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24213">In [[sociology]], '''racialization''' or '''ethnicization''' is the process of ascribing [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[Race (human classification)|racial identities]] to a relationship, social practice, or group that did not identify itself as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racialization or ethnicization is often borne out of the interaction of a group with a group that it [[Domination (sociology)|dominates]] and ascribes identity for the purpose of continued domination. While it is often borne out of domination, the racialized and ethnicized group often gradually identifies with and even embraces the ascribed identity and thus becomes a self-ascribed race or ethnicity. These processes have been common across the history of [[imperialism]], [[nationalism]], and racial and ethnic hierarchies.

== History of Racialization ==
Racial categories have historically been used as a way to allow an oppressive figure or group discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gans|first=Herbert J.|title=Racialization and racialization research|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4030486/mod_resource/content/2/Racialization%20and%20racialization%20research.pdf|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=341–352|doi=10.1080/01419870.2017.1238497|via=Routledge, Taylor and Francis Group|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denny|first=Walter Bell|date=Jul-Oct 1983|title=Orientalism in European Art|journal=The Muslim World|volume=73| issue = 3–4|pages=262–277|doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1983.tb03268.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One of the most prominent examples of [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] work in art is a piece by [[Eugène Delacroix]] titled ''[[Women of Algiers|Women of Algiers in their Apartment]].''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/france/articles/the-top-10-orientalist-artworks/|title=An Introduction To 'Orientalist' Art In 10 Famous Works|last=Morfin|first=Marcelina|work=Culture Trip|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a [[harem]] in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fine [[textile]]s, [[hookah]]s, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through [[Orientalism]] led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Many [[North Africa]]n and [[Middle East]]ern countries were colonized by European nations, such as [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], and [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coldwarstudies.com/2013/01/11/history-of-colonization-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa-mena-precursor-to-cold-war-conflict/|title=History of Colonization in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA): Precursor to Cold War Conflict|last=|first=|date=|website=coldwarstudies.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries were not fully independent until the mid-twentieth century, a time in which [[globalization]] began to rise both economically and politically.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With the rise of globalization came an expanding cultural influence and an increase in [[immigration]] to Western nations. New cultures, ethnic groups, and ideals have contributed to the process of racialization which is familiar in modern society. Racialization is a long process, and members of each group are categorized based on their perceived differences relative to those who are considered elite within a society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another major contributor to the process of racialization is the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; News outlets, films, television shows, and other forms of public communication portray racial groups to often reflect [[stereotype]]s which contribute to the public’s opinion of certain cultural groups. These opinions and stereotypes may become institutionalized and racial groups must then encounter the [[Institutionalized Racism|institutionalized racism]] that is a result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dominant groups in a society tend to racialize others because new cultural and racial groups are seen as threatening to their society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These threats instill fear into the dominant members of the society due to the possibility of [[downward mobility]] or perceived loss of [[national security]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While threats can be imagined or real, they are most prominent when there is some other issue in the nation, such as a poorly performing [[economy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The effects of racialization are often more harmful to racial and ethnic groups than the actual racialization itself, a few examples being [[Systemic racism|systemic]] and [[structural racism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further significant research in this area is aiding politicians and policy makers in creating a more equal society that embraces and supports different racial and ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Racialized incorporation ==
The process of racialization can affect newly arriving immigrants as well as their second-generation children in the United States. The concept of racialized incorporation bridges the idea of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] with [[Critical race theory|critical race studies]] in general and the concept of racialization in particular.&lt;ref name="Chaudhary 318–354"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Racialized Incorporation: The Effects of Race and Generational Status on Self-Employment and Industry-Sector Prestige in the United States|journal = International Migration Review|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 1747-7379|pages = 318–354|volume = 49|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/imre.12087|language = en|first = Ali R.|last = Chaudhary}}&lt;/ref&gt; While immigrants may possess specific ethnic and cultural identities associated with their countries of origin, once they arrive in the U.S., they are incorporated into a society that is largely organized along the lines of race. The racial hierarchy in the United States is pervasive in many aspects of life including housing, education, and employment. The racialized incorporation perspective argues that regardless of the ethnic and cultural differences across immigrant groups, racial identification is the ultimate and primary principle of social organization in the United States. So an immigrant from Sweden and his/her U.S. born second-generation children are likely to be incorporated into the White mainstream, while an immigrant from Ghana and his/her U.S. born second-generation children are likely to be incorporated into the Black community.  Because the lived experiences of Whites and Blacks in U.S. society diverge in most areas of social life, the racialized category that immigrants and their children are incorporated into will largely determine their experiences and opportunities in the United States. The concept of racialized incorporation is relatively new and was recently applied in a study of self-employment in the United States.&lt;ref name="Chaudhary 318–354"/&gt;

==Racialization of religion==
An ongoing scholarly debate covers the racialization of religious communities. Adherents to [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] can be racialized when they are portrayed as possessing certain physical characteristics, despite many individual adherents to those religions not visibly sharing in those characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meer|first=Nasar|date=2013-03-01|title=Racialization and religion: race, culture and difference in the study of antisemitism and Islamophobia|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=36|issue=3|pages=385–398|doi=10.1080/01419870.2013.734392|issn=0141-9870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joshi|first=Khyati Y.|date=2006-09-01|title=The Racialization of Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism in the United States|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|volume=39|issue=3|pages=211–226|doi=10.1080/10665680600790327|issn=1066-5684}}&lt;/ref&gt; This racialization extends to the descendants of the adherents, even though those descendants may often convert away from active observance of the religion of their forebears but also retain the lingering cultural aspects of the religion for familial and community purposes.

The most immediate effect of the racialization of religion is said to be the [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalization]] of such racialization by the descendants of adherents, whereby the descendants of adherents accept and internalize their religiously-influenced familial culture as an ethnoracial distinction and identity. One of the applications of this racialization is [[nationalism]], whereby the created race seeks to assert cultural and [[nation]]al aspirations which are compatible and accommodating to other groups. Another one of the applications of this racialization is [[racism]] and [[discrimination]], whereby those who are racialized are barred from participation in any public or private function of [[society]] due to the negative "attributes" of the race assigned to them.

==Racialization of labor==
The racialization of labor is said to involve the segregation and appointment of workers based on perceived ethnic differences.&lt;ref&gt;Marta Maria Maldonado, {{"'}}It is their nature to do menial labour': the racialization of 'Latino/a workers' by agricultural employers", ''[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]'', vol. 32 no. 6 (July 2009), 1026. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a910770329 Link] (accessed April 14, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; This racialization of labor is said to produce a hierarchical arrangement which limits employee agency and mobility based on their race. The process of racialization is reinforced through presupposed, stereotypical qualities which are imposed upon the racialized person by the racializer.&lt;ref name=Racializationrocess&gt;Marta Maria Maldonado, "Racial Triangulation of Latino/a Workers by Agricultural Employers", ''Human Organization'', Vol. 65 No. 4, Winter 2006, 360. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a910770329 Link] (accessed April 14, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Racialization is then [[Normalization (sociology)|normalized]] by the promotion of "colourblindness" through the use of "soft" language which avoids highlighting ethnic differences.&lt;ref name=Racializationrocess /&gt;

The racialization of labor specially limits [[Labor mobility|labor mobilization]] up the workforce ladder based on race. Dominant racialized labor groups, mainly White/European workers, are generally presented more privileges than subordinate labor groups, mainly Black or Hispanic workers. The subordinate labor groups face the denial of basic citizenship rights, more exploitation, and inferior working conditions. Furthermore, they are less likely to move up in rank within a company or advance to a higher job position.

Members of the dominant race (e.g., whites) benefit from the privileges of whiteness, whether these are material or psychological, and are maintained and reproduced within social systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murga, A. (2011). The Racialization of Day Labor Work in the U.S. Labor Market: Examining the Exploitation of Immigrant Labor. Journal of Labor Research. doi:10.1007/s12122-014-9191-7|title=Examining the U.S. Labor Market Performance of Immigrant Workers in the Presence of Network Effects|url=|journal=Journal of Labor Research|volume=36|pages=9–26|via=|doi=10.1007/s12122-014-9191-7|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, immigrant workers, especially Latino and Black workers, experience poor working conditions in day labor work. Day laborers experience "race" and this has impacted their integration into the [[Labour economics|labor market]].

Furthermore, research by Edna Bonacich, Sabrina Alimahomed Jake B. Wilson, 2008 regarding the effects of race and criminal background on employment indicates that black men need to work more than twice as hard as white men to secure the same job. Being black in America today is about the same as having a felony conviction in terms of one’s chances of finding a job. Specifically, “the combination of minority status and criminal background appears to intensify employers’ negative reactions, leaving few employment prospects for black ex-offenders (200 applications resulted in only 10 callbacks)”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonacich, E., Alimahomed, S., &amp; Wilson, J. B. (2008). The Racialization of Global Labor. American Behavioral Scientist, 52(3), 342-355. doi:10.1177/0002764208323510|title=The Racialization of Global Labor|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=52|issue=3|pages=342–355|via=|doi=10.1177/0002764208323510|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, According to Chetty, Hendren, Kline, and Saez, the effect of [[race segregation]] impacts the labor market, saying “upward income mobility is significantly lower in areas with larger African American Populations”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Race segregation may lead to divergent economic outcomes due to the fact that areas with larger black population tend to be more segregated by income and race and have adverse effects.

Lastly, the decline of [[Labor-unions|labor unions]] has negatively affected racialization of labor. Those who would have benefited from union membership no longer will as labor unions continue to diminish. In Jake Rosenfeld’s article, ''Little Labor: How Union Decline Is Changing the American Landscape'', he describes the people what no longer can benefit from labor unions: “an immigrant employee who once would have been organized, a female African -American worker no longer able to rely on a union wage to reduce pay gaps with her white counterpart, or a less-educated worker lacking the training, resources, and knowledge to participate in politics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rosenfeld, J. (2014). What Unions No Longer Do. doi:10.4159/harvard.9780674726215|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.4159/harvard.9780674726215|title=What Unions No Longer do|year=2014|isbn=9780674726215}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is less upward mobility when unions are not controlling wages and benefits.

== Racialization in Education ==
Racialization in an educational setting is apparent based on the teacher and the background they come from. The teacher’s race along with their views that came along through [[socialization]] growing up can affect the way the students portray themselves in a classroom setting. It also has to do with the amount of people who come from the same background because the majority of a population will dictate which group is being racialized. An example of students being racialized by their teachers and institutions can be seen through the way high schools teach in America today. Schools tend to teach classes that focus on a more Anglo-Saxon point of view without incorporating any diverse classes that would accommodate for the population of students that come from diverse backgrounds like Latinos, African, and Native Americans.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=San Pedro|first=Timothy|date=2016|title=Youth Voices, Public Spaces, and Civic Engagement: Truth, in the End, Is Different From What We Have Been Taught"Re-Centering Indigenous Knowledges in Public Schooling Spaces|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=68–69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Desert View High School in Arizona has a great population of Native American students who wish to learn more about their [[Culture|cultural background]]  and where they came from. However, author Timothy J. San Pedro who wrote “Truth, in the End, Is Different From What We Have Been Taught: Re-Centering Indigenous Knowledges in Public Schooling Spaces” found that the school mainly focuses on the “Americanized” perspective of history that does not tell the whole story on what came to be in the Native American population. For example, San Pedro describes how the Desert View High School has posters of history classes that glorify “explorers” that were really conquerors of people who initially settled in areas that were “discovered” (San Pedro 2016). This idea of limiting the Native American population from learning about themselves forces them to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] to the culture where they are being racialized in an educational setting. They are forced to conform and be put under a racial category among their American teachers and learn things that do not pertain to their culture or [[Identity (social science)|social identity]].

== Racialization and Gender ==
Through the process of racializing [[social group]]s are distinguished and subjected to differential and unequal treatment on the basis of supposedly biological, phenotypic, cultural, and gender characteristics. Racialization can affect anyone in any race. Therefore, racialization and gender can often intersect (Elabor-Idemudia. 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The racialization of gender in the social construction of immigrant women in Canada: A case study of African women in a prairie province. Canadian Woman Studies, 19(3), 38-44|last=Elabor-Idemudia|first=P.|date=1999|website=.lib.umich.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=1999|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as [[racism]] and gender intersect or [[discrimination]] and gender intersect it is easy for racialization to overlap with gender. During racialization, certain racial categories are created and distinctive and stereotypical characteristics are attributed to that specific category. Within these categories, there can also be subcategories of racialization such as Caucasian man or African American women. Often immigrants who migrate to the U.S are affected by racialization if they are not white and fit more into a [[minority group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Mental images and political stories: Tracing the implicit effects of race and gender rhetoric on public opinion (Order No. 3029457).|last=Winter|first=N.J.G|date=2001|website=|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=2001|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, African American women may often be [[stereotype]]d as uneducated, loud, or improper. Through Racialization if a woman of African descent immigrated to the U.S people will attribute those same stereotypes to her because through a racial lens she fits the African American woman category. Therefore, those same stereotypes will be applied to her as well. Racialization combined with gender can also be seen through the actions of the person that is racializing the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/cared/racialization|title=Racialization: Framing and Learning Anti-Racism.|last=Changnon-Greyeyes|first=C.|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such as someone crossing the street so they do not have to walk past men who appear to be African American due to the stereotypes related to African American men.

==Racialization and Incarceration==
Coming to fruition in the 1980s, the United States began to enact extensive legal reforms that worked to create a more punitive society. These reforms include mandatory [[Mandatory sentencing|minimum sentences]], trying juveniles as adults, [[Three-strikes law|three strikes and you’re out laws]], [[Truth in sentencing|truth in sentencing practices]], and many other policies and practices which served to increase our reliance on imprisonment in response to crime. As a result, U.S. society has been pegged with a “[[mass incarceration]]” structure. A recent report has concluded that nearly 1 in 100 U.S. adults are incarcerated and nearly 7.3 million Americans are either in prison or under parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Solomon|title=Prison Spending Outpaces All but Medicaid|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these reforms were intended to apply to all citizens regardless of race, this has not proven to be the reality. Statistically, these punitive reforms have disproportionately impacted African Americans. Specifically, those who are uneducated and/or live in [[low-income]] areas. Some have renamed the emergence of the “mass incarceration” society as rather the emergence of “racialized mass incarceration.” The numbers are much more alarming for African Americans behind bars. Nearly 1 in 15 African Americans are incarcerated and more narrowly 1 in 9 African American Men are incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Justice Fact Sheet|url=http://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/|website=NAACP|publisher=NAACP}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers point to an obvious discrimination towards blacks in the U.S. criminal justice system. 
	
One clear reason for these disproportionate imprisonment rate can be tied to poverty and social structures. In particular, a pronounced weak attachment to [[Employment|labor]] among many [[working-age]] adults in black communities has fostered a common experience of poverty and economic hardship. Ultimately this has served to create social spaces where bonds of family and community begin to fray and fall apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ditton|first1=Paula|title=Truth in Sentencing in State Prisons|journal=U.S. Department of Justice|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of environments have created higher levels of [[juvenile crime]], drug use, and even violent and gang-oriented crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Institute of Medicine and National Research|first1=Council 2001|title=Juvenile Justice|publisher=The National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although white Americans too have a history of living in [[poverty]], the average national rate of family disruption and poverty among blacks is two to four times higher than among whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sampson|first1=Robert|title=Toward a Theory of Race, Crime, and Urban Inequality|journal=Harvard|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, another reason for the United States racialized prison system can be seen with the war on drugs. Despite similar rates of drug use among blacks and whites, blacks make up 50% of those incarcerated for drug use compared to only 26% of whites. 
	
While the two examples above point to definite explanations for the United States racialized prison system, ultimately the most salient explanation for disproportionate imprisonment rates is public opinion and [[prejudice]]. Social stereotypes and stigmas have created assumptions about African Americans that make them more susceptible to arrest and imprisonment. These latter factors are often influenced by society’s outlook on the prison system. Most educated, middle to upper-class individuals, are in favor of things such as the [[death penalty]], minimum sentences, and trying juveniles as adults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bobo|first1=Lawrence|title=Unfair by Design: The War on Drugs, Race, and the Legitimacy of the Criminal Justice System|journal=Brown|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined with social stigmas make blacks unfairly disadvantaged in the realm of [[criminal justice]]. For example, in recent times, these effects can be seen in an increase in [[police brutality]] towards minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wines|first1=Sarah|title=Police Killings Rise Slightly, Though Increased Focus May Suggest Otherwise|website=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistically, it is 2.5 times more likely for blacks to be killed than whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowery|first1=Wesley|title=More Whites killed by police, but blacks 2.5 times more likely to be killed|website=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iceberg.svg|thumb|20% is above the surface ('''content aspect''') and 80% is underneath the surface ('''relation aspect''').]]

In [[psychology]] and [[sociology]], '''relationship aspect''' refers to the quality of interpersonal cooperation in terms of [[intuition|intuitive]], [[affect (psychology)|emotional]] and social inner relatedness, which makes people feel connected outside of the content aspect.

Openness, honesty, reliability, [[emotional intelligence]] and other [[Key Skills Qualification|key skills]] are required to develop and deepen a good relationship.

== Relevance ==
In order for [[communication]] processes within familiar or business relationships and especially inside of [[Love|romantic]] relationships to succeed, the quality of the relationship aspect is of prime importance. According to [[Sigmund Freud]], trust, empathy, and shared values, along with preconceptions or fears and wishes, determine the success of interpersonal communication by more than 80 percent.

The iceberg model states that the relationship aspect has a much greater impact on communication than the content level, but also that it often works subconsciously.

=== Social context ===
[[Social skills|Social competence]] generally refers to skills needed for social behavior. The term “social” can be understood within the field of social-psychology as “interpersonal”, sociological-value-neutral (as in “societal”) or as sociological-judgemental (as in “social-moral”). It describes the different dimensions of interpersonal relationships. Which interpersonal relationships and mismeetings (Martin Buber) will unfold, which conflicts may develop, and which of the existing conflicts can possibly be solved? Courage, the ability to overcome something, and risk are fundamental traits in developing social skills and stable relationships. Their quality can generally be measured on the basis of the [[social status|status]], [[power (social and political)|power]] and influence within a [[social structure]] as well as the [[physical attractiveness|choice of partner]].

The ability to develop stable relationships is strongly based on the following features:

* [[Team|Teamwork]]
* [[Knowledge of human nature]]
* [[Empathy]] (compassion)
* [[Communication]] skills
* [[Criticism|Critical faculties]]
* [[Self-confidence]]
* [[Cooperation]]
* [[Perception]]

=== Economic context ===
The economic importance of the relationship aspect between employees and colleagues, or customers, or suppliers, becomes clear during [[business administration|business]] exchange processes, particularly within teams and in the sales area. Since [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] is an essential factor for the disposition to engage in [[money|monetary]] exchange processes, considerable efforts are made in this area to secure a defined relationship aspect, with the help of electronic records (see: [[customer relationship management|CRM]]).

The relationship aspect is of particular importance in the economic context for [[multi-level marketing|marketing]]. The economic importance of personal relationships is in no other [[distribution (marketing)|sales area]] of [[marketing]] as important as it is here. Consequently, the success of networking depends very much on the number of people one knows and their level of trust. Naturally, these are first and foremost close relatives and good friends. These people are seen as potential customers and future independent employees. Visits to these people are primarily for the purpose of selling products and recruiting them to the business. In this context, aspects of [[business ethics]] also play a direct role.

The efforts to establish a mutually beneficial business relationship on the basis of a "good relationship aspect" are represented by various concepts in the spirit of the [[win-win strategy]]. The "[[getting to yes]]" theory, in particular, aims to make the relationship between the two parties as good as possible and the dispute as clear as necessary (principle: "Separate the people from the problem").

=== Rhetorical context ===
Within the argumentation, the relationship to the use of the relationship aspect is based on emotional arguments which are supported by preconceptions, personal references, experience and the credibility of the speaker. The logically valid deductive reasoning on the other hand completely excludes the relationship aspect between speaker and audience. Since [[Plato]], [[dialectics]] has established itself as a school of argumentation. Dialectics aims to promote an inner understanding and willingness to compromise, comprising three stages of development: a thesis, an antithesis and a synthesis.

== Conflict resolution ==
Another method for solving interpersonal conflicts in the relationship aspect has been successfully established with [[systemic therapy]] or systemic [[organisational development]]. All persons and institutions involved with their needs and expectations, as well as the interactions with each other, are considered neutral. In this way, it is usually possible to clarify the relationship disturbances beyond the [[pure reasoning]] approach.

Another form of conflict resolution for a disturbed relationship aspect is [[mediation]]. This person mediates between parties in order to find a pragmatic solution, usually a compromise. In contrast to more therapeutically oriented systemic work, mediation is more frequently encountered in business.

From the theoretical background of [[psychoanalysis]], [[Gestalt therapy]] and [[humanistic psychology]], a third concept has been established, called [[theme-centered interaction]], which was developed by the educator and psychoanalyst [[Ruth Cohn]] to improve relationships within groups. The aim of TCI is to open up better possibilities of communication through understanding interrelationships and through emotional experience. The result is an interaction model that treats the person, the group and the task as a model unit, where each is equally important and where the context of communication is always taken into consideration.

== Representation ==
The [[genogram]] has been established as an instrument for the graphical representation of a bipolar or polypolar relationship aspect. Dependencies and informal structures that would be hardly recognizable on the surface can be visualized more easily with the help of graphical relationship lines between the participants. The mediator, the systemic organizational developer, or the [[therapist]] uses this image to reduce tension and previously hidden conflicts.

'''Religious views on smoking''' vary widely.  [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] have traditionally used [[tobacco]] for religious purposes, while Abrahamic and other religions have only been introduced to the practice in recent times due to the [[European colonization of the Americas]] in the 16th century.

==Abrahamic religions==
With the exception of a few [[Christian denomination]]s, the [[Abrahamic religions]] originated before tobacco smoking was introduced to Europe from the New World. Therefore, these religions do not address it in their foundational teachings; however, modern practitioners have offered interpretations of their faith with regard to smoking.

===Christianity===
{{see also|Tobacco control#Early history of tobacco control}}
[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was known to enjoy smoking a pipe, and wrote poetry on how doing so enhanced his relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1725). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516212245/http://waeshael.home.att.net/edifying.htm Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, smoking was considered as inappropriate by certain [[Christian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Thompson |editor-first=Kenneth |date=2013 |chapter=7.

Judy's ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext01/jmjdy10.txt Questionable Amusements and Worthy Substitutes]'', a book featuring anti-smoking dialogue which was published in 1904 by the Western [[Methodist]] Book of Concern.

Though there is no official [[canon law|canonical]] prohibition regarding the use of tobacco, the more traditional among the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es forbid their [[clergy]] or [[monasticism|monastics]] to smoke, and the [[laity]] are strongly encouraged to give up this habit, if they are subject to it. One who smokes is considered to be polluting the "Temple of the Holy Spirit" (i.e., the body), which has been sanctified by the reception of the [[Sacred Mysteries]] (Sacraments). (The view of the body being the "temple of the Holy Spirit" is also common in Protestant circles, and is quoted as a basis against not only tobacco use, but recreational drugs, eating disorders, sexual immorality, and other vices which can be harmful to the body. The Bible reference is I Corinthians 6:7-20.) In Orthodox cultures, various derogatory terms have developed to describe smoking, such as "[[incense]] of Satan". Father Alexander Lebedeff described the Orthodox approach as follows:
{{blockquote|You ask, "Are there canons that speak to the issues of … tobacco?" I would ask you, where are the Canons that forbid use of marijuana or snorting cocaine or downloading pornography from the Internet? Obviously, there are none. Does this mean that your innate Orthodox common sense should not be enough to guide you to recognize what is healthy and what is not? The Canons should not be considered a compendium of answers to all possible questions. God gave us a mind and a conscience and we should use them to determine what is right and what is wrong, whether or not the particular yes issue has been addressed in the canons or not.&lt;br /&gt;Smoking tobacco is a disgusting, filthy, addictive habit that turns the mouth of the smoker into an ashtray. It not only poisons the body of the smoker but pollutes the air that others around the smoker breathe. It is absolutely incompatible with the dignity of the Orthodox Priesthood, diaconate, or monastic state, whether the Canons specifically address it or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] does not condemn smoking, but considers excessive smoking to be sinful, as described in the Catechism (CCC 2290):
{{blockquote|The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of excess: the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco, or medicine.}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have not permitted any active members to smoke since 1973,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2000647 "Life Story: Jehovah Always Rewards His Loyal Ones", ''The Watchtower'', September 1, 2000, page 26.] The footnote reads: "The Watchtower of June 1, 1973, explained why from that time forward, an individual would need to quit smoking before he could be baptized and become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses."&lt;/ref&gt; and their literature has warned about physical and spiritual dangers of smoking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102000202 "Why Quit Smoking?", ''Awake!'', March 22, 2000, pages 4-7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] also requires its members to abstain from tobacco use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Joseph Smith]], recorded that on February 27, 1833 he received a [[revelation]] which addressed tobacco use. It is commonly known as the [[Word of Wisdom]], found in section 89 of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and prohibits the smoking or chewing of tobacco. ({{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89}}) While initially viewed as a guideline, this was eventually accepted as a commandment by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. The Word of Wisdom is also practiced to various degrees by other [[Latter Day Saint denominations]].

===Islam===
{{see also|Tobacco fatwa}}
The first [[fatwa]]s discouraging the use of tobacco dates from 1602.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|title=How tobacco firms try to undermine Muslim countries' smoking ban|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/04/21/84683.php|accessdate=5 February 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Observer (Bangladesh)|The Daily Observer]]|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, [[tobacco fatwa]]s (Islamic legal pronouncements) have been issued due to health concerns.

The holy book of [[Islam]], the [[Qur'ān]], does not specifically prohibit or denounce smoking, but gives behavioral guidance:

* “Don't throw yourself into danger by your own hands...” (el-Bakara 2/195)
* “You may eat, drink, but not waste” (el-A‘râf 7/31)

In practice, at least one recent survey (Abbottabad, [[Pakistan]]) found that observant Muslims tend to avoid smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hameed|first1=A|last2=Jalil|first2=MA|last3=Noreen|first3=R|last4=Mughal|first4=I|last5=Rauf|first5=S|title=Role of Islam in prevention of smoking.|journal=Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad|date=2002|volume=14|issue=1|pages=23-5|pmid=12043328|url=http://www.ayubmed.edu.pk/JAMC/PAST/14-1/Hameed.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of young Muslim Arab-Americans found that Islamic influences were correlated with some diminished smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Islam|first1=SM|last2=Johnson|first2=CA|title=Correlates of smoking behavior among Muslim Arab-American adolescents.|journal=Ethnicity &amp; Health|date=November 2003|volume=8|issue=4|pages=319-37|doi=10.1080/13557850310001631722|pmid=14660124|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a714038251~db=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, an Egyptian study found that knowledge of an anti-smoking [[fatwa]] did not reduce smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radwan |first1=GN |last2=Israel |first2=E |last3=El-Setouhy |first3=M |last4=Abdel-Aziz |first4=F |last5=Mikhail |first5=N |last6=Mohamed |first6=MK |title=Impact of religious rulings (Fatwa) on smoking. |journal=Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology |date=December 2003 |volume=33 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=1087-101 |pmid=15119472 |url=http://www.nosmokingegypt.com/FATWA.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041012204303/http://www.nosmokingegypt.com/FATWA.pdf |archivedate=2004-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the prevalence of smoking is increasing in Islamic countries.

The prominent scholar [[Yusuf al Qaradawi]] argues that smoking is no longer an issue of dispute among Islamic scholars due to the knowledge of health risks.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reported juristic disagreement among Muslim scholars on the ruling concerning smoking, since its appearance and spread, is not usually based on differences between legal proofs, but on the difference in the verification of the cause on which the ruling is based. They all agree that whatever is proved to be harmful to the body and mind is prohibited, yet they differ whether this ruling applies to smoking. Some of them claimed that smoking has some benefits, others assured that it had few disadvantages compared to its benefits, whereas a third group maintained that it had neither benefits nor bad effects. This means that if scholars had been certain about the harmfulness of smoking, then they would undoubtedly have considered it prohibited.[…]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Second: Our inclination to consider smoking prohibited does not mean that it is as grave as major sins like adultery, drinking alcohol or theft. In fact, prohibited matters in Islam are relative; some of them are minor prohibitions whereas others are major, and each has its own ruling. The major sins, for example, have no expiation other than sincere repentance. However, the minor sins can be expiated by the Five Prayers, the [[Friday Prayer]], the Fasting of [[Ramadan]], the Night Vigil Prayer in Ramadan, and other acts of worship. They can also be expiated by avoiding the major sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503548726 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213192447/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503548726 |title=Is the Ruling on Smoking Still Controversial? - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |archivedate=13 February 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All contemporary rulings tend to condemn smoking as potentially harmful or prohibit ([[haraam|haram]]) smoking outright as a cause of severe health damage. [[Arab Muslims]] tend to prohibit smoking (despite [[Saudi Arabia]] ranking 23rd in the world for the percentage of its population that smokes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanbedu.com/2009/10/09/saudi-arabia-don%E2%80%99t-keep-us-from-smoking/|title=Saudi Arabia:  Don’t Keep Us From Smoking|work=American Bedu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in South Asia, smoking tends to be considered lawful but discouraged:&lt;ref name="Ghouri et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghouri|first1=N|last2=Atcha|first2=M|last3=Sheikh|first3=A|title=Influence of Islam on smoking among Muslims.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=4 February 2006|volume=332|issue=7536|pages=291-4|doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7536.291|pmid=16455732|pmc=1360407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In many parts of the Arabic speaking world, the legal status of smoking has further changed during recent years, and numerous religious edicts or fatawa, including from notable authorities such as [[Al-Azhar University]] in Egypt, now declare smoking to be prohibited. The reasons cited in support of the reclassification of smoking as prohibited include Islamic law's general prohibition of all actions that result in harm. For example, the Qur’an says, "And spend of your substance in the cause of God, and make not your own hands contribute to your own destruction (2; 195)." Additionally, jurists rely on the exhortations in the Qur’an not to waste money. Greater appreciation of the risks associated with [[passive smoking]], has also led recent jurists to cite the obligation to avoid causing willful annoyance, distress, or harm to other people.&lt;ref name="Ghouri et al. 2006"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
====Backlash====
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, tobacco companies including [[British American Tobacco]] and [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]] were involved in campaigns to undermine fatwas against smoking in [[Muslim majority countries]] by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a {{"'}}fundamentalist'? who wishes to return to [[Shariah|sharia law]]", and be "a threat to existing government".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boseley |first1=Sarah |title=How tobacco firms tried to undermine Muslim countries' smoking ban |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/20/tobacco-firms-tried-undermine-muslim-countries-smoking-ban|accessdate=5 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[tobacco industry]] was also concerned that the [[World Health Organization]]'s encouraging of anti-smoking stance of [[Ulama|Muslim scholars]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 1985 report from tobacco firm Philip Morris squarely blamed the WHO: "This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO ... The WHO has not only joined forces with Muslim fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Judaism===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Chofetzchaim1.jpg|thumb|The Jewish leader Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan, an anti-smoking advocate.]] --&gt;
{{main article|Jewish law and history on smoking}}

Early on in the Hasidic movement, the [[Baal Shem Tov]] taught that smoking tobacco can be used as a religious devotion, and can even help bring the Messianic Era.  Rabbi [[Levi Yitchak of Berditchev]] is quoted as saying that "a Jew smokes on the weekdays and sniffs tobacco on the Sabbath".  Rabbi [[Dovid of Lelov]] taught that it is a good religious practice to smoke on Saturday nights after the Sabbath, and this practice is followed by the Rebbes of [[Lelov (Hasidic dynasty)|Lelov]] and [[Skulen (Hasidic dynasty)|Skulen]], however the current Rebbe of Skulen discourages people from following his example, in light of current views opposing smoking, and he himself only takes a few brief puffs of a cigarette after [[Havdalah]].  Many Hasidic Jews smoke, and many who do not smoke regularly will smoke on the holiday of [[Purim]], even if they do not do so any other time of the year, and some consider it to be a spiritual practice, similar to the smoke of the altar in the ancient Temple.  However, in recent years, many Hasidic Rabbis have come out against smoking, as have rabbis of other movements.

Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (1838–1933) was one of the first [[Judaism|Jewish]] authorities to speak out on smoking. He considered it a health risk and a waste of time, and had little patience for those who claimed addiction, stating that they never should have started smoking in the first place (''Likutei Amarim'' 13, ''Zechor le-Miriam'' 23).

A shift toward health-oriented concerns may be observed in different rabbinic interpretations of Jewish law (''[[halakha]]''). For instance, at a time when the link between smoking and health was still in doubt, Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] issued an influential opinion in 1963 stating that smoking was permitted, although still inadvisable. (''Igrot Moshe'' Y.D. II:49)

More recently, rabbinic [[responsa]] tend to argue that smoking is prohibited as self-endangerment under Jewish law and that smoking in indoor spaces should be restricted as a type of damage to others.  The self-endangerment rule is grounded partly on a Biblical verse that is read as an injunction to watch one's health - "ונשמרתם מאד, לנפשתיכם"  [Vi'nish'martem Me'od Li'naf'sho'tey'chem] {{bibleverse|Deut.||04:15|HE}} "And you shall watch yourselves very well..." Similarly, rabbinic rules against damaging others are traced back to Biblical and [[Talmud]]ic laws.

Famous Ashkenazi [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] rabbis have called on people not to smoke and called smoking an 'evil habit.' These rabbis include Rabbi [[Yosef Sholom Eliashiv]], Rabbi [[Aharon Leib Shteinman]], Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Shapiro]], Rabbi [[Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz]], Rabbi [[Nissim Karelitz]], and Rabbi [[Shmuel Auerbach]]. Rabbi [[Shmuel Wosner|Shmuel HaLevi Wosner]] forbade people from starting to smoke and said that those who smoke should stop doing so. All of these rabbis also said that it is forbidden to smoke in a public place, where others might be bothered by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704132739/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking2.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704223348/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/vayakhel/VLasmoking.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704131007/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/vayakhel/VLasmoking.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among important Sephardi Haredi rabbis, Rabbi [[Ben Tzion Abba Shaul]] and Rabbi [[Moshe Tzedaka]] called on youth not to start smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5762/korach/KR62osmoking.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907195654/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5762/korach/KR62osmoking.htm |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major Ashkenazi rabbis who explicitly forbade smoking include Rabbi [[Eliezer Waldenberg]], Rabbi [[Moshe Stern]], and Rabbi [[Chaim Pinchas Sheinberg]].

==Hinduism==

While not explicitly prohibited in Hinduism, tobacco use is seen as a kind of intoxication, and as such should not be done in public. Vaishnavas of ISKCON, founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, are prohibited from using tobacco.

Communal smoking of a sacred pipe is a religious ceremony in a number of Native American cultures, while other tribes are social smokers only, if they smoke at all. In some cases [[tobacco]] is smoked, in other cases, ''[[kinnikinnick]]'', or a combination of the two.

Naturally grown and harvested tobacco, prepared in the ways traditional to intact [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] ceremonial communities, is very different from commercially-marketed tobacco.&lt;ref name="Sacred"&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Traditional vs. Commercial Tobacco|url=http://keepitsacred.itcmi.org/tobacco-and-tradition/traditional-v-commercial/ |website=Keep It Sacred - National Native Network|accessdate=Oct 9, 2016|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Big Tobacco and Minorities: Native American Statistics |url=

There is a movement among Native peoples, including a resolution by The [[National Congress of American Indians]], to make sure that only naturally-grown tobacco is used in ceremonies,&lt;ref name="Sacred"/&gt; and that social smoking and use of commercial tobacco be avoided or ended altogether.&lt;ref name="Sacred"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vargas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vargas|first1=Yvonne|title= Tobacco use snuffing out dreams of Native communities|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2006/12/20/tobacco-use-snuffing-out-dreams-native-communities-129230/ |publisher= [[Indian Country Today Media Network]] |website= indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com|date=Dec 20, 2006|accessdate=Oct 9, 2016|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pagan faiths==
Tobacco use holds a sacred and/or neutral view in numerous if not all pagan religions and seen in some as liberty and intoxication with the [[Deity|divine]].

==Sikhism==
[[Guru Gobind Singh]] prohibited his [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] from smoking tobacco. He called tobacco "jagat jhoot" ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: "the world's lie").

A legend states that when Guru Gobind Singh Ji was riding his blue horse, Neela, it would not enter a tobacco field and reared up in front of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Guru_Gobind_Singh_and_Tobacco |title=Guru Gobind Singh and Tobacco |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zoroastrianism==

The idea of smoking tobacco has been looked down upon in modern [[Zoroastrian]] communities due to the scientific knowledge of it causing harm to the body. This stance on smoking does not have a direct relation to the texts of the [[Avestas]] and is not stated in the religion, rather the religion teaches to not misuse fire as it is holy. Zoroastrianism teaches to do what is best for the world based on the knowledge a person has on the topic, and indirectly the knowledge of smoking being harmful to the body causes people to condemn the act.

'''"Scientific Integrity in Policymaking: An Investigation into the Bush Administration's Misuse of Science"''' is the title of a report published by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] in February, 2004. The report was the culmination of an investigation of the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s objectivity in [[science]], and ultimately a [[critic]]ism thereof.&lt;ref name="UCS2004"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Integrity in Policy Making (2004)|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/promoting-scientific-integrity/reports-scientific-integrity.html|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (After it was published, the report's existence was fairly well-publicized by the [[United States]]' [[mass media]].)

== "Suppression and distortion of research findings" ==
[[File:Condoleezza_Rice_Colin_Powell_George_W._Bush_Donald_Rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|200px|Rice, Powell, Bush, and Rumsfeld]]
A central thesis of the report, according to the Executive Summary (on page 2 of the text), was that the Bush administration had behaved in ways considered to be consistent with the following three situations.

# Epidemic altering and concealing of scientific [[information]] by senior officials in various federal [[Government agency|agencies]]
# Active censorship of scientific information that the administration considered threatening to its own [[Philosophy|philosophies]]
# Restriction of the ability of government-supported scientists to freely communicate scientific [[idea]]s related to "sensitive" issues

== "An unprecedented pattern of behavior" ==

In "Part III", the text of the report posits that the aforementioned activities are unprecedented in the [[history of the United States]]. The report lists the following persons and organization who had supposedly acted or made statements to support this claim.

''This list is sorted first by category, then by the order in which the persons or organizations are mentioned in the report.''

* Organization
** [[REP America]]
* Persons
** [[William Ruckelshaus|Ruckelshaus, William]]
** [[Russell Train|Train, Russell]]
** [[Wolfgang Panofsky|Panofsky, Dr. Wolfgang H. K.]]
** [[Marvin Leonard Goldberger|Goldberger, Dr. Marvin]]
** [[Margaret Scarlett|Scarlett, Dr. Margaret]]
** [[Donald Kennedy|Kennedy, Donald]]
** [[D. Allan Bromley|Bromley, Dr. D. Allan]]
** [[Lewis M. Branscomb|Branscomb, Professor Lewis M.]]
** [[Lynn Goldman|Goldman, Dr. Lynn]]

== Recommendations by the Union ==

Page 29 of the report states: "This behavior by the administration violates the central premise of the [[scientific method]], and is therefore of particularly grave concern to the scientific community." It then goes on, in a short section titled "Conclusions and Recommendations: What's at Stake" at the end of the report, to provide recommendations for "restoring scientific integrity to federal policymaking" (page 30). These recommendations (on pages 30–31) include a suggestion for the [[President of the United States]] to issue [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]s, and other actions, that would prevent further "abuse"; for the [[United States Congress]] to hold appropriate [[Hearing (law)|hearing]]s, consider the consequences of [[statutory law]] under its influence, increase the amount of publicly available scientific information, and establish an organization to guide Congress in its deliberations in technical matters; for scientists to raise awareness of the aforementioned issues and provide public policy recommendations; for the public to exercise its political influence in a constructive manner.

== Response ==
On April 2, 2004, the [[White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]] issued a statement by [[John Marburger|Dr. John Marburger]], the director of OSTP, that claims the descriptions of the incidents in the UCS report are all "false," "wrong," or "a distortion." He said he was disappointed with the report and dismissed it as "biased."[https://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,62339,00.html].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5570">'''Sex Industry Network''' (also known as '''SIN''') is a peer-based, not for profit organisation, funded by SA Health, a [[South Australia]] government organisation. Its aim is to maintain low rates of [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs), [[Blood-borne disease|blood borne viruses]] (BBVs) and [[HIV]] among [[sex workers]] and their clients in South Australia.

SIN provides safer sex supplies such as [[condoms]] and [[Personal lubricant|lube]] and delivers outreach to brothels, parlours, private and street based sex workers.

==History==
SIN was formed out of the Prostitutes Association of South Australia (PASA), a group formed in 1986 by sex workers.&lt;ref name="SIN Jennings"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jennings|first1=S.|title=Sex Industry Network – best practice sex worker organisation|url=http://pag.aids2014.org/Abstracts.aspx?AID=2116|website=pag.aids2014.prog|publisher=20th International AIDS Conference|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time community groups from priority populations (sex workers, men who have sex with men and injecting drug users) were being funded to deliver HIV prevention information and education within communities as part of Australia’s partnership approach to HIV/AIDS. In 1987, PASA received a grant from the SA Health Commission to conduct a three-month HIV/AIDS education project with sex workers called the ‘Travelling Parlour Show’. Several sex workers received training to become ‘peer educators’ and joined with a nurse from the [[sexually transmitted infection]]s clinic and took their education and information sessions to the workplaces of sex workers across the metropolitan area of [[Adelaide]].

In 1989, PASA and the AIDS council of South Australia (ACSA) joined forces to develop an ongoing HIV/AIDS education project with the sex workers of South Australia.&lt;ref name="Scarlet Alliance SIN"&gt;{{cite web|title=June 2010 "The House of Ill Repute – 21 Years of SIN" Adelaide|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/media/News_Item.2010-05-21.4545 |website=scarletalliance.org.au|publisher=Scarlet Alliance|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project has had several name changes including ‘the PASA project’ and ‘SWIPE’ but has been known as the SA Sex Industry Network or SIN since 1994.&lt;ref name="Same Memory, SA State Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Industry Page 5|url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=670|website=samememory.sa.gov.au|publisher=Government of South Australia State Library|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SIN was a founding member and continues to be an active member of [[Scarlet Alliance]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Prostitution Hope Ditmore"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hope Ditmore|first1=Melissa|title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work, Volume 2|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0313329702|page=431|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-5WyPfynlwMC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=Prostitutes+Association+of+South+Australia+%2B+PASA#v=onepage&amp;q=Prostitutes%20Association%20of%20South%20Australia%20%2B%20PASA&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ACSA became insolvent and SIN was temporarily closed.&lt;ref name="Star Observer Ozturk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ozturk|first1=Serkan|title=SA Govt Forces Closure of AIDS Council|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/sa-govt-forces-closure-of-aids-council/107340|accessdate=12 October 2014|publisher=Star Observer|date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarlet Alliance supported a group of volunteer sex workers in South Australia to keep limited services going while new arrangements were negotiated with the funding bodies. The SA health department agreed to fund  Scarlet Alliance to complete ACSA’s original contract.&lt;ref name=SWOP&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Worker Organisations|url=http://www.swop.org.au/links|website=swop.org.au|publisher=SWOP Sex Workers Outreach Project|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political advocacy==
SIN has supported Labor MP [[Steph Key]]'s attempts to decriminalize prostitution in South Australia. In 2012, the decriminalisation bill was defeated by one vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://au.news.yahoo.com/sa/a/24846631/selling-sex-in-the-city-adelaides-illegal-prostitution-industry/ Selling sex in the city: Adelaide's illegal prostitution industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011002615/https://au.news.yahoo.com/sa/a/24846631/selling-sex-in-the-city-adelaides-illegal-prostitution-industry/ |date=2014-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 2017, an improved bill which had support of sex workers, the working women's centre and unions was introduced into the upper house. The decriminalisation of sex work bill &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/B/CURRENT/STATUTES%20AMENDMENT%20(DECRIMINALISATION%20OF%20SEX%20WORK)%20BILL%202015_HON%20MICHELLE%20LENSINK%20MLC.aspx/ Decriminalisation of Sex Work Bill (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;  passed the upper house 13 votes to 8. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-06/sa-sex-work-decriminalisation-marathon-debate/8682738/ Sex work decriminalisation one step closer in South Australia after marathon debate]&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2017, the lower house was set to debate the bill, however time ran out, resulting in a further delay to any progress.

More recently, the catch-all terms '''GSM''' ("Gender and Sexual Minorities"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Sexual Minority Students (LGBTIQA)|url=http://www.derby.ac.uk/campus/support/gender-and-sexual-minority-students/|publisher=University of Derby|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''GSRM''' ("Gender, Sexual, and Romantic Minorities"), and '''GSD''' ("[[Gender and Sexual Diversity]]")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/02/25/organisation-proposes-replacing-the-limiting-term-lgbt-with-more-inclusive-gsd/ Organisation proposes replacing the 'limiting' term LGBT with 'more inclusive' GSD], February 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; have been proposed.{{efn|See also: [[LGBT#Variants|Variants of the term "LGBT"]].}}

== Origins ==
The term ''sexual minority'' was coined most likely in the late 1960s under the influence of [[Lars Ullerstam]]'s ground breaking book "The Erotic Minorities: A Swedish View" which came strongly in favor of tolerance and empathy to uncommon varieties of sexuality, such as [[paedophilia]] and "sex criminals".&lt;ref name=GSM1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lattimer|first1=Julia|title=GSM acronym better than LGBT alphabet soup|url=http://www.collegiatetimes.com/opinion/gsm-acronym-better-than-lgbt-alphabet-soup/article_f7a325a4-5acd-11e4-bf0d-001a4bcf6878.html|work=Collegiate Times|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used as  analogous to [[ethnic|ethnic minority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeGagne|first1=Alexa|title=Queering the language of 'sexual minorities' in Canada|url=http://www.congress2013.ca/blog/queering-language-sexual-minorities-canada|work=University of Alberta|accessdate=11 June 2015|date=6 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612220449/http://www.congress2013.ca/blog/queering-language-sexual-minorities-canada|archivedate=12 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ullerstam|first1=Lars|title=The Erotic Minorities: A Swedish View|date=1967|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=whGGAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists such as [[Ritch Savin-Williams]] support using the term in order to accurately describe adolescent youths who may not identify as any common culturally-defined [[sexual identity]] label ([[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], ''et cetera'') but who still have attractions towards those of the same [[anatomical sex]] as themselves.&lt;ref name=Savin-Williams1&gt;Savin-Williams, Ritch C. "A critique of research on sexual-minority youths." Journal of adolescence 24.1 (2001): 5-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated health and social issues ==
===Stress===
Social issues may lead to possible health and psychological issues, especially in youth. It has been found that sexual minorities face increased stress due to [[Social stigma|stigma]]s. This stigma-related stress creates elevated coping regulation and social and cognitive processes leading to risk for psychopathology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hatzenbuehler|first=Mark L.|date=2009-09-01|title=How does sexual minority stigma "get under the skin"? A psychological mediation framework.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/135/5/707/|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=English|volume=135|issue=5|pages=707–730|doi=10.1037/a0016441|issn=1939-1455|pmc=2789474|pmid=19702379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risky behavior===
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published their 2015 study of large cohorts of ninth to twelfth grade students across the US. One hundred health behaviors were shown to put LGB students at risk for health consequences. Sexual minority students engage in more risky behaviors when compared with nonsexual minority students. Some students "...had no sexual contact [and] were excluded from analyses on sexual behaviors [including] female students who had sexual contact with only females [and] were excluded from analyses on condom use and birth control use..." Also excluded were "...male students who had sexual contact with only males [and] were excluded from analyses on birth control use.” &lt;ref name = CDC2016/&gt; One small study &lt;!--nonMEDRS--&gt;showed that LGBT adolescents were victimized more often, had higher rates of psychopathology, left home more frequently, used highly addictive substances more frequently, and were more likely to have more [[multiple sex partners]] than heterosexual adolescents.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Development===
Based on studies of adolescents, it is concluded that sexual minorities are similar to heterosexual adolescents in developmental needs and concerns. However, research has suggested that sexual minority youth (more specifically GLBT youth) are more susceptible to psychological and health issues than heterosexual youth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cochran|first=Bryan N.|last2=Stewart|first2=Angela J.|last3=Ginzler|first3=Joshua A.|last4=Cauce|first4=Ana Mari|date=2002-05-01|title=Challenges Faced by Homeless Sexual Minorities: Comparison of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Homeless Adolescents With Their Heterosexual Counterparts|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.92.5.773|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=92|issue=5|pages=773–777|doi=10.2105/AJPH.92.5.773|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1447160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epidemiology===
Sexual minorities tend to use [[alternative and complementary medicine]] alternative methods of addressing their health needs more often than heterosexuals.&lt;ref name = Blume2016&gt;{{cite web | title =Advances in Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Interventions Among Racial, Ethnic, and Sexual Minority Populations | first1 = Arthur W. | last1 = Blume | publisher = Alcohol Research, Current Reviews |date = 2016 | volume = 38 | issue =1 | pages = 47–54 | PMC = 4872612 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4872612/pdf/arcr-38-1-47.pdf | access-date = March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual minority women have a higher incidence of [[asthma]], [[obesity]], [[arthritis]] and [[cardiovascular disease]] than other groups.&lt;ref name="SimoniSmith2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simoni|first1=Jane M.|last2=Smith|first2=Laramie|last3=Oost|first3=Kathryn M.|last4=Lehavot|first4=Keren|last5=Fredriksen-Goldsen|first5=Karen|title=Disparities in Physical Health Conditions Among Lesbian and Bisexual Women: A Systematic Review of Population-Based Studies|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=64|issue=1|year=2016|pages=32–44|issn=0091-8369|doi=10.1080/00918369.2016.1174021|pmc=5063711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolescent sexual minorities report a higher incidence of the following when compared to heterosexual students:

*feelings of not being safe travelling to and from school or in school.
*not going to school because they did not feel safe.
*forced to do sexual things they did not want to do by someone they were dating or going out with one or more times during the 12 months (touching, kissing, or physically forced to have sexual intercourse)
*had sexual intercourse.
*first had sex before age 13.
*had sex with at least four other people.
*not using birth control.

===Discrimination===
When gay, lesbian, and bisexual adults reported being discriminated against, forty-two percent credited it to their [[sexual orientation]]. This discrimination was positively associated with both harmful effects on quality of life and indicators of psychiatric morbidity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mays|first=Vickie M.|last2=Cochran|first2=Susan D.|date=2001-11-01|title=Mental Health Correlates of Perceived Discrimination Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults in the United States|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.91.11.1869|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=91|issue=11|pages=1869–1876|doi=10.2105/AJPH.91.11.1869|issn=0090-0036}}&lt;sup&gt;[16-years old]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--In fact, sexual minority respondents were significantly more likely to have at least one of five psychiatric disorders examined in the research than heterosexual persons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The research on discrimination has built upon prior evidence that discrimination can lead to negative psychological changes. These negative changes are evident in the resulting health issues found in the surveyed adults.--&gt;

== In the media ==
Sexual minorities are generally portrayed in the mass media as being ignored, trivialized, or condemned. The term [[symbolic annihilation]] accounts for their lack of characterization due to not fitting into the white, heterosexual, vanilla type lifestyle. It has been suggested that online media has developed into a space in which sexual minorities may use “social artillery”. This description centers on how social networking and connections to oppose  instances of homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PhD|first=Paul Venzo|last2=PhD|first2=Kristy Hess|date=2013-11-01|title="Honk Against Homophobia": Rethinking Relations Between Media and Sexual Minorities|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2013.824318|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=60|issue=11|pages=1539–1556|doi=10.1080/00918369.2013.824318|issn=0091-8369|pmid=24147586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, some individuals have made their way into the media through television and music. TV shows such as [[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]] and ABC’s [[Modern Family]] star individuals who are open about their non-heterosexual lifestyles. In music, people like [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]] and [[Sia Furler|Sia]] have created songs that express their [[emotion]]s and sexuality with a number of followers. While sexual minorities do have a place in the media, it is often critiqued that they are still limited in their representations. In shows, if a character is gay, they are often a very shallow character that is only present for comic relief or as a plot twist. Compared to a heteronormative counterpart, the sexual minority is often a mere side-kick. However, since the integration of actors, musicians, and characters of sexual minorities, the idea of non-normativity has become more normalized in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tcjournal.org/drupal/vol4/bond|title=GLOing Depictions of Sexual Minorities: The Evolution of Gay- and Lesbian-Oriented Digital Media {{!}} Technoculture|website=tcjournal.org|access-date=2016-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220050024/https://tcjournal.org/drupal/vol4/bond|archive-date=2016-12-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural issues==
Current and past research has been "skewed toward SM men—and is disproportionately focused on HIV and other sexually transmitted infections." Between 1989 and 2011, numerous grants for research were sponsored and funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) but funded research for sexual minorities and health made up 0.1% of all funded studies addressed the health of sexual minorities - especially women. Most research has been directed toward gay and bisexual men. Women sexual minority studies accounted for 13.5%.&lt;ref name="MullerHughes2016"/&gt;

Sexual minorities in South Africa have sexual-orientation-related health inequities when compared to other countries. One of the highest prevalence of sexual violence directed toward women of a sexual minority occurs in South Africa. Women of color who are living in low income urban areas are notably targeted. The perpetrators of sexual violence believe they are correcting the women and their actions will cure them of their homosexuality.&lt;ref name="MullerHughes2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muller|first1=Alexandra|last2=Hughes|first2=Tonda L.|title=Making the invisible visible: a systematic review of sexual minority women’s health in Southern Africa|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=16|issue=1|year=2016|issn=1471-2458|doi=10.1186/s12889-016-2980-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
Some LGBT people object to using the term ''sexual minorities'' and prefer the term LGBT. Reasons for these objections may vary. For example, some LGBT people feel that the term ''sexual minority'' reminds them about discrimination and about being a minority. They want to be not a distinct minority but an integral and respectable part of the society. Some other LGBT people dislike the term for being too inclusive, including [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger]]s, polyamorists, BDSM people and other perceived "sexual strangers". These LGBT people want to make a larger distance between these sexual practices and bisexuality/homosexuality/transgender.

Some [[transgender]] and [[transsexual]] people dislike the term ''sexual minority'' for yet another reason. They argue that the phenomenon of transsexuality or transgender has nothing to do with sex, sexual practices or [[sexual orientation]], but it relates to the [[gender]], gender dysphoria and gender-variant behavior or feelings. Thus, they feel it is incorrect to classify them as "sexual minority", when, in fact, they are [[Gender variance|gender-variant]] minority.

Some [[conservatism|conservative]] groups oppose the use of the term ''sexual minority'' for completely different reasons. They think or feel that the term inherently implies some degree of legalisation or protection for those engaged in such sexual practices, much like ethnic minorities are protected from being discriminated or persecuted in modern democratic countries.

Some people dislike the term because it includes ''minority'', when the fact is that not all these categories are really about minorities but actually about ''minorised'' groups.

Others referred to as "sexual minorities" include [[sexual fetishism|fetishists]] and practitioners in of [[BDSM|BDSM (bondage, dominance, and submission)]], and [[sadism and masochism]].&lt;ref name=Savin-Williams1/&gt; The term may also include [[asexuality|asexuals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Morrison|editor1-first=Todd G.|editor2-last=Morrison|editor2-first=Melanie A.|editor3-last=Carrigan|editor3-first=Mark A.|editor4-last=McDermott|editor4-first=Daragh T.|title=Sexual Minority Research in the New Millennium|date=2012|isbn=978-1-61209-939-2|edition=hardcover, illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=B. A.|title=Prejudice against the asexual community. Violence against asexual women|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/asexual2.htm|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people who may be strictly heterosexual and whose choice of actual sex acts may be [[vanilla sex|vanilla]], but whose choice of partner or partners is atypical, such as [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]] (although this is debated),&lt;ref&gt;Rust, Paula C. [http://mysite.du.edu/~jdonnell/papers/nl_gay_v3.pdf "The politics of sexual identity: Sexual attraction and behavior among lesbian and bisexual women."] ''Social Problems'' 39, no. 4 (1992) p.8 "Sexual minorities are not merely people who engage in "deviant" sexual behavior -- for example,
fetishists of various types -- or even those that adopt "deviant" (sexual) identities (e.g. "swingers")."&lt;/ref&gt; [[polyamory|polyamorists]]&lt;ref name="Nichols, Margaret"&gt;Nichols, Margaret, and M. I. C. H. A. E. L. Shernoff. "Therapy with sexual minorities." ''Principles and practice of sex therapy'' 4 (2000): 353-367.&lt;/ref&gt; or people in other [[Forms of nonmonogamy|nonmonogamous relationship]]s, people who [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|strongly prefer adolescent sex partners]], and are of [[age disparity in sexual relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altair|first1=Octaevius|title=The Violators: No Human Rights for You (Canada)|date=2011|isbn=9781257378012|page=11|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eRrLAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=12 March 2015|quote=The rights of youth must be protected as well as the rights of Atheists and Sexual minorities.

I engage is [''[[sic]]''] recreational sex exclusively with teenagers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or people who engage in [[mixed race relationships]].

Usually, the term ''sexual minority'' is applied only to groups who practice [[Informed consent#Sex|consensual sex]]: for example, it would be unusual to refer to [[rape|rapists]] as a sexual minority, but the term would generally include someone whose sexuality gave a major, fetishized role to consensual playing out of a [[rape fantasy]]. Also, someone who very occasionally incorporates of consensual [[kink (sexual)|kink]]&lt;ref name="Nichols, Margaret"/&gt; or same-sex activity into a largely vanilla, heterosexual sex life would not usually be described as a ''sexual minority''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7927">'''Technoculture''' is a [[neologism]] that is not in standard dictionaries but that has some popularity in academia, popularized by editors Constance Penley and Andrew Ross in a book of essays bearing that title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technoculture|first=Constance|last=Penley|author2=Andrew Ross |year=1991|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=0-8166-1932-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mediamatic.net/8428/en/penley-ross Mediamatic review] Penley, Ross
Constance Penley &amp; Andrew Ross, Technoculture Cultural Politics vol 3, U of Minnesota Press 1991&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the interactions between, and politics of, [[Technology and society|technology and culture]].

== Programs of study ==
"Technoculture" is used by a number of universities to describe subject areas or courses of study. [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]], for instance, has a program of technocultural studies. In 2012, the major merged with Film Studies to form Cinema and Techno-Cultural Studies (CaTS), but in 2013 is being reviewed to become Cinema and Technoculture (see below); the [[University of Western Ontario]] offers a degree in Media, Information and Technoculture (which they refer to as MIT, offering an "MIT BA").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fims.uwo.ca/mit/index.htm Media, Information &amp; Technoculture at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of California, Riverside|UC Riverside]] is in the process of creating a program in technocultural studies beginning with the creation of a graduate certificate program in "Science Fiction and Technoculture Studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UCTV|title=Science Fiction Goes to School!|url=http://myuctv.tv/2012/07/13/science-fiction-goes-to-school/|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its description, the Georgetown University course English/CCT 691&lt;ref&gt;CCT stands for "Communications, Culture and Technology"&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''Technoculture from Frankenstein to Cyberpunk'', covers the "social reception and representation of technology in literature and popular culture from the Romantic era to the present" and includes "all media, including film, TV, and recent video animation and Web 'zines." The course focuses "mainly on American culture and the way in which machines, computers, and the body have been imagined."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/technoculture/technoculture.html |accessdate=June 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217084240/http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/technoculture/technoculture.html |archivedate=February 17, 2006 |title=Technoculture from Frankenstein to Cyberpunk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UC Davis Technocultural Studies department focuses on "transdisciplinary approaches to artistic, cultural and scholarly production in contemporary media and digital arts, community media, and mutual concerns of the arts with the scientific and technological disciplines. In contrast to programs which see technology as the primary driving force, we place questions of poetics, aesthetics, history, politics and the environment at the core of our mission. In other words, we emphasize the 'culture' in Technoculture."

The Technocultural Studies major program is an interdisciplinary integration of current research in cultural history and theory with innovative hands-on production in digital media and "low-tech". It focuses on the fine and performing arts, media arts, community media, literature and cultural studies as they relate to technology and science. Backed by critical perspectives and the latest forms of research and production skills, students enjoy the mobility to explore individual research and expression, project-based collaboration and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/ucdwebcatalog/PDF/GenCat20102012.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111208135815/http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/UCDWebCatalog/PDF/GenCat20102012.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-12-08 |title=UC Davis General Catalogue 2010-2011 2011-2012 |date=July 2002 |accessdate=2011-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technocultural Studies is a fairly new major at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] and is considered a division of Humanities, Arts and Cultural Studies.

*Film Studies and Technocultural Studies majors at UC Davis have merged into Cinema and Technoculture. The faculty have been hard at work on developing this new major, and it is going through the review process.  Declared students will be grandfathered in to the existing programs to complete their major.  They will also have the option of switching to the new major if they choose.  The faculty of UC Davis believes these new additions will improve the program and hope their students take advantage of them.

== Journals  ==

'''Technoculture: An Online Journal of Technology in Society'' ({{ISSN|1938-0526}}) is an independent, interdisciplinary, annual peer-reviewed journal that publishes critical and creative works that explore the ways in which technology impacts society. It uses a broad definition of technology. Founded by Keith Dorwick and Kevin Moberly, it is now edited by Keith Dorwick. ''Technoculture'' is a member of the Council of Editors of Learned Journals and is indexed by EBSCOhost and the Modern Language Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tcjournal.org |title=''Technoculture: An Online Journal of Technology in Society.'' |date=2009–2011 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall McLuhan]] is most known for his concepts of a "[[Global village (term)|global village]]". In his book ''[[Understanding Media]]'' he talks about how media affects society and culture. He also develops a theory about technology being an extension of the body. According to McLuhan, the alphabet is what gave rise to the idea that sight is more important than hearing because in order to communicate one had to be able to see and understand the alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://marshallmcluhan.com/biography/ |title=Marshall Who? |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Technoculture: The Key Concepts'', Debra Benita Shaw "outlines the place of science and technology in today's culture" and "explores the power of scientific ideas, their impact on how we understand the natural world and how successive technological developments have influenced our attitudes to work, art, space, language and the human body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technoculture: The Key Concepts|first=Debra Benita|last=Shaw|year=2008|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-84520-298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clay Shirky]] writes, teaches, and consults on the social and economic effects of the internet, and especially on places where our social and technological networks overlap. He is on the faculty of NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program, and has consulted for Nokia, Procter and Gamble, News Corp., the BBC, the United States Navy and Lego. He is also a regular speaker at technology conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Here Comes Everybody]]|first=Clay|last=Shirky|authorlink=Clay Shirky|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Group|isbn=978-1-59420-153-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" [[Walter Benjamin]] attempts to analyze the changed experience of art in modern society. He believes that a reproduction of art lacks presence in time and space and therefore has no aura. Original works of art do have an aura. An aura includes authority, its place in space and time (when it was made), how the piece's physical condition suffered and how it's changed owners over time. An original work of art derives its authenticity from history and what has happened to it over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|first=Walter|last=Benjamin|year=2010|publisher=Prism Key Press|isbn=1-4537-2248-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tono Maria''' also known as the “[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] of [[South America]]” was another woman, similar to [[Sarah Baartman]]’s case, that was exhibited in the “London shows” or freak shows in the 1800s. Tono Maria, a Botocudo (derived from the Portuguese word, botoque for plug) woman from the South American region (now the Brazilian state of [[Minas Gerais]]) was known for her scars, social codes that signified her sexual transgressions, her full figure and large lip and ear plugs. Tono Maria’s features fascinated the London spectators and further fueled their studies in scientific racism and western superiority.

==Life==
Tono Maria was displayed in a London freak show, and described in an 1822 article called the “Sketches of Society: The Shows of London” as the [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] of South America whose “charms are reputed to have been irresistible in her native land in which she made conquest of no fewer than three chieftains in succession." She is described at the time as being "about forty years of age". &lt;ref name="London Literary Gazette"&gt;Sketches of Society: The Shows of London.” The London Literary Gazettte and Journal of the Belle Lettres, 1822. pg 123. Accessed April 14, 2017. https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435059865105;view=1up;seq=131&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
Author Janell Hobson briefly recounts Tono Maria in her memoir, ''Venus in the Dark'', and describes how the London spectators viewed her nearly 100 scars, each supposedly representing a sexual transgression committed in her own tribe, as a social stigma, a mark of excess sexuality representing how nonwhites were "openly licentious, debauched, and depraved” in comparison with European white women who were considered “pure” and “refined”.&lt;ref name="Venus in the Dark"&gt;Janell Hobson. Venus in the Dark: Blackness and Beauty in Popular Culture. Routledge. Taylor &amp; Francis Group. pg 46. 2005. Accessed April 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Author Rosemarie Garland Thompson mentions Tono Maria in her book, ''Extraordinary Bodies'', as a spectacle that “confirmed the Englishman’s sense of physical mastery” and was seen as a cautionary tale of female sexual appetite. &lt;ref&gt;Rosemarie Garland Thompson. ''Extraordinary Bodies''. Columbia University Press.April 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diverse torture instruments.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|A variety of torture instruments. Many, including the large [[Iron Maiden of Nuremberg]], were never used for torture.]]
'''Torture''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''tortus'': to twist, to torment) is the act of deliberately inflicting severe physical or psychological [[suffering]] on someone by another as a punishment or in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or force some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a [[mens rea|knowing and intentional act]]; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict suffering or pain, without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture.&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/23038/9-insane-torture-techniques&lt;/ref&gt;
Torture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals, groups, and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day, and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or longer. Reasons for torture can include [[punishment]], [[revenge]], political [[Brainwashing|re-education]], [[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[coercion]] of the victim or a third party, [[interrogation]] to extract information or a [[confession]] irrespective of whether it is [[false confession|false]], or simply the [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] gratification of those carrying out or observing the torture. Alternatively, some forms of torture are designed to inflict [[Psychological torture|psychological pain]] or leave as little physical injury or evidence as possible while achieving the same psychological devastation. The torturer may or may not kill or injure the victim, but torture may result in a [[murder|deliberate death]] and serves as a form of [[capital punishment]]. Depending on the aim, even a form of torture that is intentionally fatal may be prolonged to allow the victim to suffer as long as possible (such as [[half-hanging]]). In other cases, the torturer may be indifferent to the condition of the victim.

Although torture is sanctioned by some states, it is prohibited under [[international law]] and the [[domestic laws]] of most countries. Although widely illegal and reviled, there is an ongoing debate as to what exactly is and is not legally defined as torture. It is a serious violation of [[human rights]], and is declared to be unacceptable (but not illegal) by Article 5 of the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and the [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 8 June 1977 officially agree not to torture captured persons in [[armed conflicts]], whether international or internal. Torture is also prohibited for the signatories of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], which has 163 state parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title= United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical, and information obtained by torture is far less reliable than that obtained by other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/014/2005/en |title=Torture and Ill-Treatment in the 'War on Terror' |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=22 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=general/&gt;&lt;ref name=reckoning/&gt; Despite these findings and international conventions, organizations that monitor abuses of human rights (e.g., [[Amnesty International]], the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]], [[Freedom from Torture]], etc.) report widespread use condoned by states in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]] [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol10/001/2005/en/ Report 2005]  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070317170847/http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/2af-summary-eng Report 2006] &lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some of them openly.&lt;ref name="Amnesty08"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |title=Report 08: At a Glance |year=2008 |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202906/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |archivedate = 8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

===International level===

====UN Convention Against Torture====
The [[United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], which is currently in force since 26 June 1987, provides a broad definition of torture. Article 1.1 of the UN Convention Against Torture reads:
{{blockquote|For the purpose of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which severe [[pain]] or [[suffering]], whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him, or a third person, information or a [[Confession (law)|confession]], punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or [[intimidating]] or [[Coercion|coercing]] him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a [[public official]] or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm|title=A/RES/39/46. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|website=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition was restricted to apply only to nations and to government-sponsored torture and clearly limits the torture to that perpetrated, directly or indirectly, by those acting in an official capacity, such as [[government agency|government personnel]], [[law enforcement officers|law enforcement personnel]], [[medical personnel]], [[military personnel]], or [[politicians]]. It appears to exclude:
# torture perpetrated by [[gang]]s, [[hate group]]s, [[rebellion|rebel]]s, or [[terrorist]]s who ignore national or international mandates;
# random violence during war; and
# punishment allowed by national laws, even if the punishment uses techniques similar to those used by torturers such as [[mutilation]], [[flagellation|whipping]], or [[corporal punishment]] when practiced as [[criminal justice|lawful punishment]]. Some professionals in the torture rehabilitation field believe that this definition is too restrictive and that the definition of politically motivated torture should be broadened to include all acts of organized violence.&lt;ref&gt;James Jaranson, "The Science and Politics of Rehabilitating Torture Survivors," in ''Caring for Victims of Torture,'' edited by Michael K. Popkin, Amer Psychiatric Pub Inc.1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Declaration of Tokyo====

An even broader definition was used in the 1975 [[Declaration of Tokyo]] regarding the participation of medical professionals in acts of torture:

:For the purpose of this Declaration, torture is defined as the deliberate, systematic or wanton infliction of physical or mental suffering by one or more persons acting alone or on the orders of any authority, to force another person to yield information, to make a confession, or for any other reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html World Medical Association, ''Declaration of Tokyo,'' 1975.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218203758/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html |date=18 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition includes torture as part of [[domestic violence]] or ritualistic abuse, as well as in criminal activities.

====Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court====
The [[Rome Statute]] is the [[treaty]] that set up the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). The treaty was adopted at a diplomatic conference in Rome on 17 July 1998 and went into effect on 1 July 2002. The Rome Statute provides a simplest definition of torture regarding the prosecution of [[war criminals]] by the International Criminal Court. Paragraph 1 under Article 7(e) of the Rome Statute provides that:

{{quote|"Torture" means the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm ROME STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT], INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, 17 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture====

The [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]], which is in force since 28 February 1987, defines torture more expansively than the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Article 2 of the Inter-American Convention reads:

{{quote|For the purposes of this Convention, torture shall be understood to be any act intentionally performed whereby physical or mental pain or suffering is inflicted on a person for purposes of criminal investigation, as a means of intimidation, as personal punishment, as a preventive measure, as a penalty, or for any other purpose. Torture shall also be understood to be the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish.

The concept of torture shall not include physical or mental pain or suffering that is inherent in or solely the consequence of lawful measures, provided that they do not include the performance of the acts or use of the methods referred to in this article.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/English/Treaties/a-51.html Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture], Organization of American States, 9 December 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Amnesty International====

Since 1973, [[Amnesty International]] has adopted the simplest, broadest definition of torture. It reads:

:Torture is the systematic and deliberate infliction of acute pain by one person on another, or on a third person, in order to accomplish the purpose of the former against the will of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act40/001/1984/en/ Amnesty International, (1973) ''Torture in the Eighties.'' USA Edition. Amnesty International Publication.] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal level===

====United States====

=====U.S. Code § 2340=====
[[Title 18 of the United States Code]] contains the definition of torture in 18 U.S.C. § 2340, which is only applicable to persons committing or attempting to commit torture outside of the United States.&lt;ref name="LGT"&gt;{{USC|18|2340A}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It reads:
{{quote|As used in this chapter—
:(1) “torture” means an act committed by a person acting under the [[color of law]] specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control;
:(2) “severe mental pain or suffering” means the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from—
:: (A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;
:: (B) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;
:: (C) the threat of imminent death; or
:: (D) the threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality; and
: (3) “United States” means the several [[U.S. state|states]] of the United States, the [[District of Columbia]], and the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealths]], [[Territories of the United States|territories, and possessions of the United States]].}}

In order for the United States to assume control over this jurisdiction, the alleged offender must be a U.S. national or the alleged offender must be present in the United States, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or alleged offender. Any person who conspires to commit an offense shall be subject to the same penalties (other than the penalty of death) as the penalties prescribed for an actual act or attempting to commit an act, the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.&lt;ref name="LGT"/&gt;

=====Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991=====
The [[Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991]] provides remedies to individuals who are victims of torture by persons acting in an official capacity of any foreign nation. The definition is similar to the U.S. Code § 2340, which reads:
{{quote|(b) TORTURE.—For the purposes of this Act—
:(1) the term "torture" means any act, directed against an individual in the offender's custody or physical control, by which severe pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering arising only from or inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions), whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on that individual for such purposes as obtaining from that individual or a third person information or a confession, punishing that individual for an act that individual or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, intimidating or coercing that individual or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind; and
:2) mental pain or suffering refers to prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from—
::(A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;
::(B) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;
::(C) the threat of imminent death; or
::(D) the threat that another individual will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-106/pdf/STATUTE-106-Pg73.pdf|title=PUBLIC LAW 102-256 — MAR. 12, 1992|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
{{Further information|History of human rights}}
In the study of the history of torture, some authorities rigidly divide the history of torture ''per se'' from the history of capital punishment, while noting that most forms of capital punishment are extremely painful. Torture grew into an ornate discipline, where calibrated violence served two functions: to investigate and produce confessions and to attack the body as a form of punishment. Entire populaces of towns would show up to witness an execution by torture in the public square. Those who had been "spared" torture were commonly locked barefooted into the stocks, where children took delight in rubbing feces into their hair and mouths.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Scott, ''A History of Torture'' (London: Merchant, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberately painful methods of torture and execution for severe crimes were taken for granted as part of justice until the development of [[Humanism]] in [[17th century philosophy]], and "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]" came to be denounced in the [[English Bill of Rights]] of 1689. The [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the [[western world]] further developed the idea of universal [[human rights]]. The adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 marks the recognition at least nominally of a general ban of torture by all UN member states.

Its effect in practice is limited, however, as the Declaration is not ratified officially and does not have legally binding character in international law, but is rather considered part of [[customary international law]]. Several countries still practice torture today. Some countries have legally codified it, and others have claimed that it is not practiced, while maintaining the use of torture in secret.&lt;ref&gt;"Nigeria's Torture Chambers Exposed in New Report." ''Amnesty''. September. 2014. Accessed 20 July. 2017. https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/09/nigeria-s-torture-chambers-exposed-new-report/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the days when Roman law prevailed throughout Europe, torture has been regarded as subtending three ''classes'' or ''degrees'' of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hirsch, ''ed.'', ''The Book of Torture and Executions'' (Toronto: Golden Books, 1944).&lt;/ref&gt; ''First-degree'' torture typically took the forms of whipping and beating but did not mutilate the body. The most prevalent modern example is [[bastinado]], a technique of beating or whipping the soles of the bare feet. ''Second-degree'' torture consisted almost entirely of crushing devices and procedures, including exceptionally clever screw presses or "bone vises" that crushed thumbs, toes, knees, feet, even teeth and skulls in a wide variety of ways. A wide array of [[Boot (torture)|"boots"]]—-machines variously and ingeniously designed to slowly crush feet—-are quite representative. Finally, ''third-degree'' tortures savagely mutilated the body in numerous dreadful ways, incorporating spikes, blades, boiling oil, and extremely carefully controlled fire. The serrated iron tongue shredder; the red-hot copper basin for destroying eyesight ([[abacination]], ''q.v.''); and the stocks that forcibly held the prisoner's naked feet, glistening with lard, directly over red-hot coals ([[foot roasting]], ''q.v.'') until the skin and foot muscles were burnt black and the bones fell to ashes are examples of torture in the third degree.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Judicial torture was probably first applied in Persia. Over time torture has been used as a means of reform, inducing public terror, interrogation, spectacle, and sadistic pleasure. The [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] used torture for interrogation. Until the 2nd century AD, torture was used only on [[slave]]s (with a few exceptions).&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger. ''Epistulae'' : X.96.5: "''Hunc abstinentia sanctitate, quoad viridis aetas, vicit et fregit; novissime cum senectute ingravescentem viribus animi sustinebat, cum quidem incredibiles cruciatus et indignissima tormenta pateretur.''"&lt;/ref&gt; After this point it began to be extended to all members of the [[Proletariat|lower classes]].&lt;ref&gt;de Ste. Croix, Geoffrey Ernst Maurice. ''Christian Persecution, Martyrdom, and Orthodoxy''. 2006. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A slave's testimony was admissible ''only'' if extracted by torture, on the assumption that slaves could not be trusted to reveal the truth voluntarily. This torture occurred to break the bond between a master and his slave. Slaves were thought to be incapable of lying under torture.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Edward. Torture. New York: Basil Blackwell Inc., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval and early modern European courts used torture, depending on the crime of the accused and his or her social status. Torture was deemed a legitimate means to extract confessions or to obtain the names of accomplices or other information about a crime, although many confessions were greatly invalid due to the victim being forced to confess under great agony and pressure. It was permitted by law only if there was already [[half-proof]] against the accused.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001, 26-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Torture was used in continental Europe to obtain [[corroborating evidence]] in the form of a confession when other evidence already existed.&lt;ref&gt;Langbein, John H., "Torture and Plea Bargaining" (1978). ''Faculty Scholarship Series''. Paper 543.
http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/543&lt;/ref&gt; Often, defendants already sentenced to death would be tortured to force them to disclose the names of accomplices. Torture in the [[Medieval Inquisition]] began in 1252 with a papal bull [[Ad extirpanda|Ad Extirpanda]] and ended in 1816 when another [[papal bull]] forbade its use.

A highly esteemed torture in the times of the Inquisition as a good means of interrogating "taciturn" heretics and wizards was the interrogation chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/#portfolio|title=Please visit our colleagues in Bruges!|website=torturemuseumamsterdam.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133744/http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/#portfolio|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture was usually conducted in secret, in underground dungeons. By contrast, torturous executions were typically public, and woodcuts of English prisoners being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] show large crowds of spectators, as do paintings of Spanish [[auto-da-fé]] executions, in which heretics were burned at the stake. Torture was also used during this time period as a means of reform, spectacle, to induce fear into the public, and most popularly as a punishment for treason.

Medieval torture devices were varied. One old English chronicle from the Early Medieval period reads, "They hanged them by the thumbs, or by the head, and hung fires on their feet; they put knotted strings about their heads, and writhed them so that it went to the brain ... Some they put in a chest that was short, and narrow, and shallow, and put sharp stones therein, and pressed the man therein, so that they broke all his limbs ... I neither can nor may tell all the wounds or all the tortures which they inflicted on wretched men in this land." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bately|first= Janet M.|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition. Vol. 3: MS. A |year= 1986| location=Cambridge |publisher=D.S. Brewer |isbn=978-0-85991-103-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tortures later in the Middle Ages consisted of whipping; the crushing of thumbs, feet, legs, and heads in iron presses; burning the flesh; and tearing out teeth, [[www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)|fingernails]], and toenails with red-hot iron forceps. Limb-smashing and drowning were also popular medieval tortures. Specific devices were also created and used during this time, including the rack, the Pear (also mentioned in Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811) as "Choak [''sic.''] Pears," and described as being "formerly used in Holland."), [[thumbscrew (torture)|thumbscrew]]s, animals like rats, the [[iron chair]], and the [[cat o nine tails]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5402/5402.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern period===
[[File:Lingchi (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Lingchi]] – execution by [[slow slicing]] – in Beijing around 1904.]]

During the early modern period, the [[torture of witches]] took place. In 1613, [[Anton Praetorius]] described the situation of the prisoners in the dungeons in his book ''Gründlicher Bericht Von Zauberey und Zauberern'' (''Thorough Report about Sorcery and Sorcerers''). He was one of the first to protest against all means of torture.

While secular courts often treated suspects ferociously, [[Will Durant|Will]] and Ariel Durant argued in ''The Age of Faith'' that many of the most vicious procedures were inflicted upon pious [[heresy|heretics]] by even more pious friars. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] gained a reputation as some of the most fearsomely innovative torturers in medieval Spain.

Torture was continued by [[Protestants]] during the [[Renaissance]] against teachers who they viewed as [[Heresy|heretics]]. In 1547 [[John Calvin]] had [[Jacques Gruet]] arrested in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Under torture he confessed to several crimes including writing an anonymous letter left in the pulpit which threatened death to Calvin and his associates.&lt;ref name=Monter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monter|first=E. William|title=Crime and Punishment in Calvin's Geneva, 1562|journal=Archiv für Reformationsgeschichte|year=1973|volume=64|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Geneva had him beheaded with Calvin's approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parker|first=T.H.L.|year=2006|title=John Calvin: A Biography|publisher=Lion Hudson plc|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-7459-5228-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite book |title=The debatable Land Between this World and the Next |last=Owen |first=Robert Dale |year=1872 |publisher=G.W.

In England the trial by [[jury]] developed considerable freedom in evaluating evidence and condemning on [[circumstantial evidence]], making torture to extort confessions unnecessary. For this reason in England a regularized system of judicial torture never existed and its use was limited to political cases. Torture was in theory not permitted under English law, but in [[Tudors|Tudor]] and early [[Stuarts|Stuart]] times, under certain conditions, torture was used in England. For example, the confession of [[Marc Smeaton]] at the trial of [[Anne Boleyn]] was presented in written form only, either to hide from the court that Smeaton had been tortured on [[Rack (torture)|the rack]] for four hours, or because [[Thomas Cromwell]] was worried that he would recant his confession if cross-examined. When [[Guy Fawkes]] was arrested for his role in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605 he was tortured until he revealed all he knew about the plot. This was not so much to extract a confession, which was not needed to prove his guilt, but to extract from him the names of his fellow conspirators. By this time torture was not routine in England and a special warrant from King [[James I of England|James I]] was needed before he could be tortured. The wording of the warrant shows some concerns for humanitarian considerations, specifying that the severity of the methods of interrogation were to be increased only gradually until the interrogators were sure that Fawkes had told all he knew. In the end this did not help Fawkes much as he was broken on the only rack in England, which was in the [[Tower of London]].

The [[privy council]] attempted to have [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]] who stabbed [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] to death in 1628 questioned under torture on the rack, but the judges resisted, unanimously declaring its use to be contrary to the [[English law|laws of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jardine|first=David|authorlink=David Jardine (barrister)|title=A Reading on the Use of Torture in the Criminal Law of England|publisher=Baldwin and Cradock|location=London|year=1837|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torture was abolished in England around 1640 (except ''[[peine forte et dure]]'', which was abolished in 1772).

In [[Colonial America]], women were sentenced to the [[stocks]] with wooden clips on their tongues or subjected to the "[[dunking stool]]" for the gender-specific crime of talking too much.&lt;ref&gt;Brizendine, Louann ''The Female Brain'' Broadway Books. New York. 2006 pg 36&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Native American peoples, especially in the area that later became the eastern half of the United States, engaged in the sacrificial torture of war captives.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Captives in American Indian Wars]]&lt;/ref&gt; And Spanish colonial officials in what is today the southwestern United States and northern Mexico often resorted to torture to extract confessions from rebellious Native Americans, as evidenced by the case of the Pima leader Joseph Romero 'Canito' in 1686.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/553394 |title=Torture in Colonial Spain's Northwestern Frontier: The Case of Joseph Romero "Canito," 1686 |journal=Journal of the Southwest |volume=56 |issue=2 |last=Daughters |first=Anton |date=2014-08-28|pages=233–251 |doi=10.1353/jsw.2014.0009 |access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 17th century the number of incidents of judicial torture decreased in many European regions. [[Johann Graefe]] in 1624 published ''Tribunal Reformation'', a case against torture. [[Cesare Beccaria]], an Italian lawyer, published in 1764 "An Essay on Crimes and Punishments", in which he argued that torture unjustly punished the innocent and should be unnecessary in proving guilt. [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) also fiercely condemned torture in some of his essays.

While in Egypt in 1798, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] wrote to Major-General Berthier regarding the validity of torture as an interrogation tool:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The barbarous custom of whipping men suspected of having important secrets to reveal must be abolished. It has always been recognized that this method of interrogation, by putting men to the torture, is useless. The wretches say whatever comes into their heads and whatever they think one wants to believe. Consequently, the Commander-in-Chief forbids the use of a method which is contrary to reason and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte, ''Letters and Documents of Napoleon, Volume I: The Rise to Power'', selected and translated by John Eldred Howard (London: The Cresset Press, 1961), 274.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

European states abolished torture from their statutory law in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. England abolished torture in about 1640 (except [[peine forte et dure]], which England only abolished in 1772), Scotland in 1708, [[Prussia]] in 1740, Denmark around 1770, Russia in 1774, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1776, Italy &lt;!--anachronism; Italy, as a unified state, didn't exist until 1861--&gt; in 1786, France in 1789, and [[Baden]] in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/hcc4/htm/i.vi.viii.htm History of the Christian Church, Volume IV: Mediaeval Christianity.

===Methods of torture===

Tortures included the chevalet, in which an accused witch sat on a pointed metal horse with weights strung from her feet.&lt;ref name="Naish p27"&gt;Camille Naish, ''Death Comes To The Maiden: Sex and Execution 1431-1933'' (London: Routledge, 1991), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual humiliation torture included forced sitting on red-hot stools.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Charles Lea, ''Witchcraft'', pg 236 as quoted in Camille Naish, ''Death Comes To The Maiden: Sex and Execution 1431-1933'' (London: Routledge, 1991), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Gresillons, also called pennywinkis in Scotland, or pilliwinks, crushed the tips of fingers and toes in a vise-like device.&lt;ref name="HRTR p120"&gt;H.R. Trevor-Roper, ''The European Witch-Craze of The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries and Other Essays,'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1969), 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Boot, or "leg-screw", used mostly in Germany and Scotland, was a steel boot that was placed over the leg of the accused and was tightened. The pressure from the squeezing of the boot would break the shin bone in pieces. An anonymous Scotsman called it "The most severe and cruel pain in the world".&lt;ref name="HRTR p121"&gt;H.R. Trevor-Roper, ''The European Witch-Craze of The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries and Other Essays,'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1969), 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Ingenious variants of the Spanish boot were also designed to slowly crush feet between iron plates armed with terrifying spikes. The echelle more commonly known as the "ladder" or "rack" was a long table that the accused would lie upon and be stretched violently. The torture was used so intensely that on many occasions the victim's limbs would be pulled out of the socket and, at times, the limbs would even be torn from the body entirely. On some special occasions a tortillon was used in conjunction with the ladder which would severely squeeze and mutilate the genitals at the same time as the stretching was occurring.&lt;ref name="HRTR p120"/&gt; Similar to the ladder was the "lift". It too stretched the limbs of the accused; in this instance however the victim's feet were strapped to the ground and their arms were tied behind their back before a rope was tied to their hands and lifted upwards. This caused the arms to break before the portion of the stretching began.&lt;ref name="HRTR p121"/&gt; Finally, the judicial system of King James favored the use of the turkas, an ingenious and savage iron instrument for destroying the nails of the fingers and toes. The sharp point of the instrument was first pushed under the nail to the root, splitting the nail down the centerline. Pincers then grabbed either edge of the destroyed nail and slowly tore it away from the nail bed.  Other common tortures included the strappado, a system of weights and pulleys with which the prisoner was trussed up and jerked in order to dislocate his limbs; the water torture, by which he was maintained at the very edge of drowning; and the so-called torture by fire, in which the bare feet, immobilized in an iron stocks and smeared with lard, were slowly barbecued over red-hot coals.

===Since 1948===

{{Main article|Use of torture since 1948}}

Modern sensibilities have been shaped by a profound reaction to the [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] committed by the [[Axis Powers]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] in the [[Second World War]], which have led to a sweeping international rejection of most if not all aspects of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Elihu Lauterpacht, C. J. Greenwood ''International Law Reports'', Cambridge University Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-521-66122-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-66122-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=_mutsUVLw7gC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 p. 139 section 189]&lt;/ref&gt; Even as many states engage in torture, few wish to be described as doing so, either to their own citizens or to the international community. A variety of devices bridge this gap, including state [[plausible deniability|denial]], "[[secret police]]", "[[need to know]]", a denial that given treatments are torturous in nature, appeal to various laws (national or international), the use of [[judicial jurisdiction|jurisdictional argument]] and the claim of "overriding need". Throughout history and today, many states have engaged in torture, albeit unofficially. Torture ranges from physical, psychological, political, interrogations techniques, and also includes rape of anyone outside of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Broken Spirits: The Treatment of Traumatized Asylum Seekers, Refugees, War ...

According to scholar [[Ervand Abrahamian]], although there were several decades of prohibition of torture that spread from Europe to most parts of the world, by the 1980s, the taboo against torture was broken and torture "returned with a vengeance," propelled in part by television and an opportunity to break political prisoners and broadcast the resulting public recantations of their political beliefs for "ideological warfare, political mobilization, and the need to win 'hearts and minds.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Tortured+confessions+%22hearts+and+minds%22&amp;safe=active#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Tortured+confessions+abrahamian+%22hearts+and+minds%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=e169c8353451e3d9 Tortured confessions: prisons and public recantations in modern Iran] - Page 3
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the years 2004 and 2005, over 16 countries were documented using torture.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/|title=Human Rights Watch - Defending Human Rights Worldwide|website=hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to bring global awareness, Human Rights Watch, has created an internet site to alert people to news and multimedia publications about torture occurring worldwide.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt; The International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims [IRCT] made a global analysis of torture based on [Amnesty International, 2001], [Human Rights Watch, 2003], [United Nations, 2002], [U.S. Department of State, 2002] yearly human rights reports. These reports showed that torture and ill treatment are consistently report based on all four sources in 32 countries. At least two reports the use of torture and ill treatment in at least 80 countries. These reports confirm the assumption that torture occurs in a quarter of the world's countries on a regular basis. This global prevalence of torture is estimated on the magnitude of particular high-risk groups and the amount of torture used by these groups. "Such groups comprise refugees and persons who are or have been under torture." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
According to professor Darius Rejali, although dictatorships may have used tortured "more, and more indiscriminately", it was modern democracies, "the United States, Britain, and France" who "pioneered and exported techniques that have become the lingua franca of modern torture: methods that leave no marks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2007/12/16/torture_american_style/?page=1|title=Torture, American style|website=Boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of torture used as the oppression against political opponents or could be a part of criminal investigation or interrogation techniques in order to obtain the desired information and keep law enforcement empowered over everyday citizens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The modern concept of torture methods that leave no physical evidence is noted in 1995 by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [[DSM-IV]] within the changing definition of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder [[PTSD]]. This revised definition included psychological torture stating: "Expresses concern that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders definition of posttraumatic stress disorder does not include those forms of psychological torture in which the physical integrity of a person is not threatened. It is suggested that any diagnostic criterion that characterizes the traumatic stressors leading to PTSD should be expressed in such a way that psychological forms of torture are included."&lt;ref&gt;[Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV-TR.. 4th ed. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1995, the sweeping definition of changes from 'any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether ''mental'' or ''physical'', is intentionally inflicted on a person' to including the terms ''psychological torture'' and including examples such as, interrogation techniques range from sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, fear and humiliation to severe sexual and cultural humiliation and use of threats and phobias to induce fear of death or injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reyes|first=Hernan|title=The Worst Scars are in the Mind: Psychological Torture|journal=The International Review of the Red Cross|year=2007|volume=89|issue=867|pages=591–617|doi=10.1017/s1816383107001300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AbuGhraibAbuse-standing-on-box.jpg|thumb|[[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]].]]
Torture still occurs in a small number{{cn|date=November 2018}} of liberal democracies despite several international treaties such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[UN Convention Against Torture]] making torture illegal. Despite such international conventions, torture cases continue to arise such as the 2004 [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal committed by personnel of the [[United States Army]]. The [[U.S. Constitution]] and [[U.S. law]] prohibits the use of torture, yet such human rights violations occurred during the [[War on Terror]] under the euphemism [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|Enhanced interrogation]]. The United States revised the previous torture policy in 2009 under the Obama Administration. This revision revokes the Executive Order 13440 of 20 July 2007, under which the incident at Abu Ghraib and prisoner abuse occurred. Executive Order 13491 of 22 January 2009 further defines United States policy on torture and interrogation techniques in an attempt to further prevent another torture incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations|title=Executive Order 13491 -- Ensuring Lawful Interrogations|website=The White House|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218212240/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet apparently the practice continues, albeit outsourced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apnews.com/4925f7f0fa654853bd6f2f57174179fe In Yemen's secret prisons, UAE tortures and US interrogates] Associated Press, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the findings of Dr. Christian Davenport of the [[University of Notre Dame]], Professor William Moore of [[Florida State University]], and David Armstrong of [[Oxford University]] during their torture research, evidence suggests that non-governmental organizations have played the most determinant factor for stopping torture once it gets started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davenport|first=Christian|title=Helsinki Commission Hearing|url=http://www.csce.gov/index.cfm?Fuseaction=ContentRecords.ViewWitness&amp;ContentRecord_id=907&amp;ContentType=D&amp;ContentRecordType=D&amp;ParentType=H&amp;CFID=5892559&amp;CFTOKEN=28254175|website=Hearing: "Is It Torture Yet?"|publisher=US Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|accessdate=21 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118231903/http://www.csce.gov/index.cfm?Fuseaction=ContentRecords.ViewWitness&amp;ContentRecord_id=907&amp;ContentType=D&amp;ContentRecordType=D&amp;ParentType=H&amp;CFID=5892559&amp;CFTOKEN=28254175|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary research suggests that it is civil society, not government institutions, that can stop torture once it has begun. This inability to control abuse and torture in society creates an imperfect Democracy non-compliant with internationally agreed upon standards for civil and political rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many organizations serve to expose widespread human rights violations and hold individuals accountable to the [[international community]].

===Historical methods of execution and capital punishment===
{{Main article|List of methods of capital punishment}}
{{See also|Execution}}

For most of recorded history, capital punishments were often cruel and inhumane. Severe historical penalties include [[breaking wheel]], [[boiling to death]], [[flaying]], [[slow slicing]], [[disembowelment]], [[crucifixion]], [[impalement]], [[Crushing (execution)|crushing]], [[stoning]], [[execution by burning]], [[dismemberment]], [[sawing (torture)|sawing]], [[decapitation]], [[scaphism]], or [[necklacing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950826,00.html|title=The Death Penalty :Revenge Is the Mother of Invention|date=24 January 1983|website=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Slow slicing'', or ''death by/of a thousand cuts'', was a form of [[execution]] used in China from roughly 900 AD to its abolition in 1905. According to apocryphal lore, ''líng che'' began when the torturer, wielding an extremely sharp knife, began by putting out the eyes, rendering the condemned incapable of seeing the remainder of the torture and, presumably, adding considerably to the psychological terror of the procedure. Successive rather minor cuts chopped off ears, nose, tongue, fingers, toes, and such before proceeding to grosser cuts that removed large collops of flesh from more sizable parts, e.g., thighs and shoulders. The entire process was said to last three days, and to total 3,600 cuts. The heavily carved bodies of the deceased were then put on a parade for a show in the public. More typical was to bribe the executioner to administer hasty death to the victim after a small number of dramatic slices inflicted for showmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|title=Death by a Thousand Cuts at Chinese Arts Centre until 23rd March|website=manchestereventsguide.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418031632/http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|archivedate=18 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, H. (1927). ''Genghis Khan: Emperor of all men''. (New York: American Reprint Co.)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Impalement'' was a method of torture and [[execution (legal)|execution]] whereby a person is pierced with a long stake. The penetration can be through the sides, from the [[rectum]], or through the [[Human mouth|mouth]] or [[vagina]]. This method would lead to slow, painful, death. Often, the victim was hoisted into the air after partial impalement. Gravity and the victim's own struggles would cause him to slide down the pole. Death could take many days. Impalement was frequently practiced in Asia and Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Vlad III Dracula]] and [[Ivan the Terrible]] have passed into legend as major users of the method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9382120/Dracula Dracula - Britannica Concise] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''breaking wheel'' was a torturous [[capital punishment]] device used in the [[Middle Ages]] and early modern times for public execution by [[Club (weapon)|cudgeling]] to death, especially in France and Germany. In France the condemned were placed on a cart-wheel with their limbs stretched out along the spokes over two sturdy wooden beams. The wheel was made to slowly revolve. Through the openings between the spokes, the executioner hit the victim with an iron hammer that could easily break the victim's bones. This process was repeated several times per limb. Once his bones were broken, he was left on the wheel to die. It could take hours, even days, before shock and dehydration caused death. The punishment was abolished in Germany as late as 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wheel, Breaking on the |volume=28 |page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The word 'torture' comes from the French ''torture'', originating in the [[Late Latin]] ''tortura'' and ultimately deriving the [[past participle]] of ''torquere'' meaning 'to twist'.&lt;ref name="isbn0877797137 "&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary, 10th Edition |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=Springfield, Mass |year=1999 |page= 1246|isbn=978-0-87779-713-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The word is also used loosely to describe more ordinary discomforts that would be accurately described as tedious rather than painful; for example, "making this spreadsheet was torture!"

According to Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', torture was also referred to as "the question" in seventeenth century France. This term is derived from torture's use in criminal cases: as the accused is tortured, the torturers would typically ask questions to the accused in an effort to learn more about the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.891 | title = Question or Torture | accessdate = 1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Religious perspectives}}

==Religious perspectives==

===Roman Catholic Church===
{{main article|Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition|Medieval Inquisition}}
{{see also|Christian views on Hell#Roman Catholicism}}

Throughout the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] generally opposed the use of torture during criminal proceedings. This is evident from a letter sent by Pope [[Pope Nicholas I|Saint Nicholas]] the Great to [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Khan Boris]] of the Bulgars in AD 866, delivered in response to a series of questions from the former and concerned with the ongoing [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianisation of Bulgaria]]. ''Ad Consulta Vestra'' (as entitled in Latin) declared judicial torture to be a practice that was fundamentally contrary to [[divine law]].&lt;ref name="legacy.fordham.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgars, 866|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/866nicholas-bulgar.asp=27}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pontiff made it a point of incontrovertible truth that, in his own words: "confession [to a crime] should be spontaneous, not compelled, and should not be elicited with violence but rather proferred voluntarily". He argued for an alternative and more humane procedure, in which the accused person would be required to swear an oath of innocence upon the "holy Gospel that he did not commit [the crime] which is laid against him and from that moment on the matter is [to be put] at an end".&lt;ref name="legacy.fordham.edu"/&gt; Nicholas likewise stressed in the same letter that "those who refuse to receive the good of Christianity and sacrifice and bend their knees to idols" were to be moved towards accepting the true faith "by warnings, exhortations, and reason rather than by force," emphasising to this end that "violence should by no means be inflicted upon them to make them believe. For everything which is not voluntary, cannot be good".&lt;ref name="legacy.fordham.edu"/&gt;

In the High Middle Ages the Church became increasingly concerned with the perceived threat posed to its existence by resurgent heresy, in particular that attributed to a purported sect known as the [[Cathars]]. Catharism had its roots in the Paulician movement in Armenia and eastern Byzantine Anatolia and the [[Bogomils]] of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Consequently, the Church began to enjoin secular rulers to extirpate heresy (lest the ruler’s Catholic subjects be absolved from their allegiance), and in order to coerce heretics or witnesses "into confessing their errors and accusing others," decided to sanction the use of methods of torture, already utilized by secular governments in other criminal procedures due to the [[Medieval Roman law|recovery of Roman Law]], in the medieval inquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canons of the Fourth Lateran Council, 1215|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.asp|website=canon 3|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SS Innocentius IV – Bulla 'Ad_Extirpanda'|url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/01p/1252-05-15,_SS_Innocentius_IV,_Bulla_%27Ad_Extirpanda%27,_EN.pdf|website=1252|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pope Innocent IV, in the Bull [[Ad extirpanda]] (15 May 1252), stipulated that the inquisitors were to "stop short of danger to life or limb".&lt;ref&gt;''Ad extirpanda'', quoted at [http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt119.html ''The Roman Theological Forum'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Church's views regarding torture have changed drastically, largely reverting to the earlier stance. In 1953, in an address to the 6th International Congress of Penal Law, Pope Pius XII approvingly reiterated the position of Pope Nicholas the Great over a thousand years before him, when his predecessor had unilaterally opposed the use of judicial torture, stating: {{quotation|
Preliminary juridical proceedings must exclude physical and psychological torture and the use of drugs: first of all because they violate a natural right, even if the accused is indeed guilty, and secondly because all too often they give rise to erroneous results...About eleven hundred years ago, in 866, the great Pope Nicholas I replied in the following way to a question posed by a people which had just come into contact with Christianity...Who would not wish that, during the long period of time elapsed since then, justice had never laid this rule aside! The need to recall the warning given eleven hundred years ago is a sad sign of the miscarriages of juridical practice in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pope Pius XII: 6th International Congress of Penal Law |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gyIgwz_lDGkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=torture+pius+xii+nicholas#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|website=1252|isbn=9789287145147|last1=Carpentier|first1=Jean|last2=Council For Cultural Co-Operation|first2=Council of Europe|date=2001-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus, the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (published in 1994) condemns the use of torture as a grave violation of [[Human Rights]]. In No. 2297-2298 it states:

{{quotation|
Torture, which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for the person and for human dignity... In times past, cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate governments to maintain law and order, often without protest from the Pastors of the Church, who themselves adopted in their own tribunals the prescriptions of Roman law concerning torture. Regrettable as these facts are, the Church always taught the duty of clemency and mercy. She forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent times it has become evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public order, nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human person. On the contrary, these practices led to ones even more degrading. It is necessary to work for their abolition. We must pray for the victims and their tormentors. }}

===Sharia law===
The prevalent view among jurists of [[sharia law]] is that torture is permissible only for the maintenance of law and order.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Violations in some stricter jurisdictions include acts of public indecency or immorality, which can result in floggings. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Other sharia-derived punishments that might overlap with widely held notions of torture include the various forms of [[hudud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banchoff|first1=Thomas|title=Democracy and the New Religious Pluralism|date=2007|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Judaism===
Torture has no presence within [[halakha]]. There did once exist a system of [[capital and corporal punishment in Judaism]], as well as a [[Flagellation#Judaism|flagellation]] statute for non-capital offences, but it was all abolished by the [[Sanhedrin]] during the [[Second Temple period]].

[[Maimonides]] issued a ruling in the case of a man who was ordered by a [[Beth Din]] to divorce his wife and refuses, that "we coerce him until he states 'I want to.'"&lt;ref&gt;Maimoides; ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' Hilkhot Gerushin 2:20&lt;/ref&gt; This is only true in cases where specific grounds for the verdict exist.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowitz, Chaim;[http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html "The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications"]; ''Jewish Law Articles''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some activist rabbis had interpreted this statement to mean that torture could be applied against husbands in troubled marriages in order to force them into granting religious divorces to their wives.&lt;ref&gt;Samaha, Albert (4 December 2013) [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/bad-rabbi-tales-of-extortion-and-torture-depict-a-divorce-brokers-brutal-grip-on-the-orthodox-community-6440276 "Bad Rabbi: Tales of Extortion and Torture Depict a Divorce Broker's Brutal Grip on the Orthodox Community"], ''Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt; These rabbis were later implicated in the [[2013 New York divorce torture plot]].&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Reuven (22 April 2015) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/orthodox-rabbi-guilty-kidnapping-beating-jewish-husbands-article-1.2193597/ "N.J.

==Laws against torture==
On 10 December 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR). Article 5 states, "No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html Universal Declaration of Human Rights], United Nations, 10 December 1948&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, a number of other international treaties have been adopted to prevent the use of torture. The most notable treaties relating to torture are the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] and the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and their [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 8 June 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/faq/torture-law-2011-06-24.htm |title=What does the law say about torture? |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations Convention Against Torture===
The [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] came into force in June 1987. The most relevant articles are Articles 1, 2, 3, and 16.

{{quotation|Article 1&lt;br /&gt;
1. For the purposes of this Convention, the word "torture" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.&lt;br /&gt;

{{Main article|International Criminal Court}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]], which established the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), provides for criminal prosecution of individuals responsible for [[genocide]], [[war crime]]s, and [[crimes against humanity]]. The statute defines torture as "intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions". Under Article 7 of the statute, torture may be considered a crime against humanity "when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack".&lt;ref&gt;Article 7 of the [http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm Rome Statute].

===Geneva Conventions===
The four [[Geneva Conventions]] provide protection for people who fall into enemy hands.
The conventions do not clearly divide people into [[combatant]] and [[non-combatant]] roles. The conventions refer to:
* "wounded and sick combatants or non-combatants"
* "civilian persons who take no part in hostilities, and who, while they reside in the zones, perform no work of a military character"&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], Article 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Members of the [[armed forces]] of a Party to the conflict as well as members of [[militias]] or [[Military volunteer|volunteer corps]] forming part of such armed forces"
* "Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized [[resistance movements]] belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this [[Military occupation|territory is occupied]]"
* "Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power"
* "Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of [[military aircraft]] crews, [[war correspondent]]s, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces"
* "Members of crews, including masters, pilots and apprentices, of the [[merchant marine]] and the crews of [[civil aircraft]] of the Parties to the conflict"
* "Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[first Geneva Convention|first]] (GCI), [[second Geneva Convention|second]] (GCII), [[third Geneva Convention|third]] (GCIII), and [[fourth Geneva Convention|fourth]] (GCIV) Geneva Conventions are the four most relevant for the treatment of the victims of conflicts. All treaties states in Article 3, in similar wording, that in a non-international armed conflict, "Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms... shall in all circumstances be treated humanely." The treaty also states that there must not be any "violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, [[mutilation]], cruel treatment and torture" or "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:First Geneva Convention|First Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Second Geneva Convention|Second Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

GCI covers wounded combatants in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, members of the armed forces who are sick or wounded "shall be respected and protected in all circumstances. They shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Party to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments".

GCII covers shipwreck survivors at sea in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, persons "who are at sea and who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances, it being understood that the term "shipwreck" means shipwreck from any cause and includes forced landings at sea by or from aircraft. Such persons shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Parties to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments".

GCIII covers the treatment of [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) in an international armed conflict. In particular, Article 17 says that "No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind." POW status under GCIII has far fewer exemptions than "Protected Person" status under GCIV. Captured combatants in an international armed conflict automatically have the protection of GCIII and are POWs under GCIII unless they are determined by a competent tribunal to not be a POW (GCIII Article 5).

GCIV covers most [[civilian]]s in an international armed conflict, and says they are usually "Protected Persons" (see exemptions section immediately after this for those who are not). Under Article 32, civilians have the right to protection from "murder, torture, corporal punishments, mutilation and medical or scientific experiments...but also to any other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents."

====Geneva Convention IV exemptions====
GCIV provides an important exemption:
{{quotation|Where in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention [ie GCIV] as would ... be prejudicial to the security of such State ... In each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity (GCIV Article 5)}}

Also, nationals of a State not bound by the Convention are not protected by it, and nationals of a neutral State in the territory of a combatant State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, cannot claim the protection of GCIV if their home state has normal diplomatic representation in the State that holds them (Article 4), as their diplomatic representatives can take steps to protect them. The requirement to treat persons with "humanity" implies that it is still prohibited to torture individuals not protected by the Convention.

The [[George W. Bush administration]] afforded fewer protections, under GCIII, to detainees in the "[[War on Terror]]" by codifying the legal status of an "[[unlawful combatant]]". If there is a question of whether a person is a lawful combatant, he (or she) must be treated as a POW "until their status has been determined by a competent tribunal" (GCIII Article 5). If the tribunal decides that he is an unlawful combatant, he is not considered a protected person under GCIII. However, if he is a protected person under GCIV he still has some protection under GCIV, and must be "treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention" (GCIV Article 5).&lt;ref group=nb&gt;
"Every person in enemy hands must have some status under international law: he is either a prisoner of war and, as such, covered by the Third Convention, a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention, or again, a member of the medical personnel of the armed forces who is covered by the First Convention. ''There is no'' intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law. We feel that this is a satisfactory solution – not only satisfying to the mind, but also, and above all, satisfactory from the humanitarian point of view.", because in the opinion of the ICRC "If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered 'unlawful' or 'unprivileged' combatants or belligerents (the treaties of humanitarian law do not expressly contain these terms). They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action" ([[Jean Pictet]] (ed.) – [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600007?OpenDocument Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1958)] – 1994 reprint edition). [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/f6c8b9fee14a77fdc125641e0052b079 Geneva Conventions Protocol I] Article 51.3 also covers this interpretation "Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions====
There are two additional protocols to the Geneva Convention: [[Protocol I]] (1977), relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts and [[Protocol II]] (1977), relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts. These clarify and extend the definitions in some areas, but to date many countries, including the United States, have either not signed them or have not ratified them.

[[Protocol I]] does not mention torture but it does affect the treatment of POWs and Protected Persons. In Article 5, the protocol explicitly involves "the appointment of Protecting Powers and of their substitute" to monitor that the Parties to the conflict are enforcing the Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080410223403/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol1.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol 1)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol also broadens the definition of a lawful combatant in wars against "alien occupation, colonial domination and racist regimes" to include those who carry arms openly but are not wearing uniforms, so that they are now [[lawful combatant]]s and protected by the Geneva Conventions—although only if the Occupying Power has ratified Protocol I. Under the original conventions, combatants without a recognizable insignia could be treated as war criminals, and potentially be executed. It also mentions spies, and defines who is a mercenary. Mercenaries and spies are considered an unlawful combatant, and not protected by the same conventions.

[[Protocol II]] "develops and supplements Article 3 [relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts] common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 without modifying its existing conditions of application" (Article 1). Any person who does not take part in or ceased to take part in hostilities is entitled to humane treatment. Among the acts prohibited against these persons are, "Violence to the life, health and physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular murder as well as cruel treatment such as torture, mutilation or any form of corporal punishment" (Article 4.a), "Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault" (Article 4.e), and "Threats to commit any of the foregoing acts" (Article 4.h).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080612085204/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol2.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Clauses in other articles implore humane treatment of enemy personnel in an internal conflict. These have a bearing on torture, but no other clauses explicitly mention torture.

===Other conventions===
In accordance with the optional [[UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]] (1955), ''"[[corporal punishment]], punishment by placing in a dark cell, and all cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments shall be completely prohibited as punishments for disciplinary offences."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080718003225/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_comp34.htm Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners], United Nations, Geneva, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], (16 December 1966), explicitly prohibits torture and ''"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment"'' by signatories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] United Nations, 16 December 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

;European agreements
[[File:10CFREU-Article4.jpg|right|thumb|Article 4 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] prohibits torture.]]

In 1950 during the [[Cold War]], the participating member states of the [[Council of Europe]] signed the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The treaty was based on the [[UDHR]]. It included the provision for a court to interpret the treaty, and Article 3 '''"Prohibition of torture"''' stated; ''"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm European Convention on Human Rights], 4 November 1950(with later protocols).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the [[five techniques]] of "[[sensory deprivation]]" were not torture as laid out in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, but were "''inhuman or degrading treatment''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/1.html Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1977]. (Case No. 5310/71)&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Uses of torture in recent times#United Kingdom|Accusations of use of torture by United Kingdom]] for details). This case occurred nine years before the United Nations Convention Against Torture came into force and had an influence on thinking about what constitutes torture ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Michael John Garcia (Legislative Attorney American Law Division) [http://www.ilw.com/immigdaily/news/2005,1223-crs.pdf U.N. Convention Against Torture (CAT):Overview and Application to Interrogation Techniques] [http://www.ilw.com/ CRS Report for Congress] 7 November 2005. pp. 13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 1987, the member states of the [[Council of Europe]], meeting at [[Strasbourg]], adopted the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] (ECPT). Two additional Protocols amended the Convention, which entered into force on 1 March 2002. The Convention set up the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] to oversee compliance with its provisions.

;Inter-American Convention
The [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]], currently ratified by 18 nations of the [[Americas]] and in force since 28 February 1987, defines torture more expansively than the United Nations Convention Against Torture.

{{quotation|For the purposes of this Convention, torture shall be understood to be any act intentionally performed whereby physical or mental pain or suffering is inflicted on a person for purposes of criminal investigation, as a means of intimidation, as personal punishment, as a preventive measure, as a penalty, or for any other purpose. Torture shall also be understood to be the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish.

The concept of torture shall not include physical or mental pain or suffering that is inherent in or solely the consequence of lawful measures, provided that they do not include the performance of the acts or use of the methods referred to in this article.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"/&gt;}}

===Supervision of anti-torture treaties===
The [[Istanbul Protocol]], an official UN document, is the first set of international guidelines for documentation of torture and its consequences. It became a United Nations official document in 1999.

Under the provisions of [[OPCAT]] that entered into force on 22 June 2006 independent international and national bodies regularly visit places where people are deprived of their liberty, to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Each state that ratified the OPCAT, according to Article 17, is responsible for creating or maintaining at least one independent national preventative mechanism for torture prevention at the domestic level.

The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, citing Article 1 of the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture]], states that it will, "by means of visits, examine the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty with a view to strengthening, if necessary, the protection of such persons from torture and from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/about.htm|title=About the CPT|website=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In times of armed conflict between a signatory of the Geneva Conventions and another party, delegates of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) monitor the compliance of signatories to the Geneva Conventions, which includes monitoring the use of torture. Human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], the [[World Organization Against Torture]], and [[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] work actively to stop the use of torture throughout the world and publish reports on any activities they consider to be torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apt.ch/|title=Association for the Prevention of Torture|website=apt.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal law===
[[Sovereign state|States]] that ratified the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] have a treaty obligation to include the provisions into [[municipal law]]. The laws of many states therefore formally prohibit torture. However, such ''[[de jure]]'' legal provisions are by no means a proof that, ''[[de facto]]'', the signatory country does not use torture. To prevent torture, many legal systems have a [[right against self-incrimination]] or explicitly prohibit undue force when dealing with suspects.

The French 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], of constitutional value, prohibits submitting suspects to any hardship not necessary to secure his or her person.

The [[U.S. Constitution]] and [[U.S. law]] prohibits the use of unwarranted force or coercion against any person who is subject to interrogation, detention, or arrest. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] includes protection against [[self-incrimination]], which states that "[n]o person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself". This serves as the basis of the [[Miranda warning]], which [[Law enforcement in the United States|U.S. law enforcement personnel]] issue to individuals upon their arrest. Additionally, the U.S. Constitution's [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] forbids the use of "[[cruel and unusual punishments]]," which is widely interpreted as prohibiting torture. Finally, 18 U.S.C. § 2340&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|2340}} ''et seq.''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''et seq.'' define and forbid torture committed by U.S. nationals outside the United States or non-U.S. nationals who are present in the United States. As the United States recognizes [[customary international law]], or the [[law of nations]], the U.S. [[Alien Tort Claims Act]] and the [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] also provides legal remedies for victims of torture outside of the United States. Specifically, the status of torturers under the law of the United States, as determined by a famous legal decision in 1980, ''[[Filártiga v. Peña-Irala]]'', 630 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 876 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2d Cir.]] 1980), is that, "the torturer has become, like the [[maritime piracy|pirate]] and the [[slave trade]]r before him, [[hostis humani generis]], an enemy of all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Filártiga v. Peña-Irala |vol=630 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=876 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1980 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/630/876/238132/ |accessdate=2017-01-06 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion of evidence obtained under torture===

====International law====
Article 15 of the 1984 [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] specify that:

{{quotation|Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.}}

A similar provision is also found in Article 10 of the 1985 [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]]:

{{quotation|No statement that is verified as having been obtained through torture shall be admissible as evidence in a legal proceeding, except in a legal action taken against a person or persons accused of having elicited it through acts of torture, and only as evidence that the accused obtained such statement by such means.}}

These provisions have the double dissuasive effect of nullifying any utility in using torture with the purpose of eliciting confession, as well as confirming that should a person extract statements by torture, this can be used against him or her in criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Rights in Times of Conflict and Terrorism |author=Louise Doswald-Beck |page=220 |date=21 March 2011 |publisher=Praeger; 1 edition |isbn=978-0-1995-7894-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is because experience has shown that under torture, or even under a threat of torture, a person will say or do anything solely to avoid the pain. As a result, there is no way to know whether or not the resulting statement is actually correct. If any court relies on any evidence obtained from torture regardless of validity, it provides an incentive for state officials to force a confession, creating a marketplace for torture, both domestically and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apt.ch/en/evidence-obtained-through-torture/ |title=Exclusion of evidence obtained through torture |publisher=[[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Within national borders====
Most states have prohibit their legal systems from accepting evidence that is extracted by torture. The question of the use of evidence obtained under torture has arisen in connection with prosecutions during the [[War on Terror]] in the United Kingdom and the United States.

=====United Kingdom=====
In 2003, the United Kingdom's Ambassador to [[Uzbekistan]], [[Craig Murray]], suggested that it was "wrong to use information gleaned from torture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1474852/The-envoy-silenced-after-telling-undiplomatic-truths.html|title=The envoy silenced after telling undiplomatic truths|last=Gedye|first=Robin|date=23 October 2004|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|quote=Murray fired off a memorandum to the Foreign Office last July suggesting that Britain's intelligence services were wrong to use information gleaned from torture victims|accessdate=26 August 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The unanimous [[House of Lords Judicial Committee|Law Lords]] judgment on 8 December 2005 confirmed this position. They ruled that, under English law tradition, "torture and its fruits" could not be used in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,15935,1662107,00.html Torture evidence inadmissible in UK courts, Lords rules],''[[The Guardian]]'', 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; But the information thus obtained could be used by the British police and security services as "it would be ludicrous for them to disregard information about a ticking bomb if it had been procured by torture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4510866.stm Torture ruling's international impact] by Jon Silverman [[BBC]] 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray's accusations did not lead to any investigation by his employer, the FCO, and he resigned after disciplinary action was taken against him in 2004. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office itself is being investigated by the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] because of accusations that it has victimized, bullied and intimidated its own staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1533100,00.html Foreign Office faces probe into 'manipulation'], Robert Winnett,''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 20 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray later stated that he felt that he had unwittingly stumbled upon what has been called "torture by proxy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/?050214on_onlineonly01 Q &amp; A: Torture by Proxy] Jane Mayer answers question asked by Amy Davidson [[The New Yorker]] on 14 February 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709140152/http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/?050214on_onlineonly01 |date=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that Western countries moved people to regimes and nations where it was known that information would be extracted by torture, and made available to them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Murray states that he was aware from August 2002 "that the CIA were bringing in detainees to [[Tashkent]] from [[Bagram Air Base|Bagram airport Afghanistan]], who were handed over to the [[Uzbek security services]] (SNB). I presumed at the time that these were all Uzbek nationals—that may have been a false presumption. I knew that the CIA were obtaining intelligence from their subsequent interrogation by the SNB." He goes on to say that he did not know at the time that any non-Uzbek nationals were flown to Uzbekistan and although he has studied the reports by several journalists and finds their reports credible he is not a firsthand authority on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/archives/2005/07/extraordinary_r_1.html Extraordinary Rendition] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728095612/http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/archives/2005/07/extraordinary_r_1.html |date=28 July 2012 }} on [http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/ Craig Murray's website], 11 July 2005 {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate on 7 July 2009, MP [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] accused the UK government of outsourcing torture, by allowing [[Rangzieb Ahmed]] to leave the country (even though they had evidence against him upon which he was later convicted for terrorism) to Pakistan, where it is said the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] was given the go ahead by the British intelligence agencies to torture Ahmed. Davis further accused the government of trying to gag Ahmed, stopping him coming forward with his accusations, after he had been imprisoned back in the UK. He said, there was "an alleged request to drop his allegations of torture: if he did that, they could get his sentence cut and possibly give him some money. If this request to drop the torture case is true, it is frankly monstrous. It would at the very least be a criminal misuse of the powers and funds under the Government's Contest strategy, and at worst a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Business&gt;Publications and Records &gt; Commons Publications &gt; Commons Hansard &gt; Daily Hansard -Debate|publisher=Parliament.uk|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/debtext/90707-0020.htm|accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====
In May 2008, [[Susan J. Crawford]], the [[Convening authority (court-martial)|official overseeing prosecutions]] before the [[Guantanamo military commissions]], declined to refer for trial the case of [[Mohammed al-Qahtani]] because she said, "we tortured [him]."&lt;ref name = "Qahtani Tortured"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5134328.stm Q&amp;A: Guantanamo detentions] BBC News, 22 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qhatani remains imprisoned at Guantanamo.

On 28 October 2008, Guantanamo military judge [[Stephen R. Henley]] ruled that the government cannot use statements made as a result of torture in the military commission case against Afghan national [[Mohammed Jawad]]. The judge held that Jawad's alleged confession to throwing a grenade at two U.S. service members and an Afghan interpreter was obtained after armed Afghan officials on 17 December 2002,&lt;ref name=usatoday13Jan2009&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-01-13-torture-hearings_N.htm| title=Court hears arguments over detainee's confession| newspaper=USA Today | agency=Associated Press| date=13 January 2009 | accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; threatened to kill Jawad and his family. The government had previously told the judge that Jawad's alleged confession while in Afghan custody was central to the case against him. Hina Shamsi, staff attorney with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] National Security Project stated: "We welcome the judge's decision that death threats constitute torture and that evidence obtained as a result must be excluded from trial. Unfortunately, evidence obtained through torture and coercion is pervasive in military commission cases that, by design, disregard the most fundamental due process rights, and no single decision can cure that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yubanet.com/usa/Guantanamo-Judge-Rejects-Evidence-Obtained-Through-Torture-In-Jawad-Case.php#.VRJHGI56LLs|title=Guantanamo Judge Rejects Evidence Obtained Through Torture In Jawad Case|website=yubanet.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160011/http://yubanet.com/usa/Guantanamo-Judge-Rejects-Evidence-Obtained-Through-Torture-In-Jawad-Case.php#.VRJHGI56LLs|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, on 19 November, the judge again rejected evidence gathered through coercive interrogations in the military commission case against Afghan national Mohammed Jawad, holding that the evidence collected while Jawad was in U.S. custody on 17–18 December 2002, cannot be admitted in his trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/guantanamo-judge-throws-out-more-evidence-obtained-through-torture-jawad-case|title=Guantánamo Judge Throws Out More Evidence Obtained Through Torture In Jawad Case|website=American Civil Liberties Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because the U.S. interrogator had blindfolded and hooded Jawad in order to frighten him.&lt;ref&gt;usatoday13Jan2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture has been criticized on humanitarian and moral grounds, on the grounds that evidence extracted by torture is unreliable, and because torture corrupts institutions that tolerate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/torture/ethics/wrong_2.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213004811/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/torture/ethics/wrong_2.shtml|archivedate=13 December 2007|title=Consequentialist reasons why torture is wrong|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides degrading the victim, torture debases the torturer: American advisors alarmed at torture by their South Vietnamese allies early in the [[Vietnam War]] concluded that "if a commander allowed his officers and men to fall in to these vices [they] would pursue them for their own sake, for the perverse pleasure they drew from them."&lt;ref name = "Bright Shining Lie"&gt;{{cite book| last =Sheehan| first = Neil| title =A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam| publisher =Random House | edition =first| year =1988| pages= 104, 105| isbn =978-0-394-48447-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequent degeneracy destroyed discipline and morale: "[a] soldier had to learn that he existed to uphold law and order, not to undermine it."&lt;ref name = "Bright Shining Lie"/&gt;

Organizations like [[Amnesty International]] argue that the universal legal prohibition is based on a universal philosophical consensus that torture and ill-treatment are repugnant, abhorrent, and immoral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Amnesty International|authorlink=Amnesty International|url=http://web.amnesty.org/pages/stoptorture-arguments-eng#question1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205141017/http://web.amnesty.org/pages/stoptorture-arguments-eng|archivedate=5 December 2007|title=Torture and ill-treatment: the arguments: 1.

The [[ticking time bomb scenario]], a [[thought experiment]], asks what to do to a captured terrorist who has placed a [[nuclear bomb]] in a populated area. If the terrorist is tortured, he may explain how to defuse the bomb. The scenario asks if it is ethical to torture the terrorist. A 2006 [[BBC]] poll held in 25 nations gauged support for each of the following positions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm|title=One third support some torture|publisher=BBC News|date=19 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Terrorists pose such an extreme threat that governments should be allowed to use some degree of torture if it may gain information that saves innocent lives.
*Clear rules against torture should be maintained because any use of torture is immoral and will weaken international human rights.
An average of 59% of people worldwide rejected torture. However, there was a clear divide between those countries with strong rejection of torture (such as Italy, where only 14% supported torture) and nations where rejection was less strong. Often this lessened rejection is found in countries severely and frequently threatened by terrorist attacks. E.g., Israel, despite its Supreme Court outlawing torture in 1999, showed 43% supporting torture, but 48% opposing, India showed 37% supporting torture and only 23% opposing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm ''Ibid'']: "''Israel has the largest percentage of those polled endorsing the use of a degree of torture on prisoners, with 43% saying they agreed that some degree of torture should be allowed.''" On the Israeli Supreme Court decision outlawing torture, see Judgment Concerning the Legality of the General Security Service’s Interrogation Methods, Supreme Court of Israel, 38 I.L.M. 1471 (1999), and other references at [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss14/nagan.shtml#Heading300 law.harvard.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430213030/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm |date=30 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within nations there is a clear divide between the positions of members of different ethnic groups, religions, and political affiliations, sometimes reflecting distinctions between groups considering themselves threatened or victimized by terror acts and those from the alleged perpetrator groups. For example, the study found that among Jews in Israel 53% favored some degree of torture and only 39% wanted strong rules against torture while Muslims in Israel were overwhelmingly against any use of torture, unlike Muslims polled elsewhere. Differences in general political views also can matter. In one 2006 survey by the Scripps Center at Ohio University, 66% of Americans who identified themselves as strongly Republican supported torture, compared to 24% of those who identified themselves as strongly Democratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newspolls.org/articles/19606|title=New XHTML 1.0 Transitional Compliant Page|website=newspolls.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514083035/http://www.newspolls.org/articles/19606|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 U.S. survey 72% of American Catholics supported the use of torture in some circumstances compared to 51% of American secularists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/032406/032406h.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612093225/http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/032406/032406h.htm|title=Nation: Americans, especially Catholics, approve of torture|archivedate=12 June 2008|website=ncronline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Pew survey in 2009 similarly found that the religiously unaffiliated are the least likely (40 percent) to support torture, and that the more a person claims to attend church, the more likely he or she is to condone torture; among racial/religious groups, white evangelical Protestants were far and away the most likely (62 percent) to support inflicting pain as a tool of interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, Leonard (7 May 2009).

There are also different attitudes as to what constitutes torture, as revealed in an ABC News/Washington Post poll, where more than half of the Americans polled thought that techniques such as [[sleep deprivation]] were not torture.&lt;ref&gt;David Morris and Gary Langer ''[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=90051 Poll: Torture Methods Opposed]'' ABCNEWS.com 27 May 2004 "Americans by nearly 2-to-1 oppose torturing terrorism suspects — but half believe the U.S. government, as a matter of policy, is doing it anyway. And even more think the government is employing physical abuse that falls short of torture in some cases."&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, so-called "enhanced interrogation" techniques were employed by the CIA in situations that did not involve the "ticking time bomb" scenario that has been the subject of opinion polls and public debate. In April 2009 a former senior U.S. intelligence official and a former Army psychiatrist stated that the Bush administration applied pressure on interrogators to use the "enhanced interrogation" techniques on detainees to find evidence of cooperation between al Qaida and the late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Landay, Jonathan (21 April 2009).

Pressed by the BBC in 2010 on his personal view of waterboarding, Presidential Advisor [[Karl Rove]] said: "I'm proud that we kept the world safer than it was, by the use of these techniques. They’re appropriate, they're in conformity with our international requirements and with US law."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk, 13 March 2010, "Karl Rove says water torture is justified - and a source of pride" by Giles Whittell&lt;/ref&gt;

These American citizens could theoretically be tried by the [[International Criminal Court]] even though the US is not a signatory. But it would have to be referred by the [[UN security council]] and, given that the US has a [[veto]] on the council, this hypothesis is very improbable." [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] Legal Director Kat Craig said: "This latest exposé of [[human rights abuses]] shows that torture is [[endemic]] to [[US foreign policy]]; these are considered and deliberate acts, not only sanctioned but developed by the highest echelons of [[United States Department of Defense|US security service]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/07/pentagon-investigating-link-military-torture Pentagon investigating link between US military and torture centres in Iraq.

===Effectiveness===
{{main|Effectiveness of torture for interrogation}}
There is a strong [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] argument against torture; namely, that it is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-rsquo-ve-known-for-400-years-that-torture-doesn-rsquo-t-work/|title=On Witches and Terrorists|first=Michael|last=Shermer|journal=Scientific American|volume=316|issue=5|pages=77|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0517-77|pmid=28437416|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information supporting the ineffectiveness of torture goes back centuries. For example, during [[witch trial]]s torture was routinely used to try to force subjects to admit their guilt and to identify other witches. It was found that subjects would make up stories if it meant the torture would cease.

There is no scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h4q565424126068h/|title=A utilitarian argument against torture interrogation of terrorists|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics |year=2004 |volume=10 |number=3 |page=543 |author=Jean Maria Arrigo |doi=10.1007/s11948-004-0011-y|citeseerx=10.1.1.470.9264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of scientific basis for the effectiveness of torture as an interrogation techniques is summarized in a 2006 Intelligence Science Board report titled "EDUCING INFORMATION, Interrogation: Science and Art, Foundations for the Future".&lt;ref name="Educing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/dni/educing.pdf|title=Educing Information: Interrogation: Science and Art—Foundations for the Future|date=December 2006|publisher=National Defense Intelligence College|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some have pointed to some specific cases where torture has elicited true information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/torturecardozo.pdf|title=J. Franklin, Evidence gained from torture: wishful thinking, checkability and extreme circumstances|year=2009|journal=Cardozo Journal of International and Comparative Law |volume= 17 |issue=2|accessdate=28 December 2009 |pages= 281–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection===
A famous example of rejection of the use of torture was cited by the Argentine [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] in whose report, Italian general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] was reputed to have said in connection with the investigation of the disappearance of prime minister [[Aldo Moro]], "Italy can survive the loss of Aldo Moro. It would not survive the introduction of torture."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012004601/http://nuncamas.org/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_002.htm Report of Conadep (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons): Prologue] - 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secrecy===
Before the emergence of modern policing, torture was an important aspect of policing and the use of it was openly sanctioned and acknowledged by the authority. The Economist magazine proposed that one of the reasons torture endures is that torture does indeed work in some instances to extract information/confession, if those who are being tortured are indeed guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9832909 | work=The Economist | title=Is torture ever justified? | date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the culture, torture has at times been carried on in silence (official silence &lt;ref&gt;Bakir, V. Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles. Farnham: Ashgate (2013). Available at: http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781472402554&lt;/ref&gt;), semi-silence (known but not spoken about), or openly acknowledged in public (to instill fear and obedience).

In the 21st century, even when states sanction their interrogation methods, torturers often work outside the law. For this reason, some prefer methods that, while unpleasant, leave victims alive and unmarked. A victim with no visible damage may lack credibility when telling tales of torture, whereas a person missing fingernails or eyes can easily prove claims of torture. Mental torture, however can leave scars just as deep and long-lasting as physical torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004a/5e.html Abu Ghraib and the ISA: What's the difference?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520150425/http://aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004a/5e.html |date=20 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional torturers in some countries have used techniques such as electrical shock, asphyxiation, heat, cold, noise, and sleep deprivation, which leave little evidence, although in other contexts torture frequently results in horrific mutilation or death. However the most common and prevalent form of torture worldwide in both developed and under-developed countries is beating.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act40/016/2000/en/ Amnesty.org] &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|List of methods of torture}}

[[List of torture methods and devices#Psychological torture methods|Psychological torture]] uses non-physical methods that cause psychological [[suffering]]. Its effects are not immediately apparent unless they alter the [[behavior]] of the tortured person. Since there is no international political consensus on what constitutes psychological torture, it is often overlooked, denied, and referred to by different names.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Psychological torture is less well known than physical torture and tends to be subtle and much easier to conceal. In practice the distinctions between physical and psychological torture are often blurred.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Physical torture is the inflicting of severe pain or suffering on a person. In contrast, psychological torture is directed at the psyche with calculated violations of psychological needs, along with deep damage to psychological structures and the breakage of beliefs underpinning normal [[sanity]]. Torturers often inflict both types of torture in combination to compound the associated effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Psychological torture also includes deliberate use of extreme [[psychological stress|stressors]] and situations such as [[mock execution]], [[shunning]], violation of deep-seated social or [[sexual norm]]s and [[taboo]]s, or extended [[solitary confinement]]. Because psychological torture needs no physical violence to be effective, it is possible to induce severe psychological pain, suffering, and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] with no externally visible effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

[[Rape]] and other forms of [[sexual abuse]] are often used as methods of torture for interrogative or punitive purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Nooria | last=Mehraby | url=http://www.startts.org.au/default.aspx?id=201 | title=Refugee Women: The Authentic Heroines | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830113952/http://www.startts.org.au/default.aspx?id=201 |archivedate=30 August 2007 }} &lt;!-- Must be a more reliable source than this! --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medical torture]], medical practitioners use torture to judge what victims can endure, to apply treatments that enhance torture, or act as torturers in their own right. [[Josef Mengele]] and [[Shirō Ishii]] were infamous during and after [[World War II]] for their involvement in medical torture and murder. In recent years, however, there has been a push to end medical complicity in torture through both international and state-based legal strategies, as well as litigations against individual physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hoffman | first = S. J. | year = 2011 | title = Ending medical complicity in state-sponsored torture | url = http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hoffman/files/25_-_lancet_-_ending_medical_complicity_in_state-sponsored_torture_2011_hoffman.pdf | journal = The Lancet | volume = 378 | issue = 9802 | pages = 1535–1537 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60816-7 | pmid=21944647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pharmacological torture]] is the use of drugs to produce psychological or physical pain or discomfort. [[Tickle torture]] is an unusual form of torture which nevertheless has been documented, and can be both physically and psychologically painful.&lt;ref&gt;Heger, Heinz. ''The Men With the Pink Triangle''. Boston: Alyson Publications, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamey|first=Gavin|title=Torture: European Instruments of Torture and Capital Punishment from the Middle Ages to Present|journal=British Medical Journal|date=11 August 2011|volume=323|issue=7308|page=346|doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7308.346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark.''

== Murder ==

{{original research|section|date=February 2017}}
{{Main|Torture murder}}

Torture murder involves torture to the point of murder. [[Murderer]]s might also torture their victims to death for sadistic reasons. [[Al-Qaida|Some terrorist groups]] torture—typically commencing with the forcible extraction of all ten fingernails, all ten toenails, and all thirty-two teeth—before executing the victim by such barbaric techniques as slow decapitation via butcher knife.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Ancient conceptual forerunners of torture murder include [[drawing and quartering]] and [[flaying]].

==Effects==
The consequences of torture reach far beyond immediate pain. Many victims suffer from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), which includes symptoms such as flashbacks (or intrusive thoughts), severe anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, depression and memory lapses. Torture victims often feel guilt and shame, triggered by the humiliation they have endured. Many feel that they have betrayed themselves or their friends and family. All such symptoms are normal human responses to abnormal and inhuman treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/defining-torture.aspx |title= What is torture? |publisher=IRCT |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations like [[Freedom from Torture]] and the [[Center for Victims of Torture]] try to help survivors of torture obtain medical treatment and to gain [[forensic]] medical [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to obtain [[refugee|political asylum]] in a safe country or to prosecute the perpetrators.

Torture is often difficult to prove, particularly when some time has passed between the event and a medical examination, or when the torturers are immune from prosecution. Many torturers around the world use methods designed to have a maximum psychological impact while leaving only minimal physical traces. Medical and Human Rights Organizations worldwide have collaborated to produce the [[Istanbul Protocol]], a document designed to outline common torture methods, consequences of torture, and medico-legal examination techniques. Typically deaths due to torture are shown in an autopsy as being due to "natural causes" like heart attack, inflammation, or [[embolism]] due to extreme [[stress (medicine)|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For survivors, torture often leads to lasting [[mental health|mental]] and physical health problems.

Physical problems can be wide-ranging, e.g. [[sexually transmitted diseases]], musculo-skeletal problems, [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]], post-traumatic [[epilepsy]] and [[dementia]] or chronic pain syndromes.

On 19 August 2007, the [[American Psychology Association]] (APA) voted to bar participation, to intervene to stop, and to report involvement in a wide variety of interrogation techniques as torture, including "using [[mock execution]]s, simulated drowning, sexual and religious humiliation, stress positions or sleep deprivation", as well as "the exploitation of prisoners' phobias, the use of mind-altering drugs, [[hooding]], forced nakedness, the use of dogs to frighten detainees, exposing prisoners to extreme heat and cold, physical assault and threatening the use of such techniques against a prisoner or a prisoner's family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/19/AR2007081901513.html|title=APA Rules on Interrogation Abuse|website=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the APA rejected a stronger resolution that sought to prohibit "all psychologist involvement, either direct or indirect, in any interrogations at U.S. detention centers for foreign detainees or citizens detained outside normal legal channels." That resolution would have placed the APA alongside the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association in limiting professional involvement in such settings to direct patient care. The APA echoed the Bush administration by condemning isolation, sleep deprivation, and sensory deprivation or over-stimulation only when they are likely to cause lasting harm.

Psychiatric treatment of torture-related medical problems might require a wide range of expertise and often specialized experience. Common treatments are [[psychotropic]] [[medication]], e.g. [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] [[antidepressants]], [[counseling]], [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]], [[family systems therapy]] and [[physiotherapy]].

:''See [[Psychology of torture]] for psychological impact, and aftermath, of torture.''

==Rehabilitation==

The aim of rehabilitation is to empower the torture victim to resume as full a life as possible. Rebuilding the life of someone whose dignity has been destroyed takes time and as a result long-term material, medical, psychological and social support is needed.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rehabilitation|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/rehabilitation.aspx|website=What is torture?|publisher=International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT)|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment must be a coordinated effort that covers both physical and psychological aspects. It is important to take into consideration the patients' needs, problems, expectations, views and cultural references.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

The consequences of torture are likely to be influenced by many internal and external factors. Therefore, rehabilitation needs to employ different treatment approaches, taking into account the victims' individual needs, as well as the cultural, social and political environment.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

Rehabilitation centres around the world, notably the members of the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]], commonly offer multi-disciplinary support and counselling, including:
*medical attention / psychotherapeutic treatment
*psychosocial support / trauma treatment
*legal services and redress
*social reintegration.
In the case of asylum seekers and refugees, the services may also include assisting in documentation of torture for the asylum decision, language classes and help in finding somewhere to live and work.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

===Rehabilitation of secondary survivors===
In the worst case, torture can affect several generations. The physical and mental after-effects of torture often place great strain on the entire family and society. Children are particularly vulnerable. They often suffer from feelings of guilt or personal responsibility for what has happened. Therefore, other members of the survivor’s family – in particular the spouse and children – are also offered treatment and counselling.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

===Broken societies===
In some instances, whole societies can be more or less traumatized where torture has been used in a systematic and widespread manner. In general, after years of [[Social repression|repression]], [[wikt:conflict|conflict]] and [[war]], regular support networks and structures have often been broken or destroyed.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

Providing [[peer support|psychosocial support]] and [[redress]] to survivors of torture and trauma can help reconstruct broken societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.rct.dk/media/1195332/fieldmanual_ver1.pdf|title=Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims: Field Manual on Rehabilitation (2007)|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Rehabilitation centres therefore play a key role in promoting democracy, co-existence and respect for human rights. They provide support and hope, and act as a symbol of triumph over the manmade terror of torture which can hold back the development of democracy of entire societies."&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

A '''voluntary group''' or '''union''' (also sometimes called a '''voluntary organization''', '''common-interest association''',&lt;ref name=Prins2010&gt;Prins HEL et al. (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yP6TrXRpPdMC Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge]. Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|266}} '''association''', or '''society''') is a group of individuals who enter into an agreement, usually as [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, to form a body (or [[organization]]) to accomplish a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/association association] Entry at [[Dictionary.reference.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples include [[trade association]]s, [[trade union]]s, [[learned society|learned societies]], [[professional association]]s, and [[Environmental movement|environmental group]]s.

Membership is not necessarily voluntary: in order for particular associations to function correctly they might need to be mandatory or at least strongly encouraged, as is common with many [[teachers union]]s in the US. Because of this, some people use the term common-interest association to describe groups which form out of a common interest, although this term is not widely used or understood.&lt;ref name=Prins2010/&gt;

Voluntary associations may be incorporated or unincorporated; for example, in the US, unions gained additional powers by incorporating.&lt;ref&gt;Bradburn B. (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IbqTcM4rrR8C&amp;pg=PA217#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Citizenship Revolution: Politics and the Creation of the American Union, 1774–1804]'', p. 217. [[University of Virginia Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the terms Voluntary Association or Voluntary Organisation cover every type of group from a small local Residents' Association to large Associations (often  [[Registered charity|Registered Charities]]) with multimillion-[[British pound|pound]] turnover that run large-scale business operations (often providing some kind of [[public service]] as subcontractors to government departments or local authorities).

==Differences by jurisdictions==
In many [[jurisdiction]]s no formalities are necessary to start an association. In some jurisdictions, there is a minimum for the number of persons starting an association.

Some jurisdictions require that the association register with the police or other official body to inform the public of the association's existence. This could be a tool of political control or intimidation, and also a way of protecting the economy from [[fraud]].

In many such jurisdictions, only a registered association (or in the UK an incorporated body) is a [[juristic person]] whose members are not responsible for the financial acts of the association. Any group of persons may, of course, work as an informal association, but in such cases, each person making a transaction in the name of the association takes responsibility for that transaction, just as if it were that individual's personal transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = 2|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many countries where the formation of truly independent Voluntary Associations is effectively proscribed by law or where they are theoretically legally permitted, but in practice are persecuted; for example, where membership brings unwelcome attention from police or other state agencies.

==History==
[[File:Civil Brainbar (1).jpg|thumb|Civil lecture at Budapest Brainbar]]
Voluntary groups are a broad and original form of nonprofit organizations, and have existed since ancient history. In [[Ancient Greece]], for example, there were various organizations ranging from elite clubs of wealthy men (''hetaireiai'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4436529 Politics on the Margins: The Athenian "Hetaireiai" in 415 BC]. ''Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte''.&lt;/ref&gt; to private religious or professional associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ascough, Richard S.

In Community Formation in the Early Church and the Church Today. Edited by Richard N. Longenecker, 3–24. Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In preindustrial societies, governmental administrative duties were often handled by voluntary associations such as [[guild]]s. In medieval Europe, guilds often controlled towns.&lt;ref name=Kohn2003&gt;Kohn M. (2003). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=427763 Merchant Associations in Pre-Industrial Europe].

==Legal status==
A standard definition of an unincorporated association was given by [[Frederick Lawton (judge)|Lord Justice Lawton]] in the [[English trust law]] case ''[[Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell]]'' (1981):&lt;ref&gt;[1981] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1981/2.html EWCA Civ 2], [1982] 1 WLR 522&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"unincorporated association" [means] two or more persons bound together for one or more common purposes, not being business purposes, by mutual undertakings, each having mutual duties and obligations, in an organisation which has rules which identify in whom control of it and its funds rests and upon what terms and which can be joined or left at will.&lt;ref&gt;The definition was for [[taxation|tax]] purposes, but was expressed to be of general application.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In most countries, an unincorporated association does not have [[legal person|separate legal personality]], and few members of the association usually enjoy [[limited liability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=XU, Y.  |author2=Ngai, N. P.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China. Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly. 40(2), 247–269 |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |url= http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/early/2009/07/23/0899764009340229.abstract |publisher=Nvs.sagepub.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some countries they are treated as having separate [[legal personality]] for tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom an unincorporated association is assessable to [[corporation tax]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of their lack of legal personality, [[Will (law)|legacies]] to unincorporated associations are sometimes subject to general common law prohibitions against [[Purpose trust#Unincorporated associations|purpose trusts]].

Associations that are organized for profit or financial gain are usually called [[partnership]]s.&lt;ref&gt;In most [[common law]] legal systems, partnership is defined by statute as "the relationship which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit"&lt;/ref&gt; A special kind of partnership is a [[co-operative]] which is usually founded on one person&amp;mdash;one vote principle and distributes its profits according to the amount of goods produced or bought by the members. Associations may take the form of a [[non-profit organization]] or they may be [[not-for-profit corporation]]s; this does not mean that the association cannot make benefits from its activity, but all the benefits must be reinvested. Most associations have some kind of document or documents that regulate the way in which the body meets and operates. Such an instrument is often called the organization's bylaws, constitution, regulations, or agreement of association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 85|edition = 2nd|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common law==

===England and Wales===
{{Main article|Unincorporated associations in English law}}
Under [[English law]], an unincorporated association consists of two or more members bound by the rules of a society which has at some point in time, been founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettit |first=Philip |year=2009 |title=Equity and the Law of Trusts|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19956102-5  |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several theories have been proposed as to the way that such associations hold rights. A transfer may be considered to have been made to the association's members directly as [[joint tenants]] or [[tenants in common]]. Alternatively, the funds transferred may be considered to have been under the terms of a private [[purpose trusts in English law|purpose trust]]. Many purpose trusts fail for want of a [[beneficiary]] and this may therefore may result in the gift failing. However, some purpose trusts are valid, and, accordingly, some cases have decided that the rights associated with unincorporated associations are held on this basis. The dominant theory, however, is that the rights are transferred to the members or officers absolutely, perhaps on trust for the members, but are importantly bound by contracts ''[[inter se]]''.&lt;ref name="pettit6265"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettit |first=Philip |year=2009 |title=Equity and the Law of Trusts|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19956102-5  |pages=62–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, on dissolution, the distribution of these rights depends on how they were held. A purpose trust may by its nature survive the dissolution of the association, or it may not. If it fails as a result of the dissolution, then the rights will be held on [[resulting trusts in English law|resulting trust]] for the contributors, unless they can be shown to have renounced their right to such a trust in their favour. If the rights are held subject to contract, then they will be divided among the surviving membership upon dissolution, according to the terms of the contracts ''inter se'' or an implied term according to contribution. If, as a result of this contract or statute, no member can claim, the rights will pass to the Crown as ''[[bona vacantia]]''. This conclusion has also been suggested where the association dissolves because only one member remains, although this has been doubted by some commentators who believe the last members should be entitled to the rights.&lt;ref name="pettit6265"/&gt;

===Scotland===
[[Scottish law]] on unincorporated associations is essentially the same as English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/download_file/view/357/ |title=Report on Unincorporated Associations |publisher=Scottish Law Commission |id=SCOT LAW COM No 217 |date=November 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2014 |quote=We are not aware of any material differences between the law of Scotland and the law of England and Wales regarding unincorporated associations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Each state sets its own laws as to what constitutes an unincorporated association and how it is to be treated under the laws. In the United States, voluntary associations which were incorporated were "pre-eminent" in collective action.&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Companies: Organizational Aspects of Religion and Religious Aspects of Organizations, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5OBplT1ehtgC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p108]. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[California]], during the 1980s, then [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] [[Los Angeles County District Attorney|district attorney]] [[Ira Reiner]] decided to use California's unincorporated associations law to attack [[street gangs]] and the habit of their members of tagging [[graffiti]] in public spaces, in an attempt to abate vandalism and to recover cleanup costs. He sued the street gangs by name, with cases titled such as ''City of Los Angeles v. [[Bloods|The Bloods]]'' and ''City of Los Angeles v. [[Crips|The Crips]]'', which then allowed the city to go after any member of the street gang, as a member of the unincorporated association being sued, for damages resulting from graffiti tagging involving that gang's name{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.
* In [[Texas]], state law has statutes concerning unincorporated non-profit associations that allow unincorporated associations that meet certain criteria to operate as entities independent of their members, with the right to own property, make contracts, sue and be sued, with limited liability for their officers and members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonprofit Organizations|url=http://www.sos.state.tx.us/corp/nonprofit_org.shtml|publisher=Texas Secretary of State|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New York (state)|New York]] state law regarding unincorporated associations actually gives members of the association more protection against liability than that given to either stockholders of [[corporation]]s or members of [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]]. This was noted in the case{{which|date=April 2013}} of the [[Associated Press]] organization, because the members of the AP are not liable for damages for the organization's actions unless the association as a whole approved it.

===Australia===
In most Australian states and territories, a similar set of laws allows not-for-profit associations to become legal entities with a limit to the liability of their members. An example of such a law, the Associations Incorporation Act that is in force in South Australia, allows for the creation of a legal entity able to buy and sell land and in general, enter into legally binding contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Associations Incorporation Act 1985|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/ASSOCIATIONS%20INCORPORATION%20ACT%201985.aspx|publisher=Government of South Australia, Attorney-General's Department|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many clubs and societies begin life as an unincorporated body and seek to attain incorporated status to protect its members from legal liability and in many cases to seek government financial assistance only available to an incorporated body. Clubs and societies wishing to incorporate must meet the provisions of the relevant state act and lodge their constitution with the corresponding state government authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to incorporate|url=http://www.ocba.sa.gov.au/Associations/how/index.html|publisher=The Government of South Australia, Consumer &amp; Business Services|accessdate=17 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924075924/http://www.ocba.sa.gov.au/Associations/how/index.html|archive-date=24 September 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
Certain [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] systems classify an '''association''' as a special form of [[contract]]ual relationship.

===Canada===
Under the [[Civil Code of Quebec|Quebec Civil Code]] an association is categorized as a type of statutory specific contract set forth in a constitution. An association can become incorporated with its own legal identity so that it may, e.g., open a bank account, enter into contracts (rent real estate, hire employees, take out an insurance policy), or sue or be sued.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===France===
In [[France]], all voluntary associations are non-profit. They may count as unincorporated (''association non-déclarée'') or incorporated (''association déclarée''), and are created in terms of and governed by the [[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau|Waldeck-Rousseau]] Act 1901. This is why ''[[:fr:Association loi 1901|association loi (de) 1901]]'' is subjoined to their name, except in [[Alsace]]-[[Moselle]] area which is governed by local law in this regard (the area was German in 1901) and are therefore called ''[[:fr:Association loi 1908|association loi (de) 1908]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}. If the association responding to defined criteria, like social or medical help for example, they can be declared "public utility association" (''association d'utilité publique'') by French authorities. Associations act 1901 let an important large of freedom about internal operation, like direction or authorized members for example.

===Germany===
{{Main article|Eingetragener Verein}}
The [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]] sets out different rights and rules for an unincorporated association (''nicht eingetragener Verein'') with legal identity (''Vereine'', art. 21-79 [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]) versus an incorporated association (''eingetragener Verein'') with full [[legal person]]ality, which the law treats as partnerships (''Gesellschaften'', art. 705-740 [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]). Associations can be for-profit (''wirtschaftlicher Verein''), non-for-profit (''Idealverein''), or public (''gemeinnütziger Verein'').{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], many non-profit organizations (NPOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are established as registered  nonprofit associations (Hebrew ''amutah,'' plural ''amutot'') (some are established as public benefit companies (Hebrew ''Chevrah LeTo’elet Hatzibur'') not to be confused with [[public benefit corporation]]s). ‘‘Amutot’’ are regulated by the Associations Law, 1980. An ''amutah'' is a body corporate, though not a company. The ''amutah'' is successor to the Ottoman Society which predated the State of Israel, and was established by the now-superseded Ottoman Societies Law of 1909, based on the French law of 1901. An ''amutah'' must register with the ''Rasham Ha’amutot'' ('Registrar of Amutot'), under the purview of the ''Rashot Hata’agidim'' ('Corporations Authority') of the [[Ministry_of_Justice_(Israel)|Ministry of Justice]].

==Freedom of association==
The freedom of association stands in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml|publisher=The United Nations|accessdate= September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Cquote|Article 20
:(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
:(2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association.}}

[[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] also protects the right to [[freedom of assembly]] and association.

{{Cquote|Article 11 – Freedom of assembly and association

# Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.
# No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.}}

{{War}}

'''War''' is a state of armed conflict between [[State (polity)|states]], [[government]]s, [[Society|societies]] and informal [[paramilitary]] groups, such as [[mercenaries]], [[insurgent]]s and [[militia]]s. It is generally characterized by extreme [[violence]], [[aggression]], destruction, and mortality, using [[Regular army|regular]] or [[Irregular military|irregular]] [[military forces]]. '''Warfare''' refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warfare|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/warfare|website=Cambridge Dictionary|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Total war]] is warfare that is not restricted to purely [[legitimate military target]]s, and can result in massive [[civilian casualties|civilian]] or other [[non-combatant]] suffering and [[Casualty (person)|casualties]].

The [[war studies|scholarly study of war]] is sometimes called polemology ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}} {{Respell|POL|ə|MOL|ə|jee}}), from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''polemos'', meaning "war", and ''[[-logy]]'', meaning "the study of".

While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of [[human nature]],&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 67, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.&lt;ref name="Sage Publications"&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2006 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Friedman | first2= Jonathan | title= Globalization and Violence, Vol. 3: Globalizing War and Intervention | url= https://www.academia.edu/3587732 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Gari-Melchers-War-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Mural of War (1896), by [[Gari Melchers]]]]
The English word ''war'' derives from the late [[Old English]] (circa.1050) words ''wyrre'' and ''werre'', from [[Old French]] ''werre'' (also ''guerre'' as in modern French), in turn from the [[Franks|Frankish]] *''werra'', ultimately deriving from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''werzō'' 'mixture, confusion'. The word is related to the [[Old Saxon]] ''werran'', [[Old High German]] ''werran'', and the German ''verwirren'', meaning “to confuse”, “to perplex”, and “to bring into confusion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=war |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=war |year=2010 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{Main|Outline of war#Types of war|l1=Types of war}}

War must entail some degree of confrontation using weapons and other [[military technology and equipment]] by armed forces employing [[military tactics]] and [[operational art]] within a broad [[military strategy]] subject to [[military logistics]]. Studies of war by military theorists throughout [[military history]] have sought to identify the [[philosophy of war]], and to reduce it to a [[military science]]. Modern military science considers several factors before a [[Defence policy|national defence policy]] is created to allow a war to commence: the environment in the area(s) of combat operations, the posture national forces will adopt on the commencement of a war, and the type of warfare troops will be engaged in.
* [[Asymmetric warfare]] is a conflict between [[belligerent]]s of drastically different levels of military capability and/or size.
* [[Biological warfare]], or germ warfare, is the use of weaponized biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
* [[Chemical warfare]] involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat. Poison gas as a [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] was principally used during [[World War I]], and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more than 100,000 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, Second Edition |author=D. Hank Ellison |date=August 24, 2007 |pages=567–70 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-0-8493-1434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Civil war]] is a war between forces belonging to the same nation or political entity.
* [[Conventional warfare]] is declared war between states in which [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[biological weapon|biological]], or [[chemical weapons]] are not used or see limited deployment.
* [[Cyberwarfare]] involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's information systems.
* [[Insurgency]] is a rebellion against authority, when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents (lawful combatants). An insurgency can be fought via counter-insurgency warfare, and may also be opposed by measures to protect the population, and by political and economic actions of various kinds aimed at undermining the insurgents' claims against the incumbent regime.
* [[Information warfare]] is the application of destructive force on a large scale against information assets and systems, against the [[computer]]s and [[Computer network|networks]] that support the four critical infrastructures (the power grid, communications, financial, and transportation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/eprint/snyder/infowarfare.htm |title=Information Warfare |last=Lewis |first=Brian C. |date= |website=Federation of American Scientist |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970617035106/http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/snyder/infowarfare.htm |archive-date=17 June 1997 |dead-url=yes |access-date=27 Feb 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nuclear warfare]] is warfare in which [[nuclear weapon]]s are the primary, or a major, method of achieving capitulation.
* [[Total war]] is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the [[laws of war]], placing no limits on [[legitimate military target]]s, using [[weapon]]s and [[Military tactics|tactics]] resulting in significant [[civilian casualties]], or demanding a [[war effort]] requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian population.
* [[Unconventional warfare]], the opposite of conventional warfare, is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict.
* [[War of aggression]] is a war for conquest or gain rather than self-defense; this can be the basis of [[war crime]]s under [[customary international law]].
* [[War of liberation]], Wars of national liberation or national liberation revolutions are conflicts fought by nations to gain independence. The term is used in conjunction with wars against foreign powers (or at least those perceived as foreign) to establish separate sovereign states for the rebelling nationality. From a different point of view, these wars are called insurgencies, rebellions, or wars of independence.

[[File:War deaths caused by warfare.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|The percentages of men killed in war in eight tribal societies, and Europe and the U.S. in the 20th century. (Lawrence H. Keeley, archeologist)]]
The earliest recorded evidence of war belongs to the Mesolithic cemetery [[Site 117]], which has been determined to be approximately 14,000 years old. About forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed signs of violent death.&lt;ref name="Keeley page 37"&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H: ''War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage''. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rise of the [[State (polity)|state]] some 5,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared, ''Guns, Germs and Steel''&lt;/ref&gt; military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of [[gunpowder]] and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, ''"One source claims that 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20)."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conway W.

Jongman &amp; J.M.G. van der Dennen, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132823/http://rint.rechten.rug.nl/rth/dennen/hoax.htm 'The Great "War Figures" Hoax: an investigation in polemomythology']&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the following regarding one of the proponents of this estimate: "In addition, perhaps feeling that the war casualties figure was improbably high, he changed "approximately 3,640,000,000 human beings have been killed by war or the diseases produced by war" to "approximately 1,240,000,000 human beings...&amp;c."" The lower figure is more plausible,&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Muehlenkamp, [http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/germs-vs-guns-or-death-from-mass.html 'Germs vs. guns, or death from mass violence in perspective']&lt;/ref&gt; but could also be on the high side, considering that the 100 deadliest acts of mass violence between 480 BCE and 2002 CE (wars and other man-made disasters with at least 300,000 and up to 66 million victims) claimed about 455 million human lives in total.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew White, ''Atrocitology: Humanity's 100 Deadliest Achievements'', Canongate Books Ltd. (20 October 2011), {{ISBN|0857861220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitive warfare is estimated to have accounted for 15.1 % of deaths and claimed 400 million victims.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew White, [http://necrometrics.com/pre1700b.htm#Primitive 'Primitive War']&lt;/ref&gt; Added to the aforementioned (and perhaps too high) figure of 1,240 million between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, this would mean a total of 1,640,000,000 people killed by war (including deaths from famine and disease caused by war) throughout the history and pre-history of mankind. For comparison, an estimated 1,680,000,000 people died from infectious diseases in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;David McCandless, [http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/20th-century-death '20th Century Death']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuclear warfare]] breaking out in August 1988, when nuclear arsenals were at peak level, and the aftermath thereof, could have reduced human population from 5,150,000,000 by 1,850,000,000 to 3,300,000,000 within a period of about one year, according to a projection that did not consider "the most severe predictions concerning [[nuclear winter]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wm. Robert Johnston, [http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/nuclearwar1.html 'The Effects of a Global Thermonuclear War']&lt;/ref&gt; This would have been a proportional reduction of the world’s population exceeding the reduction caused in the 14th century by the [[Black Death]], and comparable in proportional terms with the plague’s impact on Europe's population in 1346–53.

In ''[[War Before Civilization]]'', Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], says approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |title=Review: War Before Civilization |publisher=Brneurosci.org |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=2011-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121021158/http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many fought constantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|last=Spengler|date=4 July 2006|work=Asia Times Online|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Debra L., Ryan P. Harrod, and Ventura R. Pérez, eds. 2012. ''The Bioarchaeology of Violence''. Gainesville: University Press of Florida. http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=MARTI002&lt;/ref&gt; Keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy raids.&lt;ref name="Keeley page 55"&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H: ''War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage''. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Rubinstein]] wrote "Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty...'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [i.e., after the coming of the Europeans].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

[[File:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba IV.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Japanese [[samurai]] attacking a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ship, 13th century]]
In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place.&lt;ref name="War"&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/CG/world-war-one2.html World War One – A New Kind of War | Part II], From ''14 – 18 Understanding the Great War'', by Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the emergence of the Left as a force to be reckoned with.&lt;ref name = "Kolko 1994 xviitoxviii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|1994|p=xvii–xviii}}: "War in this century became an essential precondition for the emergence of a numerically powerful Left, moving it from the margins to the very center of European politics during 1917–18 and of all world affairs after 1941".&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its destructiveness (see [[mutual assured destruction]]), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear [[World War III]]. At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it altogether. These efforts materialized in the forms of the [[League of Nations]], and its successor, the United Nations.

In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed [[atom bomb]], [[Albert Einstein]] famously stated, "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."&lt;ref name="EinsteinWWIV"&gt;{{cite web|year=1947 |url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/action/urgent-actions/einstein/ |title=Albert Einstein: Man of Imagination |accessdate=2010-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604080636/http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/action/urgent-actions/einstein/ |archivedate=4 June 2010 }} Nuclear Age Peace Foundation paper

[[Mao Zedong]] urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if "half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Instant Wisdom: Beyond the Little Red Book |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946612-2,00.html |date= 20 September 1976 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate= 14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Security Report 2005]] documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's "Peace and Conflict" study indicated the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Joseph, J.

Human history had numerous wars coming and going, but the average number of people dying from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10 people dying per 100,000. However, major wars over shorter periods have resulted in much higher casualty rates, with 100-200 casualties per 100,000 over a few years. While conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not generally true. For instance, the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648) had about the same number of casualties per capita as [[World War I]], although it was higher during [[World War II]] (WWII). That said, overall the number of casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times. Quite to the contrary, on a global scale the time since WWII has been unusually peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace/|title=War and Peace|work=Our World in Data|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Largest by death toll===
{{Main|List of wars by death toll|Outline of war#Wars}}
The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is [[World War II]], from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the [[Mongol conquests]]&lt;ref&gt;*The Cambridge History of China: Alien regimes and border states, 907–1368, 1994, p. 622, cited by White
&lt;br /&gt;*Matthew White (2011-11-07). The Great Big Book of Horrible Things: The Definitive Chronicle of History's 100 Worst Atrocities.&lt;/ref&gt; at up to 60 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in [[modern history]] may have been the [[Paraguayan War]] (see [[Paraguayan War casualties]]). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmc=4340604|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Richard Smalley]] identified war as the sixth biggest problem (out of ten) facing humanity for the next fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;"Top Ten Problems of Humanity for Next 50 Years", Professor R. E. Smalley, Energy &amp; NanoTechnology Conference, Rice University, May 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, [[famine]], large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] or civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tanton|first1=John|title=The Social Contract|date=2002|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=John|title=The pursuit of happiness|date=1992|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baxter|first1=Richard|title=Humanizing the Laws of War|date=2013|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]] in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians).&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin'', Basic Books, 2010, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of [[propaganda]] by some or all parties in the conflict,&lt;ref&gt;''Dying and Death: Inter-disciplinary Perspectives''.  p. 153, Asa Kasher (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and increased revenues by [[weapons manufacturers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chew|first1=Emry|title=Arming the Periphery|date=2012|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (which is sometimes considered part of [[World War II]], or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over 60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls.&lt;ref name="users.erols"&gt;McFarlane, Alan: ''The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap'', Blackwell 2003, {{ISBN|0-631-18117-2}},

===On military personnel===
[[Military personnel]] subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries, including depression, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], disease, injury, and death.

{{Quote|In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.|''No More Heroes'', Richard Gabriel&lt;ref name="War"/&gt;}}

During World War II, research conducted by [[US Army]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[S.L.A. Marshall]] found, on average, 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lt. Col. Dave Grossman|title=On Killing – The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War &amp; Society|publisher= Little, Brown &amp; Co., |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Civil War Collector’s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These studies suggest most military personnel resist firing their weapons in combat, that – as some theorists argue – human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt; Swank and Marchand’s WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;

[[United States military casualties of war]] since 1775 have totaled over two million. Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilized in [[World War I]], 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, Martin (2000), ''[http://www.jimmyatkinson.com/papers/versaillestreaty.html#endnotes The Treaty of Versailles and its Consequences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512224100/http://www.jimmyatkinson.com/papers/versaillestreaty.html |date=12 May 2008 }}'', New York: Longman&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, during the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Royal Navy]] reported it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 died of disease or were 'missing'.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Turberville (2006).

===On civilians===
{{see also|Civilian casualties}}
[[File:The Hanging by Jacques Callot.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Les Grandes Misères de la guerre]]'' depict the destruction unleashed on civilians during the [[Thirty Years' War]].]]
Most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to [[famine]], disease, and death in the [[civilian]] [[population]]). During the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Europe, the population of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was reduced by 15 to 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://necrometrics.com/pre1700a.htm#30YrW The Thirty Years War (1618–48)], Alan McFarlane, The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe – Demographics]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as [[genocide]], while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war.

Most estimates of [[World War II casualties]] indicate around 60 million people died, 40 million of which were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II Fatalities|url=http://www.secondworldwar.co.uk/casualty.html|accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaths in the [[Soviet Union]] were around [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|27 million]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm|title=Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead | date=9 May 2005 | accessdate=6 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it otherwise would have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Geoffrey A. |last=Hosking|title=Rulers And Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDMVMqDvp4QC&amp;pg=PA242|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02178-5|pages=242–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the economy===
{{see also|Military Keynesianism}}

Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay [[war reparations]] to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Some economists{{who|date=July 2016}} believe war can stimulate a country's economy (high government spending for World War II is often credited with bringing the U.S. out of the [[Great Depression]] by most [[Keynesian]] economists) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and [[World War I]], warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gatrell|first1=Peter|title=Russia's First World War : A Social and Economic History|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781317881391|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===

The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, {{convert|40000|mi|0|abbr=on}} of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the arts===
War leads to [[forced migration]] causing potentially large displacements of population. Among forced migrants there are usually relatively large shares of artists and other types of creative people, causing so the war effects to be particularly harmful for the country’s creative potential in the long-run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jan Borowiecki | first1 = Karol | year = 2012 | title = Are composers different?

In war, cultural institutions, such as libraries, can become "targets in themselves; their elimination was a way to denigrate and demoralize the enemy population." The impact such destruction can have on a society is important because "in an era in which competing ideologies fuel internal and international conflict, the destruction of libraries and other items of cultural significance is neither random nor irrelevant. Preserving the world’s repositories of knowledge is crucial to ensuring that the darkest moments of history do not endlessly repeat themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, K. (2007).

==Aims==

Entities deliberately contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate ''war aims'' as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Classification ===

Tangible/intangible aims:
* Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of territory (as in the German goal of [[Lebensraum]] in the first half of the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]).
* Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or reputation&lt;ref&gt;
Welch distinguishes: "tangible goods such as arms, wealth, and – provided they are strategically or economically valuable – territory and resources" from "intangible goods such as credibility and reputation" – {{cite book

==Limiting and stopping==
[[File:Washington March15 2003-02.jpg|thumb|Anti-war rally in Washington, D.C., March 15, 2003]]
{{main|Anti-war movement}}
{{See also|Aestheticization of violence}}

Religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the [[Second Vatican Council]] document ''Gaudiem et Spes'': "Any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against God and man himself. It merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html PASTORAL CONSTITUTION ON THE CHURCH IN THE MODERN WORLD GAUDIUM ET SPES PROMULGATED BY HIS HOLINESS, POPE PAUL VI ON DECEMBER 7, 1965]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in response to the United States [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Protests [[Opposition to the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|opposing the War in Afghanistan]] occurred in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Organizations like [[Stop the War Coalition]], based in the United Kingdom, worked on campaigning against the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop the War Coalition: Timeline of Events 2001–2011 |url=http://stopwar.org.uk/index.php/about/timeline-of-stop-the-war-events-2001-2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530053507/http://www.stopwar.org.uk/index.php/about/timeline-of-stop-the-war-events-2001-2011 |archivedate=30 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It won the recognition of President Calderon, who began war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Calderon apologizes to drug war victims |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2011/06/20116244495608277.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of motivation==
[[File:Szigetvar 1566.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[List of campaigns of Suleiman the Magnificent|Ottoman campaign]] for territorial [[Ottoman wars in Europe|expansion in Europe]] in 1566]]
There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus about which are most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy |first=Jack S. |year=1989 |title=The Causes of War: A Review of Theories and Evidence |journal=Behavior, Society and Nuclear War |volume=I |page=295 |editor1-first=Philip E. |editor1-last=Tetlock |editor2-first=Jo L. |editor2-last=Husbands |editor3-first=Robert |editor3-last=Jervis |editor4-first=Paul C. |editor4-last=Stern |editor5-first=Charles |editor5-last=Tilly |accessdate=4 May 2012 |url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1989%20Causes%20of%20War.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922150721/http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1989%20Causes%20of%20War.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl von Clausewitz]] said, 'Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.'&lt;ref&gt;Clausewitz, Carl Von (1976), ''On War'' (Princeton University Press) p. 593&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalytic===
Dutch psychoanalyst [[Joost Meerloo]] held that, "War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction."&lt;ref name = "meerloo"&gt;
| A. M. Meerloo, M.D. ''The Rape of the Mind'' (2009) p. 134, Progressive Press, {{ISBN|978-1-61577-376-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus war can sometimes be a means by which man's own frustration at his inability to master his own self is expressed and temporarily relieved via his unleashing of destructive behavior upon ''others.'' In this destructive scenario, these ''others'' are made to serve as the scapegoat of unspoken and subconscious frustrations and fears.

Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and [[John Bowlby]] have argued human beings are [[Inheritance|inherently]] violent.&lt;ref&gt;Durbin, E.F.L. and John Bowlby. ''Personal Aggressiveness and War'' 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; This aggressiveness is fueled by [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]] and [[Psychological projection|projection]] where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other [[race (human classification)|races]], religions, nations or [[Ideology|ideologies]]. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.

The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of [[Melanie Klein]], thought war was the paranoid or projective “elaboration” of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;(Fornari 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our “love need”: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.

Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. "The Origin of Great Wars." ''The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars.'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Maurice N. ''War and the Human Race.'' 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.

{{Quotation|Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.|

Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and [[competition]] over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meyer. Social Evolution in Franz M. Wuketits and Christoph Antweiler (eds.) Handbook of Evolution The Evolution of Human Societies and Cultures Wiley-VCH Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as [[chimpanzee]]s,&lt;ref name = "ApesWar"&gt;{{cite news

Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states.&lt;ref&gt;Johan M.G. van der Dennen. 1995. ''The Origin of War: Evolution of a Male-Coalitional Reproductive Strategy''. Origin Press, Groningen, 1995 chapters 1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist and linguist [[Steven Pinker]] argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Pinker |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |title=Steven Pinker – Books – The Blank Slate |publisher=Pinker.wjh.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510091413/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |archivedate=2011-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}  He also argued that in order to have credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation ("[[honor]]").{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which "coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups", is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking "tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors".&lt;ref name="HumanPrimateAggression"&gt;''Mind the Gap: Tracing the Origins of Human Universals'' By Peter M. Kappeler, Joan B. Silk, 2009, Chapter 8, "Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans; The Case for a Unified Theory", Margaret C. Crofoot and Richard W. Wrangham&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashley Montagu]] strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Ashley (1976), ''The Nature of Human Aggression'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Montagu's argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the [[Chewong]] and [[Semai people|Semai]] of the Malay peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Signe and Roy Willis, eds. (1989) ''Societies at Peace: Anthropological Perspectives''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Bobbi S. Low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/eugene.burnstein/files/35._low_93_evolutionaryperspective_war.pdf "An Evolutionary Perspective on War"], Bobbi S.

===Economic===
[[File:Disabled Iraqi T-54A, T-55, Type 59 or Type 69 tank and burning Kuwaiti oil field.jpg|thumb|Kuwaiti [[oil well]]s on fire, during the [[Gulf War]], 1 March 1991]]
War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for [[natural resource]]s and for wealth. War has also been linked to [[economic development]] by economic historians and development economists studying [[state-building]] and [[fiscal capacity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Noel D.|last2=Koyama|first2=Mark|date=2015|title=States and Economic Growth: Capacity and Constraints|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/md0bpim4r69d5eq/State%20Capacity%20Survey%2010-5-15%20Draft.pdf?dl=0|journal=George Mason University WORKING PAPER|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme [[right (politics)|right]] of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Griffin]] and Matthew Feldman, eds., ''Fascism: Fascism and Culture'', New York: [[Routledge]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Mike. ''[[Social Darwinism]] in European and American Thought, 1860–1945: Nature as Model and Nature as Threat'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including [[Presidents of the United States]] and U.S. [[General officer|Generals]], expressed support for an economic view of war.

===Marxist===
The [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great ([[Imperialism|imperialist]]) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the [[free market]] and [[Social class|class system]]. Part of the theory is that war will disappear once a [[world revolution]], over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred. Marxist philosopher [[Rosa Luxemburg]] theorized that [[imperialism]] was the result of capitalist countries needing new [[Market (economics)|markets]]. Expansion of the [[means of production]] is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in [[consumer demand]]. Since the workers in a [[capitalist economy]] would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1955/08/imp-crit.html |title=The Marxist Theory of Imperialism and its Critics |first=Einde |last=O'Callaghan |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] --&gt;

Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and youth bulge theories:

====Malthusian====
[[File:Aerial view of a US helicopter as it flies over a Mogadishu residential area.JPEG|thumb|right|U.S. Marine helicopter on patrol in Somalia as part of the [[Unified Task Force]], 1992]]
[[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian theories]] see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.

[[Pope Urban II]] in 1095, on the eve of the [[First Crusade]], spoke:
{{quote|For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lend me your ears: great speeches in history |first=William |last=Safire |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-393-05931-1 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geography: an integrated approach |first=David |last=Waugh |publisher=[[Nelson Thornes]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-17-444706-1 |page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Youth bulge====

A youth bulge is evident for [[Demographics of Africa|Africa]], and to a lesser extent in some countries in West Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central America.]]

According to Heinsohn, who proposed [[youth bulge]] theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the "fighting age" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with [[total fertility rate]]s as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson, John L. (2002): "The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Trends"[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cia/helgerson2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G. (2006): "Demography and War" [https://de.scribd.com/doc/310263543/Gunnar-Heinsohn-Demography-and-War (online)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinsohn saw both past "Christianist" European colonialism and imperialism, as well as today's Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G. (2005): "Population, Conquest and Terror in the 21st Century" [https://de.scribd.com/doc/310265022/Gunnar-Heinsohn-Population-Conquest-and-Terror-in-the-21st-Century (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; Among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the [[French Revolution]] of 1789,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack A. Goldstone|title=Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-T9dR7nWDUC|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=4 March 1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08267-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effect of economic depression upon the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Moller, Herbert (1968): ‘Youth as a Force in the Modern World’, ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 10: 238–60; 240–44&lt;/ref&gt; The 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge.&lt;ref&gt;Diessenbacher, Hartmut (1994): ''Kriege der Zukunft: Die Bevölkerungsexplosion gefährdet den Frieden''.

===Rationalist===
[[File:LRPs directing artillery.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. soldiers directing artillery on enemy trucks in A Shau Valley, April 1968]]
[[Rationalism (international relations)|Rationalism]] is an [[international relations theory]] or framework. Rationalism (and [[Neorealism (international relations)]]) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Rationalist Explanations for War|last = Fearon|first = James D.|date = Summer 1995|journal = International Organization |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=379–414|doi = 10.1017/s0020818300033324|pmid = |jstor=2706903}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under a [[game theory]] approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. In "Rationalist Explanations for War", [[James Fearon]] examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:
* Issue indivisibilities
* Incentives to misrepresent or [[information asymmetry]]
* Commitment problems&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"Issue indivisibility" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other.

[[File:U.S. Marines in Operation Allen Brook (Vietnam War) 001.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Marines direct a concentration of fire at the enemy, Vietnam, 8 May 1968]]
"[[Information asymmetry]] with incentives to misrepresent" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state's victory or loss. For instance, [[Geoffrey Blainey]] argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, "war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Blainey|title=Causes of War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mcknp3tt0LMC&amp;pg=PA114|year=1988|edition=3rd|page=114|accessdate=2016-03-19|isbn=9780029035917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Powell | first1 = Robert | year = 2002 | title = Bargaining Theory and International Conflict | url = | journal = Annual Review of Political Science | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of [[cognitive bias]],&lt;ref&gt;Chris Cramer, 'Civil War is Not a Stupid Thing', {{ISBN|978-1850658214}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are still "as rational as you and me".&lt;ref&gt;From point 10 of [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think (article)], accessed 16 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to philosopher [[Iain King]], "Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury...."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from [[Iain King]], in [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think]&lt;/ref&gt;  King asserts that "Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in [[GroupThink]]" which is faulty, but still rational.&lt;ref&gt;Point 6 in [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lake|first1=David A.|title=Two Cheers for Bargaining Theory: Assessing Rationalist Explanations of the Iraq War|journal=International Security|date=November 2010|pages=7–52|doi=10.1162/isec_a_00029|volume=35|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political science===
The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] following [[World War I]]. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the [[Correlates of War]] Project, Peter Brecke and the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first proposed by [[Kenneth Waltz]] in ''[[Man, the State, and War]]'' and has been often used by political scientists since then.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|143}}

====System-level====

There are several different [[international relations theory]] schools. Supporters of [[realism in international relations]] argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the [[security dilemma]].&lt;ref name=Levy1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Jack S.|title=The Causes of War and the Conditions of Peace|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=Jun 1998|volume=1|pages=139–65|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.1.1.139|url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1998%20causes%20of%20war%20%26%20conditions%20of%20peace.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TXiBeznJ?url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1998%20causes%20of%20war%20%26%20conditions%20of%20peace.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}}

Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]], and the [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealist]] school represented by scholars such as [[Kenneth Waltz]] and [[John Mearsheimer]], two main sub-theories are:
# [[Balance of power (international relations)|Balance of power]] theory: States have the goal of preventing a single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In this view, an international system with more equal distribution of power is more stable, and "movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing."&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|147}} However, evidence has shown power [[Polarity (international relations)|polarity]] is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of wars.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|147–48}}
# [[Power transition theory]]: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to preemptively suppress them.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|148}} On this view, unlike for balance-of-power theory, wars become ''more'' probable when power is more equally distributed. This "power preponderance" hypothesis has empirical support.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|148}}
The two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|148}}

[[Liberalism (international relations)|Liberalism]] as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations.  Realists{{who|date=July 2016}} respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|149}} Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|150}} Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war don't necessarily trade less with each other.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|150}}

====Societal-level====
* [[Diversionary foreign policy|Diversionary theory]], also known as the "scapegoat hypothesis", suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to rally domestic popular support.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|152}} This is supported by literature showing out-group hostility [[Realistic conflict theory|enhances]] in-group [[Group cohesiveness|bonding]], and a significant domestic "rally effect" has been demonstrated when conflicts begin.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|152–13}} However, studies examining the increased use of force as a function of need for internal political support are more mixed.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|152–53}} U.S. war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent U.S. leaders have supported diversionary theory.&lt;ref name="MilitaryAdventurism"&gt;{{cite web| year = 2001| url = http://www.bepress.com/peps/vol7/iss3/3/| title = Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy (p. 19)| accessdate = 2010-02-07| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110707224412/http://www.bepress.com/peps/vol7/iss3/3/| archivedate = 7 July 2011| df = dmy-all}} More recently studies (Lebow 2008, Lindemann 2010) demonstrated that striving for self-esteem (i.e. virile self images), and recognition as a Great Power or non-recognition (exclusion and punishment of great powers, denying traumatic historical events) is a principal cause of international conflict and war.
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual-level====

These theories suggest differences in people's personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|157}} For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by [[bounded rationality]] and various [[cognitive biases]],&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|157}} such as [[prospect theory]].&lt;ref name=Levy1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Jack S.|title=Prospect Theory, Rational Choice, and International Relations|journal=International Studies Quarterly|date=Mar 1997|volume=41|issue=1|pages=87–112|url=http://www.ou.edu/uschina/texts/Levy.97.ISQ.ProspectTheory.pdf|doi=10.1111/0020-8833.00034|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075824/http://www.ou.edu/uschina/texts/Levy.97.ISQ.ProspectTheory.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
[[File:Morgen nach der Schlacht967b.jpg|thumb|''Morning after the [[Battle of Waterloo]]'', by [[John Heaviside Clark]], 1816]]

The [[morality]] of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="DeForrest"&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest |first=Mark Edward |title=Conclusion |url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/ |website=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ |publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law |accessdate=August 1, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402204812/http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26 |archivedate=2 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the [[just war theory]], are ''[[jus ad bellum]]'' and ''[[Jus in bello]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest |first=Mark Edward |title=GENERALLY RECOGNIZED PRINCIPLES OF JUST WAR THEORY |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jus ad bellum'' (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Part II, Question 40|url=http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020212080058/http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 12, 2002|website=The Summa Theologica|publisher=Benziger Bros. edition, 1947|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosley|first=Alexander|title=The Jus Ad Bellum Convention|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|website=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jus in bello]]'' (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=The Principles Of Jus In Bello|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|website=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.&lt;ref name="Moseley"/&gt; Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.&lt;ref name="Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304"&gt;{{cite book|last=Codevilla, Seabury|first=Angelo, Paul|title=War: Ends and Means|year=1989|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-465-09067-9|page=304|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157488610X/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0465090672&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0144DHEVCX1XCVMJXAZQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism asserts that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so civilization can flourish. These are broad [[archetypes]] for the general position that [[the ends justify the means]]. Lewis Coser, U.S. conflict theorist and sociologist, argued conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created. Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," ''CFM Research'', Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alliantiewapen Nassau Loon-Heinsberg - Alliance coat of arms of Nassau Loon-Heinsberg - Wapenboek Nassau-Vianden - KB 1900 A 016, folium 20r.jpg|thumb|Alliance arms of [[Maria of Loon-Heinsberg]]. Arms of women were usually depicted on lozenges. Here, her family arms are impaled with those of her husband, [[Jan IV of Nassau]]. ]]

Due to the differing role of women in past society, special rules grew relating to the [[blazon]]ing of arms for women. The rules for women and heraldry developed differently from place to place and there is no one single rule that applies everywhere. In general, arms of women were most likely depicted not on shields but on [[Lozenge_(heraldry)|lonzeges]] or ovals. Different rules exist that depend on the woman's marital status and a married woman would also often make use of her husband's arms in addition to those from her family. In both the English&lt;ref name="ukcollege1"/&gt; and the Scottish&lt;ref name="hersocscot"/&gt; systems of heraldry these differences remain active.

==Characteristics==
===Escutcheons, crests, and other heraldic elements===
Heraldry has its origins from associations with warfare and the age of chivalry. The traditional shield was also associated with war and so women did not usually display familial arms on [[Escutcheon_(heraldry)|escutcheons]]. Rather, they could display these on various other shapes: more commonly the [[Lozenge_(heraldry)|lozenge]], an oval, or a [[Cartouche_(design)|cartouche]].

The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]]–a device that sits atop the shield on an [[armorial achievement]]–likewise was not accorded to heraldic devices of women as these had associations with warfare.

===Transmission===
In many heraldic traditions, arms generally are passed patrilineally. In other nations, in Canadian heraldry for example,  women may inherit arms on an equal basis with their brothers (if any). Women in Canada may also transmit their arms to their heirs, regardless of gender.{{refn|This system of equality for men and women is a result of provisions in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which guarantee, among other things, freedom from discrimination under the law on the basis of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charterofrights.ca/en/17_00_01 |title=Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms – Equality Rights |publisher=6074332 Canada Inc., in association with SailorJones Media Inc. |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[English heraldry|English]], [[Scottish Heraldry|Scottish]] and [[Northern Irish heraldry]], a [[woman]] may bear arms by inheritance from her father&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies1"&gt;{{ Citation | last=Fox-Davies | first=Arthur | lastauthoramp=yes | title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry | publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. | place= | volume= | edition= | year=2007 | quote=Every woman is entitled to bear upon a lozenge in her own lifetime the arms, quarterings, and difference marks which belonged to her father. | page=546 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSeEWjQCTIAC&amp;lpg=PA546&amp;dq=heraldic%20heiress&amp;pg=PA546#v=onepage&amp;q=heraldic%20heiress&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by grant to herself.  When unmarried, she displays her arms on a [[lozenge]] (a diamond shape) or on an oval or oval-like shape. Traditionally, a woman does not display her arms on a shield, as the shield originated with [[knights]] and warfare, and is thus viewed as fitting for a man, but not a woman.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
[[image: Coat of Arms of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.svg|thumb|left|The arms of the [[Duchess of Cambridge]] (right) impaled with those of her husband, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] (left)]] When married, a woman has the option of uniting her arms with those of her husband in what are called marital arms; their arms are [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]], meaning they are placed side by side in the same shield, with those of the man on the dexter (left, as seen from the front) and those of his wife on the sinister (right, as seen from the front).&lt;ref name="Boutell1"&gt;{{ Citation | last1=Beddoe | first1=Alan | last2=Galloway | first2=Strome  | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Beddoe's Canadian heraldry | publisher=Mika | place= | volume= | edition= | year=1981 | quote=If her husband is an armiger her arms leave the female lozenge and share her husband's shield, ie, are 'impaled' with his arms, his to the dexter (right) and hers to the sinister (left). | page=171 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QE5mAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=armigerous+women+shield&amp;dq=armigerous+women+shield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1aDjT4-2C8Xe0QHD39jfCQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one spouse belongs to the higher ranks of an [[British honours system#Current orders of chivalry|order of chivalry]], and is thereby entitled to surround his or her arms with a circlet of the order, it is usual to depict them on two separate shields tilted towards one another, this is termed "accollé".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[File:Coat of Arms of Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester.svg|thumb|Coat of Arms of [[Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester]] who is a heraldic heiress. Depicting her father's arms imposed over those of [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], her husband.]]
A married woman may also bear either her own arms or her husband's arms alone on a shield with the shield charged with a small lozenge to distinguish her from her husband.&lt;ref name="Slater"&gt;{{cite book|author=Slater,  Stephen|title=The  Complete  Book  of  Heraldry|year=2004|publisher=Anness  Pub.  Co.|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widowed woman usually displays the impaled arms on a lozenge-shaped shield, unless she is a heraldic heiress (see below).&lt;ref name="Fearn"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fearn, Jacqueline|title=Discovering Heraldry|year=1980|publisher=Shire|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heraldic Heiresses====
If the woman is an [[heraldic heiress]], her arms are shown on an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon of pretence]], which is a small shield in the centre of her husband's arms. When widowed, instead of showing the impaled arms on a lozenge, she continues to use her marital arms, but placed on a lozenge or oval.&lt;ref name="Fearn"/&gt; In England and Northern Ireland, if there is more than one surviving daughter, each transmits her father's arms on equal terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFriar1993|Friar 1993]], p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland however, only the eldest surviving daughter transmits her father's undifferenced arms to her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBurnett1997|Burnett 1997]], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian Heraldry===
{{main|Canadian heraldry}}
 
In [[Canadian heraldry]], women and men are treated equally for heraldic purpose, reflecting Canadian equality laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charterofrights.ca/en/17_00_01 |title=Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms - Equality Rights |publisher=6074332 Canada Inc., in association with SailorJones Media Inc. |date= |accessdate= June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore common to display the arms of women on shields, rather than on a lozenge or oval, but a woman may still choose to have her arms displayed on a traditional shape.

In many systems of heraldry, the arms of each living person must be unique. English heraldry has used armorial variants to distinguish the arms of brothers from their father's arms and from each other since the thirteenth century;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Boutell |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Boutell |title=The handbook to English heraldry |others=[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], ed |year=1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xdMAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Boutell%20Fox%20Davies&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Chapter XII}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is now normally done by the system of marks or ''brisures'' set up by the early Tudor herald [[John Writhe]].&lt;ref name="ukcollege1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/12.htm|title=The Law of Arms: The descent of arms|date=2004-04-10|publisher=College of Arms|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Canada adds a unique series of brisures for use by female children who inherit arms. As in other heraldic systems, these cadency marks are not always used;&lt;ref name="Royal Heraldry Society of Canada-Cadency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.heraldry.ca/course_canadian.htm|publisher=Royal Heraldry Society of Canada|title=Heraldry Examination|accessdate=2008-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in any case, when the heir succeeds (in Canada, the first child, whether male or female, according to strict [[primogeniture]]), the mark of cadency is removed and the heir uses the plain coat of arms.&lt;ref name="hersocscot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/beginners.html |title=Beginners Heraldry, The Heraldry Society of Scotland – UK Heraldry |publisher=The Heraldry Society of Scotland |date=2005-04-17 |accessdate=2008-11-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013201010/http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/beginners.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
