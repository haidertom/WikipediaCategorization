'''Anne Knight''' (2 November 1786 – 4 November 1862)&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; was a social reformer, abolitionist and a pioneer of [[feminism]]. She was at the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention|1840 Anti-Slavery convention]] where the need to improve women's rights became obvious.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In 1847 Knight produced what is considered the first leaflet for [[women's suffrage]]. She formed the first UK women's suffrage organisation in Sheffield in 1851.

==Family background==
Anne Knight was born in [[Chelmsford]] in 1786. She the daughter of William Knight (1756–1814), a [[Chelmsford, England|Chelmsford]] [[grocer]], and his wife Priscilla Allen (1753-1829). Her parent's families were both [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and several of their members took an active part in the [[Temperance movement|temperance]] and [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|anti-slavery]] movements.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Early efforts and frustrations==
In 1825 she was a member of the [[Chelmsford Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society]] when she toured Europe with a group of Quakers. The tour was part sightseeing but also took in good causes. Knight could speak in both French and German.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Knight worked closely with other leading abolitionist [[Thomas Clarkson]], [[Elizabeth Pease]] and [[Joseph Sturge]].

Her grandfather, [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]], is in the left foreground. Move your cursor to identify them or click the icon to enlarge}}
When women were prevented from participating in the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in [[London]] in 1840, Knight was outraged, and started to campaign for women's rights. A few women were included in the painting of the convention with Knight; these were [[Elizabeth Pease Nichol|Elizabeth Pease]], [[Amelia Opie]], [[Anne Isabella Noel Byron, 11th Baroness Wentworth|Baroness Byron]], [[Mary Anne Rawson]], [[Mrs John Beaumont]], [[John Harfield Tredgold|Elizabeth Tredgold]], [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s daughter-in-law and niece Mary and right at the back [[Lucretia Mott]].&lt;ref name=npg&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp00224&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=sit The Anti-Slavery Society Convention], 1840, [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]], accessed 19 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847 Knight produced what is considered the first leaflet for [[women's suffrage]]. Her efforts to impress the importance of women's suffrage on such reform leaders as [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] and [[Richard Cobden]] proved of little use, as did her efforts with the [[Chartism|Chartist]] leadership.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Edward H. Milligan: Knight, Anne (1786–1862). ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford: OUP, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47054 Retrieved 4 November 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight was described by the American Quaker [[Lucretia Mott]] in the 1840s as "a singular looking woman - very pleasant and polite."&lt;ref&gt;Edward H. Milligan: Knight, Anne (1786–1862).... Quoting F. B. Tolles, ed.: ''Slavery and 'the Woman Question' '' (London: Journal of the Friends Historical Society Supplement, 1952), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to France==
She moved to France in 1846 and participated in the revolution of 1848, and attended the international peace conference in Paris in 1849. With [[Jeanne Deroin]] she challenged the banning of women from political clubs and of publication of feminist material.  In 1851, she worked with [[Anne Kent]] to form the [[Sheffield Female Political Association]], the first British organisation to call for [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Death and commemorations==
Anne Knight never married. She died at [[Waldersbach]], near [[Strasbourg]], France, on 4 November 1862, at the house of the grandson of [[Jean-Frédéric Oberlin]] (1740–1820), a philanthropist whose work she revered.

A village, [[Knightsville, Jamaica|Knightsville]] in [[Jamaica]], was named after her, or possibly after her younger sister Maria (1791–1870), who visited the West Indies in the mid-1810s with the abolitionist John Candler (1787–1869).

Some of the new student accommodation at the [[University of Essex]], Anne Knight House, is named after her. So also is Anne Knight House, opened in January 2005 by the Colchester Quaker Housing Association a hostel for young people. A Grade II [[listed building]] opposite the [[Chelmsford railway station|railway station in Chelmsford]], her birthplace, used as a Quaker Meeting House from 1823 until the 1950s, was named Anne Knight Building in her honour. It formed part of the [[Anglia Ruskin University]] central campus until this was relocated in 2008. The building was subsequently vacant until 2015 when it enjoyed a brief period of use as a cultural project before being turned into a family-owned chain restaurant.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5562">The '''Climate Summit 2014''' (sometimes also referred to as the '''Leader's Climate Summit''') was a meeting on climate change in [[New York City|New York]] on September 23, 2014. UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] announced it in September 2013 and invited leaders of governments, the private sector, and civil society to unite in taking concrete action towards a low-carbon world.

The Summit's focus was on initiatives and actions rather than on negotiations between countries. It was seen as a milestone on the path towards closing the ''emissions gap'' between reduction pledges and the necessary emission cuts for the [[Climate change mitigation|2 °C scenario]] (with "pursue efforts to" limit the temperature increase to 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C), and to a new legal agreement on climate change, to be approved by the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21 in Paris]] in December 2015. One product of the Summit was the [[New York Declaration on Forests]].

== Developments and positions prior to the Summit ==
After the [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP19 in Warsaw]], the Climate Summit was the next high-level gathering on climate change. Since the [[Kyoto Protocol]]'s second commitment period expires in 2020, the [[UNFCCC]] process attempts to establish a new worldwide contract about climate protection and emission reduction objectives, that is to be drafted in 2014 at the [[2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP20 in Lima]] and adopted in 2015 at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21 in Paris]]. The Climate Summit in September 2014 is not part of this negotiating process, but is expected to serve as a kick-off for a year of intense activity in climate policy and an indicator on the countries' ambitions to reduce emissions and support climate protection. Having this in mind, UN Secretary-General Ban invited leaders of governments, the private sector and [[civil society]] from all over the world to unite in action:

{{quote|I challenge you to bring to the Summit bold pledges. Innovate, scale-up, cooperate and deliver concrete action that will close the emissions gap and put us on track for an ambitious legal agreement through the UNFCCC process.|UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/climatechange/summit2014 ''Climate Summit 2014''], un.org; visited March 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In December 2013, Secretary-General Ban appointed the former President of Ghana, [[John Kufuor]], and [[Jens Stoltenberg]], former Prime Minister of Norway, as special envoys on climate change, to assist Ban in connection with the Climate Summit and provide strategic advice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://summit.sites.unicnetwork.org/2013/12/23/secretary-general-appoints-special-envoys-on-climate-change-to-engage-global-leaders-ahead-of-2014-climate-summit/#more-113 ''Secretary-General appoints special envoys on climate change''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416175308/http://summit.sites.unicnetwork.org/2013/12/23/secretary-general-appoints-special-envoys-on-climate-change-to-engage-global-leaders-ahead-of-2014-climate-summit/#more-113#more-113 |date=2014-04-16 }}, unicnetwork.org; visited March 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation of the Climate Summit, on May 4 and 5 the ''Abu Dhabi Ascent'' was held in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[UAE]], as a meeting in order to cross-link initiatives between governments, the private sector and civil society and to "generate momentum" for the Climate Summit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47073 ''United Arab Emirates to host meeting ahead of UN chief’s climate summit''], un.org; visited March 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Ban Ki-moon appointed former [[President of Ireland]], and former [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[Mary Robinson]], a special envoy for climate change to interact with global leaders ahead of the Climate Summit, to forge political commitment towards finalizing an agreement in 2015.&lt;ref name="ClimateChange"&gt;{{cite news|title=Robinson to head United Nations effort on climate change|url=http://www.irishsun.com/index.php/sid/223797021/scat/aba4168066a10b8d/ht/Robinson-to-head-United-Nations-effort-on-climate-change|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=''Irish Sun.com''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715110732/http://www.irishsun.com/index.php/sid/223797021/scat/aba4168066a10b8d/ht/Robinson-to-head-United-Nations-effort-on-climate-change|archive-date=2014-07-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Climate Summit took place at [[UN Headquarters]] in [[New York City]] on September 23, 2014, one day ahead of the annual [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly Debate]].

A [[People's Climate March|major protest against climate change]] took place outside the conference and on Sunday two days before the conference in other countries worldwide to encourage the leaders to take strong climate action.

'''Communibiology''' is a term referring to a research paradigm that emphasizes the "[[neurobiological]] foundations of human communication behavior".&lt;ref name=Heisel1999&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heisel | first1 = A. D. | last2 = McCroskey | first2 = J. C. | last3 = Richmond | first3 = V. P. | title = Testing theoretical relationships and non-relationships of genetically-based predictors: Getting started with communibiology | journal = Communication Research Reports | volume = 16 | pages = 1 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1080/08824099909388695}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communibiologists take the nature side of the [[nature versus nurture]] debate in communication development. The communibiological paradigm was developed by Beatty and McCroskey as an alternative to the nature side supporting [[social learning theory|social learning paradigm]].&lt;ref name=BeattyMcCroskey2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McCroskey | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Beatty | first2 = M. J. | title = The communibiological perspective: Implications for communication in instruction | journal = Communication Education | volume = 49 | pages = 1 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1080/03634520009379187}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe [[genetics]] to be far more important in the development of [[communication behavior]] than [[learning process]]es and the environment.&lt;ref name=BeattyMcCroskey2000 /&gt;   These researchers do concede, however, that genetic factors are not the sole source of communication behavior. One accepted ratio is 20% influence of cultural, situational, or environmental stimuli and 80% influence of inborn, neurobiological structures on behavior.&lt;ref name=BeattyMcCroskey2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BorenVeksler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boren|first=Justin P.|author2=Veksler, Alice E.|title=A decade of research exploring biology and communication: The brain, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, and immune systems|journal=Communication Research Trends|year=2011|volume=30|issue=4|pages=1–31|url=http://justinboren.com/pdf/CRT_v30_n4.pdf|issn=0144-4646}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A main idea of communibiology is that [[temperament]]s are based on genetics and not learned. Communication behavior is an expression of a person's temperament, though the behavior and the temperament do not completely correlate with one another.&lt;ref name=McCroskey2006 /&gt; Identical genetics producing identical temperaments may result in non-identical communication behaviors because one's temperament can be expressed in various ways. The behaviors, though, will be very similar.&lt;ref name=McCroskey2006 /&gt;

==Influences on the communibiological paradigm==

===Hans Eysenck's personality theory===
[[Hans Eysenck]] found that the two main aspects of [[personality]] are temperament and [[intelligence]]. He identified three personality types:
*[[Extraversion and introversion|Extraversion]] –sociable, lively, active, assertive, sensation-seeking, carefree dominant, surgent and venturesome.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = L. | last2 = Keaten | first2 = J. A. | title = Treating communication anxiety: Implications of the communibiological paradigm | journal = Communication Education | volume = 49 | pages = 45 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1080/03634520009379192}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Neuroticism]] – [[anxiety|anxious]], [[depression (mood)|depressed]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] feelings, [[low self-esteem]], tense, irrational, shy, moody emotional.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt;
*[[Psychoticism]] – [[aggressive]], cold, [[ego-centric]], impersonal, [[impulsive behaviour|impulsive]], [[anti-social beahviour|antisocial]], unempathic, creative, and tough-minded.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt;
Eysenck argues that these three personalities are inherited&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt; lending it useful to the communibiological paradigm. Other research has also found that the genetic component of these three personalities is between 50% and 80%.&lt;ref name=Heisel1999 /&gt;

===J.A. Gray's theory of neuropsychology of temperament===
J.A. Gray proposed a [[behavioral inhibition system]] (BIS) and a [[behavioral activation system]] (BAS). The threshold for activation of the BIS or BAS is inherited.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt;

===Cary Horvath's twins study===
Horvath compared identical and [[fraternal twins]] in order to determine if communicator styles were inherited.  This was the first study of heredity and communication and it found that communicator style variables are partially inherited,&lt;ref name=Horvath1995&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = C. W. | title = Biological origins of communicator style | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 394–407 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1080/01463379509369987}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading the way for the future studies regarding inheritance and communication behavior.

==Model for communibiological research (as used by Beatty, et al.)==
#Select or create a theory that proposes an explanation for an aspect of human communication behavior.
#Relate the theory to specific biological elements or [[biological process|processes]].
#Select or create a measure related to those biological elements or processes.
#Establish a relationship between the measurements, human communication behavior, and biological elements or processes.&lt;ref name=Heisel1999 /&gt;

==Opponents==
There exist many opponents to the communibiological paradigm. First are the "nurture" and social learning paradigm supporters that believe learning has more to do with communication behavior than genetics. Then there are others who believe the whole argument is pointless. Condit calls for a multi-causal model that would incorporate both nature and nurture. Condit also claims that the 80% genetic influence found by Beatty and McCroskey lacks solid evidence and a number in the 40-60% range is more likely, helping to support her view of incorporating both nature and nurture.&lt;ref name=Condit2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Condit | first1 = C. M. | title = Culture and biology in human communication: Toward a multi-causal model | journal = Communication Education | volume = 49 | pages = 7–9 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1080/03634520009379188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communibiological perspective on communication apprehension==
[[Communication apprehension]] afflicts millions of people worldwide. Much of the communibiological research done on communication apprehension has found that the causes of the affliction are inherited.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, C. (2016). Student oral presentations: developing the skills and reducing the apprehension. In: Proceedings of 10th International Technology, Education and Development Conference Valencia, Spain. 7-9 March, 2016. IATED (2016). IATED, Valencia, Spain, pp. 1474-1483. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297715071_Student_oral_presentations_developing_the_skills_and_reducing_the_apprehension&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beatty and McCroskey===
Beatty and McCroskey first developed their communibiological paradigm in order to more effectively diagnose communication apprehension. Using [[Hans Eysenck|Eysenck]]'s personality theory they identified the primary components of communication apprehension to be introversion and neuroticism.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt; They also used Gray's theory to say that activation of the behavioral inhibition system is related to anxiety.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt; They make note that both the personalities of Eysenck's theory and the activation threshold of the BIS in Gray's theory have been found to be inherited. Differences in communication apprehension correspond to differences in BIS activation threshold,&lt;ref name=BeattyValencic2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beatty | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Valencic | first2 = K. M. | title = Context-based apprehension versus planning demands: A communibiological analysis of anticipatory public speaking anxiety | journal = Communication Education | volume = 49 | pages = 58 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1080/03634520009379193}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the idea that communication apprehension is genetically determined.

===Interpersonal communication motives===
Interpersonal communication motives explain why people with communication apprehension communicate the way they do. People with low communication apprehension communicate for [[pleasure]], [[affection]], control, and [[relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]] while people with high communication apprehension communicate for [[social inclusion|inclusion]] and escape.&lt;ref name=PaulselMottet2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paulsel | first1 = M. L. | last2 = Mottet | first2 = T. P. | title = Interpersonal communication motives: A communibiological perspective | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 182 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1080/01463370409370189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paulsel and Mottet (2004)&lt;ref name=PaulselMottet2004 /&gt; found that interpersonal communication motives such as these are at least a partially influenced by genetically inherited traits.

===Communication apprehension in second languages===
Jung and McCroskey (2004)&lt;ref name=JungMcCroskey2004 /&gt; studied the presence of communication apprehension in those speaking their [[first language]] and those speaking their [[second language]]. Communication apprehension in the first language predicted communication apprehension in the second language. This combated the social learning perspective which would say that the learning of the second language would influence and change the communication apprehension in the second language. They concluded that communication apprehension is a cross-linguistic trait and that the trait is genetically inherited.&lt;ref name=JungMcCroskey2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jung | first1 = H. Y. | last2 = McCroskey | first2 = J. C. | title = Communication apprehension in a first language and self-perceived competence as predictors of communication apprehension in a second language: A study of speakers of English as a second language | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 170 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1080/01463370409370188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
The fact that the causes of communication apprehension are inherited has major implications in how it can be treated as some believe that if communication apprehension is genetically inherited then it cannot be changed. Others contend, as Beatty and McCroskey did, that since traits are not exclusively genetically inherited, treatment is viable. Treatment in terms of the communibiological paradigm involves learning to control the negative aspects of one's inherited temperament.&lt;ref name=KeatenKelly2000 /&gt;

==The role of culture==
Comminubiologists argue that people are born with specific temperaments based on their genetics. This does not, however, mean that they do not learn. [[Culture]] plays an important role in this learning process. While they are born with a certain temperament a person learns how to respond to specific temperamental demands based on the culture they are surrounded by.&lt;ref name=McCroskey2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1= McCroskey|first1= James C.|year= 2006|title= The Role of Culture in a Communibiological Approach to Communication|journal= Human Communication|volume= 9|issue= 1|pages= 31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children they learn which temperamental actions are appropriate and which are not. So while the basis of a person's communication behavior is based on genetics, a good portion of their behavior is also affected by the culture they are raised in. In fact, the communication behaviors [[ethnocentrism]] and [[homophobia]] were found to have no relationship with a person's [[genetic make-up]] or temperament.&lt;ref name=McCroskeyWrench2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wrench | first1 = J. S. | last2 = McCroskey | first2 = J. C. | title = A communibiological examination of ethnocentrism and homophobia | journal = Communication Research Reports | volume = 20 | pages = 24 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1080/08824090309388796}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traits are instead developed through culture.

[[File:Athletics competitions.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Competition in sports. A selection of images showing some of the sporting events that are classed as [[sport of athletics|athletics]] competitions.]]

'''Competition''' is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more entities, organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for [[territory (animal)|territory]], a niche, for scarce [[resource]]s, goods, for mates, for [[:wikt:prestige|prestige]], [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]], for [[award]]s, for group or social status, or for [[leadership]] and [[Profit (economics)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 
&lt;/ref&gt; It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (an example of which is a [[zero-sum game]]).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K.G., Ferrier, W.J. and Ndofor, H., 2001. Competitive dynamics research: Critique and future directions. Handbook of strategic management, pp.315-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition occurs [[nature|naturally]] between living organisms which co-exist in the same [[natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2001"&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2001. ''Competition'', 2nd ed., Kluwer, Dordrecht. 552 p.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other [[resource (biology)|biological resources]]. Humans usually compete for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of [[wealth]], power, prestige, and [[celebrity|fame]].

Competition is often considered to be the opposite of [[cooperation]], however in the real world, mixtures of cooperation and competition are the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociologyguide.com/basic-concepts/Competition.php Competition], Sociology guide&lt;/ref&gt; Optimal strategies to achieve goals are studied in the branch of mathematics known as [[game theory]].

Competition is also a major tenet of [[market economy|market economies]] and business. It is often associated with business competition as most companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers. Also competition inside a company is usually stimulated with the larger purpose of meeting and reaching higher quality of services or improved products that the company may produce or develop.

== Consequences ==
Competition can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Many evolutionary biologists view inter-species and intra-species competition as the driving force of [[adaptation]], and ultimately of [[evolution]]. However, some biologists disagree, citing competition as a driving force only on a small scale, and citing the larger scale drivers of evolution to be abiotic factors (termed 'Room to Roam').&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–47 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] prefers to think of evolution in terms of competition between single genes, which have the welfare of the organism 'in mind' only insofar as that welfare furthers their own selfish drives for replication (termed the 'selfish gene').

Some [[social Darwinist]]s claim that competition also serves as a mechanism for determining the best-suited group; politically, economically and ecologically. Positively, competition may serve as a form of [[recreation]] or a challenge provided that it is non-hostile. On the negative side, competition can cause injury and loss to the organisms involved, and drain valuable resources and energy. In the human species competition can be expensive on many levels, not only in lives lost to war, physical injuries, and damaged psychological well beings, but also in the health effects from everyday civilian life caused by work stress, long work hours, abusive working relationships, and poor working conditions, that detract from the enjoyment of life, even as such competition results in financial gain for the owners.

== Biology and ecology ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Natural selection]] --&gt;
{{Main|Competition (biology)}}
Competition within, between, and among species is one of the most important forces in biology, especially in the field of [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2001"/&gt;

Competition between members of a species ("intraspecific") for resources such as [[food]], [[water]], [[Territory (animal)|territory]], and [[sunlight]] may result in an increase in the frequency of a variant of the species best suited for survival and reproduction until its fixation within a population. However, competition among resources also has a strong tendency for diversification between members of the same species, resulting in coexistence of competitive and non-competitive strategies or cycles between low and high competitiveness. Third parties within a species often favour highly competitive strategies leading to species extinction when environmental conditions are harsh ([[evolutionary suicide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldauf|first1=Sebastian A.|last2=Engqvist|first2=Leif|last3=Weissing|first3=Franz J.|title=Diversifying evolution of competitiveness|journal=Nature Communications|date=29 October 2014|volume=5|pages=5233|doi=10.1038/ncomms6233|pmid=25351604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition is also present between species ("interspecific"). When resources are limited, several species may depend on these resources. Thus, each of the species competes with the others to gain access to the resources. As a result, species less suited to compete for the resources may [[extinction|die out]] unless they [[adaptation|adapt]] by character dislocation, for instance. According to [[evolutionary theory]], this competition within and between species for resources plays a significant role in [[natural selection]]. At shorter time scales, competition is also one of the most important factors controlling diversity in ecological communities, but at larger scales expansion and contraction of ecological space is a much more larger factor than competition.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010"/&gt; This is illustrated by living plant communities where asymmetric competition and competitive dominance frequently occur.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2001"/&gt; Multiple examples of symmetric and asymmetric competition also exist for animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borzée|first1=Amaël|last2=Kim|first2=Jun Young|last3=Jang|first3=Yikweon|title=Asymmetric competition over calling sites in two closely related treefrog species|journal=Scientific Reports|date=7 Sep 2016|volume=6|page=32569|doi=10.1038/srep32569|pmc=5013533|pmid=27599461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game theory==
{{main|Game theory}}
Game theory is "the study of [[mathematical model]]s of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers."&lt;ref name=Myerson&gt;[[Roger B. Myerson|Myerson, Roger B.]] (1991). ''Game Theory: Analysis of Conflict,'' Harvard University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA1 1]. Chapter-preview links, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR7 vii–xi].&lt;/ref&gt; Game theory is mainly used in [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[psychology]], as well as [[logic]], [[computer science]], [[biology]] and [[poker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323610704578625812355516182|title=The Science of Winning Poker|author=Christopher Chabris|date=26 July 2013|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it mainly addressed [[zero-sum game]]s, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants.

Game theory is a major method used in [[mathematical economics]] and business for [[Economic model|modeling]] competing behaviors of interacting [[Agent (economics)|agent]]s.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as [[auction]]s, [[bargaining]], [[mergers &amp; acquisitions]] pricing,&lt;ref name="GT-A-E-00"/&gt; [[fair division]], [[Duopoly|duopolies]], [[Oligopoly|oligopolies]], [[social network]] formation, [[agent-based computational economics]],&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; [[general equilibrium]], [[mechanism design]],&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; and [[voting system]]s;&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; and across such broad areas as [[experimental economics]],&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; [[Behavioral game theory|behavioral economics]],&lt;ref name=r6/&gt; [[information economics]],&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; [[industrial organization]],&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; and [[political economy]].&lt;ref name=r9/&gt;&lt;ref name=r10/&gt;

This research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as [[Solution concept|"solution concepts" or "equilibria"]]. A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the [[Nash equilibrium]]. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.&lt;ref name="GT-F-R-09"&gt;[http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 Game-theoretic model to examine the two tradeoffs in the acquisition of information for a careful balancing act] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524231021/http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 |date=2013-05-24 }} Research paper [[INSEAD]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GT-F-R-10"&gt;[http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 Options Games: Balancing the trade-off between flexibility and commitment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620053305/http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 |date=June 20, 2013 }}.

==Economics and business==
{{Main|Competition (economics)}}

Merriam-Webster defines competition in business as "the effort of two or more parties acting independently to secure the business of a third party by offering the most favorable terms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/dictionary/competition m-w.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was described by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and later economists as allocating productive [[resource]]s to their most highly valued uses and encouraging [[X-inefficiency|efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George J. Stigler]] ([[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics|[1987]]] 2008). "competition," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000261&amp;q=competition&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=6 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[microeconomic theory]] distinguished between [[perfect competition]] and [[imperfect competition]], concluding that no system of resource allocation is more efficient than [[perfect competition]]. Competition, according to the theory, causes commercial firms to develop new products, services and technologies, which would give consumers greater selection and better products. The greater selection typically causes lower prices for the products, compared to what the price would be if there was no competition ([[monopoly]]) or little competition ([[oligopoly]]).

However, competition may also lead to wasted (duplicated) effort and to increased [[cost]]s (and prices) in some circumstances. For example, the intense competition for the small number of [[superstar|top jobs in music and movie acting]] leads many aspiring musicians and actors to make substantial investments in training which are not recouped, because only a fraction become successful. Critics have also argued that competition can be destabilizing, particularly competition between certain financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 ''Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts have also questioned the constructiveness of competition in profitability. It has been argued that competition-oriented objectives are counterproductive to raising revenues and profitability because they limit the options of strategies for firms as well as their ability to offer innovative responses to changes in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/CompOrientPDF%2011-27%20%282%29.pdf |title=The Profitability of Winning |author1=J. Scott Armstrong |author2=Fred Collopy |journal=Chief Executive |pages=61–63 |year=1994 |access-date=2011-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622023252/http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/CompOrientPDF%2011-27%20(2).pdf |archive-date=2010-06-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the strong desire to defeat rival firms with competitive prices has the strong possibility of causing price wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Profitability%20of%20winning.pdf | title = Competitor-oriented Objectives: The Myth of Market Share |author1=J. Scott Armstrong |author2=Kesten C. Greene | journal = International Journal of Business | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 116–34 | year = 2007 | issn= 1083-4346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three levels of economic competition have been classified:

* The most narrow form is '''direct competition''' (also called category competition or brand competition), where [[product (business)|products]] which perform the same function compete against each other. For example, one brand of pick-up trucks competes with several other brands of pick-up trucks. Sometimes, two companies are rivals and one adds new products to their line, which leads to the other company distributing the same new things, and in this manner they compete.
* The next form is '''substitute''' or '''indirect competition''', where products which are close substitutes for one another compete. For example, butter competes with margarine, mayonnaise and other various sauces and spreads.
* The broadest form of competition is typically called '''budget competition'''. Included in this category is anything on which the [[consumer]] might want to spend their available [[income|money]]. For example, a family which has $20,000 available may choose to spend it on many different items, which can all be seen as competing with each other for the family's expenditure. This form of competition is also sometimes described as a competition of "share of wallet".

In addition, companies also compete for [[finance|financing]] on the capital markets (equity or debt) in order to generate the necessary cash for their operations. An [[investor]] typically will consider alternative investment opportunities given his risk profile and not only look at companies just competing on product ('''direct competitors'''). Enlarging the investment universe to include '''indirect competitors''' leads to a broader peer universe of comparable, indirectly competing companies.

Competition does not necessarily have to be between companies. For example, business writers sometimes refer to '''internal competition'''. This is competition within companies. The idea was first introduced by [[Alfred Sloan]] at [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the 1920s. Sloan deliberately created areas of overlap between divisions of the company so that each division would be competing with the other divisions. For example, the [[Chevrolet]] division would compete with the [[Pontiac]] division for some [[market segment]]s. The competing brands by the same company allowed parts to be designed by one division and shared by several divisions, for example parts designed by Chevrolet would also be used by Pontiac. Also, in 1931, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] initiated a deliberate system of internal brand-versus-brand rivalry. The company was organized around different [[brand]]s, with each brand allocated resources, including a dedicated group of employees willing to champion the brand. Each brand manager was given responsibility for the success or failure of the brand, and compensated accordingly.

Finally, most businesses also encourage competition between individual employees. An example of this is a contest between sales representatives. The sales representative with the highest sales (or the best improvement in sales) over a period of time would gain benefits from the employer. This is also known as '''intra-brand competition.'''

Shalev and Asbjornsen also found that success (i.e. the saving resulted) of [[reverse auction]]s correlated most closely with competition. The literature widely supported the importance of competition as the primary driver of reverse auctions success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1727409 papers.ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings appear to support that argument, as competition correlated strongly with the reverse auction success, as well as with the number of bidders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/39032383/Electronic-Reverse-Auction-and-the-Public-Sector-Factors-of-Success-Moshe-E-Shalev-Stee-Asbjorensen |publisher= Shalev Moshe and Asbjornsen Stee |title=Electronic reverse auctions and the public sector – Factors of success |work=Journal of Public Procurement |pages=428–52 |volume=10 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that business and economic competition in most [[country|countries]] is often limited or restricted. Competition often is subject to legal restrictions. For example, competition may be legally prohibited, as in the case with a [[government monopoly]] or a [[government-granted monopoly]]. [[Tariffs]], [[subsidies]] or other [[protectionist]] measures may also be instituted by government in order to prevent or reduce competition. Depending on the respective economic policy, pure competition is to a greater or lesser extent regulated by [[competition policy]] and [[competition law]].  Another component of these activities is the discovery process, with instances of higher [[government regulation]]s typically leading to less competitive businesses being launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=884&amp;full=1 Competition, Regulation, and the Market Process: An "Austrian" Perspective, Sept. 30, 1982] by [[Israel M. Kirzner]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate===
{{See also|Race to the bottom}}
Competition between countries is quite subtle to detect, but is quite evident in the [[world economy]]. Countries compete to provide the best possible business environment for [[multinational corporations]]. Such competition is evident by the policies undertaken by these countries to educate the future workforce. For example, East Asian economies such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea tend to emphasize education by allocating a large portion of the budget to this sector, and by implementing programmes such as [[gifted education]].

===Law===
{{Main|Competition law}}
[[File:U.S. Department of Justice headquarters, August 12, 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] building in [[Washington, D.C.]] is home to the influential [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] enforcers of U.S. competition laws]]
Competition [[law]], known in the [[United States]] as antitrust law, has three main functions. First, it prohibits agreements aimed to restrict free trading between business entities and their customers. For example, a [[cartel]] of sports shops who together fix football jersey prices higher than normal is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;''JJB Sports v OFT [2004] CAT 17''&lt;/ref&gt; Second, competition law can ban the existence or abusive behaviour of a firm dominating the market. One case in point could be a software company who through its [[monopoly]] on computer platforms makes consumers use its media player.&lt;ref&gt;in the E.U. side of the saga, see [http://europa.eu.int/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?lang=en&amp;num=79958777T1904%20R0201_2&amp;doc=T&amp;ouvert=T&amp;seance=ORD&amp;where=() Case T-201/04] ''Microsoft v. Commission'' Order, 22 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Third, to preserve competitive markets, the law supervises the [[mergers and acquisitions]] of very large corporations. Competition authorities could for instance require that a large packaging company give plastic bottle [[license]]s to competitors before taking over a major [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] producer.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-12/03 P, Commission v. Tetra Laval&lt;/ref&gt; In this case (as in all three), competition law aims to protect the [[consumer welfare|welfare of consumers]] by ensuring business must compete for its share of the [[market economy]].

In recent decades, competition law has also been sold as good medicine to provide better [[public services]], traditionally funded by [[tax]] payers and administered by [[Democracy|democratically]] accountable [[government]]s. Hence competition law is closely connected with the law on deregulation of access to markets, providing state aids and subsidies, the [[privatisation]] of state-owned assets and the use of independent sector regulators, such as the United Kingdom telecommunications watchdog [[Ofcom]]. Behind the practice lies the theory, which over the last fifty years has been dominated by [[neo-classical economics]]. Markets are seen as the most efficient method of allocating resources, although sometimes [[market failure|they fail]], and regulation becomes necessary to protect the ideal market model. Behind the theory lies the history, reaching back further than the [[Roman Empire]]. The business practices of market traders, [[guilds]] and governments have always been subject to scrutiny and sometimes severe sanctions. Since the twentieth century, competition law has become global. The two largest, most organised and influential systems of competition regulation are [[United States antitrust law]] and [[European Community competition law]]. The respective national authorities, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) in the United States and the [[Directorate-General for Competition (European Commission)|European Commission's Competition Directorate General]] (DGCOMP) have formed international support and enforcement networks. Competition law is growing in importance every day, which warrants for its careful study.

== Trade ==

Competition is also found in [[trade]]. For nations, as well as firms it is important to understand trade dynamics in order to market their goods and services effectively in international markets. [[Balance of trade]] can be considered a crude, but widely used proxy for international competitiveness across levels: [[country]], [[industry]] or even [[business|firm]]. Research data hints that exporting firms have a higher survival rate and achieve greater employment growth compared with non-exporters.

Using a simple concept to measure heights that firms can climb may help improve execution of strategies. International competitiveness can be measured on several criteria but few are as flexible and versatile to be applied across levels as Trade Competitiveness Index (TCI) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://kmomaya.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/ijm_pranusha_bhokray_momaya_export_competitiveness_pre-publication_review.pdf | title = Export Competitiveness of Select Firms from India: Glimpse of Trends and Implications |author1=Manthri P. |author2=Bhokray K. |author3=Momaya K.

== Politics ==
Competition is also found in [[politics]]. In [[democracy|democracies]], an [[election]] is a competition for an elected office. In other words, two or more candidates strive and compete against one another to attain a position of power. The winner gains the seat of the elected office for a predefined period of time, towards the end of which another election is usually held to determine the next holder of the office.

In addition, there is inevitable competition inside a government. Because several offices are appointed, potential candidates compete against the others in order to gain the particular office. Departments may also compete for a limited amount of resources, such as for [[budget|funding]]. Finally, where there are [[party systems]], elected leaders of different parties will ultimately compete against the other parties for [[law]]s, [[funding]] and [[political power|power]].

Finally, competition also exists between [[government]]s. Each [[country]] or [[nationality]] struggles for world dominance, power, or [[military]] strength. For example, the [[United States]] competed against the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]] for world power, and the two also struggled over the different types of government (in these cases [[representative democracy]] and [[communism]]). The result of this type of competition often leads to worldwide tensions, and may sometimes erupt into [[war]]fare.

== Sports ==

[[File:US Olympic Committee Headquarters by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Olympic Committee]]'s headquarters in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. The [[Olympic Games]] are regarded as the international pinnacle of sports competition.]]
While some [[sport]]s and [[game]]s (such as [[fishing]] or [[hiking]]) have been viewed as primarily recreational, most sports are considered competitive. The majority involve competition between two or more persons (sometimes using [[horse racing|horses]] or [[auto racing|cars]]). For example, in a game of [[basketball]], two teams compete against one another to determine who can score the most points. When there is no set reward for the winning team, many players gain a sense of [[pride]]. In addition, extrinsic rewards may also be given. Athletes, besides competing against other humans, also compete against [[nature]] in sports such as [[whitewater kayaking]] or [[mountaineering]], where the goal is to reach a destination, with only natural barriers impeding the process. A regularly scheduled (for instance annual) competition meant to determine the "best" competitor of that cycle is called a [[championship]].
[[File:Citi Field Day.jpg|thumb|left|[[Baseball]], a competitive sport]]
Competitive sports are governed by codified rules agreed upon by the participants. Violating these rules is considered to be [[unfair competition]]. Thus, sports provide artificial (not natural) competition; for example, competing for control of a ball, or defending territory on a playing field is not an innate biological factor in humans. Athletes in sports such as [[gymnastics]] and competitive [[Diving (sport)|diving]] compete against each other in order to come closest to a conceptual ideal of a perfect performance, which incorporates measurable criteria and standards which are translated into numerical ratings and scores by appointed judges.

Sports competition is generally broken down into three categories: '''individual''' sports, such as [[archery]]; '''dual''' sports, such as [[tennis|doubles tennis]], and '''team''' sports competition, such as [[cricket]] or [[football]]. While most sports competitions are recreation, there exist several [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major]] and [[minor league|minor]] professional sports leagues throughout the world. The [[Olympic Games]], held every four years, is usually regarded as the international pinnacle of sports competition.

== Education ==
Competition is a major factor in education. On a global scale, national education systems, intending to bring out the best in the next generation, encourage competitiveness among students through [[scholarships]]. Countries such as England and Singapore have [[special education]] programmes which cater for specialist students, prompting charges of [[academic elitism]]. Upon receipt of their academic results, students tend to compare their grades to see who is better. In severe cases, the pressure to perform in some countries is so high that it can result in stigmatization of intellectually deficient students, or even suicide as a consequence of failing the exams; Japan being a prime example (see [[Education in Japan]]). This has resulted in critical re-evaluation of examinations as a whole by educationalists {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Critics of competition as a motivating factor in education systems, such as [[Alfie Kohn]], assert that competition actually has a net negative influence on the achievement levels of students, and that it "turns all of us into losers" (Kohn 1986). Economist [[Richard Layard]] has commented on the harmful effects, stating "people feel that they are under a great deal of pressure. They feel that their main objective in life is to do better than other people. That is certainly what young people are being taught in school every day. And it's not a good basis for a society."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13052639 ''Group dedicated to happiness launched in UK'', BBC video, April 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other studies such as the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] show that the effect of competition on students depends on each individual's level of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]. Students with a high level of agency thrive on competition, are self-motivated, and are willing to risk failure. Compared to their counterparts who are low in agency, these students are more likely to be flexible, adaptable and creative as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Literature ==
Literary competitions, such as contests sponsored by [[literary journals]], publishing houses and theaters, have increasingly become a means for aspiring writers to gain recognition. Awards for fiction include those sponsored by the ''[[Missouri Review]]'', ''[[Boston Review]]'', ''[[Indiana Review]]'', ''[[North American Review]]'' and ''[[Southwest Review]]''. The [[Edward Albee|Albee]] Award, sponsored by the Yale Drama Series, is among the most prestigious playwriting awards.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Consumer competitions - games of luck or skill==
{{further|Game of chance}}
In Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, competitions or lottos are the equivalent of what are commonly known as [[sweepstakes]] in the United States. The correct technical name for Australian consumer competitions is a trade promotion lottery or lottos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/promos_trade_promos.asp |title=OLGR &gt; Promotions and competitions &gt; Trade promotion lotteries |publisher=Olgr.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition or trade promotion lottery entrants enter to win a prize or prizes, hence many entrants are all in competition, or competing for a limited number of prizes.

A trade promotion lottery or competition is a free entry lottery run to promote goods or services supplied by a business. An example is where you purchase goods or services and then given the chance to enter into the lottery and possibly win a prize. A trade promotion lottery can be called a lotto, competition, contest, sweepstake, or giveaway.

Such competitions can be games of luck (randomly drawn) or skill (judged on an entry question or submission), or possibly a combination of both.

People that enjoy entering competitions are known as compers. Many compers attend annual national conventions. In 2012 over 100 members of the online competitions community of lottos.com.au from around Australia met on the Gold Coast, Queensland to discuss competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lottos.com.au/competitions/viewthreadlite.php?tid=275933 |title=NATIONAL LOTTOS MEET GOLD COAST 16TH SEPTEMBER 2012 :) |publisher=Lottos.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amv7jMwbHIw&amp;t=6s |title=Comp Queens |publisher=Aca.ninemsn.com.au |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
Competition has been studied in several fields, including [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]. Social [[psychologist]]s, for instance, study the nature of competition. They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances. They also study [[group dynamics]], to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are. [[Sociologist]]s, meanwhile, study the effects of competition on society as a whole. In addition, [[anthropologist]]s study the history and prehistory of competition in various cultures. They also investigate how competition manifested itself in various [[culture|cultural]] settings in the past, and how competition has developed over time.

==Competitiveness==
{{Main|Competitiveness}}
Many [[philosopher]]s and [[psychologist]]s have identified a trait in most living organisms which can drive the particular organism to compete. This trait, called competitiveness, is viewed as an innate [[biology|biological]] [[Trait (biological)|trait]] {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}which coexists along with the urge for survival. Competitiveness, or the inclination to compete, though, has become synonymous with aggressiveness and ambition in the [[English language]]. More advanced [[civilization]]s integrate aggressiveness and competitiveness into their [[Social interaction|interactions]], as a way to distribute resources and adapt. Many plants compete with neighboring ones for sunlight.

However, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and others have argued that as one ascends the evolutionary hierarchy, competitiveness (the survival instinct) becomes less innate, and more a learned behavior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The same could be said for co-operation: in humans, at least, both co-operation and competition are considered learned behaviors{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}, because the human species learns to adapt to environmental pressures. Consequently, if survival requires competitive behaviors, the individual will compete, and if survival requires co-operative behaviors, the individual will co-operate. In the case of humans, therefore, aggressiveness may be an innate characteristic, but a person need not be competitive at the same time, for instance when scaling a cliff. On the other hand, humans seem also to have a nurturing instinct, to protect newborns and the weak. While that does not necessitate co-operative behavior, it does help.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The term also applies to [[econometrics]]. Here, it is a comparative measure of the ability and performance of a firm or sub-sector to sell and produce/supply goods and/or services in a given market. The two academic bodies of thought on the assessment of competitiveness are the '''Structure Conduct Performance Paradigm''' and the more contemporary '''New Empirical Industrial Organisation''' model. Predicting changes in the competitiveness of business sectors is becoming an integral and explicit step in public policymaking. Within capitalist economic systems, the drive of enterprises is to maintain and improve their own competitiveness.

=== Hypercompetitiveness ===
The tendency toward extreme, unhealthy competition has been termed '''hypercompetitiveness'''. This concept originated in [[Karen Horney]]'s theories on [[neurosis]]; specifically, the highly aggressive personality type which is characterized as "moving against people". In her view, some people have a need to compete and win at all costs as a means of maintaining their [[self-esteem|self-worth]]. These individuals are likely to turn any activity into a competition, and they will feel threatened if they find themselves losing. Researchers have found that men and women who score high on the trait of hypercompetitiveness are more [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] and less psychologically healthy than those who score low on the trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ryckman, R.

C. |year=1994 |title= Personality correlates of the hypercompetitive attitude scale: Validity tests of Horney's theory of neurosis |work=[[Journal of Personality Assessment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypercompetitive individuals generally believe that "[[winning isn't everything; it's the only thing]]".{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It promotes a "climate of competitive egoism and individualism", with competition for jobs and competition between employees; Marx said competition between workers exceeds that demonstrated by company owners.&lt;ref name="allenb"&gt;
Allen E. Buchanan, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j1AOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marx and justice: the radical critique of liberalism]'', [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], 1982
&lt;/ref&gt; He also points out that competition separates individuals from one another and while concentration of workers and development of better communication alleviate this, they are not a decision.&lt;ref name="allenb"/&gt;

===Freud===
[[Sigmund Freud]] explained competition as a primal dilemma in which all infants find themselves. The infant competes with other family members for the attention and affection of the parent of the opposite sex or the primary caregiving parent. During this time, a boy develops a deep fear that the father (the son's prime rival) will punish him for these feelings of desire for the mother, by castrating  him. Girls develop penis envy towards all males. The girl’s envy is rooted in the biologic fact that, without a penis, she cannot sexually possess mother, as the infantile id demands, resultantly, the girl redirects her desire for sexual union upon father in competitive rivalry with her mother. This constellation of feelings is known as [[Oedipus Complex]] ( after the Greek Mythology figure who accidentally killed his father and married his mother). This is associated with the [[phallic stage]] of childhood development where intense primal emotions of competitive rivalry with (usually) the parent of the same sex are rampant and create a crisis that must be negotiated successfully for healthy psychological development to proceed. Unresolved Oedipus complex competitiveness issues can lead to lifelong neuroses manifesting in various ways related to an overdetermined relationship to competition.

===Mahatma Gandhi===
[[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] speaks of egoistic competition.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"&gt;
Parmeshwari Dayal, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FemHmw5fGQUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Gandhian Theory of Social Reconstruction], Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; For him, such qualities glorified and/or left unbridled, can lead to violence, conflict, discord and destructiveness. For Gandhi, competition comes from the ego, and therefore society must be based on mutual love, cooperation and sacrifice for the well-being of humanity.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt; In the society desired by Gandhi, each individual will cooperate and serve for the welfare of others and people will share each other's joys, sorrows and achievements as a norm of a social life. For him, in a non-violent society, competition does not have a place and this should become realized with more people making the personal choice to have fewer tendencies toward egoism and selfishness.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1910">A '''crisis camp''' is a [[BarCamp]] gathering of [[Information technology|IT]] professionals, [[software developer]]s, and computer [[programmer]]s to aid in the relief efforts of a major crisis such as those caused by [[earthquake]]s, [[flood]]s, or [[hurricane]]s. Projects that crisis camps often work on include setting up [[social network]]s for people to locate missing friends and relatives, creating maps of affected areas, and creating inventories of needed items such as food and clothing.

Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], many crisis camps were set up around the world, often under the name "Crisis Camp Haiti", to help with the relief effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-crisiscamp17-2010jan17,0,6468659.story |title=Crisis Camp Haiti: Techno-types volunteer their computer skills to aid quake victims |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |accessdate=January 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120063956/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-crisiscamp17-2010jan17%2C0%2C6468659.story |archivedate=January 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural studies''' is a field of theoretically, politically, and empirically engaged cultural analysis that concentrates upon the political dynamics of contemporary culture, its historical foundations, defining traits, conflicts, and contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp.388-396. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/d2310?journalCode=epda &lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies researchers generally investigate how cultural practices relate to wider systems of [[power (social and political)|power]] associated with or operating through social phenomena, such as [[ideology]], [[class structure]]s, [[nationality|national formations]], [[ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender]], and generation.  Cultural studies views cultures not as fixed, bounded, stable, and discrete entities, but rather as constantly interacting and changing sets of practices and processes.&lt;ref&gt;"Cultural studies" is not synonymous with either "[[area studies]]" or "[[ethnic studies]]," although there are many cultural studies practitioners working in both area studies and ethnic studies programs and professional associations (e.g. [[American studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[African-American studies]], [[Latino studies|Latina/o Studies]], [[European studies]], [[Latin American studies]], etc.).&lt;/ref&gt; The field of cultural studies encompasses a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. Although distinct from the discipline of [[cultural anthropology]] and the interdisciplinary field of [[ethnic studies]], cultural studies draws upon and has contributed to each of these fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/cultural-studies|title=cultural studies {{!}} interdisciplinary field|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural studies was initially developed by British academics in the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and has been subsequently taken up and transformed by scholars from many different disciplines around the world.  Cultural studies is avowedly and even radically interdisciplinary and can sometimes be seen as antidisciplinary. A key concern for cultural studies practitioners is the examination of the forces within and through which socially organized people conduct and participate in the construction of their everyday lives.&lt;ref&gt;Pain, R. and Smith, S. eds., 2008. Fear: Critical geopolitics and everyday life. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Cultural Studies as a field of research is not concerned with the linguistically uncategorized experiences of individuals, or, in a more radical approach, holds that individual experiences do not exist, being always the result of a particular social-political context.

Cultural studies combines a variety of politically engaged critical approaches drawn including [[semiotics]], [[Marxism]], [[feminist theory]], [[ethnography]], [[critical race theory]], [[post-structuralism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[social theory]], [[political theory]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[literary theory]], [[Media influence|media theory]], [[film studies|film/video studies]], [[communication studies]], [[political economy]], [[translation studies]], [[museum studies]] and [[art history|art history/criticism]] to study cultural phenomena in various societies and historical periods. Cultural studies seeks to understand how meaning is generated, disseminated, contested, bound up with systems of power and control, and produced from the social, political and economic spheres within a particular social formation or conjuncture. Important theories of [[cultural hegemony]] and [[Structure or agency|agency]] have both influenced and been developed by the cultural studies movement, as have many recent major communication theories and agendas, such as those that attempt to explain and analyze the cultural forces related to processes of [[globalization]].

During the rise of [[neo-liberalism]] in Britain and the US, cultural studies both became a global movement, and attracted the attention of many conservative opponents both within and beyond universities for a variety of reasons.  Some left-wing critics associated particularly with Marxist forms of political economy also attacked cultural studies for allegedly overstating the importance of cultural phenomena.  While cultural studies continues to have its detractors, the field has become a kind of a worldwide movement that is to this day associated with a raft of scholarly associations and programs, annual international conferences, publications and students and practitioners from [[Taiwan]] to [[Amsterdam]] and from [[Bangalore]] to [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, Michael (2009), [http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-the-Matter-With/48334 "What's the Matter with Cultural Studies?"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cultstud.org/index.php?s=resources "Cultural Studies Associations, Networks and Programs"], extensive, but incomplete, list of associations, networks and programs as found on the website for the Association of Cultural Studies, Tampere, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;  Somewhat distinct approaches to cultural studies have  emerged in different national and regional contexts such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Italy.

==Characteristics==
In his 1994 book, ''Introducing Cultural Studies'', [[Ziauddin Sardar]] lists the following five main characteristics of cultural studies:&lt;ref&gt;Sardar, Ziauddin and Van Loon, Borin (1994). ''Introducing Cultural Studies.'' New York: Totem Books&lt;/ref&gt;

*The aim of cultural studies is to examine cultural practices and their relation to [[power (sociology)|power]]. For example, a study of a [[subculture]] (such as white working class youth in London) would consider their social practices against those of the dominant culture (in this example, the middle and upper classes in London who control the political and financial sectors that create policies affecting the well-being of white working class youth in London).
*The objective of cultural studies includes understanding culture in all its complex forms and analyzing the social and political context in which culture manifests itself.
*Cultural studies is a site of both study/analysis and political criticism/action. (For example, not only would a cultural studies scholar study an object, but s/he would connect this study to a larger, progressive political project.)
*Cultural studies attempts to expose and reconcile constructed divisions of [[knowledge]] that purport to be grounded in nature.
*Cultural studies has a commitment to an ethical evaluation of modern [[society]] and to a [[Radicalization|radical]] line of political action.

==History==
As Dennis Dworkin writes,&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Dennis. ''Cultural Marxism in Post-War Britain: History, the New Left, and the Origins of Cultural Studies'' (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1997), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; "a critical moment" in the beginning of cultural studies as a field was when [[Richard Hoggart]] used the term in 1964 in founding the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] (CCCS) at the [[University of Birmingham]] in the UK, which was to become home for the development of the intellectual orientation that has become known internationally as the "Birmingham School" of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;see also Corner, John (1991), "Postscript: Studying Culture—Reflections and Assessment: An Interview with Richard Hoggart." ''Media, Culture and Society'', Vol. 13, No. 2, April.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] at the university thus became the world's first institutional home of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/research/projects/cccs/about.aspx|title=About the Birmingham CCCS - University of Birmingham|website=www.birmingham.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoggart appointed [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] as his assistant, and Hall was effectively directing [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] by 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Davies, "British Cultural Marxism," ''International Journal of Politics, Culture and Society'' 4(3) (1991): 323-344, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall formally assumed the directorship of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] in 1971, when Hoggart left Birmingham to become Assistant Director-General of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hoggart, An Idea and Its Servants: UNESCO from Within.  Newark, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the field of cultural studies became closely associated with Hall's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morley &amp; Chen (eds.)|title=Stuart Hall: Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilroy, Grossberg and McRobbie (eds.)|title=Without Guarantees: In Honour of Stuart Hall|date=2000|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, Hall left Birmingham to accept a prestigious chair in Sociology at the Open University in the UK, and Richard Johnson took over the directorship of the Centre.

In the late 1990s, "restructuring" at the [[University of Birmingham]] led to the elimination of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] and the creation of a new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS) in 1999.  Then, in 2002, the University of Birmingham's senior administration abruptly announced the disestablishment of CSS, provoking a substantial international outcry.  The immediate reason for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's [[Research Assessment Exercise]] of 2001, though a dean from the university attributed the decision to "inexperienced ‘macho management.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Frank|title=Cultural Studies and Sociology at, and After, the Closure of the Birmingham School|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2004|volume=18|issue=6|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RAE, a holdover initiative of the [[Margaret Thatcher]]-led UK government of 1986,  determines research funding for university programs.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Polly (2002), [http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/socialsciences/story/0,,745058,00.html "Birmingham's cultural studies department given the chop"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous published accounts of the history of cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Graeme|title=British Cultural Studies: An Introduction|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartley|first1=John|title=A Short History of Cultural Studies|date=2003|publisher=Sage|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1980|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stuart Hall's directorship of CCCS at Birmingham===
Beginning in 1964, after the initial appearance of the founding works of British Cultural Studies in the late 1950s, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]'s pioneering work at [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]], along with that of his colleagues and postgraduate students including [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Dick Hebdige]], David Morley, Charlotte Brunsdon, John Clarke, [[Richard Dyer]], Judith Williamson, Richard Johnson, Iain Chambers, Dorothy Hobson, Chris Weedon, Tony Jefferson, Michael Green and [[Angela McRobbie]], gave shape and substance to the field of cultural studies.  Many cultural studies scholars employed [[Marxist]] methods of analysis, exploring the relationships between cultural forms ([[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|the superstructure]]) and that of the political economy ([[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|the base]]).  By the 1970s, the work of [[Louis Althusser]] radically rethought the Marxist account of "base" and "superstructure" in ways that had a significant influence on the "Birmingham School."  Much of the work done at [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] studied youth subcultural expressions of antagonism toward "respectable" middle-class British culture in the post-WWII period.  Also during the 70s, the politically formidable British working classes were in decline.  Britain's manufacturing industries were fading and union rolls were shrinking.  Yet millions of working class Britons backed the rise of [[Margaret Thatcher]].  For Stuart Hall and his colleagues, this shift in loyalty from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had to be explained in terms of cultural politics, which they had been tracking even before Thatcher's victory.  Some of this work was presented in the cultural studies classic, ''Policing the Crisis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall, Critcher, Jefferson, Clarke &amp; Roberts|title=Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State, and Law and Order|date=1978|publisher=Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other later texts such as Hall's ''The Hard Road to Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|title=The Hard Road to Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left|date=1988|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''New Times: The Changing Face of Politics in the 1990s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall &amp; Jacques (eds.)|title=New Times: The Changing Face of Politics in the 1990s|date=1991|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To trace the development of British Cultural Studies, see, for example, the work of [[Richard Hoggart]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Raymond Williams]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Angela McRobbie]], [[Paul Gilroy]], David Morley, Charlotte Brunsdon, [[Richard Dyer]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uniteyouthdublin.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/john_storey_what_is_cultural_studies_a_readerbookzz-org.pdf|title=What is Cultural Studies?|last=Storey|first=John|date=1996|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural studies in the late-1970s and beyond===
By the late 1970s, scholars associated with [[The Birmingham School]] had firmly placed questions of gender and race on the cultural studies agenda, where they have remained ever since.  Also by the late 1970s, cultural studies had begun to attract a great deal of international attention.  It spread globally throughout the 1980s and 90s.  As it did so, it both encountered new conditions of knowledge production, and engaged with other major international intellectual currents such as poststructuralism, postmodernism and postcolonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas &amp; Erni (eds.)|title=Internationalizing Cultural Studies: An Anthology|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wide range of cultural studies journals now located throughout the world, as shown below, is one indication of the globalization of the field.

==Developments outside the UK==
In the US, prior to the emergence of British Cultural Studies, several versions of cultural analysis had emerged largely from pragmatic and liberal-pluralist philosophical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when British Cultural Studies began to spread internationally in the late 1970s, and to engage with feminism, poststructuralism, postmodernism and race in the late 70s and 1980s, critical cultural studies (i.e., Marxist, feminist, poststructuralist, etc.) expanded tremendously in US universities in fields such as communication studies, education, sociology and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|Nelson|Treichler|1992|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren &amp; Vavrus (eds.)|title=American Cultural Studies|date=2002|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartley &amp; Pearson (eds.)|title=American Cultural Studies: A Reader|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cultural Studies (journal)|Cultural Studies]]'', the flagship journal of the field, has been based in the US since its founding editor, [[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]], brought it there from Australia in 1987.

A thriving cultural studies scene has existed in [[Australia]] since the late 1970s, when several key CS practitioners emigrated there from the UK, taking British Cultural Studies with them, after [[Margaret Thatcher]] became Prime Minister of the UK in 1979.  A school of cultural studies known as "cultural policy studies" is one of the distinctive Australian contributions to the field, though it is not the only one.  Australia also gave birth to the world's first professional cultural studies association (now known as the Cultural Studies Association of Australasia) in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frow &amp; Morris (eds.)|title=Australian Cultural Studies: A Reader|date=1993|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner (ed.)|first1=Graeme|title=Nation, Culture, Text: Australian Cultural and Media Studies|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural studies journals based in Australia include ''[[International Journal of Cultural Studies]]'', ''[[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]]'' and ''Cultural Studies Review''.

In [[Canada]], cultural studies has sometimes focused on issues of [[technology and society]], continuing the emphasis in the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Harold Innis]], and others.  Cultural studies journals based in Canada include ''Topia: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies''.

In Africa, [[human rights]] and [[Third World]] issues are among the central topics treated.  Cultural Studies journals based in Africa include the ''[[Journal of African Cultural Studies]]''.

In [[Latin America]], cultural studies has drawn on thinkers such as [[José Martí]], [[Ángel Rama]] and other Latin American figures, in addition to the Western theoretical sources associated with cultural studies in other parts of the world.  Leading Latin American cultural studies scholars include [[Néstor García Canclini]], [[Jésus Martín-Barbero]], and [[Beatriz Sarlo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarto, Ríos &amp; Trigo (eds.)|title=The Latin American Cultural Studies Reader|date=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irwin &amp; Szurmuck (eds.)|title=Dictionary of Latin American Cultural Studies|date=2012|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the key issues addressed by Latin American cultural studies scholars are [[decoloniality]], [[urban culture]]s, and [[postdevelopment theory]].  Latin American cultural studies journals include the ''Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies''.

Even though cultural studies developed much more rapidly in the UK than in continental Europe, there is a significant cultural studies presence in countries such as France, Spain and Portugal.  The field is relatively undeveloped in Germany, probably due to the continued influence of the [[Frankfurt School]], which is now often said to be in its third generation, which includes notable figures such as [[Axel Honneth]].  Cultural studies journals based in continental Europe include the ''[[European Journal of Cultural Studies]]'', the ''Journal of Spanish Cultural Studies'', ''[[French Cultural Studies]]'', and ''Portuguese Cultural Studies''.

In Germany, the term ''cultural studies'' specifically refers to the field in the Anglo-sphere especially British Cultural Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=GEkqO--HndgC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314&amp;dq=cultural+studies+in+deutschen+Kontext&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MGHZhanE3M&amp;sig=QHeWMp6GMLv_WNbX3evkxYhTGcY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2756p493QAhUGtRQKHRQSDxgQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20studies%20in%20deutschen%20Kontext&amp;f=false|title=Normativität: Über die Hintergründe sozialwissenschaftlicher Theoriebildung|last=Ahrens|first=Johannes|last2=Beer|first2=Raphael|last3=Bittlingmayer|first3=Uwe H.|last4=Gerdes|first4=Jürgen|date=2011-02-10|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=9783531930107|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; to differentiate it from the German [[:de:Kulturwissenschaft|Kulturwissenschaft]] which developed along different lines and is characterized by its distance from political science. However, Kulturwissenschaft and cultural studies are often used interchangeably, particularly by lay persons.

Throughout Asia, cultural studies has boomed and thrived since at least the beginning of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen &amp; Huat (eds.)|title=The Inter-Asia Cultural Studies Reader|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural studies journals based in Asia include ''[[Inter-Asia Cultural Studies]]''. In India the Centre for Study of Culture and Society, Bangalore and the Department of Cultural Studies at The English and Foreign Languages University Hyderabad at two major institutional spaces for Cultural Studies.

==Issues, concepts and approaches==

===Marxism, feminism, race and culture===
As noted above, Marxism has been an important influence upon cultural studies. Those associated with [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] initially engaged deeply with the [[structuralism]] of [[Louis Althusser]], and later in the 1970s turned decisively toward [[Antonio Gramsci]]. Cultural studies has also embraced the examination of race, gender, and other aspects of identity, as is illustrated, for example, by a number of key books published collectively under the name of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] in the late 1970s and early 80s, including ''Women Take Issue: Aspects of Women's Subordination'' (1978), and ''The Empire Strikes Back: Race and Racism in 70s Britain'' (1982).

===Gramsci and hegemony===
To understand the changing political circumstances of class, politics and culture in the United Kingdom, scholars at [[The Birmingham School]] turned to the work of [[Antonio Gramsci]], an Italian thinker, writer and communist party leader of the 1910s, 20s and '30s.  Gramsci had been concerned with similar issues: why would Italian laborers and peasants vote for fascists?  What strategic approach is necessary to mobilize popular support in more progressive directions?  Gramsci modified [[classical Marxism]], and argued that culture must be understood as a key site of political and social struggle.  In his view, capitalists used not only brute force (police, prisons, repression, military) to maintain control, but also penetrated the everyday culture of working people in a variety of ways in their efforts to win popular "consent."  It is important to recognize that for Gramsci, historical leadership, or "hegemony," involves the formation of alliances between class factions, and struggles within the cultural realm of everyday common sense.  Hegemony was always, for Gramsci, an interminable, unstable and contested process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|author-link1=Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|title=Gramsci's Relevance for the Study of Race and Ethnicity |journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|date=June 1986|volume=10|issue=2 |pages=5–27|doi=10.1177/019685998601000202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Lash]] writes:
{{quote|text=In the work of Hall, Hebdige and McRobbie, popular culture came to the fore... What Gramsci gave to this was the importance of consent and culture.  If the fundamental Marxists saw power in terms of class-versus-class, then Gramsci gave to us a question of ''class alliance''. The rise of cultural studies itself was based on the decline of the prominence of fundamental class-versus-class politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lash|2007|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Edgar and Sedgwick write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The theory of [[hegemony]] was of central importance to the development of British cultural studies [particularly [[The Birmingham School]]. It facilitated analysis of the ways subordinate groups actively resist and respond to political and economic domination.  The subordinate groups needed not to be seen merely as the passive dupes of the dominant class and its ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar &amp; Sedgewick, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Structure and agency===
The development of hegemony theory in cultural studies was in some ways consonant with work in other fields exploring [[Structure and agency|agency]], a theoretical concept that insists on the active, critical capacities of subordinated peoples (e.g. the working classes, colonized peoples, women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giddens|first1=Anthony|title=The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration|date=1984|publisher=Polity Press|location=Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Stuart Hall famously argued in his 1981 essay, "Notes on Deconstructing 'the Popular'," "ordinary people are not cultural dopes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guins &amp; Cruz (eds.)|title=Popular Culture: A Reader|date=2005|publisher=Sage|location=London|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insistence on accounting for the agency of subordinated peoples runs counter to the work of traditional structuralists.  Some analysts have however been critical of some work in cultural studies that they feel overstates the significance of or even romanticizes some forms of popular cultural agency.

Cultural studies often concerns itself with agency at the level of the practices of everyday life, and approaches such research from a standpoint of radical contextualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grossberg|first1=Lawrence|title=Cultural Studies in the Future Tense|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, cultural studies rejects universal accounts of cultural practices,  meanings, and identities.

Judith Butler, an American feminist theorist whose work is often associated with cultural studies, wrote that

&lt;blockquote&gt;the move from a [[Structuralism|structuralist]] account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure. It has marked a shift from a form of [[Althusser]]ian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Judith|title=Further Reflections on Conversations of Our Time|journal=Diacritics|date=1997|volume=27|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Globalization===
In recent decades, as capitalist culture has spread throughout the world via contemporary forms of [[globalization]], cultural studies has generated important analyses of local sites and practices of negotiation with and resistance to Western hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization|date=1996|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural consumption===
Cultural Studies criticizes the traditional view of the passive consumer, particularly by underlining the different ways people ''read,'' receive and interpret cultural texts, or appropriate other kinds of cultural products, or otherwise participate in the production and circulation of meanings. On this view, a consumer can appropriate, actively rework or challenge the meanings circulated through cultural texts. In some of its variants, then, cultural studies has thus shifted the analytical focus from (traditional understandings of) production to consumption, which is nevertheless understood as a form of production (of meanings, of identities, etc.) in its own right. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[John Fiske (media studies)|John Fiske]], and others have been influential in these developments.

A special 2008 issue of the field's flagship journal, ''Cultural Studies'', examined "Anti-Consumerism" from a variety of cultural studies angles.  As Jeremy Gilbert noted in his contribution to this issue, cultural studies must grapple with the fact that “we now live in an era when, throughout the capitalist world, the overriding aim of government economic policy is to maintain consumer spending levels. This is an era when ‘consumer confidence’ is treated as the key indicator and cause of economic effectiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Jeremy|title=Against the Commodification of Everything|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2008|volume=22|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The concept of "text"===
Cultural studies, drawing upon and developing [[semiotics]], uses the concept of ''[[wikt:text|text]]'' to designate not only written language, but also [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[photography|photograph]]s, [[fashion]], [[hairstyle]]s, and so forth; the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture. This conception of textuality derives especially from the work of the pioneering and influential semiotician, [[Roland Barthes]], but also owes debts to other sources, such as [[Juri Lotman]] and his colleagues from [[Tartu–Moscow School]]. Similarly, the field widens the concept of "culture." "Culture," for a cultural studies researcher, includes not only  traditional [[high culture]] (the culture of [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]]s),&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail 1981. ''The Dialogic Imagination.'' Austin, TX: UT Press, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; but also everyday meanings and practices, which have, as noted above, become a central focus of cultural studies.  Cultural studies even approaches sites and spaces of everyday life, such as pubs, living rooms, gardens and beaches, as "texts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiske, Hodge and Turner|title=Myths of Oz: Reading Australian Popular Culture|date=1987|publisher=Boston|location=Allen &amp; Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Lewis (professor)|Jeff Lewis]] summarized much of the work on textuality and textual analysis in his cultural studies textbook and a post-9/11 monograph on media and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Lewis (2008) Cultural Studies, Sage, London; Jeff Lewis, (2005) Language Wars: The Role of Media and Culture in Global Terror and Political Violence, Pluto, London.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lewis, 'textual studies' use complex and difficult heuristic methods and require both powerful interpretive skills and a subtle conception of politics and contexts. The task of the cultural analyst, for Lewis, is to engage with both knowledge systems and texts, and observe and analyse the ways the two interact with one another.  This engagement represents the critical dimensions of the analysis, its capacity to illuminate the hierarchies within and surrounding the given text and its discourses.

==Academic reception==
Cultural studies has evolved through the confluence of various disciplines—anthropology, media and communication studies, literary studies, education, geography, philosophy, sociology, politics and others. While some have accused certain areas of cultural studies of meandering into political relativism and a kind of empty version of "postmodern" analysis, others hold that at its core, cultural studies provides a significant conceptual and methodological framework for cultural, social and economic critique.  This critique is designed to "deconstruct" the meanings and assumptions that are inscribed in the institutions, texts and practices that work with and through, and produce and re-present, culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2008|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}} Thus, while some scholars and disciplines like to dismiss cultural studies for its methodological openness and rejection of disciplinarity, its core strategies of critique and analysis have had a profound influence throughout the more progressive and critical areas of the social sciences and humanities. Cultural studies work on forms of social differentiation, control and inequality, identity, community-building, media, and knowledge production, for example, has had a substantial impact. Moreover, the influence of cultural studies has become increasingly evident in areas as diverse as [[translation studies]], health studies, international relations, development studies, computer studies, economics, archaeology, and neurobiology, as well as across the range of disciplines that initially shaped the emergence of cultural studies, including literature, sociology, communication studies, and anthropology.

Cultural studies has also diversified its own interests and methodologies, incorporating a range of studies on media policy, democracy, design, leisure, tourism, warfare and development. While certain key concepts such as ideology or discourse, class, hegemony, identity and gender remain significant, cultural studies has long engaged with and integrated new concepts and approaches such as deconstruction and postmodernism. The field thus continues to pursue political critique through its engagements with the forces of culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|During|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

The Blackwell ''Companion to Cultural Studies'', edited by leading cultural studies scholar Toby Miller, contains essays that analyze the development of cultural studies approaches within each of a wide range of disciplines across the contemporary social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2006|p=index}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary scholars===
Many cultural studies practitioners work in departments of English or Comparative Literature.  Nevertheless, some traditional literary scholars such as Yale professor [[Harold Bloom]] have been outspoken critics of cultural studies. On the level of methodology, these scholars dispute the theoretical underpinning of the movement's critical framework.

Bloom stated his position during the September 3, 2000 episode of [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Booknotes]]'', while discussing his book ''How to Read and Why'':

{{quote|text=[T]here are two enemies of reading now in the world, not just in the English-speaking world. One [is] the lunatic destruction of literary studies...and its replacement by what is called cultural studies in all of the universities and colleges in the English-speaking world, and everyone knows what that phenomenon is. I mean, the...now-weary phrase 'political correctness' remains a perfectly good descriptive phrase for what has gone on and is, alas, still going on almost everywhere and which dominates, I would say, rather more than three-fifths of the tenured faculties in the English-speaking world, who really do represent a treason of the intellectuals, I think, a 'betrayal of the clerks'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Read and Why|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?157968-1/read|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=April 19, 2017|date=September 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marxist literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] is not wholly opposed to cultural studies, but has criticised aspects of it and highlighted what he sees as its strengths and weaknesses in books such as ''After Theory'' (2003). For Eagleton, literary and cultural theory have the potential to say important things about the "fundamental questions" in life, but theorists have rarely realized this potential.

===Sociologists===
Cultural studies has also had a substantial impact on sociology.  For example, when Stuart Hall left [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] at Birmingham, it was to accept a prestigious professorship in Sociology at the Open University in Britain.  The subfield of cultural sociology, in particular, is disciplinary home to many cultural studies practitioners.  Nevertheless, there are some differences between sociology as a discipline and the field of cultural studies as a whole.  While sociology was founded upon various historic works purposefully distinguishing the subject from [[philosophy]] or [[psychology]], cultural studies has explicitly interrogated and criticized traditional understandings and practices of disciplinarity.  Most CS practitioners think it is best that cultural studies neither emulate disciplines nor aspire to disciplinarity for cultural studies. Rather, they promote a kind of radical interdisciplinarity as the basis for cultural studies.

One sociologist whose work has had a major influence upon cultural studies is [[Pierre Bourdieu]].  Bourdieu's work makes innovative use of statistics and in-depth interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Harker, Cheleen Mahar, Chris Wilkes (eds), ''An Introduction to the Work of Pierre Bourdieu: The Theory of Practice''. Houndmills: Macmillan, 1990, pp. 68-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourdieu|first1=Pierre|title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste|date=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although Bourdieu's work has been highly influential within cultural studies, and although Bourdieu regarded his work as a form of science, cultural studies has never embraced the idea that it should aspire toward "scientificity," and has marshalled a wide range of theoretical and methodological arguments against the fetishization of "scientificity" as a basis for cultural studies.

Two sociologists who have been critical of cultural studies, [[Chris Rojek]] and [[Bryan S. Turner]], argue in their article, "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn", that cultural studies, particularly the flavor championed by Stuart Hall, lacks a stable research agenda, and privileges the contemporary reading of texts, thus producing an ahistorical theoretical focus. Many, however, would argue, following Hall, that cultural studies has always sought to avoid the establishment of a fixed research agenda; this follows from its critique of disciplinarity.  Moreover, Hall and many others have long argued against the misunderstanding that textual analysis is the sole methodology of cultural studies, and have practiced numerous other approaches, as noted above.  Rojek and Turner also level the accusation that there is "a sense of moral superiority about the correctness of the political views articulated" in cultural studies&lt;ref&gt;Rojek, Chris, and Bryan Turner, "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn." ''The Sociological Review'' 48.4 (2000): 629-648.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physicist Alan Sokal===
{{Main article|Sokal affair}}
In 1996, physicist [[Alan Sokal]] expressed his opposition to cultural studies by [[Sokal affair|submitting a hoax article]] to a cultural studies journal, ''[[Social Text]]''. The article, which was crafted as a parody of what Sokal referred to as the "fashionable nonsense" of [[postmodernism]], was accepted by the editors of the journal, which did not at the time practice peer review. When the paper appeared in print, Sokal published a second article in a self-described "academic gossip" magazine, ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', revealing his hoax on ''[[Social Text]]''. Sokal stated that his motivation stemmed from his rejection of contemporary critiques of scientific rationalism:

{{quote|text="Politically, I'm angered because most (though not all) of this silliness is emanating from the self-proclaimed Left. We're witnessing here a profound historical ''volte-face''. For most of the past two centuries, the Left has been identified with science and against obscurantism; we have believed that rational thought and the fearless analysis of objective reality (both natural and social) are incisive tools for combating the mystifications promoted by the powerful -- not to mention being desirable human ends in their own right. The recent turn of many "progressive" or "leftist" academic humanists and social scientists toward one or another form of epistemic relativism betrays this worthy heritage and undermines the already fragile prospects for progressive social critique. Theorizing about "the social construction of reality" won't help us find an effective treatment for AIDS or devise strategies for preventing global warming. Nor can we combat false ideas in history, sociology, economics and politics if we reject the notions of truth and falsity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies"], [[Alan Sokal]], English translation of article from ''Lingua Franca'', 1996. Physics.nyu.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Use of Deadly Force Authorized (5730792058).jpg|thumb|right|Warning sign at [[Langley Air Force Base|Langley AFB]]]]

'''Deadly force''', also known as '''lethal force''', is [[use of force]] that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or [[death]] to another person. In most jurisdictions, the use of deadly force is justified only under conditions of extreme necessity as a [[wikt:last resort|last resort]], when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed.

[[Firearm]]s, [[bladed weapon]]s, [[explosive material|explosive]]s, and [[vehicle]]s are among those [[weapon]]s the use of which is considered deadly force. The use of [[Improvised weapon|non-traditional weapons]] in an offensive manner, such as a [[baseball bat]], sharp pencil, tire iron or other, may also be considered deadly force.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

[[File:Wayne County Sheriff Deputy with Reising submachine gun.JPG|right|thumb|Deputy Sheriff with [[Reising]] submachine gun.]]   
{{Main|Police use of deadly force in the United States}}
The [[United States Armed Forces]] defines deadly force as "force that a person uses causing, or that a person knows or should know would create a substantial risk of causing, death or serious bodily harm or injury".&lt;ref&gt;AFI 31-207 Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="robertankony"&gt;Robert C. Ankony, "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," ''CFM Research'', July 2012, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[United States]], the use of deadly force by sworn [[law enforcement officers]] is lawful  when the officer reasonably believes the subject poses a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to themselves or others.  The use of deadly force by law enforcement is also lawful when used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon when the officer believes escape would pose a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to members of the public. Common law allowed officers to use any force necessary to effect a felony arrest but this was narrowed in the ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' ruling in 1985 when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] said that "deadly force...may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has [[probable cause]] to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others." &lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

In the 1989 ''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' ruling, the Supreme Court expanded its definition to include "objective reasonableness" standard—not subjective as to what the officer's intent might have been—and it must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer at the scene—and its calculus must embody the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

Most [[Law enforcement in the United States|law enforcement agencies]] establish a [[use of force continuum]] starting with simple presence through deadly force. With this model, officers attempt to control subjects and situations with the minimum force necessary. Agencies often have policies limiting the force used to be equal or one step higher on the continuum to the force they are opposing.

A [[civilian]]'s use of deadly force is generally [[justifiable homicide|justified]] if he or she reasonably believe that he or she is or other innocent lives are in imminent danger of death or serious injury.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;  Justification and affirmative defenses vary by state and may include certain property crimes, specific crimes against children or prevention of sexual assaults. 

[[U.S. law]] requires an investigation whenever a person causes another person's death, but the mechanism for such investigations can vary by state. The investigation develops evidence regarding the use of deadly physical force for the particular state or jurisdiction. An investigation may performed by a local or state police agency and also a civilian agency, such as a county prosecutor or State Attorney General.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt; A report of the findings of such an investigation may be submitted for prosecution and made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of Deadly Force by Law Enforcement Officers|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2008/rpt/2008-R-0074.htm|publisher=Chief Attorney|accessdate=28 December 2013|date=February 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation to motor vehicles ===
In {{cite court
  |litigants=Scott v. Harris
  |vol=
  |reporter=
  |opinion=No. 05-1631

  |court=
  |date=April 30, 2007
  |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-1631.ZS.html
}}, the (U.S. Supreme Court 2007) held that a police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatened the lives of innocent bystanders did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], even when it places the fleeing [[motorist]] at risk of serious bodily injury or death. In the ''Harris'' case, Officer Scott [[PIT maneuver|applied his police car's push bumper to the rear of the suspect's vehicle]], causing the [[suspect]] vehicle to lose control and crash, resulting in the fleeing suspect being paralyzed from the waist down.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

Traditionally, intentional contact between vehicles has been characterized as unlawful deadly force, though some U.S. federal appellate cases have mitigated this precedent. In
{{cite court
  |litigants=Adams v. St. Lucie County Sheriff's Department
  |vol=998
  |reporter=F.2d
  |opinion=923
  |court=11th Cir.
  |date=1993
}},
the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that although fatalities may result from intentional collisions between automobiles such fatalities are infrequent, and therefore unlawful deadly force should not be presumed to be the level of force applied in such incidents; the Adams case was subsequently called into question by
{{cite court
  |litigants=Harris v Coweta County
 |vol=406
  |reporter=F.3d
  |opinion=1307
  |court=11th Cir.
  |date=2005
}}, which in turn was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the ''Scott v. Harris'' case discussed above; the extent to which ''Adams'' can continue to be relied on is uncertain. In the ''Adams'' case, the officer rammed the suspect's vehicle.

In
{{cite court
  |litigants=Donovan v. City of Milwaukee
  |vol=17
  |reporter=F.3d
  |opinion=944
  |court=7th Cir.
  |date=1994
}}, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recognized this principle but added that collisions between automobiles and motorcycles frequently lead to the death of the motorcyclist, and therefore a presumption that unlawful deadly force was used in such intentional collisions is more appropriate. In the ''Donovan'' case, the suspect lost control of his motorcycle and became airborne, crashing into the officer's vehicle, which was parked as part of an intercepting roadblock.

'''Ethnic cleansing''' is the systematic forced removal of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or racial groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, often with the intent of making it ethnically [[homogeneous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James M. |last=Rubenstein |title=The Cultural Landscape: An Introduction to Human Geography |publisher=Pearson, |year=2008 |isbn=9780131346819}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} The forces applied may be various forms of [[forced migration]] ([[deportation]], [[population transfer]]), intimidation, as well as [[genocide]] and [[genocidal rape]].

Ethnic cleansing is usually accompanied with efforts to remove physical and cultural evidence of the targeted group in the territory through the destruction of homes, social centers, farms, and infrastructure, and by the desecration of monuments, cemeteries, and places of worship.

Initially used by the perpetrators during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and cited in this context as a euphemism akin to that of Nazi Germany's "[[Final Solution]]", by the 1990s, the term gained widespread acceptance due to journalism and the media's heightened use of the term in its generic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Thum |first1= Gregor |year= 2006–2007 |title= Ethnic Cleansing in Eastern Europe after 1945 |journal= Contemporary European History |volume= 19 |issue=1 |pages= 75–81 |doi=10.1017/S0960777309990257 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
An antecedent to the term is the Greek word ''andrapodismos'' ({{lang-gr|ανδραποδισμός}}; lit. "enslavement"), which was used in ancient texts to describe atrocities that accompanied [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in 335 BC.&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Booth|year=2012|title=The Kosovo Tragedy: The Human Rights Dimensions|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1-13633-476-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e4MsBgAAQBAJe|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, regional variants of the term could be found among the Czechs ''(očista)'', the Poles ''(oczyszczanie)'', the French ''(épuration)'' and the Germans ''(Säuberung)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Ther |editor1=Rainer Munz |editor2=Rainer Ohliger |year=2004 |title=Diasporas and Ethnic Migrants: Germany, Israel and Russia in Comparative Perspective |chapter=The Spell of the Homogeneous Nation State: Structural Factors and Agents of Ethnic Cleansing |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-1-13575-938-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEOQAgAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} A 1913 [[Carnegie Endowment]] report condemning the actions of all participants in the [[Balkan Wars]] contained various new terms to describe brutalities committed toward ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://balkanologie.revues.org/2365|title=The Two Carnegie Reports: From the Balkan Expedition of 1913 to the Albanian Trip of 1921|first=Nadine|last=Akhund|date=December 31, 2012|publisher=|journal=Balkanologie.

During [[World War II]], the euphemism ''čišćenje terena'' ("cleansing the terrain") was used by the Croatian [[Ustaše]] to describe military actions in which non-Croats were purposely killed or otherwise uprooted from their homes.&lt;ref name="Toal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toal|first1=Gerard|last2=Dahlman|first2=Carl T.|title=Bosnia Remade: Ethnic Cleansing and Its Reversal|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=2011|isbn= 978-0-19-973036-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1TrvGxJeasC|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viktor Gutić]], a senior Ustaše leader, was one of the first Croatian nationalists on record to use the term as a euphemism for committing atrocities against [[Serbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard |last=West|year=1994|title=Tito and the Rise and Fall of Yugoslavia|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7867-0332-6|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later used in the internal memorandums of Serbian [[Chetniks]] in reference to a number of retaliatory massacres they committed against [[Bosniaks]] and [[Croats]] between 1941 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edina |last=Becirevic|year=2014|title=Genocide on the River Drina|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-3001-9258-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0X4AwAAQBAJ|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian phrase очистка границ (''ochistka granits''; lit. "cleansing of borders") was used in Soviet documents of the early 1930s to refer to the forced resettlement of Polish people from the {{convert|22|km|adj=on}} [[Border Security Zone of Russia|border zone]] in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian]] and [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSRs]]. This process was repeated on an even larger scale in 1939–41, involving many other groups suspected of disloyalty towards the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; During [[The Holocaust]], [[Nazi Germany]] pursued a policy of ensuring that Europe was "cleansed of Jews" ''([[Judenrein]])''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mary |last=Fulbrooke|year=2004|title=A Concise History of Germany|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-52154-071-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFBu8ujJWzkC|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In its complete form, the term appeared for the first time in the Romanian language (''purificare etnică'') in an address by Vice Prime Minister [[Mihai Antonescu]] to cabinet members in July 1941. After the beginning of the invasion of the USSR,{{huh?|date=October 2017}} he concluded: “I do not know when the Romanians will have such chance for ethnic cleansing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnopolitical Temptations Reach Southeastern Europe: Wartime Policy Papers of Vasa Čubrilović and Sabin Manuilă|last=Petrovic|first=Vladimir|publisher=CEU Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the Soviets used the term "ethnic cleansing" to describe the inter-ethnic violence in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].&lt;ref name="Booth"/&gt; At around the same time, the Yugoslav media used it to describe what they alleged was an Albanian nationalist plot to force all Serbs to leave [[Kosovo]]. It was widely popularized by the Western media during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992–95). The first recorded mention of its use in the Western media can be traced back to an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' dated 15 April 1992, in a quote by an anonymous Western diplomat.&lt;ref name="Toal"/&gt;

The Final Report of the Commission of Experts established pursuant to [[Security Council Resolution 780]] defined ethnic cleansing as "a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas".&lt;ref name="SCRes780-Report-130"&gt;{{cite web |title=Final Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 780 (1992) |date=May 27, 1994 |url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/1994/674 |publisher=United Nations Security Council |format=PDF |page=33 &lt;!--paragraph 130--&gt; |quote=Upon examination of reported information, specific studies and investigations, the Commission confirms its earlier view that 'ethnic cleansing' is a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas.

This purpose appears to be the occupation of territory to the exclusion of the purged group or groups. This policy and the practices of warring factions are described separately in the following paragraphs.}} Paragraph 130.&lt;/ref&gt; In its previous, first interim report it noted, "[b]ased on the many reports describing the policy and practices conducted in the former [[Yugoslavia]], [that] 'ethnic cleansing' has been carried out by means of murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, [[war rape|rape]] and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, and wanton destruction of property.

The official United Nations definition of ethnic cleansing is "rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or [[intimidation]] to remove from a given area persons of another ethnic or religious group".&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, Robert M. (1996) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2501233 "Schindler's Fate: Genocide, Ethnic Cleansing, and Population Transfers"]. ''[[Slavic Review]]'' 55 (4), 727-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a category, ethnic cleansing encompasses a continuum or spectrum of policies. In the words of [[Andrew Bell-Fialkoff]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;[E]thnic cleansing [...] defies easy definition. At one end it is virtually indistinguishable from forced emigration and population exchange while at the other it merges with deportation and genocide. At the most general level, however, ethnic cleansing can be understood as the expulsion of a population from a given territory''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Bell-Fialkoff, [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html "A Brief History of Ethnic Cleansing"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040203000000/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html |date=February 3, 2004 }}, ''Foreign Affairs'' 72 (3): 110, Summer 1993. Retrieved May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Terry Martin (publisher)|Terry Martin]] has defined ethnic cleansing as "the forcible removal of an ethnically defined population from a given territory" and as "occupying the central part of a continuum between genocide on one end and nonviolent pressured ethnic emigration on the other end".&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;Martin, Terry (1998). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/235168 "The Origins of Soviet Ethnic Cleansing"]. ''[[The Journal of Modern History]]'' 70 (4), 813–861. pg. 822&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) [[Bosnian Genocide Case]] in the judgement of [[Jorgic v. Germany]] on July 12, 2007 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] quoted from the ICJ ruling on the ''Bosnian Genocide Case'' to draw a distinction between ''ethnic cleansing'' and ''genocide'':
{{quote|The term 'ethnic cleansing' has frequently been employed to refer to the events in Bosnia and Herzegovina which are the subject of this case ... [UN] General Assembly resolution 47/121 referred in its Preamble to 'the abhorrent policy of "ethnic cleansing", which is a form of genocide', as being carried on in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ... It [i.e., ethnic cleansing] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the [Genocide] Convention, if it corresponds to or falls within one of the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention. Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area "ethnically homogeneous", nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can ''as such'' be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is "to destroy, in whole or in part" a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent (''dolus specialis''), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. As the ICTY has observed, while 'there are obvious similarities between a genocidal policy and the policy commonly known as 'ethnic cleansing' (''Krstić'', IT-98-33-T, Trial Chamber Judgment, 2 August 2001, para. 562), yet '[a] clear distinction must be drawn between physical destruction and mere dissolution of a group. The expulsion of a group or part of a group does not in itself suffice for genocide.' |ECHR quoting the ICJ.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-81608 ''Jorgic v. Germany''] §45 citing ''Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro'' ("Case concerning application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide"), the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found under the heading of “intent and ‘ethnic cleansing’” (at § 190)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==As a crime under international law==

There is no international treaty that specifies a specific crime of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ward |last=Ferdinandusse |url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf |title=The Interaction of National and International Approaches in the Repression of International Crimes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705180121/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |journal=The European Journal of International Law |volume=15 |number=5 |year=2004 |p=1042, note 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ethnic cleansing in the broad sense—the forcible deportation of a population—is defined as a [[crime against humanity]] under the statutes of both [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm "Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113100723/http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm |date=January 13, 2008 }}, Article 7; [https://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc-e/index.htm ''Updated Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia''], Article 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The gross human-rights violations integral to stricter definitions of ethnic cleansing are treated as separate crimes falling under public international law of [[crimes against humanity]] and in certain circumstances [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daphna |last=Shraga |first2=Ralph |last2=Zacklin |url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html |title=The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233818/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |journal=The European Journal of International Law |volume=15 |number=3 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however situations, such as the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]], where ethnic cleansing has taken place without legal redress (see [[Preussische Treuhand v. Poland|''Preussische Treuhand'' v. Poland]]). [[Timothy V. Waters]] argues therefore that similar ethnic cleansing could go unpunished in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy V. Waters, [http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4600&amp;context=expresso "On the Legal Construction of Ethnic Cleansing"], Paper 951, 2006, [[University of Mississippi]] School of Law. Retrieved on 2006, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The emergence of ethnic cleansing as a distinct category of war crime has been a somewhat complex process. Each individual element of a programme of ethnic cleansing could be considered as an individual violation of humanitarian law - a killing here, a house-burning there – thus missing the systematic way in which such violations were perpetrated with a single aim in mind. International courts therefore consider individual incidents in the light of a possible pattern of ethnic cleansing. In the Yugoslav case, for instance, the ICTY considers the widespread massacres and abuses of human rights in Bosnia and Kosovo as part of an overall "joint criminal enterprise" to carve out ethnically pure states in the region.

However, many alleged "ethnic cleansings" in the past do not fit the modern definition of "crimes against humanity". For example, the post-WWII [[German expulsions]] were sanctioned by the international agreement at [[Potsdam conference]], requiring that the actions proceed humanely.--&gt;

==Genocide==
[[File:Armenianvictimsassault.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian Genocide]] victims]]
Academic discourse considers both [[genocide]] and ethnic cleansing to exist in a spectrum of assaults on nations or religio-ethnic groups. Ethnic cleansing is similar to forced deportation or population transfer whereas genocide is the intentional murder of part or all of a particular ethnic, racial, religious, or national group. While ethnic cleansing and genocide may share the same goal and the acts used to perpetrate both crimes may often resemble each other, ethnic cleansing is intended to displace a persecuted population from a given territory, while genocide is intended to destroy a population.&lt;ref name=Schabas&gt;{{cite book |last=Schabas |first=William |year=2000 |title=Genocide in International Law |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYptuRHDQPgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |pages=199–201 |isbn=9780521787901}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some academics consider genocide as a subset of "murderous ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael |year=2005 |title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Dark+Side+of+Democracy#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |page=17 |isbn=9780521538541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, these concepts are different, but related, as Norman Naimark writes: "literally and figuratively, ethnic cleansing bleeds into genocide, as mass murder is committed in order to rid the land of a people".&lt;ref name=MassVio&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Naimark |first=Norman |date=4 November 2007 |url=http://www.massviolence.org/Ethnic-Cleansing |title=Theoretical Paper: Ethnic Cleansing |encyclopedia=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306173512/http://www.massviolence.org/Ethnic-Cleansing |archivedate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William Schabas adds, "Ethnic cleansing is also a warning sign of genocide to come.

In 1946 [[Königsberg]] was renamed [[Kaliningrad]]. The survivors of the German population were forcibly expelled and the city was repopulated with Soviet citizens.

In the 1990s [[Bosnian war]], ethnic cleansing was a common phenomenon. It typically entailed intimidation, forced expulsion and/or killing of the undesired ethnic group, as well as the destruction or removal of key physical and cultural elements. These included places of worship, cemeteries, works of art and historic buildings. According to numerous ICTY verdicts, both Serb&lt;ref name="ICTY: Radoslav Brđanin judgement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/brdjanin/trialc/judgement/index.htm |title=ICTY: Radoslav Brđanin judgement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414072922/http://www.un.org/icty/brdjanin/trialc/judgement/index.htm |archivedate=April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Croat&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/kordic/trialc/judgement/index.htm |title=ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627000306/http://www.un.org/icty/kordic/trialc/judgement/index.htm |archivedate=June 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forces performed ethnic cleansing of their intended territories in order to create ethnically pure states ([[Republika Srpska]] and [[Herzeg-Bosnia]]). Serb forces were also judged to have committed [[Srebrenica genocide|genocide in Srebrenica and Zepa]] at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;ICTY; "Address by ICTY President Theodor Meron, at Potočari Memorial Cemetery" The Hague, June 23, 2004 [https://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2004/p860-e.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403003018/http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2004/p860-e.htm |date=April 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the evidence of numerous attacks by Croat forces against Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks), the ICTY Trial Chamber concluded in the ''Kordić and Čerkez case'' that by April 1993, the Croat leadership from Bosnia and Herzegovina had a designated plan to ethnically cleanse Bosniaks from the Lašva Valley in Central Bosnia. Dario Kordić, the local political leader, was found to be the instigator of this plan.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict - IV. Attacks on towns and villages: killings - C.

In the same year (1993), ethnic cleansing was also occurring in another country. During the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)|Georgian-Abkhaz conflict]], the armed [[Abkhazia|Abkhaz]] [[separatist]] insurgency implemented a campaign of [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing]] against the large population of ethnic Georgians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=Without an NEUTRAL expert opinion this sentence is OR.

As a tactic, ethnic cleansing has a number of systemic impacts. It enables a force to eliminate civilian support for resistance by eliminating the civilians—recognizing [[Mao Zedong]]'s dictum that guerrillas among a civilian population are fish in water, it removes the fish by draining the water{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. When enforced as part of a political settlement, as happened with the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forced resettlement of ethnic Germans to the new Germany]] after 1945, it can contribute to long-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;Judt, Tony. ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} Some individuals of the large German population in [[Czechoslovakia]] and prewar [[Poland]] had encouraged Nazi [[jingoism]] before the Second World War, but this was forcibly resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Judt ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} It thus establishes "[[facts on the ground]]"—radical demographic changes which can be very hard to reverse.

==Silent ethnic cleansing==
[[File:16 obljetnica vojnoredarstvene operacije Oluja 05082011 355.jpg|thumb|A ceremony marking the 16th anniversary of [[Operation Storm]], which resulted in the expulsion of more than 200,000 ethnic [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs from Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4747379.stm Evicted Serbs remember Storm ]".

Silent ethnic cleansing is a term coined in the mid-1990s by some observers of the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. Apparently concerned with Western media representations of atrocities committed in the conflict—which generally focused on those perpetrated by the Serbs—atrocities committed against [[Serbs]] were dubbed "silent" on the grounds that they did not receive adequate coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Krauthammer, Charles: "When Serbs Are 'Cleansed,' Moralists Stay Silent", ''International Herald Tribune'', August 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some incidents in [[Northern Ireland]] and during [[the Troubles]] between Protestants and Catholics were considered to be "ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/10/northernireland.race|title=Racist war of the loyalist street gangs|first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis|date=January 10, 2004|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/06/07/news/unionist-react-angrily-to-ira-ethnic-cleansing-plan-550226/|title=Unionists react angrily to IRA ‘ethnic cleansing' border plan|website=The Irish News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included events after the [[Holy Cross dispute]] in 2001 when Protestant paramilitaries were accused of carrying out ethnic cleansing of Catholics in north [[Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1974017.stm|title=Fresh trouble in Belfast|date=May 8, 2002|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/09/northernireland.rosiecowan|title='Ethnic cleansing' claim over Ulster attacks|first=Rosie|last=Cowan|date=September 9, 2002|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases where accusations of ethnic cleansing have circulated, partisans have fiercely disputed such an interpretation and the details of the events which have been described as ethnic cleansing by academic or legal experts. This often leads to the promotion of vastly different versions of the event in question.

==Criticism of the term==
[[Gregory Stanton]], the founder of [[Genocide Watch]], has criticised the rise of the term and its use for events that he feels should be called "genocide": as "ethnic cleansing" has no legal definition, its media use can detract attention from events that should be prosecuted as genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blum |first=Rony |last2=Stanton |first2=Gregory H. |last3=Sagi |first3=Shira |last4=Richter |first4=Elihu D. |title='Ethnic cleansing' bleaches the atrocities of genocide |journal=European Journal of Public Health |year=2007 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pmid=17513346 |pages=204–209 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckm011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Ethnic Cleansing and Genocidal Intent: A Failure of Judicial Interpretation?", ''Genocide Studies and Prevention'' 5, 1 (April 2010), Douglas Singleterry&lt;/ref&gt; Because of widespread acceptance after media influence, it has become a term used legally, but carries no legal repercussions as there is no legal definition.

A '''Fersommling''' (plural, '''Fersommlinge''') (also spelled '''[https://www.padutchdictionary.com/#d=Versammling Versammling]''' or '''Fersammling''') is a [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] social event in which food is served, speeches are made, and one or more ''g'spiel'' (plays or skits) are performed for entertainment. "A high degree of theatricality and ceremony is involved, especially in the groundhog lodges: pledging loyalty to the lodge and the groundhog, listening to a weather report, singing patriotic songs in [[Pennsylvania German language|Deitsch]], and ending every meeting by asking God to allow them to keep their way of life and their merriment."  as described by William W. Donner.&lt;ref name="Donner William W."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donner|first1=William W.|title=Serious Nonsense|date=2016|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, PA|isbn=978-0-271-07118-3|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these traditions is the singing of the German folk song "[[Schnitzelbank]]"&lt;ref name="Donner William W." /&gt;  and the patriotic "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", in [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]], as translated by [[John Birmelin]]. &lt;ref name="rosenberger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenberger |first=Homer Tope |title=The Pennsylvania Germans: 1891-1965 |location=[[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster, PA]] |publisher=[[Pennsylvania German Society]] |year=1966 |pages=194–199 |oclc=1745108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  " there is continual creativity, as current events are incorporated into the versammling performances, speeches, and skits." &lt;ref name="Donner William W." /&gt; 

Fersommlinge are typically attended by the [[Fancy Dutch]], as opposed to the "Plain sects" of the [[Amish]], [[Church of the Brethren|Brethren]] and [[Mennonites]]. The term literally means "a congregation," not in the sense of a group of church-goers, but as a "social gathering of people." Fersommlinge are not religious functions, though many churches and church groups hosted the events and used them to raise money. The Pennsylvania German [[dialect]] is the only language spoken at the event, and those who speak [[English language|English]] pay a penalty, usually in the form of a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]], [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] or [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]], per word spoken, put into a bowl in the center of the table.&lt;ref name="rosenberger"/&gt;  

The first Fersommling was held by Dr. John I. Woodruff of [[Susquehanna University]] in 1933.&lt;ref name="rosenberger"/&gt;  Shortly afterward, on March 13, 1933, a second was held in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Pennsylvania]] at the home of [[William S. Troxell]], who wrote a daily [[Column (newspaper)|column]] on Pennsylvania German [[culture]] for the Allentown ''[[The Morning Call|Morning Call]]'' under the [[pseudonym]] "Pumpernickle Bill."  The purpose of the gathering was to plan the formation of the first [[Grundsow Lodge|Grundsow (Groundhog) Lodge]]. On the next [[Groundhog day|Groundhog Day]], February 2, 1934, the first Fersommling of Grundsow Lodge Nummer Ains an Da Lechaw (Number One on the Lehigh) took place in [[Northampton, Pennsylvania|Northampton]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kutztown.edu/community/pgchc/grundsau%20lodge%202007%20june.pdf |last=Miller |first=Richard K. |title=Pennsylvania German Groundhog Lodges |date=June 2007 |publisher=Pennsylvania German Cultural Heritage Center, [[Kutztown University of Pennsylvania|Kutztown University]] ([[Kutztown, Pennsylvania|Kutztown, PA]]) |pages=1 |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2008-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010101745/http://www.kutztown.edu/community/pgchc/grundsau%20lodge%202007%20june.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kutztown.edu/community/pgchc/News/Pdf/news005fall1994.pdf |last=Shupp |first=Col.

Fersommlinge continue to be held throughout eastern Pennsylvania as a means of preserving the Pennsylvania German dialect and culture. For example, the [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] Fersommling, which started in 1937, annually attracts more than 700 participants, most of whom are of Pennsylvania German [[ancestor|ancestry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drum.umd.edu/dspace/bitstream/1903/8029/1/umi-umd-5164.pdf |title=Current Trends of Dialect Preservation through Musical Performance in the Pennsylvania German Community of Southeastern Pennsylvania |last=Yadush |first=Chantel Lynn |year=2008 |publisher=[[University of Maryland, College Park]] ([[College Park, Maryland|College Park, MD]]) |pages=55 |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2008-07-09 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Devlin |first=Ron |url=http://readingeagle.com/Article.aspx?id=30412 |title=Dialect spoken, and that's no tripe |publisher=''[[Reading Eagle]]'' ([[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading PA]]) |date=April 16, 2007 |accessdate=2008-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427203627/http://www.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=30412 |archivedate=April 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, some of the texts presented at Fersommlinge are also published in the Pennsylvania German newspaper [[Hiwwe wie Driwwe]]. Current Fersommling and Grundsau lodge information is kept up to date at [http://groundhoglodge.org/ groundhoglodge.org] and the [http://www.pgs.org/ Pennsylvania German Society]

'''''Future Shock''''' is a 1970 book by the [[futurist|futurists]] [[Alvin Toffler|Alvin and Heidi Toffler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alvin Toffler: still shocking after all these years - Interview|journal=New Scientist|date=19 March 1994|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14119173-500-alvin-toffler-still-shocking-after-all-these-years/}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the authors define the term "''future shock''" as a certain psychological state of individuals and entire societies. Their shortest definition for the term is a personal [[perception]] of "too much change in too short a period of time". The book, which became an international bestseller, grew out of an article "The Future as a Way of Life" in [[Horizon (U.S. magazine)|''Horizon'' magazine]], Summer 1965 issue.&lt;ref&gt;Toffler, Alvin, "The Future as a Way of Life", Horizon magazine, Summer 1965, Vol VII, Num 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://notearama.blogspot.com.au/2013/09/horizon-magazine-hardcover-issues-1959.html "Horizon Magazine hardcover issues 1959 – 1977 table of contents"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhart, Mary, [http://www.yoyow.com/marye/tofflers94.html "Alvin And Heidi Toffler: Surfing The Third Wave: On Life And Work In The Information Age"], MicroTimes #118, January 3, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/toffler.php "Alvin Toffler: still shocking after all these years: New Scientist meets the controversial futurologist"], [[New Scientist]], 19 March 1994, pp. 22–25. "What led you to write Future Shock? – While covering Congress, it occurred to us that big technological and social changes were occurring in the United States, but that the political system seemed totally blind to their existence. Between 1955 and 1960, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] was introduced, television became universalized, commercial jet travel came into being and a whole raft of other technological events occurred. Having spent several years watching the political process, we came away feeling that 99 per cent of what politicians do is keep systems running that were laid in place by previous generations of politicians. Our ideas came together in 1965 in an article called 'The future as a way of life', which argued that change was going to accelerate and that the speed of change could induce disorientation in lots of people. We coined the phrase 'future shock' as an analogy to the concept of culture shock. With future shock you stay in one place but your own culture changes so rapidly that it has the same disorienting effect as going to another culture"&lt;/ref&gt; The book has sold over 6 million copies and has been widely translated.

A [[Future Shock (film)|documentary film]] based on the book was released in 1972 with [[Orson Welles]] as on-screen narrator.

==Term==
The Tofflers argued that society is undergoing an enormous structural change, a revolution from an [[industrial society]] to a "[[super-industrial society]]". This change overwhelms people. He believed the accelerated rate of technological and social change left people disconnected and suffering from "shattering stress and disorientation"—future shocked. The Tofflers stated that the majority of social problems are symptoms of future shock. In their discussion of the components of such shock, they popularized the term "''[[information overload]]''."

This analysis of the phenomenon of information overload is continued in later publications, especially ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'' and ''[[Powershift: Knowledge, Wealth and Violence at the Edge of the 21st Century|Powershift]]''.

In the introduction to an essay entitled "Future Shock" in his book, ''Conscientious Objections'', [[Neil Postman]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Sometime about the middle of 1963, my colleague Charles Weingartner and I delivered in tandem an address to the [[National Council of Teachers of English]]. In that address we used the phrase "future shock" as a way of describing the social paralysis induced by rapid technological change. To my knowledge, Weingartner and I were the first people ever to use it in a public forum. Of course, neither Weingartner nor I had the brains to write a book called ''Future Shock'', and all due credit goes to [[Alvin Toffler]] for having recognized a good phrase when one came along" (p.&amp;nbsp;162).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Development of society and production==
[[Alvin Toffler|Alvin and Heidi]] distinguished three stages in development of society and production: agrarian, industrial and post-industrial.

All these waves develops own "super-ideology” with which explain the reality. This ideology affects all the spheres which make up a civilization phase: technology, social patterns, information patterns and "power" patterns.

The first stage began in the period of the [[Neolithic]] Era when people invented [[agriculture]], thereby passing from [[Barbarian|barbarity]] to a [[civilization]]. A large number of people acted as [[prosumers]] (eating their grown food, hunting animals, building their own houses, making clothes,....). People traded by exchanging their own goods for commodities of others. The second stage began in England with the Industrial Revolution during which people invented the [[machine tool]] and the [[steam engine]]. People worked in factories to make money they could spend on goods they needed (it means they produced for exchange, not for use). Countries also created new social systems. The third stage began in the second half of the 20th century in the West when people invented automatic production, robotics and the [[computer]]. The [[services sector]] attained great value. 

The Tofflers proposed one criterion for distinguishing between [[industrial society]] and [[post-industrial society]]: the share of the [[population]]  occupied in agriculture versus the share of city labor occupied in the services sector.  In a post-industrial society, the share of the people occupied in agriculture does not exceed 15%, and the share of city laborers occupied in the services sector exceeds 50%. Thus, the share of the people occupied with brainwork greatly exceeds the share of the people occupied with physical work in post-industrial society.

[[Third Wave Democracy|The third wave]] led to the [[Information Era]] (now). Homes are the dominant institutions. Most people carry on their own production and consumption in their homes or electronic cottages, they produce more of their own products and services and markets become less important for them. People consider each other to be equally free as vendors of prosumer-generated commodities.

==Fear of the future==
[[File:ChryslerBuildingMidtownManhattanNewYorkCity.jpg|thumb|[[Midtown Manhattan]] in New York City, the largest central business district in the United States]]
Alvin and Heidi Toffler's main thought consists of the fact that modern man feels shock from rapid changes. For example, Toffler's daughter went to shop in [[New York City]] and she couldn't find a shop in its previous location. Thus New York has become a city without a [[history]]. The urban population doubles every 11 years. The overall production of goods and services doubles each 50 years in developed countries. Society experiences an increasing number of changes with an increasing rapidity, while people are losing the familiarity that old institutions ([[religion]], [[family]], [[national identity]], [[profession]]) once provided. The so-called "[[brain drain]]" – the [[emigration]] of European scientists to the United States – is both an indicator of the changes in society and also one of their causes.

==Features of post-industrial society==
[[File:100 Yen lighter.JPG|thumb|A generic, disposable lighter.]]
*Many goods have become [[disposable]] as the cost of manual repair or cleaning has become greater than the cost of making new goods due to [[mass production]]. Examples of disposable goods include [[ballpoint pen]]s, [[lighter]]s, [[plastic bottle]]s, and [[paper towels]].
*The design of goods becomes outdated quickly. (And so, for example, a second generation of computers appears before the end of the [[service life|expected period of usability]] of the first generation). It is possible to rent almost everything (from a ladder to a wedding dress), thus eliminating the need for ownership.
*Whole branches of [[industry]] die off and new branches of industry arise. This affects unskilled workers who are compelled to change their residence to find new jobs. The constant change in the [[Market (economics)|market]] also poses a problem for advertisers who must deal with moving targets.
*People of post-industrial society change their profession and their workplace often. People have to change professions because professions quickly become outdated.  People of post-industrial society thus have many [[career]]s in a lifetime. The knowledge of an [[engineer]] becomes outdated in ten years. People look more and more for temporary jobs.
*To follow transient jobs, people have become [[nomad]]s. For example, immigrants from [[Algeria]], [[Turkey]] and other countries go to Europe to find work. Transient people are forced to change residence, phone number, [[school]], friends, car license, and contact with [[family]] often. As a result, relationships tend to be superficial with a large number of people, instead of being intimate or close relationships that are more stable. Evidence for this is tourist travel and holiday romances.
*The [[driver's license]], received at age 16, has become the [[teenager]]'s admission to the world of adults, because it symbolizes the ability to move independently.
*Death of Permanence. The post industrial society will be marked by a transient culture where everything ranging from goods to human relationships will be temporary.

==In popular culture==
[[Curtis Mayfield]]'s song "[[Future Shock (Curtis Mayfield song)|Future Shock]]" on the album "[[Back to the World (Curtis Mayfield album)|Back to the World]]" took its name from this book, and was in turn covered by [[Herbie Hancock]] as the title track for his 1983 recording ''[[Future Shock (Herbie Hancock album)|Future Shock]]''. That album was considered groundbreaking for fusing [[jazz]] and [[funk]] with [[electronic music]]. [[Stanley Clarke]] performed a song with the same title on his 1984 album [[Time Exposure (Stanley Clarke album)|Time Exposure]]. The rock band, BANG released "Future Shock" on their self titled Capitol Records release in 1972

In the 1974 movie ''[[The Parallax View]]'' the character Joe relates a story to Lee about a wife having an affair with her psychiatrist and then a bulldozer knocking down his house by calling it ''future shock''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.subzin.com/quotes/M6928efb3/The+Parallax+View/That%27s+future+shock%2C+Lee |title=Movie Quotes. The Parallax View |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=subzin.com |publisher= |access-date=August 30, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works taking their title from the book include: the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Future Stock]]"; [[Bailter Space|The Gordons]] 1981 EP on [[Flying Nun Records]]; a segment on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' starring [[Samantha Bee]]; Kevin Goldstein's recurring column on the ''[[Baseball Prospectus]]'' website; a ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' pre-constructed deck; and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]'s [[Starrcade (1989)|1989 Starrcade]] event.

Since 1977, UK Comic [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]] has run a series of short stories called [[Future Shocks]] based on this concept, some of which were written by [[Alan Moore]]. The abbreviated derogatory term ''Futsies'' was applied to citizens in 2000 AD stories (mainly in the [[Judge Dredd]] universe) who had been driven insane by Future Shock.

Works deriving themes and elements from Future Shock include the science fiction novels ''[[The Forever War]]'' (1974) by [[Joe Haldeman]], ''[[The Shockwave Rider]]'' (1975) by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], the [[role-playing game|RPG]] ''[[Transhuman Space]]'' (2002) by [[Steve Jackson Games]], and the [[indie RPG]] ''[[Shock: Social Science Fiction]]'' (2006) by designer [[Joshua A.C. Newman]]. [[Experimental music|Experimental]] music group [[Death Grips]] use the lyric "Culture shock, future shock, fuck yourself, choke yourself" in their song "[[Exmilitary|Culture Shock]]".

The line ''You knocked a '''future shock''' crowbar upside my head'' occurs in the track "The Outsiders" on the alternative rock band [[R.E.M.]]'s 2004 album ''[[Around the Sun]]''.

In 2011, a song titled "Future Shock" by Darwin, Obie, and Mr-E appeared on the album ''Nu Nrg 100'', the final installment of the world-renowned label Nu Energy, while Brooklyn-based band [[TV on the Radio]] included a song titled "No Future Shock" on their album ''[[Nine Types of Light]]''. The same year, the [[Unsound Festival|Unsound Music Festival]] in [[Krakow, Poland]] took the concept of 'future shock' as its theme.

[[William Brittelle]], the Brooklyn-based composer of pop-influenced electro-acoustic art music, has an album called "Future Shock".

The sense of future shock is an integral aspect of [[cyberpunk]].

Futureshock were also an electronic music duo recording for Junior Boys Own and Parlophone / EMI. The members were Phil Dockerty and Alex Tepper.

The Future Shock Book was lying on the deceased Wendell Armbruster Sr.'s desk in the 1972 movie [[Avanti!]] starring [[Jack Lemmon]].

Following the establishment of the Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace (hereinafter referred to as the Panel) and in response to the high interest generated, a [https://www.genevawaterhub.org/platforms/group-friends-water-peace Group of Friends on Water and Peace] was created in early 2016. It provides a group of countries with an opportunity to interact with the work of the Panel and offers them a platform for regular dialogue on these issues. The [[Geneva Water Hub]] acts as the Secretariat of both the Global High-Level Panel and the Group of Friends on Water and Peace.

The focus of the Panel is the nexus between [[water]] and [[cooperation]] and maintenance of peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/global-high-level-panel-on-water-and-peace-to-propose-solutions-to-conflicts/articleshow/49832510.cms|title='Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace' to propose solutions to conflicts|last=Narayanan|first=Dinesh|date=2015-11-18|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes preventive activities and arrangements, such as trans-border water cooperation regimes and institutions, protection of [[water infrastructure]] during [[armed conflicts]] and water arrangements in the context of post-conflict [[Peacebuilding|peace-building]].

The Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace will present a set of recommendations at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in September 2017.

== Objectives ==
The Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace aims at taking the issue of water in the context of maintenance of peace and security, from a technical to a political level. It has the following objectives:
* Develop a set of proposals aimed at strengthening the global architecture to prevent and resolve water-related conflicts;
* Facilitate the role of water as an important factor of building peace and cooperation; and
* Enhance the relevance of water issues in national and global policy making.

== Mandate ==
* Panel members are serving in their individual capacity;
* The Panel is independent and is tasked with outlining concrete proposals and recommendations to enable water to be an instrument of peace. These proposals / recommendations will be non-binding, and will address policy issues at all levels (global, regional, national and local). However, the Panel will not make any country specific recommendations;
* The Panel is established for a period of two years, until the end of 2017;
* The mandate of the Panel comes from the fifteen co-convening countries;
* While the Panel functions outside the formal structure of the [[United Nations]], it works in close cooperation with relevant stakeholders, notably with the UN which is represented in the Panel through [[UN-Water]] as observer. It is the only body serving in this capacity. The Panel holds consultations or hearings to get inputs from all relevant organizations and stakeholders;

[[Image:1901 Eastern Telegraph cables.png|300px|thumb|[[Eastern Telegraph]] cable network in 1901]]
A '''global network''' is any [[communication network]] which spans the entire [[Earth]]. The term, as used in this article refers in a more restricted way to ''bidirectional'' communication networks, and to technology-based networks. Early networks such as [[international mail]] and unidirectional communication networks, such as [[radio network|radio]] and [[television network|television]], are described elsewhere.

The first global network was established using [[electrical telegraph]]y and global span was achieved in 1899. The [[public switched telephone network|telephony network]] was the second to achieve global status, in the 1950s. More recently, interconnected [[IP network]]s (principally the [[Internet]], with estimated 2.5 billion users worldwide in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;http://export.gov/northcarolina/build/groups/public/@eg_us_nc/documents/webcontent/komarketingpresentation065541.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[GSM]] [[mobile communication]] network (with over 6 billion worldwide users in 2014) form the largest global networks of all.

Setting up global networks requires immensely costly and lengthy efforts lasting for decades. Elaborate interconnections, [[Telephone exchange|switching]] and [[routing]] devices, laying out physical carriers of information, such as land and [[submarine communications cable|submarine cables]] and [[earth station]]s must be set in operation. In addition, international [[communication protocol]]s, legislation and agreements are involved.

Global networks might also refer to networks of individuals (such as [[Scientific collaboration network|scientists]]), communities (such as [[city network|cities]]) and organizations (such as [[Civil society#Global|civil organizations]]) worldwide which, for instance, might have formed for the management, mitigation and resolval of [[global issue]]s.

==Satellite global networks==

[[Communication satellite]]s are an important part of global networks. However, there are specific [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) global [[satellite constellation]]s, such as [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]], [[Globalstar]] and [[Orbcomm]], which are comprised by dozens of similar satellites which are put in orbit at regularly spaced positions and form a [[mesh network]], sometimes sending and receiving information directly among themselves. Using [[VSAT]] technology, [[satellite internet access]] has become possible.

==Mobile wireless networks==

It is estimated that 80% of the global mobile market uses the GSM standard, present in more than 212 countries and territories. Its [[wikt:ubiquity|ubiquity]] makes international [[roaming]] very common between mobile phone operators, enabling subscribers to use their phones in many parts of the world. In order to achieve this, these networks must be interconnected by way of [[peering]] arrangements, and therefore the GSM network is a truly global one.

==Network interconnection==

The telegraph and [[telex]] communication networks have been phased out, so [[interconnection]] among existing global networks arise at several points, such as between the voice [[telephony]] and digital [[data network]]s, and between these and satellite networks. Many applications run now on several networks, such as [[VoIP]] (voice over IP). [[Mobile communication]] (voice and data) networks are also intimately intertwinned, because the majority of 21st century [[cell phone]]s have both voice and data (internet navigation and [[email]]ing) capabilities.

Digital global networks require huge carrying capacity in the main [[internet backbone|backbone]]s. This is currently achieved by [[fiber optic cable]]s.

==Social and economic impact==
The Canadian [[sociologist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] was the first to forecast the huge impact of the matrix of global networks upon [[society]], coining the term [[global village (term)|global village]]. His work, however, related to radio and television networks, which are [[broadcast]] (unidirectional) networks, thus predating the much larger impact of the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Harasim, L. (Ed.) - [https://books.google.com/books?id=9RAnJzaiqvMC Global Networks: Computers and International Networks, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

Global networks have revolutionized human communication several times. The first to do so was the electrical telegraph. Its impact was so large that it has been dubbed the [[Victorian Internet]]. It was expanded many times in its coverage with the advent of [[radiotelegraphy]], and with text messaging using [[telex]] machines.

The Internet and mobile communication networks have made possible entirely new forms of [[social interaction]], activities and organizing, thanks to its basic features such as widespread [[usability]] and access, and instant communication from any connected point to another. Thus, its [[Internet#Social impact|social impact]] has been, and still is, enormous. Finally, the impact on governance have been significant facilitating the emergence of 'transnational policy networks' &lt;ref&gt;Stone, Diane. Knowledge actors and transnational governance: The private-public policy nexus in the global agora. Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 winners==

Shree Bose, a 17-year-old girl in Texas, won the grand prize and $50,000 for her research on the chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, that is commonly taken by women with ovarian cancer, tackling the problem of cancer cells growing resistant to cisplatin over time.

Naomi Shah of Portland, OR, won the age 15–16 category with a study of the effects of air quality on lungs, particularly for people who have asthma. Ms. Shah recruited 103 test subjects, performed 24-hour air quality measurements at their homes and workplaces and had each blow into a device that measured the force of their breath.

Lauren Hodge of York, PA, won the age 13–14 category for research on whether marinades reduce the amount of cancer-causing compounds produced by the grilling of [[meat]]. She found that [[lemon juice]] and brown sugar cut the level of carcinogens sharply, while [[soy sauce]] increased them.

People around the world (90 countries) had the opportunity to vote for their favorite projects in Google’s online voting gallery. Google has had more than 100,000 votes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/votes-are-in-for-google-science-fair.html |title= The Votes Are in for the Google Science Fair Finalists and People’s Choice Award Winner}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the competition was really tight.

==2016==

The 2016 Google Science Fair closed its entries on May 17, 2016, the Global 16 Finalist were announced on August 11, 2016. The final event took place during 24 to 27 September 2016 at Mountain View, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Science Fair Awards Show 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZSmqjtgkmo|website=You Tube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen finalists competed for top five awards. The first two rounds had two age groups 13-15 and 16-18. However, unlike previous years, top awards during the finalist event did not distinguish between the two age groups of the previous rounds, thus making it particularly challenging event for the contestant compared to all previous years.

The Grand Prize was won by [[Kiara Nirghin]] (16) of South Africa for her project 'Fighting Drought with Fruit'.&lt;ref&gt;'{{cite web|title= Combatting drought with a Low-Cost, biodegradable Superabsorbent Polymer made out of Orange Peels|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/deb654bce83b15eed364f52fa8685634649014602eca78858c58fec00aa6041a|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lego Education Builder award was won by Anushka Naiknaware (13) of United States, the youngest contestant to win a top award ever, for 'Smart Wound Care for the Future'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fractal inspired Chitosan and Carbon Nanoparticle Based Biocompatible Sensor for Wound Management|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/562f25503d252660ac0e8309b7711f3fc2ef084c0fa3598a7a7cf9377fc8adaa|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Geographic Explorer award was won by Mphatso Simbao (18) of Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheap production of nitrogen pesticides and fertilizers through hydrolysis of plant protein for rural use|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/ae920a381dfc15613b9d8f530d904301ef5b23158fd60c5dc33af8d7a6d98d98|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scientific American Innovator Award was won by a team of three for 'Fighting Foam Waste with Recycled Filters' from the US [Ashton (14), Luke (14) and Julia (14)].

In [[Internet activism]], '''hacktivism''' or '''hactivism''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Hack (computer security)|hack]]'' and ''[[activism]]'') is the use of [[technology]] to promote a political agenda or a social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/5378/MIKHAYLOVA-THESIS-2014.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019175804/https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/5378/MIKHAYLOVA-THESIS-2014.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=2017-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With roots in [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker culture]] and [[hacker ethics]], its ends are often related to the [[free speech]], [[human rights]], or [[freedom of information]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hackers-take-down-thousands-dark-web-sites-post-private-data-n717556|title=Hackers take down thousands of 'dark web' sites, post private data|work=NBC News|access-date=2017-02-27|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227033824/http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hackers-take-down-thousands-dark-web-sites-post-private-data-n717556|archivedate=2017-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 1994 by a [[Cult of the Dead Cow]] (cDc) member known as "Omega" in an e-mail to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sfist.com/2016/07/15/black_lives_matter_protests_happeni.php|title=Black Lives Matter Protests Happening Today At SF's Civic Center And Downtown Oakland|access-date=2016-10-23|language=en-US|newspaper=SFist|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718014246/http://sfist.com/2016/07/15/black_lives_matter_protests_happeni.php|archivedate=2016-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cyber Disobedience: Re://Presenting Online Anarchy|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nRjtBAAAQBAJ|publisher = John Hunt Publishing|date = 2014-11-28|isbn = 9781782795551|first = Jeff|last = Shantz|first2 = Jordon|last2 = Tomblin|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151116134639/https://books.google.com/books?id=nRjtBAAAQBAJ|archivedate = 2015-11-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the variety of meanings of its root words, hacktivism is sometimes ambiguous and there exists significant disagreement over the kinds of activities and purposes it encompasses. Some definitions include acts of [[cyberterrorism]] while others simply reaffirm the use of technological hacking to effect social change.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ludlow [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/what-is-a-hacktivist/ "What is a 'Hacktivist'?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521020503/http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/what-is-a-hacktivist/ |date=2013-05-21 }} The New York Times.

==Overview==
Hacktivist activities span many political ideals and issues. [[Freenet]], a [[peer-to-peer]] platform for [[censorship]]-resistant communication, is a prime example of translating political thought ([[freedom of speech|anybody should be able to speak freely]]) into code. Hacking as a form of activism can be carried out through a network of activists, such as Anonymous and WikiLeaks, or through a singular activist, working in collaboration toward a common goals without an overarching authority figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milone |first=Mark |year=2002 |title=Hactivism: Securing the National Infrastructure |journal=The Business Lawyer |volume=58 |pages=383–413 |jstor=40688127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hacktivism" is a controversial term with several meanings. The word was coined to characterize electronic [[direct action]] as working toward [[social change]] by combining [[computer programming|programming]] skills with [[critical thinking]]. But just as ''hack'' can sometimes mean cyber crime, ''hacktivism'' can be used to mean activism that is malicious, destructive, and undermining the [[computer security|security]] of the [[Internet]] as a [[technology|technical]], [[economics|economic]], and [[political platform]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Krapp, [http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/noise-channels "Noise Channels: Glitch and Error in Digital Culture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523062615/http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/noise-channels |date=2013-05-23 }}. University of Minnesota Press 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Depending on who is using the term, hacktivism can be a politically motivated technology [[hack (computer security)|hack]], a constructive form of [[anarchism|anarchic]] [[civil disobedience]], or an undefined anti-systemic gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2010|title=Hactivism's New Face: Are Your Company's Enemies Embracing New Tactics?|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=bcab9318-79b2-42be-afc2-6e00f7cb80a9%40sessionmgr102&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=127|journal=Security Directors Report|volume=10|pages=2–4|via=EBSCO Host}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can signal [[anti-capitalism|anticapitalist]] or political protest; it can denote anti-[[spam (electronic)|spam]] activists, security experts, or [[open source]] advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ragan|first=Steve|year=2014|title=Hactivism Struggles With a Slippery Slope as Anonymous Targets Children's Hospital|url=|journal=CSO Magazine|volume=13|pages=|via=EBSCO Host}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people{{who|date=September 2014}} describing themselves as hacktivists have taken to [[defacement (vandalism)|defacing]] websites for political reasons, such as attacking and defacing government websites as well as web sites of groups who oppose their [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=Solomon2017&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2017.03.024 |title=Electronic protests: Hacktivism as a form of protest in Uganda |journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=718–28 |year=2017 |last1=Solomon |first1=Rukundo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Oxblood Ruffin]] (the "[[Foreign minister|foreign affairs minister]]" of Cult of the Dead Cow and Hacktivismo), have argued forcefully against definitions of hacktivism that include web defacements or [[denial-of-service attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/cDc-0384.php | first = Oxblood | last = Ruffin | title = Hacktivism, From Here to There | date = 3 June 2004 | accessdate = 2008-04-19 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080423030217/http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/cDc-0384.php | archivedate = 23 April 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hactivism is often seen as shadowy due to its anonymity, commonly attributed to the work of fringe groups and outlying members of society. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorell|first=Tom|date=2015-09-22|title=Human Rights and Hacktivism: The Cases of Wikileaks and Anonymous|url=https://academic.oup.com/jhrp/article/7/3/391/2412155|journal=Journal of Human Rights Practice|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=391–410|doi=10.1093/jhuman/huv012|issn=1757-9619}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of responsible parties to be held accountable for the social-media attacks performed by hactivists has created implications in corporate and federal security measures both on and offline.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2017/01/10/hacktivists-increasingly-target-local-and-state-government-computers|title=‘Hacktivists’ Increasingly Target Local and State Government Computers|website=www.pewtrusts.org|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some self-described hacktivists{{who|date=September 2014}} have engaged in DoS attacks, critics suggest{{who|date=September 2014}} that DoS attacks are an attack on free speech and that they have [[unintended consequences]]. DoS attacks waste resources and they can lead to a "DoS war" that nobody will win{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. In 2006, [[Blue Security]] attempted to automate a DoS attack against spammers; this led to a massive DoS  attack against Blue Security which knocked them, their old ISP and their DNS provider off the Internet, destroying their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11392 | title = Blue Security folds under spammer's wrath | first = Robert | last = Lemos | journal = SecurityFocus | date = 17 May 2006 | accessdate = 2008-04-19 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080511195952/http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11392 | archivedate = 11 May 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Denial-of-service attack|denial-of-service]] attacks by [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] on multiple sites, in reprisal for the apparent suppression of [[WikiLeaks]], [[John Perry Barlow]], a founding member of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]], said "I support freedom of expression, no matter whose, so I oppose DDoS attacks regardless of their target... they're the poison gas of cyberspace...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/09/us-wikileaks-cyberwarfare-amateur-idUSTRE6B81K520101209 | title = Analysis: WikiLeaks&amp;nbsp;— a new face of cyber-war? | accessdate = 2010-12-09 | author = Reuters | date = 2010-12-09 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120726044154/http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/09/us-wikileaks-cyberwarfare-amateur-idUSTRE6B81K520101209 | archivedate = 2012-07-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, [[Jay Leiderman]], an attorney for many hacktivists, argues that DDoS can be a legitimate form of protest speech in situations that are reasonably limited in time, place and manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/22/paypal-wikileaks-protesters-ddos-free-speech | work = The Guardian | title = Why DDoS is Free Speech | date = 22 January 2013 | location = London | first = Jay | last = Leiderman | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161115080459/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/22/paypal-wikileaks-protesters-ddos-free-speech | archivedate = 15 November 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms and methods==
Self-proclaimed "Hactivists" often work anonymously, sometimes operating in groups while other times operating as a lone-wolf with several cyber-personas all corresponding to one activist&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; within the [[cyberactivism]] umbrella that has been gaining public interest and power in pop-culture. Hactivists generally operate under apolitical ideals and express uninhibited ideas or abuse without being scrutinized by society while representing or defending them publicly under an anonymous identity giving them a sense of power in the [[cyberactivism]] community. 

In order to carry out their operations, hacktivists might create new tools; or integrate or use a variety of software tools readily available on the Internet. One class of hacktivist activities includes increasing the accessibility of others to take politically motivated action online.

# Code: Software and websites can achieve political purposes. For example, the encryption software [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] can be used to secure communications; PGP's author, [[Phil Zimmermann]] said he distributed it first to the peace movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/news/PGP_10thAnniversary.html |title=PGP Marks 10th Anniversary |publisher=Phil Zimmermann |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514200112/http://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/news/PGP_10thAnniversary.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Warren (computer specialist)|Jim Warren]] suggests PGP's wide dissemination was in response to Senate Bill 266, authored by Senators Biden and DeConcini, which demanded that "...communications systems permit the government to obtain the plain text contents of voice, data, and other communications...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.contra.org/pgp/PhilZimmerman.html | title = The Persecution of Phil Zimmermann, American | publisher = Jim Warren | date = 1996-01-08 | accessdate = 2011-02-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110513181323/http://www.contra.org/pgp/PhilZimmerman.html | archivedate = 2011-05-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WikiLeaks]] is an example of a politically motivated website: it seeks to "keep governments open".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/ |title=WikiLeaks homepage |publisher=WikiLeaks |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131235529/http://wikileaks.ch/ |archivedate=2011-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Website Mirroring: is used as a circumvention tool to bypass censorship blocks on websites. It is a technique that copies the content of a censored website and posts it to other domains and subdomains that are not censored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/mirroring-a-censored-wordpress-blog/ | title = Mirroring a Censored Wordpress Blog | first = Sami | last = Ben Gharbia | publisher = Global Voices Advocacy | accessdate = 2011-02-09 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110201130429/http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/mirroring-a-censored-wordpress-blog/ | archivedate = 2011-02-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Anonymous blogging: a method of speaking out to a wide audience about human rights issues, government oppression, etc. that utilizes various web tools such as [[Mailinator|free and/or disposable email accounts]], IP masking, and blogging software to preserve a high level of anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/guide/ | title = Anonymous Blogging with Wordpress and Tor | first = Ethan | last = Zuckerman | publisher = Global Voices Advocacy | accessdate = 2011-02-09 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110209104115/http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/guide/ | archivedate = 2011-02-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[RECAP]] is software that was written to 'liberate US case law' and make it freely available online.

# Leaking:[[Information leakage]] from an insider source who acts in the interest of the public to reveal sensitive and otherwise protected information about a given organization that implicates them in wrongdoing or malicious practices. 
# Doxing&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;: The practice in which private and/or confidential documents and records are hacked into and made public. Hactivists view this as a form of assured transparency, experts claim it is harassment. 
# [[Denial-of-service attack|Denial-of-Service]] attacks: These attacks, commonly referred to as [[Denial-of-service attack|DoS attacks]], use large arrays of personal and public computers that hackers take control of via [[malware]] executable files usually transmitted through email attachments or website links. After taking control, these computers act like a herd of zombies, redirecting their [[network traffic]] to one website, with the intention of overloading [[Server (computing)|servers]] and taking a website offline.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#[[Website defacement|Website defacements]]: Hacker(s) infiltrate a web server to replace a specific web page with one of their own, usually to convey a specific message.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitri|first=Nofia|date=April 2011|title=Democracy Discourses through the Internet Communication: Understanding the Hacktivism for the Global Changing|url=https://arastirmax.com/en/bilimsel-yayin/online-journal-communication-and-media-technologies/1/2/1-20_democracy-discourses-through-internet-communication|journal=Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies|volume=1|pages=11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[URL redirection|Website redirects]]: Similar to website mirroring, this method involves changing the address of a website within the server so would-be visitors of the site are redirected to a site created by the perpetrator, typically to denounce the original site.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
#[[Virtual sit-in|Virtual sit-ins]]: Large amounts of protesters visit a targeted website and rapidly load pages to overwhelm the site with [[network traffic]] to slow the site or take it offline.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Notable hacktivist events==
{{see also|Timeline of events associated with Anonymous}}
{{Example farm|date=June 2011}}

==Notable hacktivist groups==

===Anonymous===
{{Main article|Anonymous (group)}}
Perhaps the most prolific and well known hacktivist group, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] has been prominent and prevalent in many major online hacks over the past decade. Anonymous originated on the forums of [[4chan]] during 2003, but didn't rise to prominence until 2008 when they directly attacked the [[Church of Scientology]] in a massive [[Denial-of-service attack|DoS]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Feature by Chris Landers: Serious Business {{!}} 4/2/2008 |url=http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543 |date=2008-06-08 |accessdate=2015-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608050312/http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543 |archivedate=June 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Anonymous has participated in a great number of online projects such as [[Operation Payback|Operation: Payback]] and Operation: Safe Winter.&lt;ref name="dailydot.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = #OpSafeWinter: Anonymous fights homelessness worldwide|url = http://www.dailydot.com/news/op-safe-winter-anonymous/|website = The Daily Dot|accessdate = 2015-12-02|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151121054415/http://www.dailydot.com/news/op-safe-winter-anonymous/|archivedate = 2015-11-21|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 4chan Users Organize Surgical Strike Against MPAA - MediaCenter Panda Security|url = http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/news/4chan-users-organize-ddos-against-mpaa/|website = MediaCenter Panda Security|accessdate = 2015-12-02|language = en-US|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102111822/http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/news/4chan-users-organize-ddos-against-mpaa/|archivedate = 2016-01-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while a great number of their projects have been for a charitable cause,&lt;ref name="dailydot.com"/&gt; they have still gained notoriety from the media due to the nature of their work mostly consisting of illegal hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hacker group Anonymous is a nuisance, not a threat|url = http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/20/technology/anonymous_hack/index.htm|website = CNNMoney|accessdate = 2015-12-02|first = David|last = Goldman|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6GNX7MnbG?url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/20/technology/anonymous_hack/index.htm|archivedate = 2013-05-05|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|Paris terror attacks]] in 2015, Anonymous posted a video declaring war on [[ISIS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/paris-attacks-anonymous-launches-its-biggest-operation-ever-against-isis-promises-to-hunt-down-a6735811.html|title=Anonymous has declared war on Isis after the Paris attacks|date=2015-11-16|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201052117/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/paris-attacks-anonymous-launches-its-biggest-operation-ever-against-isis-promises-to-hunt-down-a6735811.html|archivedate=2016-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the terror group that claimed responsibility for the attacks. Since declaring war on ISIS, Anonymous since identified several Twitter accounts associated with the movement in order to stop the distribution of ISIS propaganda. However, Anonymous fell under heavy criticism when Twitter issued a statement calling the lists Anonymous had compiled "wildly inaccurate," as it contained accounts of journalists and academics rather than members of ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/anonymous-hacking-isis-warns-collaborating-us-government-deeply-stupid-2226066|title=Anonymous Hacks ISIS, But Warns Against Collaborating With US|date=2015-12-15|newspaper=International Business Times|access-date=2016-10-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119182320/http://www.ibtimes.com/anonymous-hacking-isis-warns-collaborating-us-government-deeply-stupid-2226066|archivedate=2016-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anonymous has also been involved with the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement. Early in July 2015, there was a rumor circulating that Anonymous was calling for a Day of Rage  protests in retaliation for the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, which would entail violent protests and riots. This rumor was based off a video that was not posted with the official Anonymous YouTube account. None of the Twitter accounts associated with Anonymous had tweeted anything in relation to a Day of Rage, and the rumors were identical to past rumors that had circulated in 2014 following the death of Mike Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/2016/07/11/anonymous-day-of-rage-protests-2016/|title=Anonymous 'Day of Rage' Protests|last=LaCapria|first=Kim|website=snopes|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, on July 15, a Twitter account associated with Anonymous posted a series of tweets calling for a day of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The Twitter account used the hashtag "#FridayofSolidarity" to coordinate protests across the nation, and emphasized the fact that the Friday of Solidarity was intended for peaceful protests. The account also stated that the group was unaware of any Day of Rage plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sfist.com/2016/07/15/black_lives_matter_protests_happeni.php|title=Black Lives Matter Protests Happening Today At SF's Civic Center And Downtown Oakland|newspaper=SFist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718014246/http://sfist.com/2016/07/15/black_lives_matter_protests_happeni.php|archivedate=2016-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WikiLeaks===
[[File:CollateralMurder.ogv|thumb|The video released by WikiLeaks, showing the slaying of [[Reuters]] employee [[Namir Noor-Eldeen]] and a dozen other civilians by a U.S. helicopter.]]

Originally, WikiLeaks was operated with the principles of a [[wiki]] site, meaning that users could post documents, edit others' documents, and help decide which materials were posted.

The first notable release of documents by WikiLeaks was the release of [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghanistan War logs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/421949/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wikileaks/|title=Everything You Need to Know About Wikileaks|last=Zittrain|first=Jonathan|newspaper=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, WikiLeaks published over 90,000 documents regarding the war in Afghanistan. Prior to the leak, WikiLeaks gave access to the documents to three newspapers. Though WikiLeaks did not identify a source for the documents, it was speculated that the leak came from [[Chelsea Manning]], a U.S. Army intelligence analyst arrested in May 2010 and accused of leaking classified information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-10774473|title=Welcome to a new age of whistle-blowing|last=Lang|first=Olivia|date=2010-07-27|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119121920/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-10774473|archivedate=2016-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war logs revealed 144 incidents of formerly unreported civilian casualties by the U.S. military. The leak of the Afghanistan war logs was the greatest military leak in United States history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/afghanistan-war-logs-military-leaks|title=Afghanistan war logs: Massive leak of secret files exposes truth of occupation|last=Davies|first=Nick|date=2010-07-25|last2=Leigh|first2=David|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019234655/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/afghanistan-war-logs-military-leaks|archivedate=2016-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiLeaks is also notable for its leak of over 20,000 confidential emails and 8,000 file attachments from the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC), on July 22, 2016. The emails are specifically from the inboxes of seven prominent staffers of the DNC, and they were leaked as a searchable database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/07/22/wikileaks-posts-nearly-20000-hacked-dnc-emails-online/|title=Wikileaks posts nearly 20,000 hacked DNC emails online|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-10-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031075442/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/07/22/wikileaks-posts-nearly-20000-hacked-dnc-emails-online/|archivedate=2016-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emails leaked showed instances of key DNC staffers working to undermine [[Bernie Sanders|Senator Bernie Sanders]]' presidential campaign prior to primary elections, which was directly against the DNC's stated neutrality in primary elections. Examples of targeting Senator Bernie Sanders included targeting his religion, hoping for his dropping out of the race, constructing negative narratives about his campaign and more. Other emails revealed criticism of [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] for not helping more in fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/24/here-are-the-latest-most-damaging-things-in-the-dncs-leaked-emails/|title=Here are the latest, most damaging things in the DNC’s leaked emails|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-10-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022085509/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/24/here-are-the-latest-most-damaging-things-in-the-dncs-leaked-emails/|archivedate=2016-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the leak, DNC chairwoman [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] announced she would be stepping down from her position in the DNC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/07/24/487242426/bernie-sanders-dnc-emails-outrageous-but-not-a-shock|title=Debbie Wasserman Schultz To Step Down As Democratic Chair After Convention|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-11-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115033225/http://www.npr.org/2016/07/24/487242426/bernie-sanders-dnc-emails-outrageous-but-not-a-shock|archivedate=2016-11-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, 2016, the [[Democratic National Convention]] opened without Wasserman Schultz.

===LulzSec===

In May 2011, five members of Anonymous formed the hacktivist group [[LulzSec|Lulz Security]], otherwise known as LulzSec. LulzSec's name originated from the conjunction of the internet slang term "lulz", meaning laughs, and "sec", meaning security.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/16/lulzsec-hacking-fbi-jail|title=LulzSec: what they did, who they were and how they were caught|last=Arthur|first=Charles|date=2013-05-16|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014142622/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/16/lulzsec-hacking-fbi-jail|archivedate=2016-10-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group members used specific handles to identify themselves on Internet Relay Channels, the most notable being:  "Sabu," "Kayla," "T-Flow," "Topiary," "AVUnit," and "Pwnsauce." Though the members of LulzSec would spend up to 20 hours a day in communication, they did not know one another personally, nor did they share personal information. For example, once the members' identities were revealed, "T-Flow" was revealed to be 15 years old. Other members, on the basis of his advanced coding ability, thought he was around 30 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/lulzsec-reunited-anonymous-hackers-meet-first-time-real-life-1467870|title=LulzSec Reunited: Anonymous Hackers Meet for the First Time in Real Life|last=Gilbert|first=David|date=2014-09-30|newspaper=International Business Times UK|access-date=2016-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924184722/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/lulzsec-reunited-anonymous-hackers-meet-first-time-real-life-1467870|archivedate=2016-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first notable targets that LulzSec pursued was [[HBGary]], which was performed in response to a claim made by the technology security company that it had identified members of Anonymous. Following this, the members of LulzSec targeted an array of companies and entities, including but not limited to: [[Fox Television Network|Fox Television]], [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]], [[PBS]], [[Sony]], [[Nintendo]], and the [[Senate.gov]] website. The targeting of these entities typically involved gaining access to and downloading confidential user information, or defacing the website at hand.&lt;ref&gt;United States of America v. Hector Monsegur. Southern District Court of New York. 23 May 2014. ''Cryptome.org''. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the attacks carried out by LulzSec were not as strongly political as those typical of WikiLeaks or Anonymous, they shared similar sentiments for the freedom of information. One of their distinctly politically-driven attacks involved targeting the Arizona State Police in response to new immigration laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-22526021|title=Former Lulzsec hacker Jake Davis on his motivations|last=Watts|first=Susan|date=2013-05-16|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119182301/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-22526021|archivedate=2016-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's first attack that garnered significant government attention was in 2011, when they collectively took down a website of the FBI. Following the incident, the leader of LulzSec, "Sabu," was identified as [[Hector Monsegur|Hector Xavier Monsegur]] by the FBI, and he was the first of the group to be arrested. Immediately following his arrest, Monsegur admitted to criminal activity. He then began his cooperation with the US government, helping FBI authorities to arrest 8 of his co-conspirators, prevent 300 potential cyber attacks, and helped to identify vulnerabilities in existing computer systems. In August 2011, Monsegur pleaded guilty to "computer hacking conspiracy, computer hacking, computer hacking in furtherance of fraud, conspiracy to commit access device fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and aggravated identity theft pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government." He served a total of one year and seven months and was charged a $1,200 fine.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/leading-member-of-the-international-cyber-criminal-group-lulzsec-sentenced-in-manhattan-federal-court|title=Leading Member of the International Cyber Criminal Group LulzSec Sentenced in Manhattan Federal Court|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2016-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119182337/https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/leading-member-of-the-international-cyber-criminal-group-lulzsec-sentenced-in-manhattan-federal-court|archivedate=2016-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture jamming ===
''[[Culture jamming]]'' is the practice of subverting and criticizing political messages as well as media culture with the aim of challenging the status quo. It is often targeted toward subliminal thought processes taking place in the viewers with the goal of raising awareness as well as causing a paradigm shift. Culture jamming takes many forms including [[billboard hacking]], [[broadcast signal intrusion]], ad-hoc art performances, [[Meme|memes]], and [[artivism]]. 

The term "culture jamming" was first coined in 1984 by American musician [[Don Joyce (musician)|Donald Joyce]] of the band [[Negativland]]. However, some speculation remains as to when the practice of culture jamming first began. Social researcher [[Vince Carducci]] believes culture jamming can be traced back to the 1950s with European social activist group [[Situationist International]]. Author and cultural critic [[Mark Dery]] believes medieval carnival is the earliest form of culture jamming as a way to subvert the social hierarchy at the time.

Culture jamming is sometimes confused with acts of vandalism. However, unlike culture jamming, the main goal of vandalism is to cause destruction with any political themes being of lesser importance. Artivism usually has the most questionable nature as a form of culture jamming because defacement of property is usually involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Culture jamming|date=2018-10-31|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_jamming&amp;oldid=866653735|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media hacking===
''Media hacking'' refers to the usage of various [[electronic media]] in an innovative or otherwise abnormal fashion for the purpose of conveying a message to as large a number of people as possible, primarily achieved via the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.seanbohan.com/?p=6 | title = Media Hacking | publisher = SeanBohan.com | author = Bohan, S. | accessdate = February 9, 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929114342/http://www.seanbohan.com/?p=6 | archivedate = September 29, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.meskelsquare.com/archives/2005/11/hacking_baby_cheetahs_and_hung.html | title = Hacking Baby Cheetahs and Hunger Strikes | publisher = Meskel Square | author = Heavens, A. | accessdate = February 9, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061108145039/http://www.meskelsquare.com/archives/2005/11/hacking_baby_cheetahs_and_hung.html | archivedate = November 8, 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular and effective means of media hacking is posting on a [[blog]], as one is usually controlled by one or more independent individuals, uninfluenced by outside parties. The concept of [[social bookmarking]], as well as Web-based [[Internet forum]]s, may cause such a message to be seen by users of other sites as well, increasing its total reach.

Media hacking is commonly employed for political purposes, by both political parties and [[dissident|political dissidents]]. A good example of this is the 2008 US Election, in which both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties used a wide variety of different media in order to convey relevant messages to an increasingly Internet-oriented audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peter Kafka |url=http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/6/presidential_debates_come_to_twitter_how_to_follow_along |title=Obama, McCain Debate Via Twitter: How To Follow Along* |publisher=Alleyinsider.com |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2011-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207082105/http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/6/presidential_debates_come_to_twitter_how_to_follow_along |archivedate=2009-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, political dissidents used [[blog]]s and other social media like [[Twitter]] in order to reply on an individual basis to the presidential candidates. In particular, sites like Twitter are proving important means in gauging popular support for the candidates, though the site is often used for dissident purposes rather than a show of positive support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goodgearguide.com.au/index.php/id;1823349553 |title=Twitter backlash over McCain campaign 'suspension' |publisher=Good Gear Guide |date=2008-09-25 |accessdate=2011-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201043312/http://goodgearguide.com.au/index.php/id |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile technology has also become subject to media hacking for political purposes. [[Short message service|SMS]] has been widely used by political dissidents as a means of quickly and effectively organising [[smart mobs]] for political action. This has been most effective in the Philippines, where SMS media hacking has twice had a significant impact on whether or not the country's Presidents are elected or removed from office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=August 22nd, 2006 by Howard Rheingold |url=http://www.smartmobs.com/2006/08/22/wikipedia-on-sms-political-impacts/ |title=Blog Archive » Wikipedia on SMS, political impacts |publisher=Smart Mobs |date=2006-08-22 |accessdate=2011-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613113554/http://www.smartmobs.com/2006/08/22/wikipedia-on-sms-political-impacts/ |archivedate=2011-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reality hacking===
''Reality hacking'' is any phenomenon that emerges from the nonviolent use of illegal or legally ambiguous [[Digital data|digital]] tools in pursuit of politically, socially, or [[culture jamming|culturally subversive]] ends. These tools include [[website defacement]]s, [[URL redirection]]s, [[denial-of-service attack]]s, information theft, web-site parodies, [[virtual sit-in]]s, and virtual [[sabotage]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Art movements such as [[Fluxus]] and [[Happening]]s in the 1970s created a climate of receptibility in regard to loose-knit organizations and group activities where spontaneity, a [[modern primitive|return to primitivist behavior]], and an ethics where activities and [[artivism|socially engaged art]] practices became tantamount to [[aesthetic]] concerns.{{Clarify | date = January 2010}}

The conflation of these two histories in the mid-to-late 1990s {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} resulted in cross-overs between virtual sit-ins, [[electronic civil disobedience]], denial-of-service attacks, as well as mass protests in relation to groups like the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]]. The rise of collectivies, [[net.art]] groups, and those concerned with the fluid interchange of technology and [[real life (reality)|real life]] (often from an environmental concern) gave birth to the practice of "reality hacking".

Reality hacking relies on [[tweaking]] the everyday communications most easily available to individuals with the purpose of awakening the political and [[social connectedness|community conscience]] of the larger population. The term first came into use among New York and San Francisco artists, but has since been adopted by a [[school of thought|school]] of political activists centered around [[culture jamming]].

====In fiction====
The 1999 science fiction-action film ''[[The Matrix]]'', among others, popularized the [[simulation hypothesis]] — the suggestion that [[reality]] is in fact a [[simulation]] of which those affected by the simulants are generally unaware. In this context, "reality hacking" is reading and understanding the code which represents the activity of the simulated reality environment (such as [[Matrix digital rain]]) and also modifying it in order to bend the [[laws of physics]] or otherwise modify the [[simulated reality]].

Reality hacking as a mystical practice is explored in the [[Goth subculture|Gothic-Punk]] aesthetics-inspired [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf]] [[urban fantasy]] role-playing game ''[[Mage: The Ascension]]''. In this game, the Reality Coders (also known as Reality Hackers or Reality Crackers) are a faction within the [[Virtual Adepts]], a secret society of mages whose [[Magic (fantasy)|magick]] revolves around [[Digital data|digital]] technology. They are dedicated to bringing the benefits of [[cyberspace]] to [[Real life|real space]]. To do this, they had to identify, for lack of a better term, the "[[source code]]" that allows our [[Universe]] to function. And that is what they have been doing ever since. Coders infiltrated a number of levels of society in order to gather the greatest compilation of knowledge ever seen. One of the Coders' more overt agendas is to acclimate the masses to the world that is to come. They spread Virtual Adept ideas through [[video game]]s and a whole spate of "[[reality show]]s" that mimic [[virtual reality]] far more than "real" reality. The Reality Coders consider themselves the future of the Virtual Adepts, creating a world in the image of visionaries like [[Grant Morrison]] or [[Terence McKenna]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In a [[location-based game]] (also known as a pervasive game), reality hacking refers to tapping into phenomena that exist in the real world, and tying them into the game story universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1145/1501750.1501803 |chapter=The art of game-mastering pervasive games |title=Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference in Advances on Computer Entertainment Technology - ACE '08 |pages=224–31 |year=2008 |last1=Jonsson |first1=Staffan |last2=Waern |first2=Annika |isbn=978-1-60558-393-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic interpretations ===
There have been various academic approaches to deal with hacktivism and urban hacking. In 2010, Günther Friesinger, [[Johannes Grenzfurthner]] and Thomas Ballhausen published an entire reader dedicated to the subject. They state: "Urban spaces became battlefields, signifiers have been invaded, new structures have been established: Netculture replaced counterculture in most parts and also focused on the everchanging environments of the modern city. Important questions have been brought up to date and reasked, taking current positions and discourses into account. The major question still remains, namely how to create culturally based resistance under the influence of capitalistic pressure and conservative politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Hacking: Cultural Jamming Strategies in the Risky Spaces of Modernity|url=https://www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-1536-4/urban-hacking/|publisher=Transcript|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research''' ('''HIIK''') is an independent and interdisciplinary registered association located at the Department of Political Science at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Since 1991, the HIIK has been committed to the distribution of knowledge about the emergence, course and settlement of interstate and intrastate political conflicts. The Conflict Barometer is published annually and contains the current research results.

== Conflict Barometer ==
The HIIK's annual publication '''Conflict Barometer''' describes the recent trends in global conflict developments, escalations, de-escalations, and settlements. [[Coup d'état]], attempted coups d'états, as well as implemented measures of conflict resolution are also reported. It is subdivided into five world regions and presents all present conflicts in detailed charts and short descriptions. The methodological approach consists of the conflict definition and the measuring of the conflict intensity.

== Methodology after 2011 ==
Following a methodological revision in 2011, changes in the Heidelberg methodology included allocating intensities not only based on state units and calendar years, but also on the level of subnational units and calendar months. Furthermore, the establishment of intensities now follows an analysis of clearly conceived proxy indicators, used for the assessment of means and consequences of a conflict measure. This analysis continues to be based on the actions of conflict actors, as well as the communication between them. Through the conceptual refinement and standardization of data collection and documentation, the HIIK data achieves a higher degree of precision, reliability, and comprehensibility regarding information on political conflicts.

== Conflict definition ==
A political conflict is a positional difference between at least two assertive and directly involved actors regarding values relevant to a society (the conflict items including (territory, [[secession]], [[decolonization]], [[autonomy]], [[Ideology|system/ideology]], [[national power]], [[regional predominance]], [[international power]], [[Resource (economics)|resources]], other)) which is carried out using observable and interrelated conflict measures that lie outside established regulatory procedures and threaten core state functions, the international order, or hold the prospect of doing so.
	According to the Heidelberg (1998) methodology and ideology, the essence of a political conflict lies in a contradiction, adequately represented by the concept of a “positional difference”: a positional difference is a perceived incompatibility of ideas and beliefs. It presupposes the presence of the following elements:
(1) There must be at least two entities possessing intellectual capacity and vision, and who are capable of communicating. Such an entity is called an actor.
(2) In order for the actors to sense incompatibility between their ideas and beliefs, there must be reciprocal actions and acts of communication between said actors. These actions and acts of communication are called measures.
(3) A communicating act always refers to a specific issue, an action always refers to a certain object. The subject behind a measure is called item.
For the purpose of defining the term political conflict more precisely, the three elements aforementioned shall be further defined. These elements are necessary requirements for the existence of a political conflict.

| Non-violent Crisis
| A political conflict is classified as a non-violent crisis if physical violence is being implicitly or explicitly threatened to persons or property by at least one of the actors, or if one actor uses physical violence against property, without regarding the injury of people as acceptable. A threat of force is understood as a verbally or non-verbally communicated prospect of violent measures that is based on the conflict item. An acceptance of the injury of persons is present when the use of force against property includes the possibility of the injury of people but the violator is indifferent to this possibility.

'''Helsinki Challenge''' is a science-based competition and idea accelerator which brings together the academic community and society at large to solve the world’s grand challenges in cooperation. The competition goal is not only to create new scientific information, but to influence society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/blog/prepare-for-the-unexpected |title=Prepare for the unexpected - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2015-02-11 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/qa |title=Questions &amp; Answers - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multidisciplinary teams consisting of experts from the academic and artistic communities, the business world, the public and third sectors, media and other actors of the society are welcome to take part in the competition. Participating teams are evaluated by the jury using the following criteria: originality, creativity, impact, focus on solutions and use of science-based methods. The competition prize is 375,000 euros and it is meant for the implementation of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/how-to-participate |title=How to participate? - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626135757/http://challenge.helsinki.fi/how-to-participate |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/qa |title=Questions &amp; Answers - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helsinki Challenge was held for the first time in 2015.

==Helsinki Challenge 2014–2015==

The first ever Helsinki Challenge was organised by the University of Helsinki and celebrated the University’s 375th anniversary in 2015. The first Helsinki Challenge competition themes were: environmental change, health and wellbeing, future learning, global Helsinki and new world view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/about |title=About - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626134954/http://challenge.helsinki.fi/about |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semifinal 2014–2015===
Out of 80 proposals, a list of 20 semifinalists were announced in December 2014. Teams’ competition ideas ranged from developing tools to analyze [[big data]] on the Finnish discussion forum [[Suomi24]] to studying our expectations of robot morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1417410726435 |title=Tiederyhmä selvittää syyllisyyttä robottien tekemissä virheissä - Tiede - Kotimaa - Helsingin Sanomat |publisher=Hs.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mika Pantzar |url=http://wau.fi/artikkelit/big-dataa-riittaa-mutta-riittaako-suomessa-kykya-hyodyntaa-sita |title=Big dataa riittää, mutta riittääkö Suomessa kykyä hyödyntää sitä? |publisher=Wau.fi |date=2015-05-29 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final 2014–2015===

In October 2015, the five finalist teams were chosen:  Moralities of Intelligent Machines, Biodiversity Now, Helsinki Sleep Factory, SafePreg – Health into Next Generation and NEMO - Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction.  The jury for the final included Chancellor Thomas Wilhelmsson (chair), Pro-Vice Chancellor of Education [[Sally Mapstone]] from the [[University of Oxford]], Professor of Practice Pasi Sahlberg from [[Harvard University]]’s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]], Director Ulrich Weinberg from the [[Hasso Plattner Institute]] School of Design Thinking and President Mikko Kosonen of the Finnish Innovation Fund [[SITRA]].

====Winner teams====

The €375,000 prize for the science-based idea competition Helsinki Challenge was divided between two teams. The winner was NEMO – Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction, which received €250,000, while the runner-up, Biodiversity Now, received €125,000.The prize money is intended for realising the team’s idea.

NEMO is developing new ways to digitise and transmit emotion online.The team is planning small add-ons for digital interaction platforms that would consider emotions.This way participants in online discussions could see or even experience the emotions of others in a new way that would be equivalent to natural interaction.The team wants to create an open protocol for emotion transmission for any coder to use for building new empathy-enabling applications.

Biodiversity Now team wants to establish a Finnish habitat bank so that, for example, companies reducing biodiversity through a construction project could offset this by increasing biodiversity elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sttinfo.fi/tiedote/the-internet-of-empathy-receives-the-helsinki-challenge-prize-of-250000?publisherId=1807796&amp;releaseId=36507619&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helsinki Challenge 2016–2017==

The second Helsinki Challenge was kicked off in August 2016. The winner will be announced in conjunction with the centennial of [[Finland]]'s independence in 2017. The new Helsinki Challenge themes: Sustainable Plant, Urban Future and People in Change are linked to the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. The intention is to create solutions for future wellbeing through cooperation with a range of different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://challenge.helsinki.fi/articles/helsinki-challenge-to-return-bigger-and-better&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the namesake and contemporaneous Scottish physician and social reformer, see [[John Roberton (1776)|John Roberton]].''
'''John Roberton''' (20 March 1797 – 24 August 1876) was a Scottish physician and [[social reform]]er. He was a pioneer of modern [[obstetrics]] and of [[evidence-based medicine]], and influential in the intellectual life of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Manchester]].

==Life==
Roberton was born near [[Hamilton, Lanarkshire]] and educated for the medical profession at [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]. He was admitted a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] in 1817. He intended to be a ship's surgeon, and was on his way to the [[West Indies]] when he was wrecked on the Lancashire coast. While at [[Liverpool]] he was encouraged to take up his residence at [[Warrington]]. He became a [[Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries]] in 1822, and on 9 October 1823 married Mary (1794/5–1851), daughter of [[David Bellhouse]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Mottram (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The couple subsequently moved to Manchester. He soon had an extensive [[general practice]], and, on his appointment in 1827 to the post of surgeon to the [[Manchester Lying-in Hospital]], turned his special attention to [[midwifery]] and to the [[physiology]] and diseases of women and children. He was also a lecturer at the Marsden Street School of Medicine. His first publication was ''Observations on the Mortality and Physical Management of Children'' (1827). From 1830 onwards he wrote a series of [[scientific paper]]s for the ''Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal'' on the time of onset of female [[puberty]] in various countries, which led [[James Cowles Prichard]] to alter some of the conclusions which he had arrived at in the earlier editions of his ''Physical History of Mankind''. These, along with other similar papers, are reprinted in Roberton's most important work, ''Essays and Notes on the Physiology and Diseases of Women and on Practical Midwifery'' (London, 1851). He devoted much time to the subject of hospital construction and the provision of convalescent homes, on which he wrote a number of pamphlets between 1831 and 1861.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;Sutton (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberton's advice was largely sought in the discipline in which he had specialised, [[obstetrics]], and he was aware of the broader social and medical context of his work. He helped much to extend the fame of the Manchester school of obstetrics founded by [[Charles White (physician)|Charles White]] and continued by [[John Hull (physician)|John Hull]] and [[Thomas Radford]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

He was an active social reformer, interesting himself in all local and national movements for improving the condition of working people and active in the [[Manchester Statistical Society]]. In religion he was a [[puritan]] and [[nonconformist]], and the intimate friend of the popular preachers [[Robert Stephen McAll]] and [[Robert Halley]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

He died at his residence at [[New Mills]], Derbyshire, where he had retired on relinquishing his practice. His wealth at death was under £40,000 (under £2.9 million at 2003 prices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Consumer Price Inflation since 1750 | author=O'Donoghue, J.| journal=Economic Trends | volume=604 | year=2004 | pages=38–46, March | url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/article.asp?ID=726 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Legal Tech companies are generally [[startup companies|startups]] founded with the purpose of [[disruptive innovation|disrupting]] the traditionally conservative legal market.&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Bob|title=Four Areas of Legal Ripe for Disruption by Smart Startups|url=http://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2014/12/smart-startups/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Law Technology Today|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[TechCrunch]], as of December 2014, "legal technology is booming, with companies attempting to disrupt the legal space at every level and from every angle"&lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Basha|title=Legal Tech Startups Have A Short History And A Bright Future|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/06/legal-tech-startups-have-a-short-history-and-a-bright-future/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=TechCrunch|date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Forbes]] noted in February 2015 that there were “hundreds of legal startups popping up all over the US and Europe”.&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Juetten|first1=Mary|title=The Future Of Legal Tech: It's Not As Scary As Lawyers Think|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryjuetten/2015/02/19/legal-tech-or-tech-legal/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Legal technology traditionally referred to the application of technology and software to help law firms with [[legal matter management|practice management]], [[document management system|document storage]], [[invoicing|billing]], [[accounting]] and [[electronic discovery]].&lt;ref name="lawinsider"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hibnick|first1=Eva|title=What is Legal Tech?|url=http://www.thelawinsider.com/insider-news/what-is-legal-tech|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=The Law Insider|date=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, Legal Tech has evolved to be associated more with technology startups disrupting the [[practice of law]] by giving people access to online software that reduces or in some cases eliminates the need to consult a lawyer, or by connecting people with lawyers more efficiently through online marketplaces and lawyer-matching websites.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"/&gt;

==Industry context==
The legal industry is widely seen to be conservative and traditional, with Law Technology Today noting that "in 50 years, the customer experience at most law firms has barely changed".&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;  Reasons for this include the fact law firms face weaker cost-cutting incentives than other professions (since they pass disbursements directly to their client) and are seen to be risk averse (as a minor technological error could have significant financial consequences for a client).&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;

However, the growth of the hiring by businesses of in-house counsel and their increasing sophistication, together with the development of email, has led to clients placing increasing cost and time pressure on their lawyers.&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;  In addition, there are increasing incentives for lawyers to become technologically competent, with the [[American Bar Association]] voting in August 2012 to amend the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] to require lawyers to keep abreast of "the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Client-Lawyer Relationship, Rule 1.1 Competence - Comment|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_1_competence/comment_on_rule_1_1.html|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambrogi|first1=Robert|title=The Cloud Has Landed: 10 Legal Tech Innovations and What They Mean|url=http://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=88&amp;Issue=4&amp;ArticleID=23997|website=Wisconsin Lawyer|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the saturation of the market leading many lawyers to look for cutting-edge ways to compete.  &lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"/&gt; The exponential growth in the volume of documents (mostly email) that must be reviewed for litigation cases has greatly accelerated the adoption of technology used in eDiscovery, with elements of machine language and artificial intelligence being incorporated and cloud-based services being adopted by law firms.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Investment in Legal Tech is predominantly focused in the United States with more than $254 million invested in 2014 in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legaltransformationinstitute.com/blog/2014/3/10/legal-startup-funding-2014-so-far |title=Legal Startup Funding &amp;#124; 2014 So Far [Update 10/24/14&amp;#93; — LTI |website=Legaltransformationinstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there is significant growth worldwide.&lt;ref name="Forbes2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Basha|title=Is The Legal Tech Boom Over?

[[Stanford Law School]] has started CodeX, the Center for Legal Informatics, an interdisciplinary research center, which also incubates companies started by law students and computer scientists. Some companies that have come out of the program include [[Lex Machina]] and [[Legal.io]].&lt;ref name="lawinsider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stanford Law School |url=https://www.law.stanford.edu/organizations/programs-and-centers/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics |title=CodeX - Programs and Centers - Stanford Law School |website=Law.stanford.edu |date=2016-11-27 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of interstellar radio messages (IRMs)==
There are eleven realized IRM projects:

* [[The Morse Message (1962)|The Morse Message (1962)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/you-never-get-a-seventh-chance-to-make-a-first-impression-an-awkward-history-of-our-space-transmissions/ An Awkward History of Our Space Transmissions]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arecibo message]] (1974), one transmission to [[Messier 13]]
* [[Cosmic Call]] 1 (1999), four transmissions to nearby Sun-like stars
* [[Teen Age Message]] (2001), six transmissions
* [[Cosmic Call]] 2 (2003), five transmissions
* [[A Message From Earth]] (2008), one transmission to the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]]
* [[Across the Universe (message)|Across the Universe]] (2008)
* [[Hello From Earth]] (HFE, 2009) one transmission to the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]]
* Wow! Reply (2012), three transmissions to Hipparcos 34511, Hipparcos 33277 and Hipparcos 43587 in reply to the [[Wow! signal]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/08/15/158827877/will-e-t-hear-us-reply-to-wow-signal-gets-beamed-into-space-today/ Reply To 'WOW! Signal' Gets Beamed Into Space]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lone Signal]] (2013)
* [[A simple response to an elemental message|A Simple Response to an Elemental Message]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Simple Response|url=http://blogs.esa.int/rocketscience/2016/07/28/a-simple-response|website=European Space Agency official website|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2016)

The [[Across the Universe (message)|Across the Universe]] message, [[A simple response to an elemental message|A Simple Response to an Elemental Message]] and [[Hello From Earth]] are not always considered serious. The first two of them were sent to Polaris, which is 431 light years distant from us and whose planetary system, even if it exists, may not be suited for life, because it is a supergiant star, spectral type F7Ib which is only 70 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wielen, R.; Jahreiß, H.; Dettbarn, C.; Lenhardt, H.; Schwan, H.|title=Polaris: Astrometric orbit, position, and proper motion|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2000|volume=360|page=399|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0002406.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2017|arxiv=astro-ph/0002406|bibcode=2000A&amp;A...360..399W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, both transmission rates were very high, about 128 kbit/s, for such moderate transmitter power (about 18&amp;nbsp;kW). The main defect of the "Hello From Earth" is an insufficient scientific and technical justification, since no famous [[SETI]] scientist made statements with validation of HFE's design. As it follows from [https://web.archive.org/web/20100211005300/http://www.hellofromearth.net/gliese581d/links/index.htm]: ''"After the final message was collected on Monday 24 August 2009, messages were exported as a text file and sent to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where they were encoded into binary, packaged and tested before transmission"'', but nobody explained why he hopes that such encoded and packaged text will be understood and conceived by possible extraterrestrials.

Some use the term ''[[Active SETI]] Project'', but [[Alexander Zaitsev (scientist)|Alexander Zaitsev]], who was a scientific head of composing and transmissions of [[Cosmic Call]] 1999 &amp; 2003, and [[Teen Age Message]] 2001, and a scientific consultant of [[A Message From Earth]], emphasized that he considers above IRMs as the METI (''[[Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence]] Projects'').

These seven messages have targeted stars between 20 and 69 light-years from the Earth. The exception is the Arecibo message, which targeted [[globular cluster M13]], approximately 24,000 light-years away. The first message to reach its destination will be [[A Message From Earth]], which should reach the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]] in [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] in 2029.

On 13 February 2015, scientists (including [[Geoffrey Marcy]], [[Seth Shostak]], [[Frank Drake]], [[Elon Musk]] and [[David Brin]]) at a convention of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], discussed [[Active SETI]] and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] in the [[Cosmos]] was a good idea;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150213"&gt;{{cite news |author=Borenstein, Seth (of [[AP News]]) |title=Should We Call the Cosmos Seeking ET? Or Is That Risky? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/02/13/science/ap-us-sci-calling-the-cosmos.html |date=13 February 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=14 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20150212"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ghosh |first=Pallab |title=Scientist: 'Try to contact aliens' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31442952 |date=12 February 2015 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=12 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one result was a statement, (which was not signed by [[Seth Shostak]] or [[Frank Drake]]), that a "worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent".&lt;ref name="UCB-20150213"&gt;{{cite web |author=Various |title=Statement - Regarding Messaging To Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI) / Active Searches For Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Active SETI) |url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/meti_statement_0.html |date=13 February 2015 |work=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=14 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neophile''' or '''Neophiliac''', a term popularised by cult writer [[Robert Anton Wilson]],  is a personality type characterized by a strong affinity for [[novelty]]. The term was used earlier by [[Christopher Booker]] in his book [[The Neophiliacs]] (1969), and by [[J. D. Salinger]] in his short story [[Hapworth 16, 1924]] (1965).

==Characteristics==
Neophiles/Neophiliacs have the following basic characteristics:

* The ability to adapt rapidly to extreme change.
* A distaste or downright loathing of [[tradition]], repetition, and routine.
* A tendency to become bored quickly with old things.
* A desire, bordering on obsession in some cases, to experience novelty.
* A corresponding and related desire to create novelty by creating or achieving something and/or by stirring social or other forms of unrest.
* A complete objection to or distrust of commitment.

A neophile is distinct from a [[revolutionary]] in that anyone might become a revolutionary if pushed far enough by the reigning authorities or social norms, whereas neophiles are revolutionaries by nature. Their intellectual abhorrence of tradition and repetition usually bemoans a deeper emotional need for constant novelty and change. The meaning of neophile approaches and is not mutually exclusive to the term [[visionary]], but differs in that a neophile actively seeks first-hand experience of novelty rather than merely pontificating about it.

The opposite of a neophile is a [[neophobia|neophobe]]; a person with an aversion to novelty and change. Wilson observes that neophobes tend to regard neophiles, especially extreme ones, with fear and contempt, and to brand them with titles such as "[[witch]]," "[[satanist]]," "[[heresy|heretic]]," etc. He also speculates in his [[Prometheus Rising]] series of books that the [[industrial revolution]] and related [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] represents one of the first periods of history in which neophiles were a dominant force in society. Neophiles accelerate change because they like it that way.

==Types==
Open-source advocate and programmer [[Eric S. Raymond]] observes that this personality is especially prevalent in certain fields of expertise; in business, these are primarily [[computer science]] and other areas of high technology. Raymond speculates that the rapid progress of these fields (especially computers) is a result of this. A neophile's love of novelty is likely to lead them into subjects outside of the normal areas of human interest. Raymond observes a high concentration of neophiles in or around what he calls "leading edge subcultures" such as science fiction fandom, [[neo-paganism]], [[transhumanism]], etc. as well as in or around nontraditional areas of thought such as fringe philosophy or the [[occult]]. Raymond observes that most neophiles have roving interests and tend to be widely well-read.

There is more than one type of neophile. There are social neophiles (the extreme social butterfly), intellectual neophiles (the revolutionary [[philosopher]] and the [[technophile]]), and physical/kinetic neophiles (the [[extreme sports]] enthusiast). These tendencies are not mutually exclusive, and might exist simultaneously in the same individual.

The word "neophilia" has particular significance in Internet and [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] culture. ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' gave the following definition to neophilia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trait of being excited and pleased by novelty. Common among most hackers, [[Science fiction|SF]] fans, and members of several other connected leading-edge subcultures, including the pro-technology '[[Whole Earth Review|Whole Earth]]' wing of the [[ecology movement]], [[space activist]]s, many members of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], and the [[Discordianism|Discordian]]/[[neo-pagan]] underground (see [[geek]]). All these groups overlap heavily and (where evidence is available) seem to share characteristic hacker tropisms for science fiction, [[music]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Research has uncovered a possible link between certain predisposition to some kind of neophilia and increased levels of the enzyme [[monoamine oxidase]] A.&lt;ref name="pmid16538181"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shiraishi H, Suzuki A, Fukasawa T, Aoshima T, Ujiie Y, Ishii G, Otani K | title = Monoamine oxidase A gene promoter polymorphism affects novelty seeking and reward dependence in healthy study participants | journal = Psychiatr.

{{nihongo|'''Omorashi'''|おもらし / オモラシ / お漏らし}}, sometimes abbreviated as simply "omo", is a form of [[urolagnia]] (urine fetish) subculture originating and predominately recognized in Japan, in which participants experience [[Sexual arousal|arousal]] from having a full [[urinary bladder|bladder]] or wetting themselves, or from seeing someone else experiencing a full bladder or wetting themselves. Outside Japan, it is not usually distinguished from urolagnia, though they are different things. [[Western World|Westerners]] who do make the distinction commonly use phrases such as "'''bladder desperation'''" or "'''panty wetting'''", although a number of fetishist communities in the West have also adopted the more specific Japanese language terminology. The term "omorashi" means "to wet oneself", literally translated, "leaking". The word is also occasionally [[Romanization of Japanese|romanized]] as "'''omorasi'''" in the [[Kunrei-shiki]] romanization system.

==Attitudes toward sexuality in omorashi media==
Most fetish activities concerning the use of bodily waste are considered by the general public as "[[hardcore pornography|hardcore]]", [[taboo]], or [[edgeplay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Taboo: Bodily Fluids|url=http://www.matthewhunt.com/website/taboo/bodilyfluids.html |website=''Matthewhunt.com''|accessdate=July 3, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210185752/http://www.matthewhunt.com/website/taboo/bodilyfluids.html |archivedate=December 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the object of the fetish is clothed incontinence, omorashi videos do not necessarily feature direct sexual contact. The focus on clothed (rather than overtly sexual images) makes [[garment fetishism]] a prominent feature in most omorashi erotica: commonly featured outfits include those worn by [[Schoolgirl uniform fetish|schoolgirls]], [[suit and tie fetishism|working professionals]], and other people attempting to look dignified before succumbing to the need to [[urinate]].

==Japanese subculture==
There are many ways in which omorashi fetishism is practiced in Japan.

===Yagai===
One of the variations is known as ''omorashi yagai'', which translates as "to wet oneself outdoors (or publicly)." A further variation includes ''yagai hōnyō'', or "outdoor (or public) urination", in which the subject publicly removes their clothes to urinate. Other ''yagai hōnyō'' practitioners operate much like [[graffiti]] artists, attempting public urination acts without being caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hentai dictionary: Japanese perversions, fetishes and AV slang|url=http://www.hellodamage.com/homedespot/Adictionary.htm |website=''Hellodamage.com''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427073433/http://www.hellodamage.com/homedespot/Adictionary.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diapers===
Another variation of omorashi play is ''omutsu omorashi'' or ''omutsu play (おむつ·プレイ)'' , less commonly called ''oshime omorashi'', both of which translate as "to wet oneself in a diaper." This omutsu variation is essentially the same as the standard omorashi, except that the participants are wearing a [[adult diaper|diaper]]. Diapers may be favorable for public wetting because they render it more discreet and eliminate mess, and their use is not limited specifically to those with a [[diaper fetish]]. However, omorashi fetishists specifically interested in this aspect of the subculture could be considered a Japanese variation of the diaper lover community.

Japanese acceptance of adult diaper use is comparatively high, with the market for such products growing as much as 6–10% a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Adult Diapers To Outsell Baby Diapers in Japan By 2020: Report|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/11/adult-diaper-japan_n_3580553.html |work=HuffPost|date=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these are largely intended for and worn by the elderly, with the growth due to Japan's aging population, and younger people wearing these have met with some criticism. In 2012, the Japanese magazine SPA ran an article entitled "The Ultimate Form of Slob", which criticized the trend of young Japanese women who wear diapers to avoid public restrooms. The article included an interview with a 25-year-old woman who had been wearing diapers "instead of going to the toilet" for a period of six months, "wearing [them] almost every day."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ズボラの最終形か？ オムツ女子の生態 |url=http://nikkan-spa.jp/299209 |website=nikkan-spa.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skirt omorashi ===
''See also: [[Underwear fetishism]]''

Some individuals find it attractive when one was to wet themself in a skirt. Typically, in Japan, this would be a high-school girl wearing a short pleated skirt resembling a school uniform.

===Fetish films===
{{Main article|Pink film}}

In order to avoid Japan's strict censorship laws, which limited depictions of actual sex and pubic hair, erotic films (known as ''pink films'') often relied on fetish elements which could skirt such restrictions. One such film, ''[[Terrifying Girls' High School: Lynch Law Classroom]]'' in 1973, would be the first to depict an omorashi scenario to a theatrical audience.

As the [[chronology of adult videos in Japan|AV]] (adult video) genre took hold in the 1980s, videos specifically devoted to omorashi began to appear. Several notable [[AV idols]] have starred in such scenes, including Sakura Sakurada. However, perhaps because of its softcore nature, omorashi never became a clearly pornographic genre.

Today, Japanese omorashi fans also enjoy [[game shows|game show-style]] pornographic videos in which contestants must compete in various urine-holding challenges.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kokoro-soft.com/dnanpa/pages/RVideos.html |title=The R Videos |publisher=Kokoro-soft.com |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giga&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=無題ドキュメント |trans-title=Untitled Document|url=http://www.giga-freeks.net/new/giga/html/sakuhinn_eng/category/category_omorashi.htm |website=Giga-freeks.net|accessdate=July 3, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124042827/http://www.giga-freeks.net/new/giga/html/sakuhinn_eng/category/category_omorashi.htm |archivedate=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; video company's "Desperation Tournament" series is an example of this kind of contest. One such activity is a panel of contestants competing to hold their bladders, or to guess which woman has to use the restroom the most.

===Periodicals===
Since the 1990s, magazine companies catering to the Japanese [[Kink (sexual)|kink]] community have produced a number of periodicals dedicated to omorashi subculture, including most notably [[:Ja:三和出版|Sanwa Publishing]]'s [[:ja:おもらし倶楽部|''Omorashi Club'']] (rendered phonetically as the [[wasei-eigo]] おもらし倶楽部, or ''Omorashi Kurabu''). First published September 22, 1994, ''Omorashi Club'''s success allowed Sanwa to [[Brand extension|extend]] the brand in 2006 to include a [[DVD magazine]]. The following year, the demand for material catering specifically to ''omutsu omorashi'' [[fandom]] led to further expansion with the spin-off periodical [[:ja:おむつ倶楽部|''Diapers Club'']] (おむつ倶楽部, or ''Omutsu Kurabu''). The [[scarcity]] of earlier issues of these magazines has caused them to become [[Collectable|collector's items]].

===Anime and manga===
Japanese-produced omorashi media also include [[comic book]]s and [[cartoons]]. These range from independently produced [[dōjinshi]] to large, commercially-produced [[manga]]. Some focus exclusively on omorashi stories, while others include only the occasional scene. Some contain obvious sexual themes and could be considered a form of [[H manga]], while others, like ''[[Iinari! Aibure-shon]]'', are well known to be suitable for all ages, since they have only mild [[ecchi]] content such as [[panchira]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Iinari!

Omutsu Joshi'', which follows the typical [[Harem (genre)|Harem]] formula but features teenage characters who wet their panties and wear diapers.

Wetting scenes have existed in anime as early as the popular [[Doraemon (1973 anime)|Doraemon]] and [[Devilman#The TV Series|''Devilman'']] [[Animated series|series]] of the 1970s. &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed:  [[File:Nagisa 02.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A collectible figure based on Nagisa's omutsu omorashi scene in the eroge, ''MAID iN HEAVEN SuperS''.]] --&gt;
However, these did not have the erotic context which characterizes modern omorashi media, since they predated the first full-blown anime pornography, which was not available until 1984, when the advent of the first [[H anime]] [[Original Video Animation|OVAs]] such as Wonder Kids' ''[[Lolita Anime]]'' were made possible by the widespread availability of [[home video]]. One example of this later erotic context is the 1994 [[H anime]] [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] ''[[Vixens]]'', which features scenes of incontinence in a setting that is overtly sexual.

There are also sites where users can upload and watch their own pictures. It can be fanart or manga. Sometimes there are GIFs involved. The most known site for such fanart is omorashi.org. Those pictures are more likely the fanart of already existing anime or game characters (SAO or Touhou), but there are some own pictures too.

===Eroge===
An ''[[eroge]]'' ('''ero'''tic '''ga'''me) is a Japanese [[Video game|video or computer game]] that features erotic content, usually in the form of [[anime]]-style artwork. The crossover of omorashi and anime fandom has produced a number of games such as ''Water Closet: The Forbidden Chamber'' which are specifically focused on omorashi. The limited popularity of omorashi in the West has prompted a number of programmers in the scene to create [[software patches]] for these Japanese games which translate the on screen text into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shikkin128en.googlepages.com/|title=Google page|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some eroge game designers have capitalized on the omorashi fandom's [[niche market]] by including the occasional wetting scene in their games as a selling point. ''MAID iN HEAVEN SuperS'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.doujinshi.org/book/556/MAID-iN-HEAVEN-SuperS/%E3%82%81%E3%81%84%E3%81%A9%E3%81%84%E3%82%93%E3%81%B8%E3%81%B6%E3%82%93%E3%81%99%E3%83%BC%E3%81%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%81%99 |title=Information about: MAID iN HEAVEN SuperS / めいどいんへぶんすーぱーす |website=Doujinshi.mugimugi.org|date=November 3, 2013|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--non-secure link: http://doujinshi.mugimugi.org/book/556/MAID-iN-HEAVEN-SuperS/%E3%82%81%E3%81%84%E3%81%A9%E3%81%84%E3%82%93%E3%81%B8%E3%81%B6%E3%82%93%E3%81%99%E3%83%BC%E3%81%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%81%99--&gt; for example, which contains only a single, diapered wetting scene, was used to spin-off an entire set of collectible figures in various omorashi poses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tisinc99.com/mai070604.html |title=''Maid in Heaven Supers: Beach Vol. 2'' Set of 4 – Maid in Heaven Supers Action Figures|website=''Tisinc99.com''|date=July 15, 2003|accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[PVC]] [[Model figure#Otaku fandom|model figures]] were created by toy manufacturer Giga Pulse, which is not related to the video company of similar name.

===Collectibles===

With the translation of omorashi into manga and its subsequent adoption by [[otaku]] fandom, a number of omorashi themed collectibles have appeared on the Japanese market, including figurines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leon |url=http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2010/08/07/queens-gate-urinating-alice-figure/ |title=Queen's Gate Urinating Alice Figure |publisher=Sankaku Complex |date=August 7, 2010 |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Shingo |url=http://heiseidemocracy.com/2008/08/23/iinari-aibure-shon-gets-the-figure-treatment/ |title=Iinari!

Aibure-shon''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

==Outside Japan==
Though there is a small community devoted to such fetishism outside Japan, it is usually overshadowed by the more hardcore fetishes, [[urolagnia]] and [[urophagia]]. [[Vice Media]] has documented an account of an omorashi community existing in the [[United States]] since at least 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzndbm/the-women-and-men-who-get-turned-on-by-needing-to-pee|title=The Women and Men Who Get Turned on by Needing to Pee|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Japan omorashi groups sometimes refer to their shared interest as "desperation/wetting" fetishism, often making a distinction between content featuring males and females. Some English language websites with a focus on females simply identify as "panty wetting." Since such sites abandon the "desperation" title which implies an effort not to wet, they are more likely to include nudity, overtly sexual models and situations, as well as purposeful (as opposed to accidental) wetting. There are still communities which focus on the more tame or [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] aspects of omorashi, which are generally focused on simple wetting in fully or semi-clothed situations without the overtly sexual models and situations. However, this softcore side is more rare in English-speaking communities than the more explicitly sexual omorashi content.

Though there is generally no wide acceptance of incontinence-based play, recent studies in England have shown that urinary incontinence during sexual activity is a "common, but rarely volunteered symptom" observed in 24% of sexually active women. Moreover, no connection could be identified with any specific abnormality of bladder function associated with these symptoms, indicating that such leakage is both normal and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Z.|last2=Bhola|first2=A.|last3=Starer|first3=P.|title=Urinary incontinence during orgasm|journal=Urology|volume=31 |issue=3 |year=1988|pages=279–282|doi=10.1016/0090-4295(88)90160-4 |pmid=3347980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilton|first=P.|title=Urinary incontinence during sexual intercourse: a common, but rarely volunteered, symptom|journal=British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=377–381|year=1988|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.1988.tb06609.x |pmid=3382610 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western publications and media===
Because of the western [[Social stigma|stigma]] in numerous countries against urine, omorashi subculture has not received such diverse exposure in non-Japanese media. In some countries, governments have even [[censorship|banned]] such materials. In [[New Zealand]] for example, creating, trading, distributing (e.g. making available on one's [[Internet pornography|web page]]) anything promoting or supporting "the use of urine or excrement in association with degrading or dehumanising conduct or sexual conduct" is a felony punishable by up to ten (10) years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0094/latest/DLM313407.html |title=Text of the law|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censorship.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Censorship-Compliance-Amendment-Act-2005?OpenDocument |title=Description of ten-year penalty|website=Censorship.dia.govt.nz|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Print====
An early example of pants-wetting appearing in a sexualized context in the west can be found in the 1928 [[erotic novel]] [[Story of the Eye]].

Omorashi periodicals outside of Japan include the Australia based, internationally distributed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetset.net/Wet_Set_New_Magazine.htm|title=Wet Set Magazine|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wet Set Magazine]]''. The welcome header on their website reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetset.net/ |title=wetset|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Wet Set Magazine is for girls who enjoy the thrill of wetting their knickers, or peeing in their beds and diapers. Our girls are always desperate to go to the toilet, but love to pee in their pants instead!}}

Though Wet Set publications were originally only available in English, readership in German speaking countries has since proved high enough to justify printing some materials in German.

Though Wet Set does not generally acknowledge the comparatively large Asian fan base over any other country, some Western advocates of omorashi recognize a heavy Asian influence. For instance, in a February 2006 issue of [[The Brooklyn Rail]], American poet [[Garrett Caples]] of [[Oakland, California]] chose to describe the shooting of an omorashi film in a Japanese setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Omorashi Girls|url=http://www.thebrooklynrail.org/archives/feb2006/FICTION/omorashi.html |first=Garrett|last=Caples|website=''Thebrooklynrail.org''|accessdate=July 3, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110164658/http://www.thebrooklynrail.org/archives/feb2006/FICTION/omorashi.html |archivedate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from lending Western omorashi media an "authentic" quality, the inclusion of Japanese models and settings might also be seen as an attempt to play upon the [[stereotype]] of ultrapassivity globally associated&lt;ref name="Phoebe"&gt;{{cite book |first=Phoebe |last=Eng |year=2000 |title=Warrior Lessons: An Asian American Woman's Journey into Power |chapter=She Takes Back Desire |pages=115–142 |publisher=Atria |location=New York |isbn=0-671-00957-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Asian women, further enhancing their perceived ''[[moe (slang)|moe]]'' qualities and catering to [[Asian fetish]]ists.

==In BDSM==
Omorashi may be practiced in [[BDSM]], where the [[dominant (BDSM)|dominant]] controls how and when the [[submissive (BDSM)|submissive]] is allowed to use the bathroom. This is sometimes referred to as ''bathroom use control''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cynyster.com/survey/Descriptions/Bathroomuse%28Control%29.php |title=BDSM Survey – Bathroom use (Control) |publisher=Cynyster.com |date=October 29, 2009 |accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 award-winning film [[Secretary (2002 film)|''Secretary'']] depicted a scene of bathroom use control resulting in the submissive wetting her dress.

'''Participatory development communication''' is the use of [[mass media]] and traditional, inter-personal means of communication that empowers communities to visualise aspirations and discover solutions to their development problems and issues.

'''Participatory communication''' is "the theory and practices of communication used to involve people in the [[decision-making]] of the development process. It intends to return to the roots of its meaning, which, similarly to the term community, originate from the Latin word 'communis', i.e. common (Mody, 1991). Therefore, the purpose of communication should be to make something common, or to share...meanings, perceptions, worldviews or knowledge. In this context, sharing implies an equitable division of what is being shared, which is why communication should almost be naturally associated with a balanced, two-way flow of information."{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* Strengthen a regional training capacity to improve the development support communication (DSC) skills of intermediate-level professionals so that they could improve the effectiveness of the rural development programmes in which they work.
* Initiate an example of a sustainable national DSC service to support rural development programmes and projects.
* Advance towards the creation of a group of DSC professionals in the region, by means of preparing a regional Post-graduate DSC Professional Diploma Course (through collaboration with the University of Zimbabwe in Harare).
* Advise governments and other development-related organisations about the requirements for effective DSC in Southern Africa, for future action.

Based on a "Results" section which synthesises and recaps the main issues by reviewing how the conception and levels of participation identified in his research have shifted in each phase of the project, Mefalopulos concludes by arguing that participatory communication is an approach capable of facilitating people's involvement in decision-making about issues impacting their lives – a process capable of addressing specific needs and priorities relevant to people and at the same time assisting in their empowerment. In fact, he says, participatory communication is "a necessary component, consistent with a democratic vision of international development, needed to increase projects sustainability and ensure genuine ownership by the so-called 'beneficiaries'."

==Six phases of planning==

Communication planning for development is a logical process guided by a systematic and rational framework. This framework could be developed through situation-specific data gathered using participatory research techniques.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Preliminary situation assessment===
Situation assessment could be done most effectively in a participatory manner through PRCA or participatory rural communication appraisal. Three kinds of analysis are done in PRCA: audience analysis, programme analysis, and situation analysis.
Audience analysis Audience analysis is essentially "listening" to what potential users of information need. They are the ones whom the communication program intends to reach. Users of information are also referred to as stakeholders of a communication program. Collecting baseline information about these stakeholders is an essential preliminary step towards developing a communication strategy.
Segmentation, or dividing large groups of stakeholders into smaller groups, helps achieve focus in communication strategy development. Segmentation is usually done in two ways:
* Conventional segmentation according to socio-economic status (income, education, age, sex, etc.), place of residence (urban-rural), and language/ethnic group
* Innovative segmentation based on behaviour, needs, and values and lifestyles.
* Situation analysis: In doing situation analysis, planners look at both the possible problem to be addressed by the communication program and the conditions surrounding such problem.

What are the factors which cause a gap between the existing and desired behavior of stakeholders? Is the problem due to the stakeholders' lack of awareness or knowledge of the nature of the problem? Or is it attitudinal in nature? Could the gap be due to their lack of skills to carry out certain practices?
Situation analysis likewise includes assessing the communication resources in the area which could be tapped for the communication program. Knowledge of the area's mass and small media, as well as interpersonal means of communication, should contribute substantially to strategy development.
Programme analysis
When doing program analysis, program planners need to take both an inward and an outward look at the situation that is, looking at the organization's own vision, policies, resources, strengths, and weaknesses relevant to the problem.
Are there adequate resources to realize this vision? How well are program managers using available resources? At the same time, it is important to scan the environment for existing programs that could affect, positively or negatively, the communication strategy to be developed.

===Communication strategy design===
Data that have been collected need to be analyzed and interpreted carefully as these will serve as bases of the communication strategy. Communication strategy is the combination of methods, messages, and approaches by which the planner seeks to achieve the communication objectives.
The second phase of the process charts the direction of the communication program. It is at this stage where objectives and the corresponding standards and indicators for [[Monitoring and Evaluation|monitoring and evaluation]] are formulated.
The very word strategy suggests a unique combination of techniques or approaches by which to achieve program goals and objectives.
During strategy design formulation, planners also begin thinking of the following:
* Preliminary action plan;
* Communication modes/approaches; and
* Basic messages and discussion themes.

===Participatory design of messages and discussion themes===
The main activities under the message design phase are selection of message appeals and approaches and selection of communication channels and media. The big challenge at this stage is the development of the big idea or the creative concept around which the whole communication program would revolve.
Professional communication outfits are often tapped to develop messages and communication materials for the above-mentioned processes. The disadvantage of this approach, aside from the huge expense involved, is the lack of participation from the stakeholders themselves.
Involving the stakeholders in message and materials development increases the likelihood that the communication program would help achieve the bigger development goals.

===Communication methods and materials development===
Actual development of communication methods and materials are undertaken once the communication strategy is in place.
A useful reminder to planners concerns the importance of pretesting not only the materials themselves, but also the creative idea and the messages. Pretesting allows for adjustments in the communication activities before substantial time, efforts, and resources are spent on their actual production.
Pretesting measures potential effectiveness of communication messages, methods, and materials in terms of their being able to attract attention, to be understood, to be accepted, and to generate the feeling of self-involvement among the stakeholders.

===Management and implementation===
Management of the organization carrying out the communication program and networking are two of the most important activities in this phase.
A manager's internal task entails preparing or training people for their respective tasks in the organization within a positive organizational climate. The external task calls for forging linkages with key organizations engaged in the same area of development work.
After all the preparatory stages, launching and carrying out the communication campaign or program now takes priority. Together with this come monitoring the process of dissemination, transmission, and reception of programme inputs.
The management aspect also covers the management improvement process and the concept of leadership as they affect implementation of communication programmes.

===Monitoring and evaluation===
Monitoring enables the planners and implementors to answer the question: Are things going all right? Evaluation, on the other hand, provides answers to the question: So, did it work?
Together, monitoring and evaluation help planners and implementors:
* Achieve better understanding of how the communication programme is working;
* Make informal decisions regarding operations and adjust to changing conditions;
* Ensure most effective and efficient use of resources;
* Look at the extent to which the program/project is having or has had the desired impact; and
* Fine-tune future programme impact.
To help gauge programme impact on stakeholders, it is important to set up clear standards and indicators based on the objectives set. How much have the activities contributed to achieving objectives of key organizations? This can be gauged by comparing evaluation with baseline data, specifically those gathered during the PRCA.
More importantly, monitoring and evaluation data contribute to planning for program sustainability and self-sufficiency.

==Types of participation==

Participation can be used as a goal or as a tool for specific projects.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tufte, Mefalopulos|first=Thomas, Paolo|title=Participatory Communication|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTDEVCOMMENG/Resources/Participatorycommunication.pdf|publisher=The World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four categories below refer to different levels of participation and communication:

===Passive participation===
The stakeholders of a project essentially act as "empty vessels" and receive information. Feedback is minimal if at all and participation is assessed through methods such as head counts.

===Participation by consultation===
Researchers or "experts" pose questions to the stakeholders. Input can be provided at different points in time but the final analysis and decision-making power lies in the hands of the external professionals whom may or may not take the stakeholders' decisions into consideration.

===Participation by collaboration===
Groups of primary stakeholders are formed in order to participate in discussion and analysis. Objectives are predetermined. This method incorporates components of horizontal communication and capacity building among all stakeholders.

===Empowerment participation===
Primary stakeholders are capable and willing to become involved in the process and take part in decision-making. Outsiders are equal partners, but the stakeholders make the final decisions as ownership and control of the process rests in their hands. Knowledge exchange leads to solutions.

==Minga Peru case study==

Minga Peru is a non-profit organization formed to address issues of "social justice, gender equality, reproductive health, and human rights". Minga has targeted the northern Loreto region for its development of "communicative spaces" which hope to spark debate and participation from the community. In order to achieve these goals they have produced a radio program, started a community empowerment and leadership program and supported income generating activities.

These activities are community-based approaches as evidenced by editorial letters being sent to the radio program, use of youth correspondents which provides the community with access to and voice within the broadcast, and emphasis on social networking which has resulted in stronger social cohesion. The most prominent outcomes in the empowerment of women through self-confidence. Women are better able to develop professional and social networks and have improved capacity to handle health challenges.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

{{redirect|General audience|formal meeting|Audience (meeting)}}
In [[public relations]] and [[communication science]], '''publics''' are groups of individual [[people]], and '''the public''' (a.k.a. '''the general public''') is the totality of such groupings.{{sfn|Heath|2005|pp=707}}{{sfn|Rawlins|Bowen|2005|pp=718}} This is a different concept to the [[sociology|sociological]] concept of the Öffentlichkeit or [[public sphere]].{{sfn|Heath|2005|pp=707}} The concept of a public has also been defined in [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[marketing]], and advertising.  In public relations and communication science, it is one of the more ambiguous concepts in the field.{{sfn|Vasquez|Taylor|2001|pp=139}} Although it has definitions in the theory of the field that have been formulated from the early 20th century onwards, it has suffered in more recent years from being blurred, as a result of conflation of the idea of a public with the notions of audience, market segment, community, constituency, and stakeholder.{{sfn|Jahanzsoozi|2006|pp=65}}

The name "public" originates with the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:publicus#Latin|publicus]]'' (also ''[[wikt:poplicus#Latin|poplicus]]''), from ''[[wikt:populus#Latin|populus]]'',  to the English word '[[populace]]', and in general denotes some mass population ("the people") in association with some matter of common interest. So in political science and history, a public is a population of individuals in association with civic affairs, or affairs of office or state.  In social psychology, marketing, and public relations, a public has a more situational definition.{{sfn|Vasquez|Taylor|2001|pp=140}} [[John Dewey]] defined {{harv|Dewey|1927}} a public as a  of  who, in facing a  , recognize it and organize themselves to address it. Dewey's definition of a public is thus situational: people organized about a situation. Built upon this situational definition of a public is the [[situational theory of publics]] by [[James E. Grunig]] {{harv|Grunig|1983}}, which talks of ''nonpublics'' (who have no problem), ''latent publics'' (who have a problem), ''aware publics'' (who recognize that they have a problem), and ''active publics'' (who do something about their problem).{{sfn|Rawlins|Bowen|2005|pp=720&amp;ndash;721}}{{sfn|Toth|2006|pp=506&amp;ndash;507}}

In public relations and communication theory, a public is distinct from a [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] or a [[Market (economics)|market]]. A public is a subset of the set of stakeholders for an organization, that comprises those people concerned with a specific issue. Whilst a market has an exchange relationship with an organization, and is usually a passive entity that is created by the organization, a public does not necessarily have an exchange relationship, and is both self-creating and self-organizing.{{sfn|Rawlins|Bowen|2005|pp=721}} Publics are targeted by public relations efforts. In this, ''target publics'' are those publics whose involvement is necessary for achieving organization goals; ''intervening publics'' are opinion formers and mediators, who pass information to the target publics; and ''influentials'' are publics that the target publics turn to for consultation, whose value judgements are influential upon how a target public will judge any public relations material.{{sfn|Rawlins|Bowen|2005|pp=720&amp;ndash;721}} The public is often targeted especially in regard to political agendas as their vote is necessary in order to further the progression of the cause. As seen in Massachusetts between 2003 and 2004, it was necessary to "win a critical mass of states and a critical mass of public support" in order to get same-sex marriage passed in the commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/16/massachusetts-gay-marriage_n_4288726.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119130016/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/16/massachusetts-gay-marriage_n_4288726.html |archivedate=2013-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public relations theory perspectives on publics are situational, per Dewey and Grunig; mass, where a public is simply viewed as a population of individuals; agenda-building, where a public is viewed as a condition of political involvement that is not transitory; and "homo narrans", where a public is (in the words of Gabriel M. Vasquez, assistant professor in the School of Communication at the [[University of Houston]]) a collection of "individuals that develop a group consciousness around a problematic situation and act to solve the problematic situation" {{harv|Vasquez|1993|pp=209}}.{{sfn|Vasquez|Taylor|2001|pp=140}}{{sfn|Jahanzsoozi|2006|pp=65}} Public schools are often under controversy for their "agenda-building," especially in debates over whether to teach a religious or secular curriculum.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/magazine/14texbooks-t.html|title=How Christian Were the Founders?|first=Russell|last=Shorto|date=11 February 2010|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2018|via=NYTimes.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230005639/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/magazine/14texbooks-t.html|archivedate=30 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The promotion of an agenda is commonplace whenever one is in a public environment, but schools have exceptional power in that regard.  In the public school system, it is the responsibility of those within the system to determine what agenda is being promoted.

One non-situational concept of a public is that of Kirk Hallahan, professor at [[Colorado State University]], who defines a public as "a group of people who relate to an organization, who demonstrate varying degrees of activity&amp;mdash;passivity, and who might (or might not) interact with others concerning their relationship with the organization".{{sfn|Jahanzsoozi|2006|pp=65}}

Samuel Mateus's 2011 paper "Public as Social Experience"{{Undue-inline|date=January 2016}} considered to view the concept by an alternative point of view: the public "is neither a simple audience constituted by media consumers nor just a rational-critical agency of a Public Sphere". He argued "the concept should also be seen in the light of a publicness principle, beyond a critic and manipulative publicity (...). In accordance, the public may be regarded as the result of the social activities made by individuals sharing symbolic representations and common emotions in publicness. Seen with lower-case, the concept is a set of subjectivities who look publicly for a feeling of belonging. So, in this perspective, the public is still a fundamental notion to social life although in a different manner in comparison to 18th century Public Sphere's Public. He means above all the social textures and configurations where successive layers of social experience are built up."&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, Samuel (2011) "The Public as Social Experience", Comunicação e Sociedade nº19, pp.275-286  https://www.academia.edu/34807778346/The_public_as_social_experience{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "Public as Social Experience"&lt;/ref&gt;

The general public also sets social norms which causes people to express themselves in socially acceptable manners. Although this is present within every community, this is often especially applicable within the transgender community as they feel the need to "perform" to a certain set of expectations to be seen as their true gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tsq.dukejournals.org/content/1/1-2/141.full.pdf |title=TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social publics==
Social publics are groups of people united by common ideas, ideology, or hobbies.

Networked publics are social publics which have been socially restructured by the networking of technologies. As such, they are simultaneously both (1) the space constructed through networked technologies and (2) the imagined collective which consequently emerges as a result of the intersection of human [[persons]], shared technologies, and their practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://networkedpublics.org/ |title=Networked Publics |last=Varnelis |first=Kazys |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |date=October 31, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610172912/http://networkedpublics.org/ |archivedate=June 10, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public screening''' is the showing of moving pictures to an audience in a public place. The event screened may be live or recorded, free or [[payment|paid]], and may use film, [[video]], or a broadcast method such as [[satellite television|satellite]] or [[closed-circuit television]]. Popular events for public screenings include [[film screening|films]], sporting events, and [[concert]]s. '''Private screening''' refers to the screening of a commercially made film to a group of people somewhere other than one of their homes. Private screening can be legally complex, as the rules and regulations vary from country to country.

Live public screenings of [[association football]] matches, called "{{ill|Public Viewing|de}}", became especially popular at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 football World Cup]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=CNN2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Pleitgen|first=Fred|title=Germany's World Cup legacy: What can South Africa learn?|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/football/04/27/football.world.cup.germany/|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Showing a video to a group of people outside of the home is legally regarded as a public showing, and is therefore in breach of [[copyright]] for DVDs/videos that have been purchased or hired for domestic use. To organise a group screening, permission from the copyright owner of the title in question will need to be obtained. Obtaining such rights clearances can be a complex procedure.

For certain types of screening ("non-theatrical" screening), it is possible to hire a copy of a film from its [[distributor]] with the rights already cleared. The primary non-theatrical distributors of feature films on DVD, video and [[16 mm film|16mm]] in Britain are the BFI and Filmbank Distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it on DVD or video?

Another option is to buy a ''blanket'' licence for the year known as a 'Public Video Screening Licence' which may work out cheaper if showing film is to be a regular event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to Filmbank |publisher=Filmbank |url=http://www.filmbank.co.uk/content.asp?id=25871 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006181236/http://www.filmbank.co.uk/content.asp?id=25871|archivedate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public bookcase''' is a cabinet which may be freely and anonymously used for the exchange and storage of books without the formalities associated with [[Library|libraries]]. When in public places these cabinets are of a robust and weatherproof design which are available at all times. However, cabinets installed in public or commercial buildings may be simple, unmodified book-shelves and may only be available during certain periods.

== Origin ==
Closely allied with the [[BookCrossing]] concept, the original public bookcases were conceived as artistic acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reticon.de/reporte/book-crossing-offene-buecherschraenke-in-bonn_121--1.html ''Book Crossing: Offene Bücherschränke in Bonn'', reticon-Report von Martin Ragg, 2. April 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103044019/http://www.reticon.de/reporte/book-crossing-offene-buecherschraenke-in-bonn_121--1.html |date=2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very early examples are the creations of performance artist duo Clegg &amp; Guttmann in 1991. Collections of bookcases were conceived as "free open-air libraries" in Darmstadt and Hannover in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/stadtteilkultur/stadtteilkultur/buechersch/geschichte/ ''Die Geschichte der Offenen Bibliotheken'' auf hannover.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819054002/http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/stadtteilkultur/stadtteilkultur/buechersch/geschichte/ |date=2011-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Bonn]] Community Foundation awarded Trixy Royeck funding for her idea "outdoor books&amp;nbsp;– books in the open" which she submitted while studying interior design in Mainz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buergerstiftung-bonn.de/cms/download/pressetexte/pressemeldung_031115.pdf ''Bürgerstiftung Bonn stellt offenen Bücherschrank auf'', Presseerklärung der Bürgerstiftung Bonn, 15. November 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and since this time the concept has been widely replicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/aktuell/pressebox/archiv_volltext.shtml?arch_0806/nachricht3102.html ''Bücherwald&amp;nbsp;– erstes öffentliches Bücherregal im Berliner Straßenraum'', Presseerklärung Berliner Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung, 27. Juni 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; A public bookcase opened in 2010 in Vienna, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=offener Bücherschrank – Wien
 |url = http://www.offener-buecherschrank.at/ |date=2010 |access-date=8 February 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Basel, Switzerland, where many coffee shops and other venues host open bookshelves,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.öffentliche-bücherregale.ch/ Öffentliche Bücherregale]&lt;/ref&gt; a public bookcase was unveiled in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merianstiftung.ch/presse/detail.cfm?ObjectID=8563D8F6-E24F-56B8-C18F4E451AFDC6D3 Medienmitteilung der [[Christoph Merian Stiftung]] vom 14. Juni 2011.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108234709/http://www.merianstiftung.ch/presse/detail.cfm?ObjectID=8563D8F6-E24F-56B8-C18F4E451AFDC6D3 |date=2014-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://3landinfo.blogspot.com/2011/06/dies-das-ein-neuer-bucherschrank.html 3land.info: ''dies &amp; das &amp; ein neuer Bücherschrank'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Open bookcases are financed by a wide range of organisations (individuals, foundations, Lions Clubs, civic associations, and so on).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.das-juelicht.de/nachrichten/artikel/10465.php Das JüLichT: ''Jülich ganz „sozial“''] Beitrag 2. September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors to the bookcases decide which books to deposit and borrow, and whether to return or exchange borrowed books for others.

== Use and acceptance ==
If a public bookcase is centrally and accessibly located and is stocked with sufficient material, public bookcases are quickly and widely appreciated. Vandalism has occurred in some places and, in successful cases, is countered by "bookcase sponsors" or "godfathers" who devote their time and attention to care of the collection.

The acceptance, motivation and user-profile of public bookshelves was examined in 2008 by a study at the University of Bonn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huk.uni-bonn.de/pdf-dateien/bonner-buecherschrank-artikel''Der Bonner Bücherschrank auf der PoppelsdorferAllee – Ein merkwürdiges Versorgungssystem . Kurzfassung der Ergebnisse des Projekts „Das Nutzungsverhalten am Poppelsdorfer Bücherschrank“''] (pdf) Autoren: Prof. Dr. Michael-Burkhard Piorkowsky, Sandra Bichler, Kerstin Hilt, Olga Reger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.uni-bonn.de/die-universitaet/publikationen/forsch/forsch-2-april-2009/lernen_und_lehren.pdf''Bonner "Gemeinschaftsmöbel" Studienobjekt: Offener Bücherschrank als soziales System'' (pdf) Autorin: Ulrike Klopp. In: forsch / Bonner Universitäts-Nachrichten 2/2009. (S.27)]&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that the system had developed as a notable alternative to conventional bookstores. One cannot equate public bookcases with classic peer-to-peer exchange, but they certainly represent the voluntary transfer of goods. Surveyed users also indicated that they believed that regular use of public bookcases could function as an example for similar schemes for other desirable goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10004&amp;detailid=552233 ''Poppelsdorfer Bücherschrank: Die Frauen geben, die Männer nehmen''; Bonner General-Anzeiger, 3. February 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825024252/http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10004&amp;detailid=552233 |date=2011-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This acceptance has led to a rapid dissemination of public bookshelves throughout Germany. It has been found that durable construction and storm-resistance promote sustained use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10490&amp;detailid=525497 ''Ein Schrank für ausgesetzte Bücher/Bürgerstiftung Bonn eröffnet in den kommenden Tagen zwei weitere Freiluft-Bibliotheken'', Bonner General-Anzeiger, 20.

== Variants ==
In Oerlinghausen there is a modified version of the public bookcase. A small bookcase has been installed in Simon Square by the Friends of The Public Library, in collaboration with the Cohabitation/Society/Culture group of the local Agenda 21. These groups stock the bookcase as needed from a so-called "book exchange", a larger public event which has taken place in the Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Haus in Oerlingsausen-South every Saturday since 2007. One may also deposit book requests to be matched from stock by the operators of the exchange.

The Salbke Bookmark is a large, open-air construction which includes a number of public bookcases. Originally built on the site of a demolished library in a depopulated district of Magdeburg, the local civic association has moved much of the stock to a nearby vacant shop where more than 10000 donations are securely housed.

A cafe in Marburg includes a public bookcase. The city library now includes a cabinet of books which may be freely taken or exchanged by patrons rather than organising complex book disposal events. The operation of this variant combines the library's daily operations with community control. As the bookcase is located in a protected space it does not require sponsorship or weather protection.

== Catalogs and mapping ==
[[File:Pizza Hut themed Little Free Library in Gillette, Wyoming.jpg|upright|thumb|right|A [[Pizza Hut]] themed Little Free Library in [[Gillette, Wyoming]]]]

In the United States, small enclosed bookcases, usually in front of residences, have become a common sight in many cities. Some of these are officially registered with the [[Little Free Library]] network. In Europe many public bookcases are registered via the [[Open Book Case]] project. The Open source /crowdsourcing mapping project [[OpenStreetMap]] has a designated tag for registering the location types and more of public bookcases.

'''Public duties''' are performed by military personnel, and usually have a ceremonial or historic significance rather than an overtly operational role.

==Denmark==
{{main|Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron}}

[[File:Amalienborg.1.jpg|thumb|Royal Life Guards at Amalienborg Palace]]
There are two regiments in Denmark, who provide soldiers for public duties, the [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guard regiment]] and [[Guard Hussar Regiment (Denmark)|Guard Hussar Regiment]]. 

The [[Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron]] provide mounted escorts for the [[Monarchy of Denmark| Royal family]] and foreign dignitaries, and carry ceremonial services for the Royal Danish Army. 

The [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guards]] provide a permanent guard at the Amalienborg Palace, Kastellet (part of the old fortification of Copenhagen), Rosenborg Castle/garrison of the Royal Life Guards in Copenhagen and the garrison of Høvelte. On occasions guard is kept at Fredensborg Palace, Marselisborg Palace, Gråsten Palace, Christiansborg Palace and other locations inside the Danish realm.
 
==Germany==
The ''Wachregiment Berlin'' was founded in early 1921. In addition to genuine security duties, the unit was used for ceremonial public duties in the capital. The regiment was disbanded in June 1921 and shortly after was revived as ''Kommando der Wachtruppe'' (lit. Headquarters Guard Troop). 

The ''Wachtruppe'' comprised seven companies, each drawn from one of the seven active army divisions. Each company served for three months before returning to its parent division. In this way, the Wachtruppe represented the whole [[Reichswehr]].

The ''Kommando'' was based at Moabit Barracks, and every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, performed a modest [[Guard Mounting|changing of the guard]] ceremony for the public. On each Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday, the entire ''Wachtruppe'', accompanied by the regimental band, marched from the barracks through the [[Brandenburg Gate]] and to the Berlin War Memorial, providing a greater spectacle for public view.

In 1934, the unit was renamed ''Wachtruppe Berlin'' and in 1936, a headquarters and administration company were added. In June 1937, the unit was again renamed ''Wach Regiment Berlin''. Postings were now done by individuals, not entire companies, and each man served six-month tours of duty. The unit provided escorts and Guards of Honour for State Visits, Conferences and even the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].

In 1939, the unit was reorganized as the [[Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland]]. While equipped as a field unit, the regiment also maintained a public duties detachment in the capital. The ceremonial guard was pressed into service during the July bomb plot in 1944 and helped round up conspirators in the capital. 

In 1957, the post-war [[Bundeswehr]] established the [[Wachbataillon]], a tri-service unit, for ceremonial duties.

==United Kingdom==
{{main|Queen's Guard}}
===London===
Three [[infantry]] [[battalions]] of the [[British army]] are currently tasked with the provision of Public Duties. Two of these are from the [[Foot Guards]] of the [[Household Division]], and one (since 1996) is a [[line infantry]] battalion. The former are normally based at [[Wellington Barracks, London|Wellington Barracks]] in central [[London]], within a short distance of [[Buckingham Palace]], and at [[Victoria Barracks, Windsor|Victoria Barracks]] in [[Windsor Castle]], while the latter is at the [[Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow]]. Permanent Public Duties [[Guards Incremental Companies|companies]] of the [[Foot Guards]] also supplement these men.

Apart from providing the [[Queen's Guard]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[St James's Palace]], and the [[Tower of London]] Guard, the Public Duties battalions occasionally also provide the [[Windsor Castle]] Guard, which is otherwise provided by the battalion based at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. From 1783 to 1973, the Guards provided a nightly detachment called the [[Bank Picquet]] for guard duty at the [[Bank of England]].

===Edinburgh===
Public duties are also carried out in [[Edinburgh]], although not as frequently as in London. Prior to 2002, sentries were permanently stationed at the entrance to [[Edinburgh Castle]], but these were withdrawn due to cost-cutting measures. Today, sentries are posted during the evenings between 6 pm and 9 am, and throughout the week that HM The Queen spends in Edinburgh at both the castle and the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]]. Sentries are also posted at the castle during the month of the [[Edinburgh Military Tattoo]] prior to each performance, with the regiment forming a [[guard of honour]] at the end of each performance.

Unlike in London, there is no permanently based foot guards battalion stationed in Edinburgh, so public duties are performed by one of the resident line infantry/rifles battalions. However, as part of the [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]] plan, the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Balaklava Company]] of the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]] will be reduced to a single incremental company to be based permanently in Scotland for public duties.

==Canada==
Public duties are performed in [[Ottawa]], the capital of [[Canada]]. The primary ceremonial duties involve mounting guard at the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]] and at [[Rideau Hall]], the official residence of the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]. These are performed primarily by the two Canadian regiments of foot guards (the Governor General's Foot Guards/Ottawa, and the Canadian Grenadier Guards/Montreal), detachments of which are formed into the [[Ceremonial Guard]]. However, as in London, it is possible that any Canadian regiment could serve in this capacity on authority of the Chief of Defence Staff. The guard at Parliament Hill and Rideau Hall are mounted daily from early June until late August, with the first parade usually on the Friday before [[Canada Day]]. The [[Governor General's Foot Guards]], a Canadian Primary Reserve Unit, have often been called upon to perform additional public duties in Ottawa since their inception in 1872. Recently, the Ceremonial Guard has also been tasked to mount sentries on the Cenotaph, at Elgin and Wellington St.

==United States==
===Washington, D.C.===
Probably the best-known U.S. military unit to regularly engage in public duties is the [[3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment]] ("The Old Guard") of the [[U.S. Army]]. Since April 6, 1948, the regiment is tasked with perpetually guarding the [[Tomb of the Unknowns]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. The regiment also regularly takes part in [[White House]] ceremonies, including at [[state visit]]s.

The other U.S. military services have their own ceremonial units.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3539">The job of the '''public editor''' is to supervise the implementation of proper [[journalism ethics]] at a newspaper, and to identify and examine critical errors or omissions, and to act as a liaison to the public. They do this primarily through a regular feature on a newspaper's [[editorial]] page. Because public editors are generally employees of the very newspaper they're criticizing, it may appear as though there is a possibility for bias. However, a newspaper with a high standard of ethics would not fire a public editor for a criticism of the paper; the act would contradict the purpose of the position and would itself be a very likely cause for public concern.

Many major newspapers in the U.S. use the public editor column as the voice for their [[Ombudsman#News ombudsman|ombudsman]], though this is not always so. Public editor columns cover a broader scope of issues and do not have an accreditation process, while in order to qualify as an ombudsman of any standing one must be a member of the [[Organisation of News Ombudsmen]].

The first newspaper to appoint an ombudsman was Tokyo's ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' in 1922; the first American newspapers to appoint a public editor were the ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' and ''[[Louisville Times]]'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Ananny, "It’s time to reimagine the role of a public editor, starting at The New York Times," Nieman Lab, March 17, 2016, Neiman Foundation at Harvard, URL=http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/03/mike-ananny-its-time-to-reimagine-the-role-of-a-public-editor-starting-at-the-new-york-times/&lt;/ref&gt;

At ''[[The New York Times]]'', the position was created in response to the [[Jayson Blair#Plagiarism and fabrication scandal|Jayson Blair scandal]]. The ''Times''' first public editor was [[Daniel Okrent]], who held the position from December 2003 through May 2005.  Okrent's successor was [[Byron Calame]], who was followed by [[Clark Hoyt]], who held the position for three years. In August 2010, [[Arthur S. Brisbane]] assumed the post and held it until 2012, when [[Margaret M. Sullivan]] took the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/times-names-buffalo-news-editor-as-its-new-public-editor/|title=Times Names Buffalo News Editor as Its New Public Editor|last=Vega|first=Tanzina|date=16 July 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April, 2016, Sullivan left the position to become a media columnist at the ''[[Washington Post]]''; her last column for the ''Times'' was dated April 16.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Sullivan, "Public Editor No. 5 Is Yesterday’s News," The New York Times, April 16, 2016, URL=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/public-editor/margaret-sullivan-new-york-times-public-editor.html&lt;/ref&gt;  She was replaced by [[Elizabeth Spayd]] in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Ember, "New York Times Names Elizabeth Spayd Its 6th Public Editor", The New York Times, May 18, 2016, URL=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/business/media/new-york-times-names-elizabeth-spayd-its-6th-public-editor.html&lt;/ref&gt;
On May 31, 2017, the ''Times'' announced that it was eliminating the public editor position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/business/media/new-york-times-buyouts.html |title=New York Times Will Offer Employee Buyouts and Eliminate Public Editor Role |work=The New York Times |date= |accessdate=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6884">'''Public philosophy''' is a label used for at least two separate philosophical projects. One project often called "public philosophy" is to address issues of public importance through philosophy, especially in the areas of [[public policy]], [[morality]] and [[social issues]].{{cn|date=June 2017}} In this conception, public philosophy is a matter of content, not style.{{cn|date=June 2017}} It must concern certain philosophical issues, but may be undertaken in any venue.{{cn|date=June 2017}}   The second project often called public philosophy is to engage in philosophy in public venues. This view  is exemplified by the ''Essays in Philosophy'' special issue on public philosophy (Vol 15, issue 1, 2014), which defined public philosophy as "doing philosophy with general audiences in a non-academic setting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = Jack Russell | year = 2014 | title = Public Philosophy: Introduction | url = | journal = Essays in Philosophy | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 1–4 | doi = 10.7710/1526-0569.1485 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public philosophy, in this conception, is a matter of style not content. It must be undertaken in a public venue but might deal with any philosophical issue. 

Some public philosophers are academic professionals, but others may work outside of the usual academic contexts of teaching and writing for [[peer-reviewed journals]].

==Perspectives==
According to one of the founders of the Public Philosophy Network, Sharon Meagher, “'public philosophy' is not simply a matter of doing philosophy in public. A truly public philosophy is one that demands that the
philosopher both become a student of community knowledge and reflect on his or her public engagement, recognizing that philosophy can benefit at as much from public contact as can the public benefit from contact with philosophy. The publicly engaged philosopher does not assume that he or she knows the questions in advance, but draws on his or her experiences in the community to
develop and frame questions. Further, publicly engaged philosophy demands accountability on the part of the philosopher to his or her publics—understanding that philosophers are themselves members of those publics."&lt;ref&gt;http://api.ning.com/files/C*75Xw4bA4cU7vHOHS-zlLRmkdBskXa9IzuVBCJKtjhmSgMrQy8tWTu1s9vqumPuG2gyJfaPzwWJ1Tu4*NoJIUVYUXtPpC37/KetteringreportfinalcorrectedFeb2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who hold the alternative view, that public philosophy is simply philosophy undertaken in public venues, are engaged in two projects. One of these is to educate the public and the other to engage with the public collaboratively to identify and address public problems. The second approach is often inspired by  [[John Dewey]]'s work on democracy and the need to reconstruct philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See part two of Volume I of The Essential Dewey: Pragmatism, Education, Democracy edited by Larry A Hickman and Thomas M. Alexander, Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The two approaches are not exclusive. For instance, John Pace Dewey, philosopher [[Michael J. Sandel]] describes public philosophy as having two aspects. The first is to "find in the political and legal controversies of our day an occasion for philosophy". The second is "to bring moral and political philosophy to bear on contemporary public discourse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael J. |last=Sandel |authorlink=Michael J. Sandel |title=Public Philosophy: Essays on Morality in Politics |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2005 |isbn=0-674-01928-8 |oclc=60321410 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]] says, "The role of a public philosophy is to address public affairs", but this "can be done in many different ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Tully |authorlink=James Tully (philosopher) |title=Public Philosophy in a New Key: Volume 1, Democracy and Civic Freedom |series=Ideas in Context series |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0-521-44961-8 |oclc=316855971 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tully's approach emphasizes ''practice'' through the contestable concepts of citizenship, civic freedom, and nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]], especially Chapter 9 "On local and global citizenship: an apprenticeship manual," ''Public Philosophy in a New Key, Volume II: Imperialism and Civic Freedom''. Ideas in Context series. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. pp. 243-309.&lt;/ref&gt; Public philosophy, in some conceptions, is a matter of content rather than style. Public philosophy, in this sense, need not be undertaken in a public venue but must deal with a particular subset of philosophical problems.

==Public philosophers==
The American Philosophical Association created a Committee on Public Philosophy in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apaonline.org/members/group.aspx?id=110441&lt;/ref&gt; Also the Public Philosophy Network has been holding conferences once every two years on advancing public philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;http://publicphilosophynetwork.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of individuals have been identified, either by themselves or others, as public philosophers. These include academics such as [[Cornel West]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], [[Richard Rorty]],&lt;ref name="posner"&gt;{{cite book |title=Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline |first=Richard A. |last=Posner |authorlink=Richard Posner |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2003 |isbn=0-674-01246-1 |oclc=491547976 |edition=paperback |pages=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]], and non-academics such as social activist [[Jane Addams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/addams-jane/ |title=Jane Addams |last=Hamington |first=Maurice |editor-first=Edward N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2798">'''Public reason''' refers to a common mode of deliberation that individuals may use for issues of public concern.  The concept implicitly excludes certain assumptions or motivations that are considered improper as a basis for public decision making, even as a person may apply them in personal decisions that do not have a significant impact on the public.  

==Immanuel Kant==
The phrase "public use of one's reason" (''Vernunft in allen Stükken öffentlichen Gebrauch'') was used by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his 1784 editorial piece responding to the question "[[What is Enlightenment?]]," where he distinguished it from private usage of reason, by which he meant reasoning offered from a specific civic office or post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kant's "What Is Enlightenment"|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~mgamer/Etexts/kant.html|work=An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?|accessdate=9 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125160840/http://www.english.upenn.edu/~mgamer/Etexts/kant.html|archivedate=25 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was developed by American philosopher [[John Rawls]] to refer to the common reason of all citizens in a [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] [[society]]. Public reason giving, in the Rawlsian sense, involves justifying a particular position by way of reasons that people of different moral or political backgrounds could accept. Although in his later writings he added what is known as the proviso, meaning that non-public reasons could be given assuming that public reasons would be provided in due course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawls|first=John|title=The Idea of Public Reason Revisited|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|year=1997|volume=64|pages=765–807|doi=10.2307/1600311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to accomplish this, however, one must overcome what he refers to as the burdens of judgment, which can produce disagreement among reasonable citizens. These burdens include conflicting evidence, giving differing weights to considerations, conceptual indeterminacy, differing experiences and value conflicts. Private reason, by contrast, is the exercise of an individual's reason to the constrained norms and interests of some sub-set of the public as a whole (such as a business, a political party, the military or the family).

A solid red flag, signifying the ship’s intent to engage in combat with a Spanish galleon (left ship), flies at the Dutch warship's [[stern]] (right ship).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/dam/ngaweb/collection/artobject/156252/versions/2014-04-24_artobject_156252.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Naval Encounter |author=Cornelius Verbeeck |website=Nga.gov |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The term '''''red flag''''' could mean either a literal [[flag]] used for signaling or, as a [[metaphor]], a sign of some particular problem requiring attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.word.com/idictionary/red%20flag |title=Red Flag &amp;#124; Definition of Red Flag by Merriam-Webster |website=I.word.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest citation for "red flag" in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is from 1602 and shows that at that time the flag was used by military forces to indicate that they were preparing for battle.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;'''1602''' [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]], ''Satiromastix'', ''Wks.'' 1873 I. 233 ″What, dost summon a parlie, my little Drumsticke? tis too late: thou seest my red flag is hung out.″&lt;br&gt;'''1666''' ''Lond. Gaz.'' No. 91/4 ″That the Red Flag was out, both Fleets in sight of each other, expecting every hour fit weather to Engage.″&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest citation of "red flag" in the sense of a warning is dated 1777 and refers to a flag warning of flood.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;'''1777''' [[Philip Thicknesse]], ''Year's Journey'' I. iii. 23 There is a red flag hoisted gradually higher and higher, as the water flows into the harbour [at Calais].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term and the expression "to raise the [[red]] flag" come from various usages of real [[flag]]s throughout history. The [[Railway signal#Mechanical signals|semaphore]] red flag (or red light) on railways means an immediate stop, while a red flag is frequently flown by armed forces to warn the public of live fire exercises in progress, and is sometimes flown by ships carrying munitions (in this context it is actually the flag for the letter B in the [[International maritime signal flags|International maritime signal flag alphabet]], a red [[swallowtail (flag)|swallow-tailed flag]]). In many countries a red flag is flown to signify that an outdoor [[shooting range]] is in use. The [[United States Air Force]] refers to its largest annual [[military exercise|exercise]] as [[Red Flag (USAF)|red flag]] operation. Red flags are used for various signals in team sailing races (see [[Racing Rules of Sailing]]). A [[red flag warning]] is a signal of high [[wildfire]] danger and a red flag on the beach warns of dangerous water conditions (double red flags indicate beach closure). Red flags of various designs indicate dangerous wind and wave conditions for mariners. In auto racing, a red flag indicates a stop to the race due to dangerous conditions.

A signal of [[Risk|danger]] or a problem can be referred to as a red flag, a usage that originated in the 18th century. The term "red flag" is used, e.g., during screening of communications, and refers to specific words or phrases encountered that might indicate relevance to the case. For example, email [[spam filter]]s make use of such "red flags".

'''Robert David Putnam'''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʌ|t|n|ə|m}}.}} (born 1941) is an American political scientist. He is the Peter and Isabel Malkin Professor of Public Policy at the [[Harvard University]] [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]. Putnam developed the influential [[two-level game theory]] that assumes [[international agreement]]s will only be successfully brokered if they also result in domestic benefits. His most famous (and controversial) work, ''[[Bowling Alone]]'', argues that the [[United States]] has undergone an unprecedented collapse in civic, social, associational, and political life ([[social capital]]) since the 1960s, with serious negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Parry, "Can Robert Putnam Save the American Dream" ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', March 12, 2015 [http://chronicle.com/article/Can-Robert-Putnam-Save-the/228443/  Chronicle Review]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he co-published an article in which he noted that the trend had moved the other way; he continued to advocate a push towards more social capital but he felt his famous thesis ("Americans are now bowling alone") was no longer true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Still Bowling Alone? The Post-9/11 Split|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/ocpa/pdf/still%20bowling%20alone.pdf|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, he published a book called ''Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis'' that looked at issues of inequality of opportunity in the [[US]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release on book release|url=http://robertdputnam.com/about-our-kids/press-release/|website=robertdputnam.com|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Robert David Putnam was born on January 9, 1941, in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref name=Tervetuloa&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert D.

An outstanding student, he won a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Fellowship]] to study at [[Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and went on to earn [[Master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate]] degrees from [[Yale University]], the latter in 1970. He taught at the [[University of Michigan]] until joining the faculty at Harvard in 1979, where he has held a variety of positions, including Dean of the Kennedy School, and is currently the [[Malkin Professor of Public Policy]]. Putnam was raised as a religiously observant [[Methodist]]. In 1963, Putnam married his wife Rosemary, a special education teacher and [[French horn]] player.&lt;ref name=NYT82212 /&gt; Around the time of his marriage, he [[Convert to Judaism|converted to Judaism]], his wife's religion.&lt;ref&gt;The Forward, [http://www.forward.com/articles/133047 Robert Putnam Assays Religious Tolerance From a Unique Angle], Retrieved November 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Making Democracy Work''==
His first work in the area of [[social capital]] was ''[[Making Democracy Work|Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy]]'', a comparative study of regional governments in Italy which drew great scholarly attention for its argument that the success of democracies depends in large part on the horizontal bonds that make up social capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert D. |last1=Putnam |year=1994 |title=[[Making Democracy Work|Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy]] |isbn=978-0-691-03738-7 }}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam writes that northern Italy's history of community, guilds, clubs, and choral societies led to greater civic involvement and greater economic prosperity.&lt;ref name=Putnam1993&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ncr.4100820204 |title=What Makes Democracy Work? |journal=National Civic Review |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=101–107 |year=1993 |last1=Putnam |first1=Robert D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the agrarian society of Southern Italy is less prosperous economically and democratically because of less social capital. Social capital, which Putnam defines as "networks and norms of civic engagement", allows members of a community to trust one another.&lt;ref name=Putnam1993/&gt; When community members trust one another, trade, money-lending, and democracy flourish.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==''Bowling Alone''==
{{BLP sources section|date=October 2015}}
In 1995 he published "Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital" in the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]''. The article was widely read and garnered much attention for Putnam, including an invitation to meet with then-President [[Bill Clinton]] and a spot in the pages of ''[[People magazine|People]]''. Some critics argued that Putnam was ignoring new organizations and forms of social capital; others{{who|date= October 2017}} argued that many of the included organizations were responsible for the suppression of civil rights movements and the reinforcement of anti-egalitarian social norms. Over the last decade and a half, the United States had seen an increase in bowlers but a decrease in bowling leagues.

In 2000, he published ''[[Bowling Alone|Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community]]'', a book-length expansion of the original argument, adding new evidence and answering many of his critics. Though he measured the decline of social capital with data of many varieties, his most striking point was that many traditional civic, social and fraternal organizations&amp;nbsp;– typified by [[bowling league]]s&amp;nbsp;– had undergone a massive decline in membership while the number of people bowling had increased dramatically.

Putnam makes a distinction between two kinds of social capital: bonding capital and bridging capital. Bonding occurs when you are socializing with people who are like you: same age, same race, same religion, and so on. But in order to create peaceful societies in a diverse multi-ethnic country, one needs to have a second kind of social capital: bridging. Bridging is what you do when you make friends with people who are not like you, like supporters of another football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Putnam|first1=Robert D.|title=Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community|date=2001|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York|isbn=0743203046|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam argues that those two kinds of social capital, bonding and bridging, do strengthen each other. Consequently, with the decline of the bonding capital mentioned above inevitably comes the decline of the bridging capital leading to greater ethnic tensions.

In 2016, Putnam explained his inspiration for the book, by saying,
{{quote|We've [Americans] been able to run a different kind of society. A less statist society, a more free-market society, because we had real strength in the area of social capital and we had relatively high levels of social trust. We sort of did trust one another, not perfectly, of course, but we did. Not compared to other countries. And all that is declining, and I began to worry, "Well, gee, isn't that going to be a problem, if our system is built for one kind of people and one kind of community, and now we've got a different one. Maybe it's not going to work so well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/robert-d-putnam/|title=Robert D. Putnam on Conversations with Bill Kristol|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critics such as the sociologist [[Claude Fischer]] argue that (a) Putnam concentrates on organizational forms of social capital, and pays much less attention to networks of interpersonal social capital; (b) Putnam neglects the emergence of new forms of supportive organizations on and off the Internet; and (c) the 1960s are a misleading baseline because the era had an unusually high number of traditional organizations.

Since the publication of ''Bowling Alone'', Putnam has worked on efforts to revive American social capital, notably through the [[Saguaro Seminar]], a series of meetings among academics, civil society leaders, commentators, and politicians to discuss strategies to re-connect Americans with their communities. These resulted in the publication of the book and website, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060714080329/http://www.bettertogether.org/ Better Together],'' which provides case studies of vibrant and new forms of social capital building in the United States

== Social capital ==
Putnam theorizes a relation in the negatives trends in society. He envisions a uniting factor named [[social capital]]; originally coined by social theorist [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Alexis deToqueville]] as a strength within America allowing democracy to thrive due to the closeness of society, "trends in civic engagement of a wider sort".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Robert D.|date=1995|title=Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital|url=|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam observes a declining trend in social capital since the 1960s. The decreasing in social capital is blamed for rising rates in unhappiness as well as political apathy. Low social capital, a feeling of alienation within society is associated with additional consequences such as:

* Lower confidence in local government, local leaders and the local news media.
* Lower political efficacy – that is, confidence in one's own influence.
* Lower frequency of registering to vote, but more interest and knowledge about politics and more participation in protest marches and social reform groups.
* Higher political advocacy, but lower expectations that it will bring about a desirable result.
* Less expectation that others will cooperate to solve dilemmas of [[collective action]] (e.g., voluntary conservation to ease a water or energy shortage).
* Less likelihood of working on a community project.
* Less likelihood of giving to charity or volunteering.
* Fewer close friends and confidants.
* Less happiness and lower perceived quality of life.
* More time spent watching [[television]] and more agreement that "television is my most important form of entertainment".

==Diversity and trust within communities==
In recent years, Putnam has been engaged in a comprehensive study of the relationship between [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] within communities and their ethnic diversity. His conclusion based on over 40 cases and 30,000 people within the United States is that in the short term, other things being equal, ''more'' diversity in a community is associated with ''less'' trust both among and within ethnic groups. Putnam describes people of all races, sex, socioeconomic statuses, and ages as "hunkering down", avoiding engagement with their local community as diversity increases. Although limited to American data, his findings run counter the [[contact hypothesis]] which proposes that distrust declines as members of different ethnic groups interact, and [[conflict theory]] which suggests that while distrust ''among'' ethnic groups rises with diversity, distrust ''within'' ethnic groups should decrease. Putnam found that even when controlling for income inequality and crime rates, two factors which [[conflict theory]] states should be prime causal factors in declining inter-ethnic group trust, more diversity is still associated with less communal trust. Further, he found that low communal trust is associated with the same consequences as low social capital. Putnam says, however, that "in the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural, economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Putnam published his data set from this study in 2001&lt;ref name="Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, 2000"&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221143809/http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/data_access/data/datasets/social_capital_community_survey.html#.UDTTcnCUpME|archive-date=February 21, 2015|url=http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/data_access/data/datasets/social_capital_community_survey.html#.UDTTcnCUpME |work=Public Opinion Archives|publisher=[[Roper Center for Public Opinion Research]]|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hendrix | first=Anastasia | title=Fewer In S.F.

Putnam has been criticized for the lag between his initial study and his publication of his article. In 2006, Putnam was quoted in the ''Financial Times'' as saying he had delayed publishing the article until he could "develop proposals to compensate for the negative effects of diversity" (quote from John Lloyd of Financial Times).&lt;ref name=FT10806&gt;{{cite news|last=Lloyd|first=John|title=Study paints bleak picture of ethnic diversity|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c4ac4a74-570f-11db-9110-0000779e2340.html#axzz24HMFQrIc|accessdate=August 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times|The Financial Times]]  |date=October 8, 2006|location=London | publisher = [[The Nikkei]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, writing in ''City Journal'', [[John Leo]] questioned whether this suppression of publication was ethical behavior for a scholar, noting that "Academics aren't supposed to withhold negative data until they can suggest antidotes to their findings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Leo | first = John | author-link = John Leo | title = Bowling with our own |url = http://www.city-journal.org/html/eon2007-06-25jl.html | work = [[City Journal (New York City)|City Journal]] | publisher = [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]] | date = June 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Putnam did release the data in 2001 and publicized this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/saguaro/communitysurvey/results3.html|title=The Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey|website=www.ksg.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putnam denied allegations he was arguing against diversity in society and contended that his paper had been "twisted" to make a case against race-conscious admissions to universities. He asserted that his "extensive research and experience confirm the substantial benefits of diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity, to our society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Berlett | first = Tom | title=Harvard Sociologist Says His Research Was 'Twisted' | url = https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/robert-putnam-says-his-research-was-twisted/30357 | work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | publisher =  | date = August 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 he briefly met Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] to discuss the role of civil society in the Libyan political context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Putnam | first = Robert D. | title=With Libya's Megalomaniac 'Philosopher-King' | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703408604576164363053350664 | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | publisher = [[News Corp]] | date = February 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Plimsoll''' (10 February 1824 – 3 June 1898) was an English                                          politician and social reformer, now best remembered for having devised the [[Plimsoll line]] (a line on a ship's hull indicating the maximum safe draft, and therefore the minimum [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] for the vessel in various operating conditions).

==Early life==
Samuel Plimsoll was born in [[Bristol]] and soon moved to [[Whiteley Wood Hall]], [[Sheffield]], also spending part of his childhood in [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith, Cumberland]].  Leaving school at an early age, he became a clerk at Rawson's Brewery, and rose to be manager.

In 1853, he attempted to become a coal merchant in London. 
He failed and was reduced to destitution. 
He himself told how for a time he lived in a common lodging for seven shillings and two pence a week.

Through this experience, he learnt to sympathise with the struggles of the poor, and when his good fortune returned, he resolved to devote his time to improving their condition.

His efforts were directed especially against what were known as "[[coffin ship (insurance)|coffin ships]]": unseaworthy and overloaded vessels, often heavily insured, in which unscrupulous owners risked the lives of their crews.

==Political career==
In 1867, Plimsoll was elected as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament for [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]], and endeavoured in vain to pass a bill dealing with the subject of a safe load line on ships. The main problem was the number of powerful ship-owning MPs in Parliament.

In 1872, he published a work entitled ''Our Seamen'', which became well known throughout the country.  Accordingly, on Plimsoll's motion in 1873, a Royal Commission was appointed, and in 1875 a government bill was introduced, which Plimsoll, though regarding it as inadequate, resolved to accept.

On 22 July, the Prime Minister, [[Benjamin Disraeli]], announced that the bill would be dropped. Plimsoll lost his self-control, applied the term "villains" to members of the House, and shook his fist in the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]]'s face.&lt;ref&gt;http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1875/jul/22/parliament-breach-of-order-mr-plimsoll&lt;/ref&gt;

Disraeli moved that he be reprimanded, but on the suggestion of [[Spencer Compton Cavendish|Lord Hartington]] agreed to adjourn the matter for a week to allow Plimsoll time for thought.
[[Image:load line.jpg|thumb|right|Load Line Mark and Lines and Timber Load Line Mark and Lines for power driven merchant vessels]]
Eventually Plimsoll made an apology. Many people, however, shared his view that the bill had been stifled by the pressure of the shipowners, and popular feeling forced the government to pass a bill which in the following year was amended into the Merchant Shipping Act.
[[Image:Memorial To Samuel Plimsoll.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Memorial to Samuel Plimsoll on [[Victoria Embankment]], London]]
This gave stringent powers of inspection to the [[Board of Trade]], and the mark that indicates the safe limit to which a ship may be loaded became generally known as [[Waterline|Plimsoll's mark or line]].

Plimsoll was re-elected for Derby at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|general election of 1880]] by a great majority, but gave up his seat to [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Vernon Harcourt]], believing that the latter, as Home Secretary, could advance sailors' interests more effectively than any private member.

Offered a seat by 30 constituencies, Plimsoll was an unsuccessful candidate in [[Sheffield Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Central]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885]]. He did not re-enter the house, and later became estranged from the Liberal leaders by what he regarded as their breach of faith in neglecting the question of shipping reform.

He was for some years the honorary president of the [[National Union of Seamen|National Sailors' and Firemen's Union]], and drew attention to the horrors of the cattle-ships, where animals were transported under appalling and over-crowded conditions.

==Later life==
Later, he visited the United States to try to secure the adoption of a less bitter tone towards England in the historical textbooks used in American schools. 
He died in [[Folkestone]] on 3 June 1898, and is buried in St Martin's churchyard, [[Cheriton, Kent]].

==Family==
Plimsoll married his first wife, Eliza Ann, daughter of Hugh Railton of [[Chapeltown, Sheffield|Chapeltown]], near [[Sheffield]], in 1858. In Census 1871 they were enumerated in Hastings where Eliza Ann is recorded as being blind in her right eye and deaf in her left ear. She died in Australia in 1882. There were no children by this marriage. He married his second wife, Harriet Frankish, daughter of Mr. Joseph Armitage Wade, J.P., of Hull and [[Hornsea]], in 1885. By this marriage there were six children, of whom a son, Samuel Richard Cobden Plimsoll, and two daughters survived him.{{sfn|Orme|1901}}

==Legacy==
[[File:Samuel Plimsoll (1824-1898) RMG BHC2956.tiff|thumb|right|Posthumous portrait of Plimsoll, executed by [[Reginald Henry Campbell]] in the late 19th century]]
In 1873, the '''''Samuel Plimsoll''''', an iron hulled full-rigged merchant sailing ship, was launched at the shipyard of Walter Hood &amp; Co. in Aberdeen, Scotland for the Aberdeen White Star Line (G. Thompson &amp; Co.).  She was assigned the official British Reg. No. 65097 and the signal MKDH.  In 1899, she caught fire in the [[Thames River]] and had to be scuttled, but was refloated and repaired in 1900.  In 1902, she was severely dismasted and damaged on voyage to Port Chalmers, Australia. Towed to Sydney and subsequently to Fremantle, she was reduced to hulk status the following year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Ships/Merchant/Sail/S/Samuel_Plimsoll(1873).html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.pacific.net.au/~hannahhome/ships/samuelplimsoll.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821134521/http://home.pacific.net.au/~hannahhome/ships/samuelplimsoll.html |archivedate=21 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, [[Plimsoll shoe]]s were named for their similarity in appearance to the Plimsoll line on boats.

In Whitehall Garden, a Victoria Embankment garden, there is a monument to Samuel Plimsoll in front of the railings.

British writer [[Nicolette Jones]] published ''The Plimsoll Sensation'', a highly acclaimed biography – getting the idea for it from living in 1995 in Plimsoll Road in [[Finsbury Park]], north London, but knowing hardly anything about whom it was named after.

Samuel Plimsoll appears in the third series of the BBC historical television drama ''[[The Onedin Line]]'', portrayed by actor David Garfield.

'''School violence''' encompasses physical violence, including student-on-student fighting and [[corporal punishment]]; [[Psychological abuse|psychological violence]], including verbal abuse; [[sexual violence]], including rape and sexual harassment; many forms of [[bullying]], including [[cyberbullying]]; and carrying weapons in school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246970e.pdf|title=School Violence and Bullying: Global Status Report|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100197-0|location=|pages=9, 110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely held to have become a serious problem in recent decades in many countries, especially where weapons such as guns or knives are involved. It includes [[violence]] between school students as well as  physical attacks by students on school staff.

==Risk factors==

===Internalizing and externalizing behaviors===

A distinction is made between internalizing and externalizing behavior. Internalizing behaviors reflect withdrawal, inhibition, anxiety, and/or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Internalizing behavior has been found in some cases of youth violence although in some youth, depression is associated with substance abuse. Because they rarely act out, students with internalizing problems are often overlooked by school personnel.&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;Christie, C.A., Nelson, C.M., &amp; Jolivet, K. (2005). [http://www.edjj.org/focus/prevention/plr.pdf ''Prevention of antisocial and violent behavior in youth: A review of the literature''.] Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky. Retrieved 2009-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Externalizing behaviors refer to delinquent activities, aggression, and hyperactivity. Unlike internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors include, or are directly linked to, violent episodes. Violent behaviors such as punching and kicking are often learned from observing others.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1983). Psychological mechanisms of aggression. In R. G. Geen &amp; E. I. Donnerstein (Eds.), ''Aggression: Theoretical and empirical reviews''. New York: Academic. {{ISBN|0-12-278801-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="akers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akers | first1 = R.

===Other individual factors===

A number of other individual factors are associated with higher levels of aggressiveness. Compared to children whose antisocial conduct begins in adolescence, early starters have a worse prognosis in terms of future aggression and other antisocial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0954579498001734 | last1 = Patterson | first1 = G.

Gerald Patterson's social interactional model, which involves the mother's application and the child's counterapplication of ''coercive'' behaviors, also explains the development of aggressive conduct in the child.&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;Patterson, G.

==Prevention and intervention==
The goal of prevention and intervention strategies is to stop school violence from occurring. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], there are at least four levels at which violence-prevention programs can act: at the level of society in general, the school community, the family, and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**The implementation of ''school-wide early-warning systems'', the school equivalent of a [[Distant Early Warning Line|DEW Line]]-like surveillance operation designed to "prevent the worst cases of school violence," has been problematic.&lt;ref name="Schon"/&gt; Recent developments in early threat assessment, however, show promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15388220.2010.519432 | pmid = | title = Development, Evaluation, and Future Directions of the Virginia Student Threat Assessment Guidelines | year = 2011 | last1 = Cornell | first1 = Dewey | last2 = Allen | first2 = Korrie | journal = [[Journal of School Violence]] | volume = 10 | pages = 88–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence-prevention efforts can also be usefully directed at developing anti-bullying programs, helping teachers with classroom-management strategies, applying behavioral strategies such as the Good Behavior Game, implementing curricular innovations such as the Second Step syllabus, developing programs to strengthen families (see below), and implementing programs aimed at enhancing the social and academic skills of at-risk students (see below).
* Teachers are the professional group who works directly where school bullying takes place and who spends the most time with both bullies, victims and bystanders. Thus, whether and how teachers intervene in the case of bullying is of great importance. Research has shown that teachers prefer authority-based interventions towards bullies but seem to neglect to support the victims.&lt;ref name="Burger 2015 191–202"&gt;{{cite journal| last       = Burger| first      = Christoph| last2      = Strohmeier| first2     = Dagmar| last3      = Spröber| first3     = Nina| last4      = Bauman| first4     = Sheri| last5      = Rigby| first5     = Ken| date       = 2015| title      = How teachers respond to school bullying: An examination of self-reported intervention strategy use, moderator effects, and concurrent use of multiple strategies.| url        = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004| journal    = Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=51| pages      = 191–202| doi        = 10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, most teacher training curricula do not include preventive and interventive skills regarding school violence.&lt;ref name="Burger 2015 191–202"/&gt;

== Challenges in measuring violence in schools ==
Research on violence affecting children in schools is challenging for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methodological issues ===
When trying to measure the scope of violence in schools and to find out about the types of violence experienced by students, some key issues include: from what categories of the school community to collect the data; what data should be collected from each categories; and using which methods. For example, should there be studies or surveys where researchers ask students directly about violence in school, through self-reports about the violence they experienced as targets or perpetrators? Or should they be asked about incidents of violence that they have witnessed as bystanders? Should any of these questions be asked via self-administered questionnaires or questionnaires administered by researchers in schools? Does it make more sense to collect this data outside of schools, for example, through household surveys? Or through online surveys where students have access to the internet? Or is it better to rely on mechanisms for reporting incidents of violence in educational institutions when they are available, either in the schools themselves or outside schools (governmental hotlines, internet-based reporting systems, police and justice sectors, etc.)? What questions can be asked of children, using terminology that is easy to understand, age-appropriate and culturally sensitive?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legal and ethical issues ===
In most countries there are strict rules related to research involving children, as they are under the age of consent. Therefore, requesting informed consent from the children in a study involves their parents and guardians. Asking children about violence, and particularly violence they have experienced themselves, can be traumatic. Finally, researching [[Education and the LGBT community|issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/orientation in education]] and in relation to children has additional challenges. In some contexts it is not legal to discuss these issues either in schools or even outside of schools. Where it is legal, it may be considered as a very sensitive topic to be discussed with children and young people. Asking children and young people questions related to their sexual orientation and gender identity in the school setting is ethically questionable, as it could embarrass them and expose them to stigma and discrimination, unless questions are asked in strict confidence and anonymity is granted by independent researchers external to schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, 3rd Baronet''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GCMG|DL}} (26 January 1837 – 28 October 1915), commonly referred to as "Sir Fowell Buxton",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45333289 |title=Sir Fowell Bixton Ill. |newspaper=[[The Barrier Miner]] |location=Broken Hill, NSW |date=28 October 1915 |accessdate=4 November 2011 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}
&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Governor of South Australia]] from 29 October 1895 until 29 March 1899. He was the grandson of [[Sir Thomas Buxton, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton]], a British MP and social reformer, and the son of [[Sir Edward Buxton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Edward North Buxton]], also an MP.

He attended [[Harrow School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id= BKSN854TF|name=Buxton, Thomas Fowell}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Lady [[Lady Victoria Buxton|Victoria Noel]] on 12 June 1862 and they had a total of 13 children, ten surviving infancy. She was crippled by a spinal condition in 1869.

He was elected as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)|King's Lynn]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1865|1865 general election]], but was defeated at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1868|1868 election]].&lt;ref name="craig1832-1885"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his defeat, he stood again for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] unsuccessfully on several other occasions: in [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]] at the  [[United Kingdom general election, 1874|1874 general election]], in [[West Essex (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Essex]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 general election]] and at the by-elections in [[North Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|Northern Norfolk]] in 1876 and 1879.&lt;ref name="craig1832-1885" /&gt; He was appointed [[High Sheriff of Norfolk]] in 1876.

When Buxton was appointed governor, the [[Premier of South Australia]], [[Charles Kingston]] was angry that the South Australian government had not been involved in the decision about who should be the new governor, so made life as hard as possible for Buxton and his family. The governor's allowance was reduced and customs duty was charged on their household items (including his wife's invalid carriage). Buxton took up the job anyway, and later was described as the most genial, sociable and common-sense governor, due to his gentle and unassuming friendliness. He visited gaols and hospitals, and showed genuine interest in Aboriginal culture during his time as governor. He eventually returned to England due to the ill health of his wife.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography

Their second son, [[Noel Noel-Buxton, 1st Baron Noel-Buxton|Noel Buxton]] acted as [[aide-de-camp]] to his father as governor, and later was a [[human rights]] campaigner and British [[Member of Parliament]].

A memorial to Sir Thomas and his wife Victoria was erected in St Thomas' Church in [[Upshire]] in Essex in 1917, designed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]].&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer&lt;/ref&gt;

Constance Penley &amp; Andrew Ross, Technoculture Cultural Politics vol 3, U of Minnesota Press 1991&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the interactions between, and politics of, [[Technology and society|technology and culture]].

== Programs of study ==
"Technoculture" is used by a number of universities to describe subject areas or courses of study. [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]], for instance, has a program of technocultural studies. In 2012, the major merged with Film Studies to form Cinema and Techno-Cultural Studies (CaTS), but in 2013 is being reviewed to become Cinema and Technoculture (see below); the [[University of Western Ontario]] offers a degree in Media, Information and Technoculture (which they refer to as MIT, offering an "MIT BA").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fims.uwo.ca/mit/index.htm Media, Information &amp; Technoculture at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of California, Riverside|UC Riverside]] is in the process of creating a program in technocultural studies beginning with the creation of a graduate certificate program in "Science Fiction and Technoculture Studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UCTV|title=Science Fiction Goes to School!|url=http://myuctv.tv/2012/07/13/science-fiction-goes-to-school/|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its description, the Georgetown University course English/CCT 691&lt;ref&gt;CCT stands for "Communications, Culture and Technology"&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''Technoculture from Frankenstein to Cyberpunk'', covers the "social reception and representation of technology in literature and popular culture from the Romantic era to the present" and includes "all media, including film, TV, and recent video animation and Web 'zines." The course focuses "mainly on American culture and the way in which machines, computers, and the body have been imagined."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/technoculture/technoculture.html |accessdate=June 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217084240/http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/technoculture/technoculture.html |archivedate=February 17, 2006 |title=Technoculture from Frankenstein to Cyberpunk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UC Davis Technocultural Studies department focuses on "transdisciplinary approaches to artistic, cultural and scholarly production in contemporary media and digital arts, community media, and mutual concerns of the arts with the scientific and technological disciplines. In contrast to programs which see technology as the primary driving force, we place questions of poetics, aesthetics, history, politics and the environment at the core of our mission. In other words, we emphasize the 'culture' in Technoculture."

The Technocultural Studies major program is an interdisciplinary integration of current research in cultural history and theory with innovative hands-on production in digital media and "low-tech". It focuses on the fine and performing arts, media arts, community media, literature and cultural studies as they relate to technology and science. Backed by critical perspectives and the latest forms of research and production skills, students enjoy the mobility to explore individual research and expression, project-based collaboration and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/ucdwebcatalog/PDF/GenCat20102012.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111208135815/http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/UCDWebCatalog/PDF/GenCat20102012.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-12-08 |title=UC Davis General Catalogue 2010-2011 2011-2012 |date=July 2002 |accessdate=2011-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technocultural Studies is a fairly new major at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] and is considered a division of Humanities, Arts and Cultural Studies.

*Film Studies and Technocultural Studies majors at UC Davis have merged into Cinema and Technoculture. The faculty have been hard at work on developing this new major, and it is going through the review process.  Declared students will be grandfathered in to the existing programs to complete their major.  They will also have the option of switching to the new major if they choose.  The faculty of UC Davis believes these new additions will improve the program and hope their students take advantage of them.

'''Technoculture: An Online Journal of Technology in Society'' ({{ISSN|1938-0526}}) is an independent, interdisciplinary, annual peer-reviewed journal that publishes critical and creative works that explore the ways in which technology impacts society. It uses a broad definition of technology. Founded by Keith Dorwick and Kevin Moberly, it is now edited by Keith Dorwick. ''Technoculture'' is a member of the Council of Editors of Learned Journals and is indexed by EBSCOhost and the Modern Language Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tcjournal.org |title=''Technoculture: An Online Journal of Technology in Society.'' |date=2009–2011 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall McLuhan]] is most known for his concepts of a "[[Global village (term)|global village]]". In his book ''[[Understanding Media]]'' he talks about how media affects society and culture. He also develops a theory about technology being an extension of the body. According to McLuhan, the alphabet is what gave rise to the idea that sight is more important than hearing because in order to communicate one had to be able to see and understand the alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://marshallmcluhan.com/biography/ |title=Marshall Who? |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Technoculture: The Key Concepts'', Debra Benita Shaw "outlines the place of science and technology in today's culture" and "explores the power of scientific ideas, their impact on how we understand the natural world and how successive technological developments have influenced our attitudes to work, art, space, language and the human body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technoculture: The Key Concepts|first=Debra Benita|last=Shaw|year=2008|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-84520-298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" [[Walter Benjamin]] attempts to analyze the changed experience of art in modern society. He believes that a reproduction of art lacks presence in time and space and therefore has no aura. Original works of art do have an aura. An aura includes authority, its place in space and time (when it was made), how the piece's physical condition suffered and how it's changed owners over time. An original work of art derives its authenticity from history and what has happened to it over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|first=Walter|last=Benjamin|year=2010|publisher=Prism Key Press|isbn=1-4537-2248-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology dynamics''' is broad and relatively new scientific field that has been developed in the framework of the postwar [[science and technology studies]] field. It studies the process of [[technological change]]. Under the field of Technology Dynamics the process of technological change is explained by taking into account influences from "internal factors" as well as from "external factors". Internal factors relate technological change to unsolved technical problems and the established modes of solving technological problems and external factors relate it to various (changing) characteristics of the [[social environment]], in which a particular [[technology]] is embedded.

==Overview==

For the last three decades, it has been argued that [[technology development]] is neither an autonomous process, determined by the "inherent progress" of human history, nor a process completely determined by external conditions like the prices of the resources that are needed to operate (develop) a technology, as it is theorized in neoclassical economic thinking. In mainstream neoclassical economic thinking, technology is seen as an exogenous factor: at the moment a technology is required, the most appropriate version can be taken down from the shelf based on costs of labor, capital and eventually raw materials.

Conversely, modern technology dynamics studies generally advocate that technologies are not "self-evident" or market-demanded, but are the upshot of a particular path of technology development and are shaped by social, economic and political factors. in this sense, technology dynamics aims at overcoming distinct "internal" and "external" points of views by presenting co-evolutionary approach regarding technology development.

In general, technology dynamics studies, besides giving a "thick description" of technology development, uses constructivist viewpoints emphasizing that technology is the outcome of particular social context. Accordingly, Technology Dynamics emphasizes the significance and possibility of regaining [[social control]] of technology, and also provides mechanisms needed to adapt to and steer the development of certain technologies. In that respect, it uses insights from retrospective studies to formulate hypotheses of a prospective nature on technology development of emerging technologies, besides formulating prescriptive policy recommendations.

An important feature of relevant theories of technological change therein is that they underline the quasi-evolutionary character of technological change: change based on technological variation and social selection in which technological knowledge, systems and [[institutions]] develop in interaction with each other. Processes of 'path dependence' are crucial in explaining technological change.

Following these lines, there have been different approaches and concepts used under the field of technology dynamics.

==Different frameworks to analyze the dynamics of technology==
*[[Social construction of technology]]
*[[Actor–network theory]]
*[[Systems theory]]
*[[Normalization process theory]]
*Quasi-evolutionary theories
*[[Innovation system]]
*[[Technological innovation system]]

Based on the analysis of the various perspectives, one can aim at developing interventions in the dynamics of a technology. Some approaches have been developed targeting on interventions in technological change:

*[[Technology assessment]]
*[[Backcasting]]
*Strategic niche management 
*[[Transition management (governance)]]

[[Image:Tecnology Life Cycle.png|right|frame|The typical life-cycle of a manufacturing process or production system from the stages of its initial conception to its culmination as either a technique or procedure of common practice or to its demise. The Y-axis of the diagram shows the business gain to the proprietor of the technology while the X-axis traces its lifetime.]]

The '''technology life-cycle''' ('''TLC''') describes the commercial gain of a product through the expense of research and development phase, and the financial return during its "vital life". Some technologies, such as steel, paper or cement manufacturing, have a long lifespan (with minor variations in technology incorporated with time) while in other cases, such as electronic or pharmaceutical products, the lifespan may be quite short.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nInjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=The+technology+underlying+the+product+(for+example,+that+of+a+uniquely+flavoured+tea)+may+be+quite+marginal+but+the+process+of+creating+and+managing+its+life+as+a#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20technology%20underlying%20the%20product%20(for%20example%2C%20that%20of%20a%20uniquely%20flavoured%20tea)%20may%20be%20quite%20marginal%20but%20the%20process%20of%20creating%20and%20managing%20its%20life%20as%20a&amp;f=false|title=Proceedings of IAC-MEM 2015 in Vienna|last=group of authors|publisher=Czech Institute of Academic Education z.s., 2015|year=2015|isbn=9788090579156|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TLC associated with a product or technological service is different from product life-cycle (PLC) dealt with in [[product life-cycle management]]. The latter is concerned with the life of a product in the marketplace with respect to timing of introduction, marketing measures, and business costs. The ''technology'' underlying the product (for example, that of a uniquely flavoured tea) may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different. 

The technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology, the timeline of recovering cost, and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved. The TLC may, further, be protected during its cycle with [[patents]] and [[trademark]]s seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it.

The ''product'' of the technology may be a commodity such as [[polyethylene]] plastic or a sophisticated product like the [[integrated circuit]]s used in a [[smartphone]].

The development of a ''competitive product'' or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology, making it shorter. Equally, the loss of intellectual property rights through litigation or loss of its secret elements (if any) through leakages also work to reduce a technology's lifespan. Thus, it is apparent that the ''management'' of the TLC is an important aspect of technology development.

Most new technologies follow a similar technology maturity lifecycle describing the [[technological maturity]] of a product. This is not similar to a [[product life cycle management|product life cycle]], but applies to an entire technology, or a generation of a technology.

Technology adoption is the most common phenomenon driving the evolution of industries along the industry lifecycle. After expanding new uses of resources they end with exhausting the efficiency of those processes, producing gains that are first easier and larger over time then exhaustingly more difficult, as the [[mature technology|technology matures]].

==The four phases of the technology life-cycle==
The TLC may be seen as composed of four phases:
#The '''research and development  (R&amp;D)''' phase (sometimes called the "bleeding edge") when incomes from inputs are negative and where the prospects of failure are high 
#The '''ascent''' phase when out-of-pocket costs have been recovered and the technology begins to gather strength by going beyond some Point A on the TLC (sometimes called the "leading edge") 
#The '''maturity''' phase when gain is high and stable, the region, going into saturation, marked by M, and 
#The '''decline''' (or decay phase), after a Point D, of reducing fortunes and utility of the technology.

===S-curve===
The shape of the technology lifecycle is often referred to as S-curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.improvementandinnovation.com/features/article/understanding-s-curve-innovation/|accessdate=15 October 2012|title=Understanding S-curve Innovation|journal=Improvementandinnovation.com|author=Dr. Chandana Jayalath|date=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology perception dynamics==
There is usually [[technology hype]] at the introduction of any new technology, but only after some time has passed can it be judged as mere hype or justified true acclaim.
Because of the [[logistic curve]] nature of technology adoption, it is difficult to see in the early stages whether the hype is excessive.

The two errors commonly committed in the early stages of a technology's development are:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* fitting an exponential curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming eternal [[exponential growth]]
* fitting a linear curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming that take-up of the new technology is disappointing

[[Image:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|Rogers' bell curve|300px]]
Similarly, in the later stages, the opposite mistakes can be made relating to the possibilities of [[mature technology|technology maturity]] and [[market saturation]].

The [[technology adoption life cycle]] typically occurs in an S curve, as modelled in [[diffusion of innovations]] theory. This is because customers respond to new products in different ways. Diffusion of innovations theory, pioneered by [[Everett Rogers]], posits that people have different levels of readiness for adopting new [[innovation]]s and that the characteristics of a product affect overall adoption. Rogers classified individuals into five groups: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. In terms of the S curve, innovators occupy 2.5%, early adopters 13.5%, early majority 34%, late majority 34%, and laggards 16%.

The four stages of technology life cycle are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.scribd.com/doc/20309856/Technology-Management-Growth-Lifecycle Technology Management - Growth &amp; Lifecycle], Shahid kv, Sep 28, 2009, Attribution Non-commercial&lt;/ref&gt;
*Innovation stage: This stage represents the birth of a new product, material of process resulting from R&amp;D activities. In R&amp;D laboratories, new ideas are generated depending on gaining needs and knowledge factors. Depending on the resource allocation and also the change element, the time taken in the innovation stage as well as in the subsequent stages varies widely.
*Syndication stage: This stage represents the demonstration and commercialisation of a new technology, such as, product, material or process with potential for immediate utilisation. Many innovations are put on hold in R&amp;D laboratories. Only a very small percentage of these are commercialised. Commercialisation of research outcomes depends on technical as well non-technical, mostly economic factors.
*[[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]] stage: This represents the market penetration of a new technology through acceptance of the innovation, by potential users of the technology. But supply and demand side factors jointly influence the rate of diffusion.
*Substitution stage: This last stage represents the decline in the use and eventual extension of a technology, due to replacement by another technology. Many technical and non-technical factors influence the rate of substitution. The time taken in the substitution stage depends on the market dynamics.

==Licensing options==
Large corporations develop technology for their own benefit and not with the objective of licensing. The tendency to license out technology only appears when there is a threat to the life of the TLC (business gain) as discussed later.&lt;ref&gt;Bayus, B. (1998). An Analysis of Product Lifetimes in a Technologically Dynamic Industry. Management Science, 44(6), pp.763-775.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Licensing in the R&amp;D phase===
There are always smaller firms ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]) who are inadequately situated to finance the development of innovative R&amp;D in the post-research and early technology phases. By sharing incipient technology under certain conditions,  substantial risk financing can come from third parties. This is a form of quasi-licensing which takes different formats. Even large corporates may not wish to bear all costs of development in  areas of significant and high risk (e.g. aircraft development) and may seek means of spreading  it to the stage that proof-of-concept is obtained.

In the case of small and medium firms, entities such as [[venture capitalists]] or business angels, can enter the scene and help to materialize technologies. Venture capitalists accept both the costs and uncertainties of R&amp;D, and that of market acceptance, in reward for high returns when the technology proves itself. Apart from finance, they may provide networking, management and marketing support. Venture capital connotes financial as well as human capital.

Larger firms may opt for Joint R&amp;D or work in a consortium for the early phase of development. Such vehicles are called [[strategic alliance]]s – strategic partnerships.
 
With both venture capital funding and strategic (research) alliances, when business gains begin to neutralize development costs (the TLC crosses the X-axis), the ownership of the technology starts to undergo change.

In the case  of smaller firms, venture capitalists help clients enter the stock market for obtaining substantially larger funds for development, maturation of  technology, product promotion and to meet marketing costs. A major route is through [[Initial Public Offering|initial public offering]] (IPO) which invites risk funding by the public for potential high gain. At the same time, the IPOs enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre-allotted to them (subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange). When the IPO is fully subscribed, the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans, etc. if needed.

Strategic alliance partners, allied on research, pursue separate paths of development with the incipient technology of common origin but pool their accomplishments through instruments such as 'cross-licensing'. Generally, contractual provisions among the members of the consortium allow a member to exercise the option of independent pursuit after joint consultation; in which case the optee owns all subsequent development.

===Licensing in the ascent phase ===
The ascent stage of the technology usually refers to some point above Point A in the TLC diagram but actually it  commences when the R&amp;D portion of the TLC curve inflects (only that the cashflow is negative and unremunerative to Point A). The ascent is the strongest phase of the TLC because it is here that the technology is superior to alternatives and can command premium profit or gain. The slope and duration of the ascent depends on competing technologies entering the domain, although they may not be ''as successful'' in that period. Strongly patented technology extends  the duration period.

The TLC begins to flatten out (the region shown as M) when equivalent or challenging technologies come into the competitive space and begin to eat away marketshare.

Till this stage is reached, the technology-owning firm would tend to exclusively enjoy its profitability, preferring ''not'' to license it. If an overseas opportunity does present itself, the firm would prefer to set up a  controlled subsidiary rather than license a third party.

===Licensing in the maturity phase===
The maturity phase of the technology is a period of stable and remunerative income but its competitive viability can persist over the larger timeframe marked by its 'vital life'. However, there may be a tendency to license out the technology to third parties during this stage to lower risk of  decline in profitability (or competitivity) and to expand financial opportunity.

The exercise of this option is, generally, inferior to seeking participatory exploitation; in other words, engagement in [[joint venture]], typically in regions where the technology would be in the ''ascent phase'',as say, a developing country. In addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the   technology-owner a degree of control over its use. Gain flows from the two streams of investment-based and royalty incomes. Further, the vital life of the technology is enhanced  in such strategy.

===Licensing in the decline phase===
After reaching a point such as D in the above diagram, the earnings from the technology begin to decline rather rapidly. To prolong the life cycle, owners of technology might try to license it out at  some point L when it can still be attractive to firms in other markets. This, then, traces the lengthening path, LL'. Further, since the decline is the result of competing rising technologies in this space, licenses may be attracted to the general lower cost of the older technology (than what prevailed during its vital life).

Licenses obtained in this phase are 'straight licenses'. They are free of direct control from the owner of the technology (as would otherwise apply, say, in the case of a joint-venture). Further, there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology.

The utility, viability, and thus the cost of straight-licenses depends on the estimated 'balance life' of the technology. For instance, should the key patent on the technology have expired, or would expire in a short while, the residual viability of the technology may be limited, although balance life may be governed by other criteria such as [[knowhow]] which could have a longer life if properly protected.

''It is important to note that the license has no way of knowing the stage at which the prime, and competing technologies, are on their TLCs''. It would, of course, be evident to competing licensor firms, and to the originator, from the growth, saturation or decline of the profitability of their operations.

The license may, however, be able to approximate the stage by vigorously negotiating with the licensor and competitors to determine costs and licensing terms. A lower cost, or easier terms, ''may'' imply a declining technology.

In any case, access to technology in the decline phase is a large risk that the licensee accepts. (In a joint-venture this risk is substantially reduced by licensor  sharing it). Sometimes, financial guarantees from the licensor may work  to reduce such risk and can be negotiated.

There are instances when, even though the  technology declines to becoming a technique, it may still contain important knowledge or experience which the licensee firm cannot learn of without help from the originator. This  is often the  form that ''technical service'' and ''technical assistance'' contracts take (encountered often in developing country contracts). Alternatively, consulting agencies may fill this role.

== Technology development cycle ==
According to the [[Encyclopedia of Earth]], "In the simplest formulation, innovation can be thought of as being composed of research, development, demonstration, and deployment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/156452/|title=Technological Innovation|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Earth]] |accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Technology development cycle'' describes the process of a new technology through the stages of technological maturity:
#[[Research and development]]
#[[Scientific demonstration]]
#[[System deployment]]
#[[Diffusion]]

'''''The Education of Shelby Knox''''' is 2005 documentary film that tells the coming-of-age story of public speaker and feminist Shelby Knox,&lt;ref name ="test"&gt;[http://shelbyKnox.com/], Shelby Knox's website&lt;/ref&gt; a teenager who joins a campaign for comprehensive [[sex education]] in the high schools of [[Lubbock, Texas]]. TEOSK was an official selection of the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2005 and aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]’ ''[[P.O.V.]]'' series that same year. It was directed and produced by [[Marion Lipschutz]] and [[Rose Rosenblatt]].

== Overview ==
[[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] has some of the highest [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] rates in the nation, the "solution" to which is a strict [[abstinence-only sex education]] curriculum in the public schools and a conservative preacher who urges kids to pledge abstinence until marriage.

Shelby Knox is a deeply religious [[Southern Baptist]] teenager who joins the Lubbock Youth Commission, a group of high school students representing a youth voice in city government. When the teens confront Lubbock's sexual health crisis and campaign for comprehensive sex education, Knox throws herself into the battle with missionary fervor, struggling to reconcile her newfound political beliefs with her conservative religious views. When the campaign broadens to include a fight for a gay-straight alliance, Knox must confront her family and pastor in this coming-of-age story.

== Awards ==
''The Education of Shelby Knox'' has received a number of awards:
*2005 [[Sundance Film Festival]] (Excellence in Cinematography, Documentary Category)
*2005 [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] Film Festival (Audience Award)
*2005 [[Sonoma Valley Film Festival]] (Jury Prize)
*2005 Miami Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival (Jury Prize, Best Documentary)
*2005 [[Full Frame Documentary Film Festival]] (Emerging Pictures Audience Award)
*[[Council on Foundations]] (2005 Henry Hampton Award for Excellence in Film &amp; Digital Media)
*2005 Fresno Reel Pride Film Festival (Audience Award, Best Feature)
*2006 The Index on Censorship's Freedom of Expression Film Award (Nominee)

== Shelby Knox in the News ==
The [[Dixie Chicks]]' 2006 album ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' features a track titled "Lubbock or Leave It", which is based on ''The Education of Shelby Knox''. When the song came out, the group's member [[Emily Robison]] told the press: "We'd seen a documentary called ''The Education of Shelby Knox'', which was about a girl ... trying to get Lubbock to teach sex education in the schools. Lubbock has one of the highest rates of teen pregnancy and STDs in the U.S., so it really showed what happens when you keep that information away from people." Lead singer [[Natalie Maines]], who is from Lubbock, subsequently spoke (during a 2006 episode of ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]'') about watching the film and drawing from her own experiences of living there to write the song.

Shelby calls herself a feminist revolutionary. She currently works for change.org, as the director of Organizing Women’s rights. In addition, Shelby is on the advisory board of SPARK, leadership council for ITVS Women, and Girls Lead Initiative. She also is a writer on The Ms. Education of Shelby Knox blog, where she conveys her current opinions on hot topics. Shelby Knox is also on Twitter.

In the 2013 documentary [[How to Lose Your Virginity (film)|''How to Lose Your Virginity'']], scenes from ''The Education of Shelby Knox'' are featured alongside interviews with Shelby Knox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Kolb | first = Leigh| title =How to Lose Your Virginty or: How We Need to Rethink Sex| publisher = Bitch Flicks| url =http://www.btchflcks.com/2013/08/how-to-lose-your-virginity-or-how-we-need-to-rethink-sex.html#.Ukow7Ba0wts| date = 9 August 2013| accessdate = 30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2011, Shelby Knox is living in New York City and serving as the Director of Organizing, Women's Rights for Change.org.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2915">'''Violent disorder''' is a [[statutory]] offence in [[England and Wales]]. It is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/2 section 2(1)] of the [[Public Order Act 1986]]. Sections 2(1) to (4) of that Act provide:

:(1) Where 3 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence and the conduct of them (taken together) is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for their personal safety, each of the persons using or threatening unlawful violence is guilty of violent disorder.
:(2) It is immaterial whether the 3 or more use or threaten unlawful violence simultaneously.
:(3) No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene.
:(4) Violent disorder may be committed in private as well as in public places.

'''"3 or more persons"'''

The '''William Phelps Ornithological Collection,''' also known as the Phelps Ornithological Museum, is a museum of [[Natural science|natural sciences]] dedicated to the study, exhibition and preservation of the [[Bird|birds]] of [[Venezuela]] and the rest of Latin America. The collection is located east of Caracas and in the geographic center of [[Metropolitan Region of Caracas|Greater Caracas]], in the heart of the [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande district]]. The William Phelps ornithological collection is the most important in [[Latin America]] and it is also the most important private collection in the world in its research area.&lt;ref name=":282"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H.

In this private museum one will find important Phelps family study books, as well as 8000 scientific volumes in the library,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|author=Marcos Kirschstein y José Daniel Ramos|title=El bulevar de Sabana Grande esconde un misterio de ochenta años|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/videos/cultura/bulevar-sabana-grande-esconde-misterio-ochenta-anos_69876|date=2018-01-29|accessdate=2018-05-29|work=El Nacional|location=|page=|number=|Apellido 2=}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 83,000 anatomical specimens, more than 80,000 skins, etc.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;  For the year 1990, it was said that the William Phelps Ornithological Collection contained more than 76,300 skins and a small number of anatomical specimens, in the Gran Sabana Building of [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande]]. The Phelps library in 1990 already had 6,000 books, 800 journals and 5,500 reprints, mostly from natural sciences.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;
 
== History ==

The ornithological collection was born in 1938, although it did not have its own headquarters on the [[Boulevard of Sabana Grande]] until 1949. At the beginning of 2018, it celebrated its 80th anniversary in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the passing of time, the collection has been growing&lt;ref name=":282" /&gt; and still has great international scientific relevance. In 2005, an investigation was carried out on "plumage differences in four subspecies of golden warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in [[Venezuela]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.neotropicalbirdclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/C23-Restall.pdf|title=On plumage differences in four subspecies of Golden-crowned Warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in Venezuela|last=Restall|first=Robin|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Gustavo|date=2005|journal=Cotinga|number=23|pages=33–36|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=|last3=Lentino|first3=Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Importance ===
The Phelps Foundation has been recognized worldwide for its scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fundacionwhphelps.org/web/nosotros/|title=Nosotros – Colección Ornitológica Phelps|website=fundacionwhphelps.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1937, this foundation has dedicated to the study of the distribution of birds in Venezuela as well as to the dissemination of ornithology in Venezuela. Since 1949, it has expanded globally in its mission to discover, interpret and disseminate information about ornithology through a program of scientific research, education and dissemination in the natural sciences. The Foundation has had an important global trajectory for which it is recognized and is a regional compulsory study resource on tropical birds for experts who want to know more about this area. This museum has historically been connected to the American Museum of Natural History, thanks to the work of Billy Phelps.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H. PHELPS JR.|last=VUILLEUMIER|first=FRANCOIS|date=1990|journal=Department of Ornithology, The American Museum of Natural Histor|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ornithological collection has also been expanded thanks to the research carried out with Armando Dugand from [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.bdigital.unal.edu.co/33067/1/32820-121526-1-PB.pdf|title=AVES DE LA RIBERA COLOMBIANA DEL RIO NEGRO (FRONTERA DE COLOMBIA Y VENEZUELA)|last=Dugand|first=Armando|last2=Phelps|first2=William|authorlink2=|date=1948|journal=Libro|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the funds to carry out these investigations were collected by the Phelps Foundation.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

=== Research ===
In March and April 1977, the Phelps Ornithological Collection, with the collaboration of the Venezuelan-Brazilian Border Commission, Demarcador de Limites, carried out a collection of birds at Cerro Urutaní (62 ° 05'W, 3 ° 40'N), which is a low altitude tepui on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border in the Sierra Pacaraima. A total of 511 specimens of birds were collected between 1150 and 1280 meters high s.n.m., representing 78 different species. Gilberto Pérez Chinchilla, Manuel Castro and Dickerman prepared the copies of the collection. A full report on these birds was published in the international press and was published in the Bulletin of the "American Museum of Natural History", [[New York City|New York]]. It was necessary to work in conjunction with the Boundary Directorate of [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/Phelps%20%26%20Dickerman%201980.pdf|title=CUATRO SUBESPECIES NUEVAS DE AVES (FURNARIIDAE, FORMICARIIDAE) DE LA REGION DE PANTEPUI, ESTADO BOLIVAR Y TERRITORIO AMAZONAS, VENEZUELA|last=Phelps|first=William|last2=Robert|first2=Dickerman|date=1980|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Venezolana de Ciencias Naturales|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36532">'''Women of color''' (singular: '''woman of color''', sometimes abbreviated as '''WOC''') is a phrase used to describe female [[Person of color|persons of color]]. The political term "women of color" surfaced in the violence against women movement. In the late seventies it unified all women experiencing multiple layers of [[marginalization]] with [[Race (human categorization)|race]] or [[ethnicity]] as a common issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wocninc.org/about-wocn/term-women-of-color/|title=The Women of Color Network (WOCN)  » Term: "Women of Color"|website=www.wocninc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Although similar to the term "[[person of color]]," the history of the term women of color has political roots, as explained by the women's rights leader [[Loretta Ross]]. During the 1977 [[National Women's Conference]], a group of African American women created the Black Women's Agenda to work with the conference. They aimed to substitute the proposed "Minority Women's Plank", which was included in the documentation for the conference. When other minority women wanted to be included in the agenda, negotiations to rename the group led to the creation of the term "women of color", encompassing all minority women. Although it seems to have a biological connotations, the term "women of color" is a unifying term that also addresses the political and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2011/03/26/loreta-ross-on-the-phrase-women-of-color/|title=Loretta Ross on the Phrase "Women of Color" - Sociological Images|last=Wade|first=Lisa|date=|website=The Society Pages|language=en|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influential women of color==
[[Michelle Obama]] was the [[First Lady of the United States|United States' First Lady]] from 2009 to 2017. While in school at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], she ran a literacy program for local neighborhood children. She also wrote her senior sociology thesis on ''Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community''. Obama also protested the institution's lack of minority students and professors when she attended [[Harvard Law School]]. On graduating, she practiced law at the Chicago offices of the law firm, [[Sidley Austin]], and then worked as the vice president of Community Relations for the [[University of Chicago Medical Center|University of Chicago Hospitals]], before becoming First Lady.&lt;ref&gt;Parks, Gregory S., and Quinetta M. Roberson. "Michelle Obama: A contemporary analysis of race and gender discrimination through the lens of Title VII." Hastings Women's LJ 20 (2009): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist movement ==
The first wave of the feminist movement, primarily between 1960 and 1980, did not deal with the issues faced by women of color. This wave used the term "universal woman", attempting to speak for the overall oppression faced by all women. Many involved in the first wave of feminism spoke from the white middle-class female perspective and concluded that gender was the main site of their oppression. Nevertheless, feminism slowly began to address cultural inequalities, especially after the influence of the [[civil rights movement]]. As a result, noting their range of economic, social, and political differences, women of color sought to address the unique experiences of non-white women, generally excluded from the term "[[feminism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Judith Worell |author2=Dawn M. Johnson|authorlink1=Feminist Approaches to Psychotherapy|editor1-last=Wore|editor1-first=Judith|title=Encyclopedia of Women and Gender: Sex Similarities and Differences and the Impact of Society on Gender|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=9780080548494|pages=432–433}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s [[Africana womanism]] was created to practice [[Afrocentricism]] as in America, much was based on a [[Eurocentric]] standpoint. Despite the Eurocentrism of feminism during this time period, many women of color still became [[List of feminist women of color|prominent feminist icons]]. The ''mujerismo'' movement also came about during this time to confront the issues that Latina women were facing. The term is derived from the Spanish word ''mujer'', or "woman"'; it was a name for oppressed colored women who found their issues were not being addressed within the white feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rewire.news/article/2013/07/28/women-of-color-and-feminism-a-history-lesson-and-way-forward/|title=Women of Color and Feminism: A History Lesson and Way Forward - Rewire|work=Rewire|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggles of women of color needed to be better publicized and addressed, encouraging black women to let their voices be heard. [[Intersectionality]]—the effects of experiences based primarily on age, sex, race, gender, sexuality, and disability—is an important consideration in connection with the contributions of women of color to the feminist movement. It is also important to focus on issues specific to women of color in view of the particular problems they have faced. Women of color not only had to deal with the problems of being a woman, but also because they were [[Marginalization|marginalized]] as people of color. For example, a high percentage of women of color were of lower [[socio-economic status]] as a result of economic discrimination. This is often ignored by the mainstream feminist movement. The feminist writer [[Maylei Blackwell]] discusses this historical silencing of "other" aspects of feminism in her book ''¡Chicana Power!: Contested Histories of Feminism in the Chicano Movement'', expressing the need for what she calls retrofitted memory.Retrofitted memory is a form of countermemory against privileged readings of history that allows marginalized perspectives to be recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=¡Chicana Power!: Contested Histories of Feminism in the Chicano Movement |last=Blackwell |first=Maylei |publisher=University Of Texas Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780292726901 |location=Austin, TX|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media representation ==
In the United States, women of color have frequently been misrepresented by the media for over 50 years or more. In 1968, the [[Kerner Commission]] released a report of its investigation into the 1967 race riots. It was highly critical of the way race was being treated in the media. Starting in 1971, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] required broadcasting stations to implement [[Equal employment opportunity|EEO]] programs, specifically focused on helping racial minorities and women. The [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] found that six years after starting these programs, minorities and women still remained discriminated against by the media. In order to create a positive impression, they were treated as window-dressing or misleading examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brooks | first1 = Dwight E. | last2 = Daniels | first2 = George L. | last3 = Hollifield | first3 = C. Ann | year = 2003 | title = Television in living color: Racial diversity in the local commercial television industry | url = | journal = Howard Journal of Communication | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 123–146 | doi=10.1080/10646170304275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manner in which media represents women of color has been an issue throughout most of television and film history, especially by their white-washing women on television and film. Time and time again, roles that should have been given to women of color have been given to white actors and actresses. In films such as ''[[Aloha (2015 film)|Aloha]]'' and ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', directors have replaced traditional Asian roles with actors/actresses of non-Asian descent. "Yellow Facing" has even been present in plays and musicals such as ''[[Lovely Ladies, Kind Gentlemen]]''. In this example, "the role of a Japanese man, Sakini, was given to a white actor named [[Kenneth Nelson]], a decision that aligned with all the previous white actors who had played the role, including Marlon Brando".&lt;ref name="Asian American Media Activism"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt1803zph.5|title=Asian American Media Activism|date=2016-01-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479878192|editor-last=Lopez|editor-first=Lori Kido|series=Fighting for Cultural Citizenship|pages=35–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theater researcher [[Esther Kim Lee]], "popular representation of Asians in mainstream theater are actually stereotypical and overtly mocking of Asian culture, furthermore, most Asian roles were given to white actors".&lt;ref name="Asian American Media Activism"/&gt; Not only have these issues led to public outcry and protests but harmful representations of Asian women are frequent, with the result that future opportunities for them may well be tarnished in the process. According to the media researcher [[Lori Kido Lopez]], many Asian American actors and actresses have been told by producers and directors that they were not 'real' as 'orientals' or Asians. "As a result of decades of Asian representation being commandeered by white actors in yellowface, the idea of "Asianness" had been reduced to an image of prosthetic eyepieces and heavy accents—so much so that it was not even considered realistic for an actual Asian actor to play such a role".&lt;ref name="Asian American Media Activism"/&gt; Although white-washing is a topic that has been pushed aside over the years, it is one that severely impacts opportunities for many women of color and hinders the diversification of races in media.

Because of these many pre-existing stereotypes of Asian women from the early days of Hollywood, Western culture often associate them with concepts such as the dragon lady, the femme fatale or a devious seducer. According to [[Sharad Rajgopal]] of [[Westfield State University]], "Eastern cultures have been represented in Western mainstream cinema as dangerous, devious and evil; all characteristics that represent the mythical Asian Dragon".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|title="The Daughter of Fu Manchu": The Pedagogy of Deconstructing the Representation of Asian Women in Film and Fiction on JSTOR|jstor=10.2979/meridians.2010.10.2.141|language=en|doi=10.2979/meridians.2010.10.2.141.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the image of the dragon lady was more popular in early cinema and television, many still maintain its belief today. According to Sharad Rajgopal, "The femme fatale is also present among Asian women, for example, in the 1931 film ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]'' [[Anna May Wong]] is portrayed as a dangerous threat not because of her strength, but because of her "mythical" beauty and seduction".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This image of the femme fatale can be seen in contemporary films too, such as [[Lucy Liu|Lucy Liu's]] role in [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarentino's]] ''[[Kill Bill]]'' series. The constant association of Asian women with dangerousness due to their exotic and seducing looks is harmful for Asian women everywhere. Adding to the stereotype of seduction, "Asians have also appeared in scenes carrying strong sexual overtones, or involving sexual acts, such as the film ''Call Girl II: Modern Call Girls''". With the multiple stereotypical portrayals of Asian women being seen through film and television everywhere, they may continue to face issues that are difficult to resolve as a result of the harmful, pre-existing images of themselves set forth by media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt14jxs35.7|title=Understanding South Asian Minorities in Hong Kong|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=9789888208340|editor-last=Erni|editor-first=John Nguyet|edition=1|pages=51–80|editor-last2=Leung|editor-first2=Lisa Yuk-ming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is normal for programmers to focus on representing their consumers, and because the majority of those who watch television are white, most of the media is white-washed. In its history, when [[21st Century Fox|Fox]] wished to appeal to young audiences, it aired shows about young people.  [[Ladies' night|Ladies Night]] on television was intended to draw a female audience. Economists refer to these patterns as "externalities". They are caused by rational profit-seeking behavior of media organizations facing competition for the positive attention of white-dominated mass audiences. When advertisers want to show things such as vacations, cute couples, luxurious or family scenes, most of the time they automatically think white. In the words of African American specialist Theodore Ransaw: "According to the world of TV advertising, Whites are the ones who occupy the realm of ideal humanity, of human warmth and connection".&lt;ref name="Ransaw, Theodore 2017"&gt;Ransaw, Theodore. "Alive and in Color, Gender and Racial Bias in the Media: The Search for the Inclusion of Women of Color In the Term Women." Academia.edu. N.p., n.d. Web. 07 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the media tend to broadcast women with Eurocentric, thin features. Women of color are underrepresented, but when they are included, they are often depicted in racially biased ways. Analyses have showed that people of color have historically been portrayed as athletes, or in lower-class occupations such as fast-food workers and in minor, non-speaking roles.&lt;ref name="Ransaw, Theodore 2017"/&gt; Black and Latina women are often portrayed as either slaves/maids, or poor, working-class figures with too many children. Women of color are lightened by different companies, stripped of their heritage and pride, or photoshopped to appear slimmer and more suitable for television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Signorielli|first=Nancy|year=2009|title=Minorities representation in prime time: 2000 to 2008|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08824090903293619|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=26.4|pages=323–336|via=|doi=10.1080/08824090903293619}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of color also face dehumanization by the media. The white women are usually portrayed as angelic and innocent. When a woman of color gets cast on a TV show, she is often portrayed as being very sexual. These women also face lower body satisfaction, because they either need to be slim or curvy. Women of color are forced to try to live up to a standard that is set by white women, which in most cases is unreachable.

== In television ==

Minorities are typically underrepresented on television despite making up approximately 40% of the United States population as of 2014.&lt;ref name="Bunche"&gt;Bunche&lt;/ref&gt; The first woman of color leading a television show was [[Teresa Graves]] who starred in ''[[Get Christie Love!]]'', a 1974 series on [[ABC Television|ABC]]. She was the first African American woman to star in an hour-long drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2012/04/38-years-before-olivia-pope-there-was-christie-love-and-she-made-history-146470/|title=38 Years Before "Olivia Pope" There Was "Christie Love," And She Made History|last=Obenson|first=Tambay A.|date=2012-04-12|website=Indie Wire|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There would not be a woman of color leading a television show until 2012, when [[Kerry Washington]] starred in [[Shonda Rimes]]' ''Scandal'' on ABC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/arts/television/scandal-on-abc-is-breaking-barriers.html|title=‘Scandal’ on ABC Is Breaking Barriers|last=Vega|first=Tanzina|date=2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to Washington's work, for "the second season of Scandal, Washington was nominated for an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, becoming the first African-American woman to be nominated in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 18 years."&lt;ref&gt;Freydkin&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stereotypes ===
African American women typically have been negatively stereotyped in television. In his 2010 ''Journal of African American Studies'' article "But She's Not Black!" author Philip Kretsedemas examined stereotypes of American women in television and noted the three most common: the mammy stereotype, the jezebel stereotype, and the sapphire stereotype, also known as the angry black woman stereotype. The mammy stereotype creates a view of an African American woman as a caregiver, who is loyal and often sassy. The jezebel stereotype portrays African American women as seductive, alluring, aggressive, and overtly sexualized. The sapphire stereotype displays African American women as sassy, rude, loud, and angry, but also comical and status-climbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kretsedemas|first=Philip|date=January 2010|title="But She's Not Black!"|journal=Journal of African American Studies|volume=14|pages=149–170|doi=10.1007/s12111-009-9116-3|jstor=41819243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian and Asian American Women are typically given specific stereotypes in television as well. Two common stereotypes of Asian and Asian American women are described by Hemant Shah in his 2003 article "'Asian culture' and Asian American identities in the television and film industries of the United States" as the Dragon Lady stereotype and the Lotus Blossom stereotype. The Dragon Lady stereotype portrays Asian and Asian American women as sneaky, evil, and malicious, but also promiscuous and alluring—working to seduce men and manipulate them. Another common stereotype is the Lotus Blossom stereotype. This stereotype, also known as the "China Doll", portrays Asian and Asian American women as loyal and good women, but also submissive and hypersexualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shah|first=Hemant|date=August 2003|title="Asian Culture" and Asian American Identities in the Television and Film Industries of the United States|url=|journal=Studies in Media &amp; Information Literacy Education|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latinas, or women with roots in Latin America, are also viewed through stereotypes in television. In her article "Three Faces of Eva: Perpetuation of The Hot-Latina Stereotype in Desperate Housewives", within the ''Howard Journal of Communications'', [[Debra Hoskins]] discusses these common portrayals of Latinas. She finds that within Anglo and Hispanic television and film, there are three notable stereotypes of Latinas. The first listed stereotype is the Cantina Girl, characterized by a Latina having "great sexual allure", and being represented as a sexual object. The next stereotype described is the "Faithful, self-sacrificing senorita". This stereotype includes a Latina starting off as a good character, but then turning evil later on in the show/film. She then makes a sacrifice, often death, to save a man and show that she realized she was wrong. Lastly, there is the Vamp stereotype, which portrays Latinas as women who use both intellect and sexual desire to manipulate a man and get what they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merskin|first=Debra|date=April 2007|title=Three Faces of Eva: Perpetuation of the Hot-Latina Stereotype in Desperate Housewives|url=|journal=Howard Journal of Communications|volume=18|pages=133–151|via=|doi=10.1080/10646170701309890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab and Arab American women are likewise portrayed in television and film in a stereotypical way. Jennifer Bing-Canar and Mary Zerkel explore these portrayals in their article, "Reading the Media and Myself: Experiences in Critical Media Literacy with Young Arab-American Women". In this article, it is noted that Arab women are typically seen as either promiscuous, belly-dancing, hypersexualized women, or as persecuted women wearing the [[hijab]]. In both of these portrayals, women are objectified or oppressed by men. There is also a less frequent stereotype that portrays Arab women as terrorists, although this is more commonly seen in Arab men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bing-Canar|first=Jennifer|author2=Zerkel, Mary|lastauthoramp=y|date=1998|title=Reading the Media and Myself: Experiences in Critical Media Literacy with Young Arab-American Women|url=|journal=Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=23|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native American women are not often included in film and television, but when they are, they usually fall under certain stereotypes. In the article "The YouTube Indian: Portrayals of Native Americans on a viral video site", Maria Kopacz and Bessie Lee Lawton examined these depictions. One of these portrayals is the negative stereotype of the Squaw. The Squaw stereotype depicts Native American women as promiscuous and abused servants, who are inferior to whites. The other stereotype used to represent Native American women is the Indian Princess. This includes a chief's daughter who is beautiful, but also rebellious, as she sacrifices her culture to adopt American culture and to live happily in relation with a white man. According to Kopacz and Lawton, one good example of the Indian Princess stereotype is the main character and storyline in Disney's movie, ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopacz|first=Maria &amp; Lawton, Bessie Lee|date=November 2010|title=The Youtube Indian: Portrayals of Native Americans on a viral video site|url=|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=13|pages=330–349|via=|doi=10.1177/1461444810373532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structural intersectionality and rape ==
Women of color are often isolated when it comes to economic, social, and political status. They are less likely to have their needs ads problems taken care of, than women who are racially privileged. Although there are plenty of rape centers available to women, women of color still experience discrimination. For example, counselors for rape victims often report that a high portion of their resources must be spent on handling problems other than rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|date=1991-01-01|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1241–1299|doi=10.2307/1229039|jstor=1229039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violence against women of color ==
Domestic violence is a recurring problem that greatly affects women of color around the world. Examples for women of color include physical violence, emotional abuse, victimization, economic abuse, intimidation, oppression, and threats. The violence against women of color directly correlates to high rates of poverty, poor education, limited job resources, language barriers, fear of deportation, and lack of knowledge in finding support. Many women of color accept a lifetime of abuse because they have a robust, personal, and familial identification with a certain community. They are submissive to religious beliefs, they have fear of alienation and estrangement from their daily lives, or they are skeptical of the helpfulness of intervention services. As of today, women of color are the most violently targeted community of persons in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torres|first=Campbell|date=2000|title=Abuse during and before pregnancy prevalence and cultural correlates|url=|journal=Violence and Victims|volume=15|pages=303–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thompson Lee, "African American females are more likely to be victimized, raped, or assaulted by an intimate partner in their lifetimes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Thompson, R.K.|date=2002|title=Intimate partner violence and women of color: A call for innovations|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=92|pages=530–534|doi=10.2105/ajph.92.4.530|pmc=1447110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black women experience higher rates of intimate partner homicide when compared to the statistical analysis of violence against white women. The modern racism in the world is a direct cause of violence against African American women; a black woman would be less likely to report her situation or to seek help because of blatant discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=C.C|date=2000|title=The Importance of cultural competence in ministering to African American victims of domestic violence|url=|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|volume=66|pages=266–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black stereotypes often amplify the female convolutions in regard to violence. "Myths that African American women are dominant figures that require control or are exceptionally strong under stress increase their vulnerability and discourage most from speaking out about abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nash|first=Tarrezz, Shondra|date=2005|title=Through Black Eyes: African American Women's Construction of Their Experiences With Intimate Male Partner Violence|url=|journal=Violence AgainstWomen|volume=11|pages=1427–1436|doi=10.1177/1077801205280272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Black women are often more likely to obtain help from authority than black men.

Asian and Pacific Islander women also experience many forms of domestic violence. "41-60 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander women have reported experiencing domestic violence during their lifetimes in a survey conducted by the Asian and Pacific Islander Institute." The labels placed in Asian and Pacific Islander communities such as emotional control, authoritative respect, submissiveness, and other highly valued traits contribute to this group's reluctance to express or share their abuses.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=K.J.|date=2005|title=When Violence Begins At Home: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding and Ending Domestic Abuse|url=|journal=|volume=126|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey put out by the National Violence Against Women organization, about 24 percent of Hispanic and Latina women are abused domestically by an intimate partner during their lifetimes. In regard to immigration, "48 percent of Latinas reported that their partner's violence increased since immigrating to the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutton|first=Mary|date=2000|title=Characteristics of Help-Seeking Behaviors, Resources, and Services Needs of Battered Immigrant Latinas: Legal and Policy Implications|url=|journal=Georgetown Journal on Poverty Law and Policy|volume=7|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latina and Hispanic culture significantly influences the actions women take when dealing with violence. "In the Latino culture, women are often designated to the roles of wife and mother. It is socially unacceptable to be divorced, to marry several times, or to remain single and have children out of wedlock. For these reasons, it may take some time for battered women to consider leaving their partners".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Similarly, religious beliefs and inaccessibility to resourceful information prevent many Hispanic and Latina women from seeking assistance. Latina and Hispanic women are often "concentrated in low-paying, semiskilled occupations in contrast to the overall workforce. Their limited finances and proficiencies create barriers for women trying to escape abuse and obtain legal assistance".

The [[Violence Against Women Act]] (VAWA) was implemented to protect women against men's violence. Communities of color that are referred to as the "tribal land" were disproportionately impacted by the criminal justice system. However, cases of violence against indigenous women living on tribal land in the U.S. was often ignored or unnoticed because the closest federal police station would be far away and there were not enough resources to send officers. As a result, men who were U.S. citizens would specifically target women and girls on tribal land because those men knew it would be almost impossible for them to be prosecuted. In these situations, VAWA failed to protect women living on tribal land. However, in 2013 a renewal was passed that addressed these issues, although many say that there needs to be further legislation.

== The patriarchy ==
In ''Patriarchy, the System'', [[Allan G. Johnson]] defines the term "patriarchy" as a set of symbols and ideas that make up a culture embodied by everything from the content of everyday conversation to literature and film. Johnson continues by discussing how the patriarchy regulates the way social life is expected to be and what it is about: it is male-centered, male-identified and male-dominated. Women of color are the majority of those who are oppressed by this system. Johnson notes that we all participate in the system and will always be a part of it. We can only control how we participate in the patriarchy. The common picture of someone with power is a white, heterosexual male. The structure of the patriarchy exists in the unequal distributions of power, opportunities, resources, and rewards. This is what makes male dominance possible. When we assess the social norms around us, the involvement of the patriarchy becomes clear. Johnson gives excellent examples: the standards of feminine beauty and masculine toughness, the media portrayal of feminine vulnerability and masculine protectiveness, acceptance of older men involved with younger women and elderly women alone, a career as primary for a husband, childcare being a priority for women and secondary for men, defining men and women as opposites, the acceptance of male aggression as natural but not for women, and the devaluing of femininity and being female. Although all women are affected, women of color suffer more than anyone else within this system.&lt;ref name="Johnson2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Allan G.|title=The Gender Knot: Unraveling Our Patriarchal Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9F-BQgAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-59213-382-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In business ==
According to numerous studies, women of color encounter different experiences in business and the work force than Caucasian women. A study by Boyd suggests that when looking for jobs, women of color have less chance of acquiring a job than other groups. Furthermore, finding a job is even more difficult for women of color when there are fewer jobs available or when the economy is not doing well. For example, during [[Great Depression|The Great Depression]], a time of immense economic struggle in the United States, vast numbers of black women were dismissed from their jobs at proportionally higher rate than white women. This in turn affected the families and livelihoods of the women of color as income become harder to obtain. The lack of availability of jobs and discrimination against these women forced them into unemployment in greater numbers than men of color. But, when the resources and opportunities are present, women of color have found solace in building their own businesses and becoming entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=Robert|date=December 2000|title=Race, Labor Market Disadvantage, and Survivalist Entrepreneurship: Black Women in the Urban North during the Great Depression|url=|journal=Sociological Forum|volume=15|pages=647–670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Loscocco and Robinson claim that when women of color open their small businesses, their chances of success are much slimmer than for men. People usually open their own businesses after losing their jobs or as a result of annoyance with their prior professional positions in which they could have encountered discrimination, sexual harassment, and other disturbances. There has been an increase in the number of women pursuing self-employment within businesses of their own in recent decades. But, although having similar motives and displaying comparable skill sets as men, women have had less success within their businesses. Women are also subjected to opening a business within a limited number of fields and cannot usually venture into areas deemed as more masculine such as construction or carpentry, where they face the risk of failure. In their study of women's business ventures, Loscocco and Robinson note that "while gender segregation explains a large part of women's disadvantage, as expected, we find that U.S. women fare less well even when they operate businesses in the same industry categories and subcategories as men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loscocco &amp; Robinson|first=Karyn &amp; Joyce|date=December 1991|title=Barriers to Women's Small-Business Success in the United States|url=|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=5|pages=511–532|doi=10.1177/089124391005004005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, women of color have had an even higher incidence of failure within their businesses. Mora and Davila find that "minority- and female-owned new firms thus had a higher risk of closing down within one year than those owned by non-Hispanic white men; being a female entrepreneur of color exacerbated this risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mora &amp; Davila|first=Maria &amp; Alberto|date=May 2014|title=Gender and Business Outcomes of Black and Hispanic New Entrepreneurs in the United States|url=|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=104|pages=245–249|doi=10.1257/aer.104.5.245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of color confront even more challenges because they face both gender and race discrimination. Bell finds that "racism and sexism are forces that serve to heighten black women's psychological anxiety. Due to the contemporary socio-psychological forces and the historical legacy of slavery, it is extremely complicated for black women to separate the subtleties of sexism and racism."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Ella|date=November 1990|title=The Bicultural Life Experience of Career-Oriented Black Women|url=|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=11|pages=459–477|doi=10.1002/job.4030110607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of color are thus confronted with the difficulties that their gender and races bring them and are often questioned of their abilities because of those attributes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Consequently, the intersectionality of the identities of women of color plays a grand role in their presence in business and the workforce. In her study, Adia Harvey observes that "the intersection of race, gender, and class often leaves minority women with limited occupational opportunities (Ammott and Matthei 1997; Browne 1999; Browne and Misra 2003; England 1992; Higginbotham and Romero 1997). Minority women, particularly African American women, are disproportionately concentrated in the service industry as cooks, janitors, and cashiers (Hesse-Biber and Carter 2000). Institutional discrimination, widespread acceptance of stereotypes, glass ceilings, and poverty are all structural causes that lead to the occupational segregation of working-class black women (Browne and Kennelly 1999; Browne 1999). The dual influence of race and gender means that African American women generally trail black men, white women, and white men in earnings, prestige, and power in the workplace. Many studies draw attention to the institutionalized racial- and gender-based barriers in the labor force that shape black women's occupational patterns and experiences. Browne and Kennelly (1999) argue that stereotypes of black women as irresponsible single mothers can cloud employers' treatment of black women workers. Similarly, St. Jean and Feagin (1998) assert that while some employers view black women as less threatening than black men, this does not translate into a perception that black women are competent, professional, adept workers. Instead, they must prove their capabilities repeatedly and are routinely subjected to racist and sexist hostilities, lack of mentoring opportunities, and discriminatory treatment in the workplace. Still other researchers argue that black women workers are likely to experience feelings of marginalization, dissonance, and alienation in predominantly white male workplaces (Alfred 1999; Bell and Nokomo 2001; Bonner 2004)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=Adia|date=December 2005|title=Becoming Entrepreneurs: Intersections of Race, Class, and Gender at the Black Beauty Salon|url=|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=19|pages=789–808|doi=10.1177/0891243205280104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19607">'''Work-family conflict''' occurs when an individual experiences incompatible demands between work and family roles, causing participation in both roles to become more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhaus, J. H., &amp; Beutell, N. J. (1985). Sources and conflict between work and family roles. Academy of Management Review, 10(1), 76-88.&lt;/ref&gt; This imbalance creates conflict at the [[work-life interface]]. It is important for organizations and individuals to understand the implications linked to work-family conflict. In certain cases, work-family conflict has been associated with increased [[occupational burnout]], [[job stress]], decreased health, and issues pertaining to [[organizational commitment]] and [[job performance]]. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amstad, F. T., Meier, L. L., Fasel, U., Elfering, A., &amp; Semmer, N. K. (2011). A meta-analysis of work–family conflict and various outcomes with a special emphasis on cross-domain versus matching-domain relations. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 16(2), 151-169. doi: 10.1037/a0022170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

== Foundation ==
Work-family conflict was first studied in the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lavassani &amp; Movahedi|first=Kayvan Miri &amp; Bahar|date=2014|title=DEVELOPMENTS IN THEORIES AND MEASURES OF WORK-FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS: FROM CONFLICT TO BALANCE|url=http://davidwimer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kayvan-miri-lavassani-bahar-movahedi-work-family-life-6-19.pdf|journal=Contemporary Research on Organization Management and Administration|volume=2|pages=2335-7959|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period, work and income moved from inside the home (agricultural work) to outside the home (factories).&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Industrialization challenged the current relationship between working and family.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

Boundary theory and border theory are the foundations used to study work-family conflict.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; '''Boundary theory''' divides social life into two interdependent sections, work and family. Individuals have different roles and responsibilities in each section.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Since the sections are interdependent, two roles cannot take place at the same time.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Individuals have to participate in role transformation between expectations of the workplace and expected roles within the family structure.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

'''Border theory''' expands this by considering the influences each section has on the other.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Border theory attempts to pin down ways to manage conflict and achieve balance between conflicting identities.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Individuals may choose to treat these segments separately, moving back and forth between work and family roles (displaying boundary theory) or can decide to integrate the segments with hopes of finding balance.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

==Forms of conflict==
Conflict between work and family is [[wikt:bi-directional|bi-directional]]. There is a distinction between what is termed '''work-to-family conflict''' and what is termed '''family-to-work conflict'''.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

'''Work-to-family conflict''' occurs when experiences and commitments at work interfere with family life, such as extensive, irregular, or inflexible work hours, work overload and other forms of [[job stress]], interpersonal conflict at work, extensive travel, career transitions, or an unsupportive supervisor or organization.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; For example, an unexpected meeting late in the day may prevent a parent from picking up his or her child from school.

'''Family-to-work conflict''' occurs when experiences and commitments in the family interfere with work life, such as the presence of young children, primary responsibility for children, elder care responsibilities, interpersonal conflict within the family unit, or unsupportive family members.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;For example, a parent may need to take time off from work in order to take care of a sick child, or to witness a tournament or performance of a child. Family-to-work conflict is perceived to result in lower work productivity of employees.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

Within work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict, three subtypes of conflict have been identified: time-based, strain-based, and behavior-based. ''Time-based'' conflict entails competing time requirements across work and family roles, ''strain-based'' conflict entails pressures in one role impairing performance in the second role, and ''behavior-based'' conflict entails an incompatibility of behaviors necessary for the two roles. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenhaus, J. H., &amp; Powell, G. N. (2006). When work and family are allies: A theory of work-family enrichment. Academy of Management Review, 25, 178–199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

Although work interface with family (WIF) and family interface with work (FIW) are strongly correlated, more attention has been directed toward WIF. Research, largely attributed to the idea Ariel Russel Hochschild termed the "ideal worker", depicts the inelastic nature of work roles and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Arlie Russell. 1997. The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work. New York: Metropolitan Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The expectations employers hold of an "ideal worker" already rest on unrealistic assumptions about how the family should operate. Many employers expect that employees with families have someone tending to everything at home, leaving the worker unencumbered. Despite the fact that a majority of families in the U.S are dual earning, the image of the "ideal worker" persists, presenting '''work-family conflict'''.

==Workaholism==
Workaholism correlates with experiences of '''work-to-family conflict''', since one's priority of work may interfere with family commitments.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; In its simplest form, workaholism is said to be a substantial investment in one’s work.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0018726703056003613|title=Workaholism: It's Definition and Nature|last=Harpaz|first=Itzhak|date=March 2003|website=Sage journals|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One who is said to be involved in the act of workaholism can be labeled as a [[workaholic]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Workaholism is said to be multifaceted and multi-directional.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;The flexibility and satisfaction within one’s job has an impact on an employee’s happiness and satisfaction in the home and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; An overabundance of work has been said to take priority over everyone and everything else in the lives of those infatuated with work. Excessive work prevents one from forming and maintaining intimate relationships and close friendships.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Workaholics are known to spend a vast amount of time in work related activities, which then results in the sacrifice of crucial family, social, and recreational activities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Marital problems, trouble with maintaining close relationships, and isolation from friends and family are the common issues related to workaholism and those involved.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In most recent years, employers have become more aware of the strain and stress that work can place on an employee. Companies have since started seeing their employees not only as workers, but also as people with personal and home lives.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;Implementation of family-responsive human resource practices and policies that promote work-family balance have become a reality as a way to reduce stress in both environments.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Implications for organizations ==
With the struggles of work-family conflict, options are necessary to provide a solution for these problems. Loehr and Schwartz compare the extreme demands experienced by an individual in the workplace to that of a professional athlete.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2001/01/the-making-of-a-corporate-athlete|title=The Making of a Corporate Athlete|date=2001-01-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both scenarios energy expenditure (stress) is experienced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Without recovery (oscillation) both cannot perform to their greatest ability, eventually leading to [[chronic stress]], burnout, and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Persist stress without oscillation and the result will be permanent damage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Creating an environment that values oscillation, for instance encouraging 15-minute walk breaks throughout the workday or offering corporate gym memberships, can improve employee cognition, energy, focus, and [[emotional intelligence]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Companies, along with their bottom line and employees, win when mental and physical health are treated as equally important to cognitive capabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to gain competitive advantage, organizations are attempting to be portrayed as work-life balance supportive employers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mescher|first=Samula|last2=Benschop|first2=Yvonne|last3=Doorewaard|first3=Hans|title=Representations of work—life balance support|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libweb.uwlax.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018726709349197|journal=Human Relations|volume=63|issue=1|pages=21–39|doi=10.1177/0018726709349197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that value employee work-life balance are able to attract and retain satisfied employees, improve worker performance, and boost employee morale and organization identification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Work-family conflict can be diminished by establishing family-friendly policies in the workplace. Some of these policies include maternity, paternity, parental, sick leaves, and health care insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Waldfogel, J. (2001). International Policies Toward Parental Leave and Child Care. Caring for Infants and Toddlers, 99–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations may provide child care options either as an on-site child care center at the business, references to close child care centers, or supplemented child care incomes for the families placing their children in a child care center.&lt;ref&gt;Waldfogel, J. (2001). International Policies Toward Parental Leave and Child Care. Caring for Infants and Toddlers, 99–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

With advances in technology, individuals who work outside the home and have intense schedules are finding ways to keep in touch with their families when they cannot physically be with them. "Technology has provided a bit of an upper hand, allowing them unprecedented control and creativity in maneuvering the tenuous balance between work and family" (Temple, 2009). Organizations are now able to implement [[telecommuting]] policies which allow employees to work from home&lt;ref&gt;Pitt-Catsouphes, Marcie; Casy, Judi; Shulkin, Sandee; Weber, Julie; Curlew, Mary. (2009). Telework and Telecommuting: Policy Briefing Series. Boston: Sloan Work and Family Research Network. [https://workfamily.sas.upenn.edu/sites/workfamily.sas.upenn.edu/files/imported/pdfs/policy_makers3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and provide more flexibility and control over their schedules.&lt;ref&gt;Estes, S. B., &amp; Glass, J. L. (1997). The Family Responsive Workplace. Annual Review of Sociology, 289–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of gender==
The role of gender is a large factor in work-family conflict because one's gender may determine their role in the home or work place. Female representation in the workplace is a direct result of power operating covertly through ideological controls.&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082"&gt;King, E. (2008). The effect of bias and unrealistic on the advancement of working mothers: Disentangling legitimate concerns from inaccurate stereotypes as predictors of advancement in academe. Human Relations, 61, 1677–1711. {{doi|10.1177/0018726708098082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is illustrated by the basic assumption of an "ideal worker."&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082" /&gt; Many organizations view the ideal worker as one who is "committed to their work above all else".&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082" /&gt;  Ideal workers are those that complete tasks beyond their formal and assigned behaviors, seen as a positive and valuable attribute to the organization.&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082" /&gt; Individuals having to divide their time (and their commitments) between family and work are perceived as less dedicated to the organization.&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082" /&gt; A manager's perception of a subordinate's role and commitment to the organization is positively associated with the individual's promotability.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hoobler, J., Wayne, S. &amp; Lemmon, G. (2009). Bosses' perception of family-work conflict and women's promotability: Glad ceiling effects. Academy of Management Journal, 52, 5, 939–957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manager expectations of an ideal worker are often placed on female workers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cinnamon Gali|first1=Rachel|last2=Rich|first2=Yisrael|date=December 2002|title=Gender Differences in the Importance of Work and Family Roles: Implications for Work–Family Conflict|url=https://link-springer-com.libweb.uwlax.edu/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1022021804846.pdf|journal=Sex Roles|volume=47|issue=11-12|pages=531-541|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since female workers are both part of the workforce and have significant responsibilities at home, they experience a greater bearing of work-life conflict.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Female employees, who managers perceive to be juggling work and family commitments, were presumed to be less committed to the organization, therefore not worthy of advancement.  Women in the workforce may be "inaccurately perceived to have less commitment to their organizations than their counterparts. Their advancement in organizations may be unfairly obstructed".&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082" /&gt; Males are perceived to be extremely dedicated to their organization because they experience lower levels of work-family conflict.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Merideth|last2=Carlson|first2=Dawn|last3=Hunter|first3=Emily|last4=Whitten|first4=Dwayne|date=October 2012|title=A two-study examination of work–family conflict, production deviance and gender|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libweb.uwlax.edu/science/article/pii/S0001879112001017|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=81|issue=2|pages=245-258|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2012.07.004|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male individual may be unmarried and have no thought as to what "typical" family responsibilities entail because they simply have not had the experience.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.libweb.uwlax.edu/docview/1651315091/fulltextPDF/D0B037A68F9247FBPQ/1?accountid=9435|title=Gender role beliefs and fathers' work family conflict|last1=Hergatt Huffman|first1=Ann|last2=Olson|first2=Kristine|website=ProQuest|publisher=Emerald Publishing|accessdate=25 March 2018|last3=O'Gara Jr.|first3=Thomas|last4=King|first4=Eden}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The male may be married, but his wife, due to the demands of the husband's position, has remained at home, tending solely to the house and children and experiencing the "typical" family responsibilities. Since the wife is the one who stays home and tends to the children, the husband is more present in the workforce, representing the higher percentage of males at the top of the [[Hierarchy|organization hierarchy]]. Ironically, these are the individuals creating and reforming workplace policies.&lt;ref name="Williams, J. 20002"&gt;Williams, J. (2000). Unbending gender: Why family and work conflict and what to do about it. New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[motherhood penalty]] is a term sociologists use when arguing that in the workplace working mothers encounter systematic disadvantages in pay, perceived competence, and benefits relative to childless women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Deborah|author2=Melissa Binder|author3=Kate Krause|year=2003|title=The Motherhood Wage Penalty Revisited: Experience, Heterogeneity, Work effort and Work-Schedule Flexibility|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume=56|pages=273–294|doi=10.2307/3590938}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their place of work, women may suffer a per-child wage penalty, leading to a pay gap between mothers and non-mothers that is larger than the gap between men and women. Not only do working mothers have the burden of balancing work and home life, but they also have to prove they are as dedicated as other employees.&lt;ref name="Paik"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correll|first=S.|author2=S. Bernard|author3=I. Paik|year=2007|title=Getting a job: Is there a motherhood penalty?|journal=American Journal of Sociology|pages=1297–1338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers tend to suffer less favorable job-site evaluations compared to non-mothers, stating that mothers are much less committed to their jobs, less authoritative, and less dependable than non-mothers.&lt;ref name="Paik" /&gt; Hence, mothers may experience discrimination is terms of pay, hiring, and day-to-day job experience.&lt;ref name="BudigEngland"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budig|first=Michelle|author2=Paula England|year=2001|title=The Wage Penalty for Motherhood|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=66|issue=2|doi=10.2307/2657415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way in which companies have shaped the "ideal worker" does not compliment the family lifestyle, nor does it accommodate it.&lt;ref name="Williams, J. 20002" /&gt;  Long hours and near complete devotion to the profession make it difficult for working mothers to participate in, or get ahead in the workplace while maintaining a home and family .&lt;ref name="Williams, J. 20002" /&gt;

'''World Kindness Day''' is an [[international observance]] on [[13 November]].  It was introduced in 1998 by the [[World Kindness Movement]], a coalition of nations' kindness [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. It is observed in many countries, including [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Nigeria]] and [[United Arab Emirates]]. In 2009, [[Singapore]] observed the day for the first time.  [[Italy]] and [[India]] also observed the day. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is fronted by [[David Jamilly]], who co-founded [[Kindness Day UK]]. In 2010 at the request of Michael Lloyd-White, the NSW Federation Parents and Citizens Association wrote to the Minister of The NSW Department of Education to place World Kindness Day on the NSW School Calendar. In 2012 At the request of the Chairman of World Kindness Australia, World Kindness Day was placed on the Federal School Calendar and the then Minister of School Education, Early Childhood, and Youth. The Hon [[Peter Garrett]] provided a Declaration of Support for World Kindness Australia and placed World Kindness Day on the National School Calendar for over 9000 schools. Schools across the globe are now celebrating World Kindness Day and work with local NGOs such as the Be Kind People Project and [[Life Vest Inside]] In the USA. In 2012 in Australia, [[Marie Bashir]], Governor of NSW, hosted an event for the first time at [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] to celebrate World Kindness Day and accepted a Cool To Be Kind Award from year 3&amp;4 students. Australian Councils representing over 1.3 million residents have also signed Declarations of Support for World Kindness Australia placing World Kindness Day on the Council Calendar of Events. Events include THE BIG HUG, handing out Kindness Cards, Global Flashmob, which was coordinated by [[Orly Wahba]] from USA which was held in 15 countries and 33 cities with its images of the event making the big screens in [[New York City]]. [[Canada]] celebrates with The Kindness Concert and in Singapore in 2009, 45,000 yellow [[flower]]s were given away. In 2017 World Kindness day was also celebrated in [[Slovenia]], organised by volunteering organisation Humanitarcek as part of their project Randomised Kindess.

World Kindness Day is to highlight good deeds in the community focusing on the positive power and the common thread of kindness which binds us. Kindness is a fundamental part of the [[human condition]] which bridges the divides of race religion, politics, gender and zip codes. Kindness Cards are also an ongoing activity which can either be passed on to recognize an act of kindness and or ask that an act of kindness be done. Approaches are being made to the [[United Nations]] by the peak global body, the World Kindness Movement, to have World Kindness Day officially recognized and its members unanimously sign a Declaration of Support for World Kindness.

According to [[Gulf News]], "it is a day that encourages individuals to overlook boundaries, race and religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/gulf-news-readers-celebrate-world-kindness-day-1.526824|title=Gulf News readers celebrate World Kindness Day|last=Al Theeb|first=Alia|date=November 13, 2009|work=Gulf News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
