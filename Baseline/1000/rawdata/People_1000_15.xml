'''Africanization''' or '''Africanisation''' (lit., making something African) has been applied in various contexts, notably in geographic and personal naming and in the composition of the civil service e.g. via processes such as [[indigenization]].&lt;ref&gt;African Successes Four Public Managers of Kenyan Rural Development David K. Leonard UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africanization of names==

Africanization has referred to the modification of place names and personal names to reflect an "African" identity. In some cases, changes are not a change of transliteration rather than of the European name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language in Africa: An Introductory Survey|author=Edgar A. Gregersen|year= 1977|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-677-04380-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases during the colonial period, African place names were [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] or [[Francization|Francized]].

====Country names====
Various African countries have undergone name changes during the previous century as the result of consolidations and [[secession]]s, territories gaining [[sovereignty]], and [[regime change]]s.

==Africanization of civil services==

In some countries immediately following their independence, "Africanization" was the name given to [[racial]] policies, [[affirmative action]] intended to increase the number of Africans in [[civil service]] (which had historically been dominated by whites&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ffkFRTj1WIwC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;lpg=PA406&amp;dq=Africanization+of+civil+service&amp;source=web&amp;ots=988fWraWRf&amp;sig=gMOO4OWQKqoqnhUwqSOjMnRiK2o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result Adedeji, Adebayo.

'''Biographical evaluation''' ({{lang-ar|عِلْمُ الرِّجال|`Ilm al-Rijāl}}), literally meaning'' 'Knowledge of Men' ''but more commonly understood as the ''Science of Narration'', refers to a discipline of [[Islam|Islamic]] religious studies within [[hadith terminology]] in which the narrators of [[hadith]] are evaluated. Its goal is to distinguish [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|authentic]] and [[Hadith terminology#Hasan|reliable]] [[hadith|hadiths]] from [[Hadith terminology#Da'if|unreliable]] [[hadith|hadiths]] in establishing the credibility of the narrators, using both historic and religious knowledge.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 101"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 101, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; ''`Ilm ar-rijal'' is synonymous with what is commonly referred to as ''al-jarḥ wa al-taʻdīl'' (discrediting and accrediting) – the criticism and declared acceptance of hadith narrators.{{#tag:ref|Al-[[al-Suyuti|Suyūṭī]] mentioned in the chapter of ''Tadrib al-Rawi'' entitled 'Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable': "''al-Jarḥ wa al-Taʻdīl'' is permissible..."&lt;ref name= "tadrib" /&gt;|group=footnote}}&lt;ref name= "tadrib"&gt;''Tadrib al-Rawi'', vol. 2, p. 495, ''Dar al-'Asimah'', first edition, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=[[Ali ibn al-Madini]], an early authority on the subject, said, "Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge."&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam" /&gt;}}

In his ''[[Introduction to the Science of Hadith]]'', [[Ibn al-Salah]], a renowned [[hadith]] specialist, explained the importance of the study of hadith narrators. Introducing the chapter entitled, 'Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable,' [[Ibn al-Salah]] said, "This is from the most distinguished and noble types (of hadith study) as it results in recognizing the authenticity of a hadith or its weakness."&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, published with ''Muhasin al-Istilah'' by al-Bulqini, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 654, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; He then explained that any criticism directed at a narrator was permissible due to the "maintenance of the [[Sharia]]h, purging it of any mistakes or misinformation".&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"/&gt;

Stressing the importance of biographical evaluation, [[Ali ibn al-Madini]], an early authority on the subject, said, "Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge."{{#tag:ref|The other half of knowledge, according to Ibn al-Madini, is "having understanding of the meanings of hadith".&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam" /&gt;|group=footnote}}&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam"&gt;''Siyar 'Alam al-Nubala’'', by [[al-Dhahabi]], vol. 11, p. 48, ''Mu'assasah al-Risalah'', Beirut, 11th edition, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=The following [[Qur'an]]ic verse established a general principal in '''biographical evaluation''':&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt; "O you who believe, if a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that so as not to fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done."&lt;ref name="Quran"/&gt;}}

===Beginning of narrator evaluation===
The [[Qur'an]]ic verses are numerous that praise the Companions and criticize the hypocrites, both as a group and specific individuals from amongst them–as well as criticism of specific individuals other than the hypocrites. The most well-known of these is a verse of the Quran stating, "O you who believe, if a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that so as not to fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done."&lt;ref name="Quran"&gt;The [[Qur'an|Quran]], ''Surah al-Hujarat'', 6th verse.&lt;/ref&gt; While this verse was revealed regarding a particular individual, it is a general principle. Following this example, were the Prophet and then His [[Sahaba|Companions]].&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"&gt;''ʻIlm al-rijāl wa Ihimmiyyatuh'', by al-Mu'allimee, pp. 18–20, Dar al-Rayah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time of the Companions===
While many [[Sahaba|Companions]] narrated [[hadith]], according to [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] there were six who were the most prolific narrators of them, who lived long lives enabling them narrate to a large extent. They were: [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Umar|Abdullah ibn Umar]], [[Aisha]], [[Jabir ibn Abd-Allah|Jabir ibn Abdullah]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]] and [[Anas ibn Malik]] with [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] being the most prolific of them.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 492"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 492, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn al-Salah]] the most prolific narrators from the [[Sahaba|Companions]] was [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] followed by [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]].&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 492"/&gt;

In spite of the Companions' efforts in narrating their [[hadith]], there was no need for them to evaluate each other's narrating capabilities or trustworthiness. This is because, as [[Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]] said, that Allah and his Prophet declared the [[Sahaba|Companions]] to be upright and trustworthy, and, therefore, there is no need to investigate their reliability, however, one must investigate the condition of those after them.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Kifayah'', by al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, p. 46, ''Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah'', Beirut, Lebanon, 1988; this edition is apparently based upon the original Indian printing.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many established narrations originating from the Companions praising some of the [[Tabi'un|Followers]] with some criticism of specific individuals from them.&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

===After the Companions===
As for the [[Tabi'un|Followers]], the generation following the [[Sahaba|Companions]], their praise of narrators was plentiful, while disparagement from them was seldom. Those narrators who were criticized from the Followers were not criticized for [[Hadith terminology#Mawdo|fabricating hadith]], but, instead, due to heresy, such as the [[Kharijites]], or due to weak memory or due to their condition as narrators being unknown.&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

Evaluating the narrators of [[hadith]] began in the generation following that of the Companions based upon the statement of Muhammad [[Ibn Sirin]], "They did not previously inquire about the [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|''isnad]]''. However, after the turmoil occurred they would say, 'Name for us your narrators.' So the people of the [[Sunnah]] would have their hadith accepted and the people of [[Bid‘ah|innovation]] would not."&lt;ref&gt;Reported by Muslim in the introduction to his [[Sahih Muslim|''Sahih]]'', vol. 1, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''turmoil'' referred to is the conflicting ideologies of the Kharijites and extreme [[Shia Islam|Shias]] that had emerged at the time of the third ''khalifas'' [[Uthman ibn Affan]]'s assassination and the social unrest of the Kharijites in opposition to the succeeding rulers, [[Ali]] and [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]].&lt;ref&gt;This is the explanation provided by al-Qurtubi in ''al-Mufhim'', vol. 1, pgs. 122-3 as quoted in ''Qurrah Ayn Al-Muhtaj'', vol. 2, pg 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Uthman was in the year 35 after the migration.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Bidayah wa Al-Nihayah'', by [[Ibn Kathir]], vol. 10, p. 323, ''Dar Alam al-Kutub''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following generation, [[Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in|that after the Followers]], and afterward, the weak, unacceptable narrators increased in number, necessitating that a group of scholars clarify the condition of the narrators and distinguishing any narrations that were not [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|authentic]].&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

====Early specialists====
According to [[Ibn al-Salah]], quoting an early religious authority, the first to specialize in the study of [[hadith]] narrators was [[Shuʿba Ibn al-Ḥajjāj]], followed by Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Qattan and then [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] and [[Yahya ibn Ma'in]].&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 101"/&gt; Al-Bulqini added some names to the aforementioned: [[Ali ibn al-Madini]] and 'Amr ibn 'Ali al-Fallas, and then mentioned [[Malik ibn Anas]] and [[Hisham ibn Urwah]] as having preceded them in evaluating narrators.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"/&gt;

== Overview ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=The grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision.}}

===Narrator criteria===
A [[hadith]] is subject to criticism on the basis of two matters. The first relates to the continuity of the hadith's [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|chain of narration]]; if there is [[Hadith terminology#Categories of discontinuity|discontinuity]] between two or more narrators, that hadith is criticized on this basis as discussed in depth in the [[hadith terminology]] article. The second relates to criticism of a narrator, or more, in the [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|chain of narration]] of a particular hadith.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', by Ibn Ḥajr, published as ''an-Nukat'', p. 108, ''Dar Ibn al-Jawzi'', Dammam, Saudi Arabia, sixth edition, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hadith]] narrators are evaluated in light of two qualities in determining the overall grading of a hadith. These qualities are derived from the definition of a hadith that is [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|''sahih]]'' constituting two of its five conditions. The first, uprightness (''al-ʻadālah''), is defined as the ability an individual possesses to adhere to moralistic decorum (''al-taqwā'') and maintaining proper social graces (''al-murūʼah''). The second, precision (''al-ḍabṭ''), is of two types, the first is pertaining to memorization and the second to writing. Precision in memorization (''ḍabṭ al-ṣadr'') refers to the ability to retain the specified information, recalling and conveying it at will. Precision in writing (''ḍabṭ al-kitāb'') is the preservation of the written information from the time it was heard until its transmission.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grounds for criticism===
The grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision. [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] identified and enumerated ten qualities in which a narrator could be criticized. Five relate to trustworthiness and the other five to precision; however, he presented these ten qualities in order according to severity:
# A narrator intentionally lying, claiming a statement to be a Prophetic [[hadith]] when it is not. The inclusion of a narrator of a hadith as such renders that hadith [[Hadith terminology#Maw.E1.B8.8D.C5.AB.CA.BB|fabricated (''Mawḍūʻ'')]].
# An accusation of fabricating a hadith. This would be due a narration that clearly contradicts established religious principles originating from the direction (as it pertains to that hadith's chain of narration) of that individual. Or, that a narrator is known to lie in his ordinary speech but not while narrating hadith.
# Plenitude of mistakes in a narrator's hadith.
# Lack of attention to accuracy.
# The commission of wrongdoing by statement or action as long as it does not constitute apostasy.
# Misconception due to narrating on the basis of misunderstanding.
# Contradiction of that narrator's hadith of another established narrator.
# Unspecification of that narrator's standing in their narrating capabilities.
# [[Bid‘ah|Heresy]], being the belief in an innovated matter that contradicts the established religious practice originating with the Prophet due to a misconception, not obstinateness.
# Poor memory, differing from number three above in that the mistakes of that narrator outnumber instances in which they are correct.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', pgs. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of evaluation===
[[Hadith]] scholars of the past employed various methods by which to evaluate the narrating abilities of a narrator. From these means are the following:
# Observing that narrator's religiosity and asking others about it.
# Requesting the narrator in question to narrator from a particular living scholar and then returning to that scholar and comparing his narrations with those of the narrator under examination.
# If the narrator narrates from a deceased scholar, inquiring when he, the narrator in question, was born, when he met that scholar and where and then comparing the dates provided in his response to the recognized dates of that scholars death and travels. So, perhaps, the dates provided by the narrator may contradict the established dates, for example, claiming that he heard from a particular scholar after the recognized death of that scholar.
# Comparing the narrations of the narrator with those of narrators of established reliability, comparing them seeking any distinctions that might be unique to that narrator, in particular, while contradicting the others.
# Examination of the narrations either written or memorized by that narrator after the passage of time observing any discrepancies with their initial narrations.&lt;ref&gt;''Ilm al-rijāl wa Ihimmiyyatuh'', pp. 22–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Deliberately altering the wording of a hadith or more for the purpose of examining the ability of the narrator being examined to detect those alterations. This is considered an acceptable practice as long as those alterations are brought to light following the examination process.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', [ 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation terminology ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator...}}

As a result of the evaluation of narrators, each scholar would then conclude by describing the standing of each narrator. A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator, with some variation in usage of terms between the individual evaluators. These are divided into two categories, those terms that constitute praise (''taʻdīl'') and those that constitute criticism (''jarḥ''). [[al-Suyuti|al-Suyūṭī]] gathered the various terms and arranged them in order of strength. He quoted four levels of strength for praise from Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah, adding that [[al-Dhahabi]] and [[Abd al-Rahim ibn al-Husain al-'Iraqi]] added an additional level and [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] one above that. Thus according to al-Suyūṭī, there are six levels of praise. Similarly, al-Suyūṭī described six levels of terms used to criticize a narrator; he arranged them beginning with the least severe and concluding with the most severe criticism.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"&gt;''Tadrib al-Rawi'', by al-Suyūṭī, vol. 1, pp. 573-8, ''Dar al-'Asimah'', Riyadh, first edition, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of praise===
#[[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] held that the highest level of praise was expressed was through the use of the superlative, for example, ''the most established of the people'' (''athbat al-nās''), or ''the most reliable of the people'' (''awthaq al-nās'').
#Al-'Iraqi and al-Dhahabi were of the opinion that the highest level was the repetition of adjective, or adjectives, in praising a narrator. For example, ''reliably reliable'' (''thiqah thiqah''), or ''reliable, firm'' (''thiqah thabt'').
#The highest level according to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah the highest is the use of a single adjective in describing a narrator. Examples of this are: ''reliable'' (''thiqah''), ''precise'' (''mutqin'') or ''firm'' (''thabt'').
#''Trustworthy'' (''ṣadūq'') and ''worthy of trust'' (''maḥallahu al-ṣidq'') are both examples of the next category to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah while al-'Iraqi and al-Dhahabi consider the latter term to be from the next level.
#Next is ''respectable'' ([[Sheikh#Religious usage|''shaykh]]'') along with ''worthy of trust'' (''maḥallahu al-ṣidq'') according to some. This level would also be inclusive of an individual accused of heresy.
#The lowest of the levels of praise is, for example, ''satisfactory in hadith'' (''ṣāliḥ al-ḥadīth''), meaning according to [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]], this includes ''acceptable'' (''maqbūl'') meaning, when supported by other narrators.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As he explained in the introduction to ''Taqrib al-Tahthib'', pp. 14, ''Mu'assasah al-Risalah'', Beirut, first edition, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of criticism===
#The least severe level for the criticism of a narrator is ''soft in hadith'' (''layyin al-ḥadīth'') and, according to al-'Iraqi, ''they have spoken about him'' (''takallamū fīhi''). This level would also be taken into consideration as a corroborating narrator, but at a level less than the lowest level of praise.
#Next is ''he is not strong'' (''laysa bi l-qawī''). The hadith of a narrator determined to be at this level would also be taken into consideration, as with the previous level, however, this narrator is weaker than one of the previous level.
#More severe than ''he is not strong'' is ''weak in hadith'' (''ḍaʻīf al-ḥadīth''), however, none of these first three categories are rejected outright.
#The fourth of the levels of severity of criticism includes terms such as: ''his hadith is rejected'' (''rudd al-ḥadīth'') and ''very weak'' (''ḍaʻīf jiddan'').
#The fifth includes terms such as: ''his hadith is abandoned'' (''matrūk al-ḥadīth'') and ''destroyed'' (''hālik'').
#From the most severe level of terms of criticism are: ''compulsive liar'' (''kadhdhāb''), ''he lies'' (''yakdhib'') and ''fabricator'' (''waḍḍāʻ'') among other terms.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"/&gt;

[[File:Plutarchs Lives Vol the Third 1727.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Third Volume of a 1727 edition of [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]'' printed by Jacob Tonson]]

A '''biography''', or simply '''bio''', is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or [[curriculum vitae]] ([[résumé]]), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality.

Biographical works are usually [[non-fiction]], but fiction can also be used to portray a person's life. One in-depth form of biographical coverage is called legacy writing. Works in diverse media, from literature to film, form the [[genre]] known as biography.

An '''authorized biography''' is written with the permission, cooperation, and at times, participation of a subject or a subject's heirs. An '''[[autobiography]]''' is written by the person himself or herself, sometimes with the assistance of a collaborator or [[ghostwriter]].

== History ==
At first, biographical writings were regarded merely as a subsection of history with a focus on a particular individual of historical importance. The independent genre of biography as distinct from general history writing, began to emerge in the 18th century and reached its contemporary form at the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Kendall}}

=== Historical biography&lt;!--'Historical biography' redirects here--&gt; ===
[[File:Einhard.jpg|thumb|right|Einhard as scribe]]

One of the earliest biographers was [[Cornelius Nepos]], who published his work ''Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae'' ("Lives of outstanding generals") in 44 BC. Longer and more extensive biographies were written in Greek by [[Plutarch]], in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', published about 80 A.D. In this work famous Greeks are paired with famous Romans, for example the orators [[Demosthenes]] and [[Cicero]], or the generals [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Julius Caesar]]; some fifty biographies from the work survive. Another well-known collection of ancient biographies is [[The Twelve Caesars|''De vita Caesarum'']] ("On the Lives of the Caesars") by [[Suetonius]], written about AD 121 in the time of the emperor [[Hadrian]].

In the early [[Middle Ages]] (AD 400 to 1450), there was a decline in awareness of the [[classical antiquity|classical]] culture in Europe. During this time, the only repositories of knowledge and records of the early history in Europe were those of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. [[Hermit]]s, [[monk]]s, and [[priest]]s used this historic period to write biographies. Their subjects were usually restricted to the [[Church Fathers|church father]]s, [[martyr]]s, [[pope]]s, and [[saint]]s. Their works were meant to be inspirational to the people and vehicles for [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Christianity]] (see [[Hagiography]]). One significant secular example of a biography from this period is the [[Vita Karoli Magni|life of Charlemagne]] by his courtier [[Einhard]].

In [[Islamic Golden Age|Medieval Islamic Civilization]] (c. AD 750 to 1258), similar traditional Muslim biographies of [[Muhammad]] and other important figures in the early [[history of Islam]] began to be written, beginning the [[Prophetic biography]] tradition. Early [[Biographical dictionary|biographical dictionaries]] were published as compendia of famous Islamic personalities from the 9th century onwards. They contained more social data for a large segment of the population than other works of that period. The earliest biographical dictionaries initially focused on the lives of the [[prophets of Islam]] and [[Sahaba|their companions]], with one of these early examples being ''[[The book of The Major Classes (book)|The Book of The Major Classes]]'' by [[Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi]]. And then began the documentation of the lives of many other historical figures (from rulers to scholars) who lived in the medieval Islamic world.{{sfn|Nawas|2006|p=110}}

[[File:Foxe's Book of Martyrs - Frontispiece (1761).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|The Book of Martyrs]]'', was one of the earliest English-language biographies.]]
By the late Middle Ages, biographies became less church-oriented in Europe as biographies of [[monarch|king]]s, [[knight]]s, and [[tyrant]]s began to appear. The most famous of such biographies was ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' by Sir [[Thomas Malory]]. The book was an account of the life of the fabled [[King Arthur]] and his [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Following Malory, the new emphasis on [[humanism]] during the [[Renaissance]] promoted a focus on secular subjects, such as artists and poets, and encouraged writing in the vernacular.

[[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' (1550) was the landmark biography focusing on secular lives. Vasari made celebrities of his subjects, as the ''Lives'' became an early "bestseller". Two other developments are noteworthy: the development of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century and the gradual increase in [[literacy]].

Biographies in the English language began appearing during the reign of [[Henry VIII]]. [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'' (1563), better known as ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs'', was essentially the first dictionary of the biography in Europe, followed by [[Thomas Fuller]]'s ''The History of the Worthies of England'' (1662), with a distinct focus on public life.

Influential in shaping popular conceptions of pirates, ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' (1724), by Charles Johnson, is the prime source for the biographies of many well-known pirates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5ou7Bm11IgEC ''A General History of the Robberies &amp; Murders of the most Notorious Pirates'', by Charles Johnson]. Introduction and commentary by [[David Cordingly]]. Conway Maritime Press (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The American biography followed the English model, incorporating [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s view that biography was a part of history. Carlyle asserted that the lives of great human beings were essential to understanding society and its institutions. While the historical impulse would remain a strong element in early American biography, American writers carved out a distinct approach. What emerged was a rather didactic form of biography, which sought to shape the individual character of a reader in the process of defining national character.{{sfn|Casper|1999}}{{sfn|Stone|1982}}{{clear}}

=== Emergence of the genre ===
[[File:James Boswell of Auchinleck.jpg|thumb|[[James Boswell]] wrote what many consider to be the first modern biography, ''[[The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', in 1791.]]

The first modern biography, and a work which exerted considerable influence on the evolution of the genre, was [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', a biography of lexicographer and man-of-letters [[Samuel Johnson]] published in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraries.umw.edu/blog/2012/04/19/james-boswells-life-of-johnson-the-first-modern-biography/ |title=James Boswell's 'Life of Johnson': The First Modern Biography |last=Butler |first=Paul |date=19 April 2012 |website=University of Mary Washington Libraries |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111164251/http://libraries.umw.edu/blog/2012/04/19/james-boswells-life-of-johnson-the-first-modern-biography/ |archive-date=11 November 2014 |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Boswell's personal acquaintance with his subject only began in 1763, when Johnson was 54 years old, Boswell covered the entirety of Johnson's life by means of additional research. Itself an important stage in the development of the modern [[genre]] of biography, it has been claimed to be the greatest biography written in the [[English language]]. Boswell's work was unique in its level of research, which involved archival study, eye-witness accounts and interviews, its robust and attractive narrative, and its honest depiction of all aspects of Johnson's life and character - a formula which serves as the basis of biographical literature to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brocklehurst |first1=Steven |date=16 May 2013 |title=James Boswell: The Man who Re-Invented Biography |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-22540020 |website=BBC News |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographical writing generally stagnated during the 19th century - in many cases there was a reversal to the more familiar [[hagiography|hagiographical]] method of eulogizing the dead, similar to the biographies of [[saint]]s produced in [[Medieval era|Medieval]] times. A distinction between mass biography and [[Biography in literature|literary biography]] began to form by the middle of the century, reflecting a breach between high culture and [[middle-class]] culture. However, the number of biographies in print experienced a rapid growth, thanks to an expanding reading public. This revolution in publishing made books available to a larger audience of readers. In addition, affordable [[paperback]] editions of popular biographies were published for the first time. [[Periodical]]s began publishing a sequence of biographical sketches.{{sfn|Casper|1999}}

[[Autobiography|Autobiographies]] became more popular, as with the rise of education and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop. Autobiographies were written by authors, such as [[Charles Dickens]] (who incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and [[Anthony Trollope]], (his ''Autobiography'' appeared posthumously, quickly becoming a bestseller in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Literary Gossip |newspaper=The Week |location=Toronto |date=6 December 1883 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=13 |url = https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n7/mode/1up |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), philosophers, such as [[John Stuart Mill]], churchmen – [[John Henry Newman]] – and entertainers – [[P. T. Barnum]].

=== Modern biography ===
The sciences of [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] were ascendant at the turn of the 20th century and would heavily influence the new century’s biographies.{{sfn|Stone|1982}} The demise of the [[Great man theory|"great man"]] theory of history was indicative of the emerging mindset. Human behavior would be explained through [[Darwinian]] theories. "Sociological" biographies conceived of their subjects' actions as the result of the environment, and tended to downplay individuality. The development of [[psychoanalysis]] led to a more penetrating and comprehensive understanding of the biographical subject, and induced biographers to give more emphasis to [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]]. Clearly these psychological ideas were changing the way biographies were written, as a culture of autobiography developed, in which the telling of one's own story became a form of therapy.{{sfn|Casper|1999}} The conventional concept of heroes and narratives of success disappeared in the obsession with psychological explorations of personality.

[[File:Eminent Victorians title page.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Eminent Victorians]]'' set the standard for 20th century biographical writing, when it was published in 1918.]]
British critic [[Lytton Strachey]] revolutionized the art of biographical writing with his 1918 work ''[[Eminent Victorians]]'', consisting of biographies of four leading figures from the [[Victorian era]]: [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Thomas Arnold]], and [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levy |first1=Paul |author-link1=Paul Levy (journalist) |date=20 July 2002 |title=A String Quartet in Four Movements |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview22 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strachey set out to breathe life into the [[Victorian era]] for future generations to read. Up until this point, as Strachey remarked in the preface, Victorian biographies had been "as familiar as the ''cortège'' of the undertaker", and wore the same air of "slow, funereal barbarism." Strachey defied the tradition of "two fat volumes....of undigested masses of material" and took aim at the four iconic figures. His narrative demolished the myths that had built up around these cherished national heroes, whom he regarded as no better than a "set of mouth bungled hypocrites". The book achieved worldwide fame due to its irreverent and witty style, its concise and factually accurate nature, and its artistic prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Jones |first1=Malcolm |date=28 October 2009 |title=Boswell, Johnson, &amp; the Birth of Modern Biography |url=http://www.newsweek.com/boswell-johnson-birth-modern-biography-81357 |magazine=Newsweek |location=New York |issn=0028-9604 |access-date=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and '30s, biographical writers sought to capitalize on Strachey's popularity by imitating his style. This new school featured iconoclasts, scientific analysts, and fictional biographers and included [[Gamaliel Bradford (biographer)|Gamaliel Bradford]], [[André Maurois]], and [[Emil Ludwig]], among others. [[Robert Graves]] (''I, Claudius'', 1934) stood out among those following Strachey's model of "debunking biographies." The trend in literary biography was accompanied in popular biography by a sort of "celebrity voyeurism", in the early decades of the century. This latter form's appeal to readers was based on curiosity more than morality or patriotism. By [[World War I]], cheap hard-cover reprints had become popular. The decades of the 1920s witnessed a biographical "boom."

The feminist scholar [[Carolyn Gold Heilbrun|Carolyn Heilbrun]] observed that women's biographies and autobiographies began to change character during the second wave of [[Feminism|feminist]] activism. She cited [[Nancy Milford|Nancy Milford's]] 1970 biography ''Zelda'', as the "beginning of a new period of women's biography, because "[only] in 1970 were we ready to read not that [[Zelda Fitzgerald|Zelda]] had destroyed [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]], but Fitzgerald her: he had usurped her narrative." Heilbrun named 1973 as the turning point in women's autobiography, with the publication of [[May Sarton|May Sarton's]] ''Journal of a Solitude,'' for that was the first instance where a woman told her life story, not as finding "beauty even in pain" and transforming "rage into spiritual acceptance," but acknowledging what had previously been forbidden to women: their pain, their rage, and their "open admission of the desire for power and control over one's life."{{sfn|Heilbrun|1988|pp=12, 13}}

===Recent years===
In recent years, [[multimedia]] biography has become more popular than traditional literary forms. Along with documentary [[biographical film]]s, [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] produced numerous commercial films based on the lives of famous people. The popularity of these forms of biography have led to the proliferation of TV channels dedicated to biography, including [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]], [[The Biography Channel]], and [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]].

CD-ROM and online biographies have also appeared. Unlike books and films, they often do not tell a chronological narrative: instead they are archives of many discrete media elements related to an individual person, including video clips, photographs, and text articles. Biography-Portraits were created in 2001, by the German artist [[Ralph Ueltzhoeffer]]. Media scholar [[Lev Manovich]] says that such archives exemplify the database form, allowing users to navigate the materials in many ways.{{sfn|Manovich|2001|p=220}} General "life writing" techniques are a subject of scholarly study.{{sfn|Hughes|2009|p=159}}

In recent years, debates have arisen as to whether all biographies are fiction, especially when authors are writing about figures from the past. President of Wolfson College at Oxford University, [[Hermione Lee]] argues that all history is seen through a perspective that is the product of our contemporary society and as a result  biographical truths are constantly shifting. So the history biographers write about will not be the way that it happened; it will be the way they remembered it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Stephen Frears|Frears, Stephen]]; [[Katie Derham|Derham, Katie]]; [[Hermione Lee|Lee, Hermione]]; [[Ray Monk|Monk, Ray]] |title=The Art of Life: Are Biographies Fiction? |url=http://iai.tv/video/the-art-of-life |publisher=Institute of Arts and Ideas |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates have also arisen concerning the importance of space in life-writing.{{sfn|Regard|2003}}

Daniel R. Meister in 2017 argues that:
:Biography Studies is emerging as an independent discipline, especially in the Netherlands. This Dutch School of biography is moving biography studies away from the less scholarly life writing tradition and towards history by encouraging its practitioners to utilize an approach adapted from microhistory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel R. Meister, "The biographical turn and the case for historical biography" ''History Compass'' (Dec. 2017) DOI: 10.1111/hic3.12436 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hic3.12436/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biographical research===
[[Biographical research]] is defined by Miller as a research method that collects and analyses a person's whole life, or portion of a life, through the in-depth and unstructured interview, or sometimes reinforced by semi-structured interview or personal documents.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=15}} It is a way of viewing social life in procedural terms, rather than static terms. The information can come from "oral history, personal narrative, biography and autobiography” or "diaries, letters, memoranda and other materials".{{sfn|Roberts|2002}} The central aim of biographical research is to produce rich descriptions of persons or "conceptualise structural types of actions", which means to "understand the action logics or how persons and structures are interlinked".{{sfn|Zinn|2004|p=3}} This method can be used to understand an individual’s life within its social context or understand the cultural phenomena.

=== Critical issues ===
There are many largely unacknowledged pitfalls to writing good biographies, and these largely concern the relation between firstly the individual and the context, and, secondly, the private and public. Paul James writes:
{{cquote| The problems with such conventional biographies are manifold. Biographies usually treat the public as a reflection of the private, with the private realm being assumed to be foundational. This is strange given that biographies are most often written about public people who project a ''persona''. That is, for such subjects the dominant passages of the presentation of themselves in everyday life are already formed by what might be called a ‘self-biofication’ process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=James |first1=Paul |title=Closing Reflections: Confronting Contradictions in Biographies of Nations and Peoples |journal=Humanities Research |date=2013 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=124 |url=https://www.academia.edu/3231040/Confronting_Contradictions_in_Biographies_of_Nations_and_Persons_2013_}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6618">When studying [[literature]], '''biography and its relationship to literature''' is often a subject of [[literary criticism]], and is treated in several different forms. Two scholarly approaches use [[biography]] or biographical approaches to the past as a tool for interpreting literature: '''literary biography''' and [[biographical criticism]]. Additionally, two genres of fiction rely heavily on the incorporation of biographical elements into their content, [[biographical novel|biographical fiction]] and [[autofiction|autobiographical fiction]].

==Literary biography==
A literary biography is the biographical exploration of the lives of writers and artists. Biographies about artists and writers are sometimes some of the most complicated forms of biography.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; Not only does the author of the biography have to write about the subject of the biography but also must incorporate discussion of the individual's literary works into the biography itself.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt;&lt;ref name = karl&gt;Karl, Frederick R. "Joseph Conrad" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 69–88&lt;/ref&gt; Literary biographers must balance the weight of commentary on the individual works against the biographical content to create a coherent narrative.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; This balance is affected by the degree of biographical elements in an author's literary works. The close relationship between writers and their work relies on ideas that connect human psychology and literature and can be examined through [[psychoanalytic theory]].&lt;ref name = karl/&gt;

Literary biography tends to have a plethora of autobiographical sources. Elizabeth Longford, a biographer of [[Wilfrid Blunt]], noted, "Writers are articulate and tend to leave eloquent source material which the biographer will be eager to use."&lt;ref name= longford&gt;Longford, Elizabeth "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt" of Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 55-68&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors and artists go out of their way to discourage the writing of their biographies, as was the case with Kafka, Eliot, Orwell and Auden. Auden said, "Biographies of writers whether written by others or themselves are always superfluous and usually in bad taste.... His private life is, or should be, of no concern to anybody except himself, his family and his friends."&lt;ref name = meyers&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey "Introduction" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-received literary biographies include [[Richard Ellmann]]'s ''James Joyce'' and [[George Painter]]'s ''Marcel Proust''.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113&gt;Backschneider 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = meyers/&gt;

==Biographical criticism==
{{main|Biographical criticism}}
Biographical criticism is the deliberate use of biographical information to shed light on the difference created by experience between an author and his audience, and so provide insight into how to understand that particular work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Benson| first = Jackson J| year = 1989| jstor = 25111810| title = Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism| journal = College Literature| issue = 16| volume = 29| pages = 107–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical fiction==
{{see also|Biographical novel|Biographical film}}
Biographical fiction is a type of [[historical fiction]] that takes a historical individual and recreates elements of his or her life, while telling a fictional narrative, usually in the genres of film or the novel. The relationship between the biographical and the fictional may vary within different pieces of biographical fiction. It frequently includes selective information and self-censoring of the past. The characters are often real people or based on real people, but the need for "truthful" representation is less strict than in [[biography]]. 

The various philosophies behind biographical fiction lead to different types of content. Some asserts itself as a factual narrative about the historical individual, like [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[Lincoln (novel)|Lincoln]]''. Other biographical fiction creates two parallel strands of narrative, one in the contemporary world and one focusing on the biographical history, such as [[Malcolm Bradbury]]'s ''[[To the Hermitage]]'' and [[Michael Cunningham]]'s ''[[The Hours (novel)|The Hours]]''. No matter what style of biographical fiction is used, the novelist usually starts the writing process with historical research.&lt;ref name="mullan" /&gt;

Biographical fiction has its roots in late 19th and early 20th-century novels based loosely on the lives of famous people,  but without direct reference to them, such as [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Diana of the Crossways]]'' (1885) and [[Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919). During the early part of the 20th century this became a distinct genre, with novels that were explicitly about individuals' lives.&lt;ref name = mullan&gt;{{cite news| title = Heavy on the source John Mullan analyses The Master by Colm Tóibín.

==Autobiographical fiction==
{{main|Autofiction}}
{{see also|Autobiographical novel|Autobiographical comics}}
Autobiographical fiction, or autofiction, is fiction that incorporates the author's own experience into the narrative. It allows authors to both rely and reflect on their own experience. However, the reading of the autobiographical fiction need not always be associated with the author. Such books may be treated as distinct fictional works.&lt;ref name = bragg&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5668638.ece| newspaper = The Sunday Times| date = 8 February 2009| title = Melvyn Bragg on autobiographical fiction| accessdate = 9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13666">{{Book of Mormon}}
The '''Book of Mormon witnesses''' are a group of contemporaries of [[Joseph Smith]] who saw the [[golden plates]] from which Smith translated the [[Book of Mormon]]. The most significant witnesses are the [[Three Witnesses]] and the [[Eight Witnesses]], all of whom allowed their names to be used on two separate statements included with the Book of Mormon. Each of the witnesses never denied what they saw.

==Three Witnesses==
{{Main|Three Witnesses}}

The '''Three Witnesses''' were a group of three early leaders of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] who wrote in a statement of 1830 that an [[angel]] had shown them the [[golden plates]] from which [[Joseph Smith]] translated the [[Book of Mormon]] and that they had heard God's voice testifying that the book had been translated by the power of God.

The Three Witnesses were [[Oliver Cowdery]], [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], and [[David Whitmer]], whose joint testimony, in conjunction with a separate statement by [[Eight Witnesses]], has been printed with nearly every edition of the Book of Mormon since its first publication in 1830. All three witnesses eventually broke with Smith and were excommunicated from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|church]].&lt;ref&gt;"All three witnesses eventually quarreled with Joseph and left his church. At their going he heaped abuse upon them, but none ever denied the reality of his vision, and Cowdery and Harris eventually were rebaptized. Joseph had no fear in vilifying them; he neither expected nor received reprisals. For he had conjured up a vision they would never forget." {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, Joseph Smith called Cowdery, Harris, and Whitmer "too mean to mention; and we had liked to have forgotten them."&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Roberts, ed. ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' (Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1905), 3: 232.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839 Cowdery published a tract rejecting the Latter Day Saints and in 1840 become a member of the Methodist Protestant Church.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Shook. [http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs2/1914Shk1.htm#pg039a The true origin of the Book of Mormon] (Cincinnati: Standard Pub. Co., 1914), 49–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, all three testified to the divine origin of the Book of Mormon,{{fact|date=April 2017}} and near the end of their lives rejoined one denomination or another of the Latter Day Saint movement.{{fact|date=April 2017}} Harris and Cowdery rejoined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] shortly before their deaths,{{fact|date=April 2017}} and Whitmer founded the [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)]].{{fact|date=April 2017}}

}}

==Eight Witnesses==
{{Main|Eight Witnesses}}
The '''Eight Witnesses''' were the second of the two groups of "special witnesses" to the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon's]] [[golden plates]]. They were all members of the Whitmer or Smith families: [[Christian Whitmer]], [[Jacob Whitmer]], [[Peter Whitmer, Jr.]], [[John Whitmer]], [[Hiram Page]], [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], [[Hyrum Smith]], and [[Samuel Harrison Smith]].  Joseph Smith Sr. was Joseph's father, and Hyrum and Samuel H. Smith were his brothers.  Christian, Jacob, Peter Jr. and John were David Whitmer's brothers, and Hiram Page was his brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Lyman Bushman]], ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]]'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 79: "Critics pointed out how many of the witnesses were members of the Smith and Whitmer families, implying that they signed out of loyalty or from a self-serving motive....The witnesses were no substitute for making the plates accessible to anyone for examination, but the testimonies showed Joseph—and God—answering doubters with concrete evidence, a concession to the needs of post-Enlightenment Christians."&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Three Witnesses, the Eight testified that they both saw and handled the plates. Another difference is that the Eight testified they were shown the plates by [[Joseph Smith]] rather than by an angel as had the Three Witnesses. Christian Whitmer died in 1835 and his brother Peter Whitmer, Jr. died the following year. In 1838, the surviving Whitmers became estranged from Joseph Smith during a leadership struggle in [[Far West, Missouri]], and all were excommunicated with other dissenters,&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 337,339, 350–51. On June 17, [[Sidney Rigdon]] "preached a vitriolic sermon based on the theme of salt losing its savor and being cast out and trodden underfoot....Soon after the sermon, eighty-three prominent members in Far West, many of them probably [[Danites]] by then, signed an ultimatum demanding the departure of the offenders....Fearing for their property and perhaps their lives, the dissenters fled." (355–51) In 1847, David, John, and Jacob Whitmer and Hiram Page were baptized into the newly formed [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)|Church of Christ]] founded by [[William E. M'Lellin]]. In 1831, Joseph Smith received a revelation from God that John Whitmer should "write and keep a regular history" of the church (D&amp;C 47). Whitmer did eventually write such a history, but one which concluded with a detailed description of what Whitmer considered the mistreatment that he and his family had received in Caldwell County. See Bruce N. Westerngren, ''From Historian to Dissident: The Book of John Whitmer'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; never to rejoin Smith's church. None of the Eight Witnesses is known to have denied his testimony to the authenticity of Book of Mormon or the golden plates.

==Another witness==
{{main|Mary Whitmer}}

[[Mary Whitmer|Mary Musselman Whitmer]] (1778–1856), the mother of five Witnesses who took care of the household in [[Fayette, New York]], where much of the translation occurred, said that an angel showed her the plates and thus made her more content to continue her daily labors.&lt;ref&gt;"David Whitmer Interview with Edward Stevenson, 9 February 1888,"in [[Dan Vogel]], ''Early Mormon Documents'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2003), 5: 160–61; John C. Whitmer Interview with Andrew Jenson and Edward Stevenson, 11 October 1888," in ''EMD'' 5: 260–62.  John Whitmer said that his grandmother always referred to the supernatural visitor as "Brother Nephi."&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph Smith made no mention of this visitation in his journal.

==Responses==
===Criticism===

Critics of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]—from late nineteenth-century clergymen to [[Mark Twain]] to modern agnostics, evangelical Christians, and even some unorthodox ("Big Tent") Mormons—argue that the testimonies of the witnesses cannot be taken at face value.

* According to [[Grant Palmer]], the Book of Mormon witnesses had a "nineteenth-century magical mindset" rather than "a rationalist perspective." They believed in what was called "second sight.  Traditionally, this included the ability to see spirits and their dwelling places within the local hills and elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;[[Grant H. Palmer]], ''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 175. Palmer devotes an entire chapter to the magical mindset of the Book of Mormon Witnesses.&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of the witnesses possessed and used [[Scrying|seer stone]]s; Oliver Cowdery was a [[Dowsing|rodsman]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Michael Quinn, ''Early Mormonism and the Magic World View'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1998), rev. ed., 239-40.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Tufts University professor [[John L. Brooke]] has observed, many of the earliest Mormons were "very much attuned to the supernatural powers of witchcraft."&lt;ref&gt;John L. Brooke, ''The Refiner's Fire: The Making of Mormon Cosmology, 1644–1844'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Far removed from our own modern empiricism, the world view of the witnesses is difficult for us to grasp," and thus it is less impressive that "three signatories to the Book of Mormon saw and heard an angel."&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 194-95.&lt;/ref&gt;
* All the witnesses were family, close friends, or financial backers of Joseph Smith. Cowdery, Page, and the five Whitmers were related by marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] later joked, "I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family had testified."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Fawn Brodie, ''No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1986), second ed., 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although Harris continued to testify to the truth of the [[Book of Mormon]] even when he was estranged from the church, at least during the early years of the movement, he "seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience."&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, ''Early Mormon Documents'', 2: 255. The foreman in the Palmyra printing office that produced the first Book of Mormon said that Harris "used to practice a good deal of his characteristic jargon and 'seeing with the spiritual eye,' and the like." [[Pomeroy Tucker]], ''Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism'' (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1867), 71 in ''EMD'', 3: 122. John H. Gilbert, the typesetter for most of the book, said that he had asked Harris, "Martin, did you see those plates with your naked eyes?" According to Gilbert, Harris "looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, 'No, I saw them with a spiritual eye." John H. Gilbert, "Memorandum," 8 September 1892, in ''EMD'', 2: 548. Two other Palmyra residents said that Harris told them that he had seen the plates with "the eye of faith" or "spiritual eyes." Martin Harris interviews with John A. Clark, 1827 &amp; 1828 in ''EMD'', 2: 270; Jesse Townsend to Phineas Stiles, 24 December 1833, in ''EMD'', 3: 22. In 1838, Harris is said to have told an Ohio congregation that "he never saw the plates with his natural eyes, only in vision or imagination." Stephen Burnett to Lyman E. Johnson, 15 April 1838 in ''EMD'', 2: 291. A neighbor of Harris in Kirtland, Ohio, said that Harris "never claimed to have seen [the plates] with his natural eyes, only spiritual vision." Reuben P. Harmon statement, c. 1885, in ''EMD'', 2: 385.&lt;/ref&gt;
* After Smith's death, [[James Strang]], claiming to be Smith's chosen successor, also produced [[Voree plates|buried plates]] and the testimony of eleven witnesses to their authenticity. All living witnesses to the Book of Mormon (except possibly Cowdery)—three of the Whitmers, Martin Harris, and Hiram Page—accepted at least briefly Strang's "leadership, angelic call, metal plates, and his translation of these plates as authentic."&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 212-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apologetics===
* LDS church leaders and student manuals note that none of the witnesses ever denied his testimony as it was printed in the Book of Mormon nor denied that Smith was a true prophet at the time he translated the book.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Dallin H. Oaks]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1999/05/the-witness-martin-harris "The Witness: Martin Harris"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign'']], May 1999; [[James E. Faust]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/11/a-growing-testimony "A Growing Testimony"], ''Ensign'', November 2011; [[Henry B. Eyring]], [http://www.lds.org/liahona/2003/11/an-enduring-testimony-of-the-mission-of-the-prophet-joseph "An Enduring Testimony of the Witness of the Prophet Joseph"], ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'', November 2003;[http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-and-church-history-gospel-doctrine-teachers-manual/lesson-4-remember-the-new-covenant-even-the-book-of-mormon "Lesson 4: Remember the New Covenant, Even the Book of Mormon"], ''Doctrine and Covenants and Church History: Gospel Doctrine Teacher's Manual (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apologists note that after being excommunicated, Harris and Cowdery later returned to the church.&lt;ref&gt;A list of articles is available in the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research|FAIR]] Topical Guide, under [http://www.fairlds.org/apol/ai109.html ''Book of Mormon Witnesses''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072851/http://www.fairlds.org/apol/ai109.html |date=July 25, 2008 }}.

'''Burgher arms''' are [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] borne by persons of the ''burgher'' social class of [[Europe]] (usually called ''bourgeois'' in English) since the [[Middle Ages]]. By definition, however, the term is alien to [[British heraldry]], which follows other rules.

Although the term ''burgher'' arms refers to the [[bourgeoisie]], it is often extended also to arms of (Protestant) clergy and even to arms of [[peasant]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In several European countries, the use of armorial bearings was restricted to a particular social class, e.g. the use of [[Supporters (heraldry)|supporters]] in [[Coat of arms#United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] in [[Portuguese heraldry|Portugal]] or [[coronets]] in [[Swedish heraldry#Noble arms|Sweden]]. In other countries, every individual, family and community has been free to adopt arms and use it as they please, provided they have not wrongfully assumed the arms of another.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Heraldry.html?id=XFfkAQAACAAJ Heraldry: Its Origins and Meaning]'', '[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series. (Thames &amp; Hudson 1997), {{p.|14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Use of coats of arms by burghers and artisans began during the 13th century and in the 14th century some peasants took to using arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The arms of burghers bore a far wider variety of [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] than the arms of nobility like everyday objects, in particular, [[tool]]s. In burgher arms are met sometimes also [[house mark]]s which are not met in arms of nobility. Most widespread burgher heraldry was and still is in [[Switzerland]] and in the [[Netherlands]]. In the Netherlands only a small percentage of the existing arms belong to the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Crest-[[coronet]]s in burgher arms are correct only if the arms were granted by a sovereign and the coronet is explicitly mentioned in the grant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. The Art of Heraldry. Tiger Books International, London. 1991, p. 59 {{ISBN|1-85501-154-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
== Germany ==
Although assumption of arms always remained free, the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] since [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] began to grant arms without raising people to nobiliary status. In the 15th century the authority to grant arms was delegated to “[[Hofpfalzgraf|Counts Palatine of the Imperial Court]]” ({{lang-de|[[:de:Hofpfalzgraf|Hofpfalzgrafen]]}}), who from then on also granted arms to burghers. This was regarded as luxury everyone was not able to afford.

The [[tilting helmet]] was prescribed for arms of non-nobles, while the barred helmet was restricted by the imperial chancellery to the nobility as upholders of the tradition of tourneying. This privilege was also shared by certain people who enjoyed the same standing as the nobility, e.g. those who had a doctor's title in law or theology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ottfried Neubecker]]: A Guide to Heraldry. Cassell, London 1981, p.161. {{ISBN|0-304-30751-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Custom of the use of the barred helmet was also followed by city [[Patricianship|patricians]].&lt;ref name="Heraldik 1998 p. 173"&gt;[[Handbuch der Heraldik: Wappenfibel]]. (19th expanded edition). Edited by Ludwig Biewer. (Degener &amp; Co, Neustadt an der Aisch 1998), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rule of the use of the tilting helmet by burghers was not always obeyed, it has still become the norm in many countries of the [[Heraldry#German-Nordic heraldry|German-Nordic heraldic tradition]], e.g. in [[Swedish heraldry]].

After the fall of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], arms were no longer granted to burghers except in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], where such grants continued from 1911 until 1918.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Elsewhere burgher arms were assumed. Such family heraldry is still alive in Germany and burgher arms [[law of arms|are protected by law]].

== France ==
Burgher arms used to be common in [[France]], but they disappeared in the [[French Revolution]], which was hostile to heraldry. In the end of the 17th century, an attempt was made to list all arms in ''[[Armorial général (of France)|Armorial général]]'' as a device to increase tax revenue. When the attempt failed, in order to force people to pay tax, arms were given to many burghers who had never had them. These arms were never used by their recipients.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], Heraldry: its origins and meaning (Thames &amp; Hudson 1997), p. 33-36&lt;/ref&gt; In France burgher arms are not supposed to have a helmet.

== Portugal ==
Burgher arms had a complicated and suppressed history in Portugal. During the reign of King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]], burgher arms were restricted to the use of colours only. This restriction would become irrelevant when King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] forbade the use of arms to those who were not of the [[Portuguese nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Slater: The Complete Book of Heraldry. Lorenz Books 2002, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction against burgher arms in Portugal lasted until 1910.

== Arms of peasants ==
In some regions ([[Normandy]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]) even peasants sometimes bore arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], Heraldry: its origins and meaning (Thames &amp; Hudson 1997), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Switzerland]] 14th century arms of farmers are known, but they are rare and did not become numerous until the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Frisia]] and [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]], where farmers had personal freedom.&lt;ref name="Heraldik 1998 p. 173" /&gt; In [[Denmark]] arms of farmers are preserved on seals from about 1300.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norway]] peasants have used arms since the Middle Ages and some of the arms have even been used as family arms.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Krag: ''Norsk heraldisk mønstring fra Frederik IV's regjeringstid 1699-1730'', Bind II Bønder, (1942 – 1955) and Allan Tønnesen (ed.): ''Magtens besegling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16537">A '''character''' (sometimes known as a '''fictional character''') is a [[person]] or other being in a [[narrative]] (such as a [[novel]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[television series]], [[film]], or [[video game]]).&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Freeman|title=Historicising Transmedia Storytelling: Early Twentieth-Century Transmedia Story Worlds|isbn =1315439506|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2016|pages=31–34|accessdate=January 19, 2017 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDBuDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria DiBattista|title=Novel Characters: A Genealogy|isbn =1444351559|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2011|pages=14–20|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uATBJUxMqEC&amp;pg=PT14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldick (2001, 37) and Childs and Fowler (2006, 23). See also "character, 10b" in Trumble and Stevenson (2003, 381): "A person portrayed in a novel, a drama, etc; a part played by an actor".&lt;/ref&gt; The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a "fictional" versus "real" character may be made.&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Derived from the [[ancient Greek]] word χαρακτήρ, the English word dates from the [[English Restoration|Restoration]],&lt;ref&gt;''OED'' "character" sense 17.a citing, ''inter alia'', [[John Dryden|Dryden's]] 1679 preface to ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'': "The chief character or Hero in a Tragedy ... ought in prudence to be such a man, who has so much more in him of Virtue than of Vice... If Creon had been the chief character in ''Œdipus''..."&lt;/ref&gt; although it became widely used after its appearance in ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]''  in 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34), quotation: {{quotation|[...] is first used in English to denote 'a personality in a novel or a play' in 1749 (''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; From this, the sense of "a part played by an [[actor]]" developed.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51&gt;Harrison (1998, 51-2) quotation: {{quotation|Its use as 'the sum of the qualities which constitute an individual' is a mC17 development. The modern literary and theatrical sense of 'an individual created in a fictitious work' is not attested in OED until mC18: 'Whatever characters any... have for the jestsake personated... are now thrown off' (1749, Fielding, ''Tom Jones'').}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the [[theatre]] or [[film|cinema]], involves "the illusion of being a human person".&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Characters as Guides to Meaning | journal = The Reading Teacher | first = Nancy | last = Roser |author2=Miriam Martinez|author3=Charles Fuhrken|author4=Kathleen McDonnold | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 548–559| id = | accessdate = 2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase "in character" has been used to describe an effective [[impersonation]]  by an actor.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called [[characterisation]].&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt;

A character who stands as a representative of a particular [[Social class|class]] or group of people is known as a type.&lt;ref name=b265&gt;Baldick (2001, 265).&lt;/ref&gt; Types include both [[stock character]]s and those that are more fully [[individual]]ised.&lt;ref name=b265/&gt; The characters in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1891) and [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[Miss Julie]]'' (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the [[social relation]]s of class and [[gender]], such that the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflicts]] between the characters reveal [[Ideology|ideological]] conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 35).&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 41).&lt;/ref&gt; The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions (proairetic, [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]], [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Proxemics|proxemic]]) that it forms with the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Elam (2002, 133).&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often [[Mimesis|miming]] shifts in society and its ideas about human [[individual]]ity, [[self-determination]], and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs and Fowler (2006, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
In [[fiction writing]], authors create dynamic characters by many methods.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Sometimes characters are conjured up from imagination; in other instances, they are created by amplifying the character trait of a real person into a new fictional creation, or are created from scratch as a matter of expediency.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt;

==Types==

===Round vs. flat=== &lt;!-- Characterization links here. --&gt;
In his book ''Aspects of the Novel'', [[E. M. Forster]] defined two basic types of characters, their qualities, functions, and importance for the development of the novel: '''flat''' characters and '''round''' characters.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Michael J|author2=Patrick D. Murphy|title=Essentials of the theory of fiction|publisher=Duke University Press, 1996|edition=2|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8223-1823-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat characters are two-dimensional, in that they are relatively uncomplicated. By contrast, round characters are complex figures with many different characteristics, that undergo development, sometimes sufficiently to surprise the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=E.M.|title=Aspects of the Novel|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Sue]]s are characters mainly appearing in [[fan fiction]]. They are virtually devoid of flaws,&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lucy Bennett, Paul Booth|title=Seeing Fans: Representations of Fandom in Media and Popular Culture|isbn =1501318470|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA|year=2016|page=160|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydwuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore considered flat characters.

===Dynamic vs. static===
'''Dynamic''' characters are those that change over the course of the story, while '''static''' characters remain the same throughout. An example of a popular static character in literature is [[Sherlock Holmes]]; an example of a dynamic character in literature is [[Ebenezer Scrooge]].

===Regular, recurring and guest characters===
In television, a regular, main or ongoing character is a character who appears in all or a majority of episodes, or in a significant chain of episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;The TV Writer's Workbook: A Creative Approach To Television Scripts [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YeCet_B_-IC&amp;pg=PA40 p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular characters may be both core and secondary ones. 

A [[recurring character]] often and frequently appears from time to time during the series' run.&lt;ref name="Crafty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=Alex |title=Crafty TV Writing: Thinking Inside the Box |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year= 2006 |isbn=0-8050-8028-7 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus.

A guest character is one which acts only in a few episodes or scenes. Unlike regular characters, the guest ones do not need to be carefully incorporated into the storyline with all its ramifications: they create a piece of drama and then disappear without consequences to the narrative structure, unlike core characters, for which any significant conflict must be traced during a considerable time, which is often seen as an unjustified waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Greg M. Smith, ''Beautiful TV: The Art and Argument of Ally McBeal'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA147 p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be a continuing or recurring guest character.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a guest character may gain popularity and turn into a regular one.&lt;ref&gt;David Kukoff, ''Vault Guide to Television Writing Careers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=T9zj0AqB6bUC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical analysis==
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

In the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE), the [[Greek philosophy|Classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] deduces that character (''[[ethos]]'') is one of six qualitative parts of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] and one of the three objects that it [[Mimesis|represents]] (1450a12).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8). Aristotle defines the six qualitative elements of tragedy as "plot, character, diction, reasoning, spectacle and song" (1450a10); the three objects are plot (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]''), character (''[[ethos]]''), and reasoning (''[[dianoia]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; He understands character not to denote a fictional person, but the quality of the person acting in the story and reacting to its situations (1450a5).&lt;ref name=j984&gt;Janko (1987, 9, 84).&lt;/ref&gt; He defines character as "that which reveals [[Decision making|decision]], of whatever sort" (1450b8).&lt;ref name=j984/&gt; It is possible, therefore, to have stories that do not contain "characters" in Aristotle's sense of the word, since character necessarily involves making the [[Ethics|ethical]] dispositions of those performing the action clear.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle writes: "Again, without action a tragedy cannot exist, but without characters it may. For the tragedies of most recent [poets] lack character, and in general there are many such poets" (1450a24-25); see Janko (1987, 9, 86).&lt;/ref&gt; If, in speeches, the speaker "decides or avoids nothing at all", then those speeches "do not have character" (1450b9—11).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argues for the primacy of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'') over character (''[[ethos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34) and Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the most important of these is the structure of the incidents. For (i) tragedy is a representation not of human beings but of action and life. Happiness and unhappiness lie in action, and the end [of life] is a sort of action, not a quality; people are of a certain sort according to their characters, but happy or the opposite according to their actions. So [the actors] do not act in order to represent the characters, but they include the characters for the sake of their actions" (1450a15-23).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aristotle suggests that works were distinguished in the first instance according to the nature of the person who created them: "the grander people represented fine actions, i.e. those of fine persons" by producing "hymns and praise-poems", while "ordinary people represented those of inferior ones" by "composing invectives" (1448b20—1449a5).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 5). This distinction, Aristotle argues, arises from two causes that are natural and common to all humans—the delight taken in experiencing representations and the way in which we learn through imitation (1448b4—19); see Janko (1987, 4—5).&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, a distinction between the individuals represented in tragedy and in comedy arose: tragedy, along with [[epic poetry]], is "a representation of serious people" (1449b9—10), while [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] is "a representation of people who are rather inferior" (1449a32—33).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 6—7). Aristotle specifies that comedy does not represent all kinds of ugliness and vice, but only that which is laughable (1449a32—1449a37).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' (which may or may not be by Aristotle), [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is defined as involving three types of characters: the [[buffoon]] (''[[bômolochus]]''), the [[Irony|ironist]] (''[[eirôn]]''), and the [[imposter]] or boaster (''[[alazôn]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; All three are central to [[Aristophanes]]' "[[old comedy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 170).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] comic playwright [[Plautus]] wrote his plays two centuries later, the use of characters to define dramatic [[genre]]s was well established.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 22).&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]'' begins with a [[prologue]] in which [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] claims that since the play contains kings and gods, it cannot be a comedy and must be a [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amphritruo'', line 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Sweden]]''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges riksvapen}}) has a lesser and a greater version.

== Regulated usage ==
The usage of the coats of arms is regulated by Swedish Law, [[Swedish Code of Statutes|Act]] [http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/19700498.HTM 1970:498], which states (in unofficial translation) that "in commercial activities, the coats of arms, the flag or other official insignia of Sweden may not be used in a trademark or other insignias for products or services without proper authorisation. This includes any mark or text referring to the Swedish State which this can give the commercial mark a sign of official endorsement. This includes municipal coats of arms which are registered."

Any representation consisting of three crowns ordered two above one are considered to be the lesser coat of arms, and its usage is therefore restricted by law 1970:498.

==Variants==
The arms of Sweden were first formally codified by law in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/rikskal/1909/0002.html|title=i (Svensk rikskalender / 1909)|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also formally codifies the differences between the "greater" and "lesser" arms. The present law prescribing the two arms dates from 1982.

===Greater version===
The greater coat of arms is blazoned in Swedish law as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A shield [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], quartered by a cross [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] with outbent arms, and an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House. In the first and fourth fields three [[Crown (heraldry)|open crowns]] Or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams [[argent]], a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] crowned with an open crown Or armed [[gules]]. The inescutcheon is [[Division of the field|party per pale]] the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] (Bendwise azure, argent and gules, a ''vasa'' Or); and the [[House of Bernadotte]] (Azure, issuant from a wavy base a bridge with three arches and two towers embattled argent, in honor point an eagle regardant with wings inverted resting on thunderbolts Or, and in chief the Big Dipper constellation of the same). The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. [[Supporters|Supported]] by two lions regardant, crowned and with forked tails Or armed gules, standing on a [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] Or. All surrounded by [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] mantling, crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseladorned strings Or.''&lt;ref&gt;Original text of Swedish statute 1982:268, 2 §, states: ''Stora riksvapnet utgörs av en blå huvudsköld, kvadrerad genom ett kors av guld med utböjda armar, samt en hjärtsköld som innehåller det kungliga husets dynastivapen. Huvudsköldens första och fjärde fält innehåller tre öppna kronor av guld, ordnade två över en. Huvudsköldens andra och tredje fält innehåller tre ginbalksvis gående strömmar av silver, överlagda med ett upprest, med öppen krona krönt lejon av guld med röd tunga samt röda tänder och klor. Hjärtskölden är kluven. Första fältet innehåller Vasaättens vapen: ett i blått, silver och rött styckat fält, belagt med en vase av guld. Andra fältet innehåller ätten Bernadottes vapen: i blått fält en ur vatten uppskjutande bro med tre valv och två krenelerade torn, allt av silver, däröver en örn av guld med vänstervänt huvud och sänkta vingar gripande om en åskvigg av guld samt överst Karlavagnens stjärnbild av guld. Huvudskölden är krönt med en kunglig krona och omges av Serafimer ordens insignier. Sköldhållare är två tillbakaseende, med kunglig krona krönta lejon med kluvna svansar samt röda tungor, tänder och klor. Lejonen står på ett postament av guld. Det hela omges av en med kunglig krona krönt hermelinsfodrad vapenmantel av purpur med frans av guld och uppknuten med tofsprydda snören av guld. Stora riksvapnet får brukas även utan ordensinsignier, sköldhållare, postament eller vapenmantel.''

The greater arms may also be displayed only with the crowned escutcheon. While the arms have undergone significant changes over the years, such as changing the inescutcheon with the ruling dynasty, they are based on arms created by King [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson]] in 1448.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] used in the greater blazon has in total five elements: 4 [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarterings]] on the main escutcheon (two coats of arms duplicated), and three coat of arms incorporated into an escutcheon of pretense. However, Bernadotte never used any stars in the arms of Pontecorvo (neither as Prince of Pontecorvo, nor as King of Sweden and Norway). The stars were introduced as an element in the royal coat of arms in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berghman |first=Arvid |title=Dynastien Bernadottes vapen och det svenska riksvapnet |series=Skrifter / utgivna av Riksheraldikerämbetet, 99-2298099-1 ; 1 |year=1944 |publisher=Svensk litteratur |location=Stockholm |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; chosen as a symbol of Sweden's eternal existence, as in the poem by [[Esaias Tegnér]]:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;As long as [[Charles's Wain]] still turns,
Its golden wheels around the Northern zone,
As long as the land still produces iron and heroes,
Intact shall stand the ancient Swedish throne.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This symbol became especially popular through its allusion to the name that had been borne by so many famous Swedish kings. [[Ursa Major]], or as it is called in Swedish, ''Karlavagnen'' (Charles' Wain), adds a Swedish accent to the Bernadotte dynastic coat of arms much in the same way as do the Vasa arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/early_history_of_heraldry/the_three_crowns_of_sweden.htm|title=The Heraldry Society|website=Theheraldrysociety.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Personal command-sign of the King of Sweden.svg|thumb|left|The personal command sign, for military use, of the King is a rendition of the emblazonment of the greater arms. Introduced by royal regulation in 1943, it has only been created once.]]

The arms are supported by two lions with forked tails (''queue fourchée''), facing away from the shield and crowned with Royal Crowns. For centuries, the lion has been an important element in Swedish heraldry and especially for the State Coat of Arms. The shield may be surmounted by the Collar of the [[Order of Seraphim]], the foremost order in Sweden, and the highest honour the Swedish state can bestow on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;See sections 2 and 3, Lag No. 268 om Sveriges Riksvapen of April 29, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being the official national coat of arms, the greater coat of arms is also the personal coat of arms of the king, and as such he can decree its use as a personal coat of arms by other members of the [[House of Bernadotte|Royal House]], with the alterations and additions decided by him.

[[Blazon]]: "The greater state arms consist of a head shield azure, quartered by a cross or with outbent arms, and an [[inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House.

In the first and fourth fields three coronets or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown or with armaments gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] and the [[House of Bernadotte]]. The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. Supported by two lions regardant or crowned, with parted tails and armaments gules, standing on a postament. All surrounded by hermine mantling crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseled strings or."

===Lesser version===
The lesser coat of arms is mainly used by the [[Government of Sweden]] and subordinate government authorities. As such it may be joined by insignias symbolising the activity of individual government agencies, following approval by the State Board of Heraldry. It is, for instance, embroidered on all [[Swedish police]] uniforms and in various coats of arms of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Blazon: "Azure, with three coronets Or, ordered two above one." Crowned with a royal crown. The shield may also be surrounded by the insignias of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4585">'''Creirwy''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈkrəirʊɨ}}) is a figure in the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and the ''[[s:The Mabinogion/Taliesin|Hanes Taliesin]]'' (the story of [[Taliesin]]'s life), daughter of the enchantress [[Ceridwen]] and [[Tegid Foel]] ("Tacitus the Bald"). The [[Welsh Triads]] name her one of the three most beautiful maids of the Isle of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Triads of Britain|Triads of Britain]]&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Penllyn (cantref)|Penllyn]] in [[Powys]], Wales, Creirwy (also known as ''Llywy'') has a dark, hideous brother named [[Morfran]] and a foster brother, [[Gwion Bach]] (who would become the bard Taliesin). She does not appear in the stories about [[Afagddu]] and Taliesin.

==Interpretation as a goddess==
[[Celtic Revival|Celtic]] researcher [[Edward Davies (Celtic)|Edward Davies]] deemed Creirwy "the [[Proserpina|Proserpine]] of the [[Britons (historical)|British]] [[Druid]]s"—also [[Comparative mythology|comparing]] her mother Ceridwen to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] of Roman myth.&lt;ref name=virago&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mythologyritesof00davirich ''The Mythology and Rites of the British Druids''], [https://archive.org/stream/mythologyritesof00davirich#page/205/mode/1up/ page 205]&lt;/ref&gt; Mythographer [[Jacob Bryant]] theorized that Creirwy and Ceridwen were essentially "the same mystical personage."&lt;ref name=virago /&gt;

Her name possibly means "sacred symbol of the egg" (i.e., "[[mundane egg]]", "[[adder stone]]") from the Welsh elements ''creir'' "a token, jewel, sacred object, relic, talisman, treasure, richly decorated article, object of admiration or love, darling, safeguard, strength, hand-bell, church-bell"&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, August. [http://thedarkavalonbooks.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/creirwy-the-lake-monster-of-bala-lakellyn-tegid/ "Creirwy, the Lake Monster of Bala Lake/Llyn Tegid?"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719142009/http://thedarkavalonbooks.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/creirwy-the-lake-monster-of-bala-lakellyn-tegid/ |date=2012-07-19 }} ''Dark Avalon Books''. Retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''wy'' "egg".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ŵy|Wiktionary: "ŵy"]]&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Druids, the mundane egg allegedly symbolized chaos, the beginning of all things, and upon it oaths were administered.

==Saint Creirwy==
This was also the name of a 6th-century Breton saint from Wales, daughter of Saint [[Gwen Teirbron|Gwen the Triple-Breasted]] and sister of the great regional saint [[Winwaloe]]. According to [[hagiographies]] of Winwaloe, Saint Creirwy ({{lang-la|Creirvia}}; {{lang-br|'''Klervi'''}}) as a young girl had one or both eyes gouged out by a wild [[goose]], but Winwaloe retrieved the eyeball(s) from the gander's belly and returned it/them to his little sister's [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit(s)]], and Creirwy's eyesight was miraculously restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://louis.buchillot.perso.sfr.fr/page369.htm#fiche5 "Sainte Chreirbia" (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, she is allegedly a patron saint of the blind. The story is memorialized in a 16th-century statue in Keravézan, [[Saint-Frégant]]; known as ''la fontaine de Saint Guénolé'', it depicts Winwaloe (Guénolé) holding the goose and the eyeball, with little Creirwy at his feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saint-fregant.e-monsite.com/pages/patrimoine/fontaine-de-saint-guenole.html Fontaine de Saint-Guénolé (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:br:Restr:St Frégant 2.jpg|A photo of the statue of Winwaloe and Creirwy on Breton Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the legend is dismissed by [[Sabine Baring-Gould|Baring-Gould]] and Fisher, who say it originated with an expression that "Creirwe" used; supposedly she would often say she "owed her eye to Winwaloe", but in reference to a much more ordinary childhood event, in which her brother stepped in and protected her when a wild goose flew at Creirwy and almost pecked out her eye.&lt;ref&gt;Anna of the blog ''Early Western Saints''.

Boyd grew up in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] and [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=age/&gt; and attended [[Manheim Township High School]] from 1992–1996. According to her website, she was born Danah Michele Mattas.&lt;ref name="db_hompage_name"/&gt; Once she reached college, she chose to take her maternal grandfather's name, Boyd, as her own last name. She decided to spell her name in lowercase so as "to reflect my mother's original balancing and to satisfy my own political irritation at the importance of capitalization."&lt;ref name=age/&gt;&lt;ref name="db_hompage_name"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
After her parents' divorce, in 1982, she moved to [[York County, Pennsylvania|York]], [[Pennsylvania]], with her mother and her brother. Her mother married again during danah's third grade and the family moved to [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]. She used online discussions forums to escape from high school. She called Lancaster a "religious and conservative" city. Having had online discussions on the topic, she decided to start identifying as [[queer]].&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/festival/article/2014/08/20/danah-boyd-anthropologue-de-la-generation-numerique_4473731_4415198.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, her brother taught her how to use [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] and [[Usenet]]. Even though she thought computers were "lame" at the time, the possibilities for connecting with others intrigued her. She became an avid participant on Usenet and IRC in her junior year in high school, spending a lot of time browsing, creating content, and conversing with strangers.&lt;ref name="danah.org"&gt;http://www.danah.org/aboutme.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though active in many extra-curricular activities and excelling academically, boyd had a difficult time socially in high school. She assigns "her survival to her mother, the Internet, and a classmate whose misogynistic comments inspired her to excel."&lt;ref name="danah.org"/&gt;

Her initial ambition was to become an astronaut but after an injury, she became more interested in the Internet.&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite news|title=A space of her own – Encounter with Danah Boyd|work=The Age |location=Australia|date=August 4, 2007|author=Debelle, Penelope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education ==
[[File:Danah Boyd.jpg|thumb|danah boyd in 2005, a speaker at Digital Identity conference in Chicago.]]
Boyd initially studied [[computer science]] at [[Brown University]], where she worked with [[Andries van Dam]] and wrote an undergraduate thesis about how "3-D computer systems used cues that were inherently sexist."&lt;ref name=age/&gt;  She pursued her master's degree in sociable media with [[Judith Donath]] at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. She worked for the New York-based activist organization [[V-Day (movement)|V-Day]], first as a volunteer (starting in 2004) and then as paid staff (2007–2009). She eventually moved to San Francisco, where she met the individuals involved in creating the new [[Friendster]] service. She documented what she was observing via her blog, and this grew into a career.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | work=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/technology/circuits/27frie.html | title=Decoding the New Cues in Online Society | last=Erard | first=Michael | date=November 27, 2003 | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604185643/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/technology/circuits/27frie.html | archivedate=June 4, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2006–07 academic year, boyd was a fellow at the [[Annenberg Center for Communication]] at the [[University of Southern California]]. She was a long-time fellow at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at Harvard University, where she co-directed the Internet Safety Technical Task Force,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/isttf/members | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | title=Members of the Internet Safety Technical Task Force | publisher=[[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then served on the Youth and Media Policy Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/digitalnatives/policy|title=Youth and Media Policy Working Group Initiative|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Danah Boyd (12776738645).jpg|thumb|Visualisation from one of boyd's lectures by Willow Brugh]]
While in graduate school, she was involved with a three-year ethnographic project funded by the MacArthur Foundation and led by [[Mimi Ito]]; the project examined youths' use of technologies through interviews, focus groups, observations, and document analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitallearning.macfound.org/site/c.enJLKQNlFiG/b.4773555/k.27DE/Mizuko_Ito.htm |title=MacArthur Foundation Project Summary |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalyouth.ischool.berkeley.edu/report |title=Final Report |work=The Digital Youth Project |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her publications included an article in the ''MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Learning, Identity Volume'' called "Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life."&lt;ref name=SocialNetwork&gt;{{cite journal |last=boyd |first=danah |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Buckingham |editor1-link= |title=Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life |journal=Youth, Identity, and Digital Media |series=The John D. and Catherine T.

The project culminated with a co-authored book "Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media."&lt;ref name="HangingOut"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ito |first=Mimi |title=Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |date=September 2009 |isbn=0-262-01336-3|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She published untraditional research on youth using Facebook and MySpace in 2007. She demonstrated that most young users of Facebook were white and middle-to-upper class, while MySpace users tended to be lower-class black teenagers. Her work is often translated and relayed to major media.&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr" /&gt; In addition to blogging on her own site, she addresses issues of youth and technology use on the [http://dmlcentral.net DMLcentral] blog. boyd has written academic papers and [[op-ed]] pieces on online culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |authorlink=Clay Shirky |title=[[Here Comes Everybody]] |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |date=February 28, 2008 |pages=224–5 |isbn=978-1-59420-153-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her career as a fellow at [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society|Harvard's Berkman Center]] started in 2007. In January 2009, boyd joined [[Microsoft Research]] New England, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], as a Social Media Researcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10047795-36.html|title=Microsoft hires social-net scholar Danah Boyd|author=McCarthy, Caroline|date=September 22, 2008|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, boyd founded [https://datasociety.net/ Data &amp; Society Research Institute] to address the social, technical, ethical, legal and policy issues that are emerging from data-centric technological development.

She was interviewed in the 2015 web documentary about internet privacy, ''[[Do Not Track (documentary)|Do Not Track]]''.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/14/brett-gaylor-do-not-track-interactive-documentary-privacy|title=Do not Track: an online, interactive documentary about who’s watching you|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=14 April 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, boyd is president of [[Data &amp; Society]],&lt;ref&gt;https://datasociety.net&lt;/ref&gt; a Principal Researcher at [[Microsoft Research]] and a Visiting Professor at [[New York University]]. She also serves on the board of directors of [[Crisis Text Line]] (since 2012),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/danahboyd&lt;/ref&gt; as a Trustee of the National Museum of the American Indian, on the board of the Social Science Research Council, and on the advisory board of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). Boyd is currently focused on research questions related to "big data" and AI, bias and manipulation of data, and how technology shapes inequality.

'''The East Side Kids''' were characters in a series of films released by [[Monogram Pictures]] from 1940 through 1945.  Many of them were originally part of [[Dead End Kids|The Dead End Kids]] and [[Little Tough Guys|The Little Tough Guys]], and several of them later became members of [[The Bowery Boys]].

==History==
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
When [[Samuel Goldwyn]] turned the play ''[[Dead End (play|Dead End]]'' into the [[Dead End (1937 film)|1937 film version]], he recruited the original tough-talking kids from the play ([[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Bobby Jordan]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Billy Halop]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]) to repeat their roles in the film. This led to the making of six other films starring [[The Dead End Kids]]. The most successful of these features were ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (1938) with [[James Cagney]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], and ''[[They Made Me a Criminal]]'' (1939), starring [[John Garfield]]. Universal offered a competing series, under the [[Little Tough Guys]] brand name, later combining the Little Tough Guys cast members with the Dead End Kids (minus Gorcey) as the Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys series.

==The East Side Kids==
In 1940 producer [[Sam Katzman]], noting the financial success of other tough-kid series,  made the film ''[[East Side Kids (film)|East Side Kids]]'' using two of the 'Little Tough Guys', Hally Chester and Harris Berger. He added former [[Our Gang]] player [[Donald Haines]], [[Frankie Burke]], radio actor Sam Edwards, and Eddie Brian to round out the new team. The film served as a kind of "pilot" for a possible series of films, which were eventually made possible by this film's success.

Katzman hired former Dead End Kid Bobby Jordan to play the lead in the first film in the series proper, ''[[Boys of the City]]'' and he was soon joined in the series by Leo Gorcey. Gorcey's brother David was also added, as well as (Ernie) [[Ernie Morrison|'Sunshine' Sammy Morrison]] as "Scruno," the only African-American in the group and a former child actor from the very first cast of the [[Our Gang]] comedy team.

In the first few films, [[Dave O'Brien (actor)|Dave O'Brien]] (familiar from low-budget westerns and serials, and as the accident-prone star of the [[Pete Smith Specialties|Pete Smith]] comedies) played Jordan's older brother ''Knuckles Dolan,'' who always seemed to be getting roped into chaperoning the kids from adventure to adventure. O'Brien appeared in different roles as well—continuity between films was often ignored. As with the Little Tough Guys, the membership of the team changed from film to film, until Huntz Hall joined in 1941, when the lineup was somewhat stabilized. In total, 20 actors were members of the team at one time or another.

[[File:Million Dollar Kid (1944) 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Bobby Stone]], [[Robert Greig]], [[Leo Gorcey]], and [[Huntz Hall]] in the film ''[[Million Dollar Kid]]'' (1944).]]
Always the outsider, Gabriel Dell drifted in and out of the series as a gang-member, a reporter, or a small-time hoodlum (as in ''Million Dollar Kid''). In ''Smart Alecks'' he's an ex-member who left the gang to pursue a life of crime. [[Stanley Clements]] also appeared in ''Smart Alecks'' as well as '''Neath Brooklyn Bridge'' and ''Ghosts on the Loose''. After Gorcey left the subsequent "Bowery Boys" series in 1956, Clements was chosen to replace him in the last seven films.

Monogram (which later became Allied Artists) was notorious for its "[[Poverty Row]]" productions, and the East Side films were no exception. With a minuscule budget of around $33,000 per feature and a tight shooting schedule of only 5–7 days, the series churned out three or four movies a year (an astonishing 21 films in less than six years). There was no time or money for subtlety, story development, or more than one or two takes per scene.

The stories always centered on the tough, pugnacious "Muggs McGinnis" (Gorcey) or the more innocent, clean-cut "Danny" (Bobby Jordan). Huntz Hall's "Glimpy" began as a minor character who grew in prominence as he was allowed to do more comedy bits over the course of the series. The loose format proved flexible enough to shift back and forth between urban drama (''That Gang of Mine''), murder mystery (''Boys of the City''), boxing melodrama (''Bowery Blitzkrieg''), and horror-comedy (''Spooks Run Wild''), with the kids confronting various stock villains: gangsters, smugglers, spies, and crooked gamblers, along the way. The East Side films were problem-teen melodramas until 1943, when director [[William Beaudine]] joined the series and emphasized the comedy content. He encouraged the actors to improvise freely, adding to the films' spontaneous charm.

The contemporaneous events of World War II affected the series as well as the cast.  In 1943 Béla Lugosi (who was in ''Spooks Run Wild'') returned as a Nazi saboteur in the incongruously-titled ''Ghosts on the Loose'' which also featured a young [[Ava Gardner]]; a German-Japanese spy ring was thwarted in the blatantly patriotic ''[[Let's Get Tough!]]'' from 1942 (with Gabriel Dell, of all people, as a Nazi spy). At the end of ''[[Kid Dynamite (film)|Kid Dynamite]]'' Muggs, Danny, and Glimpy enlist and show off their uniforms. In ''Follow The Leader'' (1944), Muggs and Glimpy appear in uniform as they are on leave from the Army. Offscreen, between 1942 and 1944, cast members [[Billy Benedict]], Morrison, Jordan, Dell, and David Gorcey left the series after being drafted. A few days after receiving ''his'' induction notice, Leo Gorcey suffered a near-fatal motorcycle accident and spent almost a year in recovery. His injuries led to a 4-F classification, rendering him unfit for military service.

During Bobby Jordan's absence, his role in the series was taken by former child actor David Durand. Durand had been the star of Columbia's series of "Glove Slingers" campus comedies, and lent the same earnest sincerity to his East Side Kids appearances. (Jordan returned in 1944, in uniform, for a guest appearance in ''Bowery Champs''.)

Starting with ''Clancy Street Boys'' in 1943, Bernard Gorcey (Leo's father) did various bit parts, playing different characters in a total of seven films. In ''Million Dollar Kid'' he and Leo exchanged banter borrowed from an Abbott and Costello routine. He later became a fixture with [[The Bowery Boys]].

Given the low budgets, simplistic stories, and crude, assembly-line production of the East Side Kids series, its enduring popularity relies on the cast's rambunctious energy, breezy banter (often ad-libbed and containing inside jokes), fast-paced action, and Leo Gorcey's trademark [[malapropism|malapropisms]] ("This calls for drastic measurements").

The East Side Kids series was supplanted by [[The Bowery Boys]] in 1946.

== History ==
The Flag of the President of Azerbaijan was confirmed by the decree №828 of the [[President of Azerbaijan]] on “The Standard (flag) of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan” dated September 15, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://azertag.az/xeber/Sentyabrin_15_de_Prezident_Ilham_Aliyev_Azerbaycan_Respublikasi_Prezidentinin_standarti_bayragi_haqqinda_Ferman_imzalamisdir-418434|title=President of Azerbaijan signs Decree on Presidential Standard of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-04-19|archive-url=https://azertag.az/xeber/Sentyabrin_15_de_Prezident_Ilham_Aliyev_Azerbaycan_Respublikasi_Prezidentinin_standarti_bayragi_haqqinda_Ferman_imzalamisdir-418434|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree came into force on the same day of its issuance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://e-qanun.az/alpidata/framework/data/15/f_15400.htm|title=Decree on the Presidential Standard of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=e-qanun.az|archive-url=http://e-qanun.az/alpidata/framework/data/15/f_15400.htm|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/remz_bayraq.pdf|title=Standard of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=Administrative Department of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Presidential Library|archive-url=http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/remz_bayraq.pdf|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
[[File:Inauguration Ceremony 2013.jpg|thumb|Inauguration ceremony of the President of Azerbaijan with Flag of Azerbaijan (left) and Presidential Flag (right)]]
According to the Decree, the Standard of the President of Azerbaijan is the official symbol of the [[President of Azerbaijan]]. The original version of the Presidential Standard is kept in the office of the President at the Presidential Palace. The duplicates of Presidential Flag can be placed, hung or raised on the buildings of Presidential Palace and Presidential residences; also can be placed in the halls or rooms of Presidential Palace or Presidential residences if any official event is intended to be conducted in the presence of the President; on other premises when the President of Azerbaijan is visiting; in the halls or on the building, where official or other types of events are being held with the participation of the [[President of Azerbaijan]]; and on the vehicles of the President.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Presidential flag is also used during inaugural ceremony. It is brought onto the stage by the soldiers of the Armed Forces under the accompaniment of the ceremonial march during inauguration ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.president.az/articles/9667|title=Official inauguration of Ilham Aliyev 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=en.president.az|language=en|archive-url=https://en.president.az/articles/9667|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://azertag.az/xeber/XALQA_VATANA_VA_DOVLATA_SADAQAT_ANDI_AZARBAYCAN_RESPUBLIKASININ_PREZIDENTI_ILHAM_ALIYEVIN_ANDICHMA_MARASIMI-422046|title=Inauguration ceremony of the President of Azerbaijan (2008)|last=|first=|date=|work=AZERBAIJAN STATE NEWS AGENCY|access-date=2018-04-19|archive-url=https://azertag.az/xeber/XALQA_VATANA_VA_DOVLATA_SADAQAT_ANDI_AZARBAYCAN_RESPUBLIKASININ_PREZIDENTI_ILHAM_ALIYEVIN_ANDICHMA_MARASIMI-422046|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The Presidential Flag is like a square version of the tricolor [[Flag of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani flag]] with the [[National emblem of Azerbaijan|Coat of Arm of Azerbaijan]] on both sides of red stripe instead of white crescent and eight-pointed star. The Presidential Flag is framed with golden fringes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is silver cord attached to the pole of the Presidential Flag illustrating the full name of the [[President of Azerbaijan]] and the date of his term of office. The pole of the flag is covered with a metal hood in crescent and 8 point star shape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Outline of story ==
[[File:25 tam back.jpg|thumb| Backside of Tibetan [[Historical money of Tibet|25 tam banknote]], dated 1659 of the Tibetan Era (= 1913 CE). On the right, the four harmonious animals are represented.]]
A popular scene often found as wall paintings in Tibetan religious buildings represents an elephant standing under a fruit tree carrying a monkey, a hare and a bird (usually a partridge, but sometimes a grouse, and in Bhutan a [[hornbill]]) on top of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gruschke|first1=Andreas|title=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: The Qinghai part of Amdo|date=2001|publisher=White Lotus Press|location=Bangkok|isbn=9747534592|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GuKfAAAAMAAJ|series=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: Amdo|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene refers to a legend which tells that four animals were trying to find out who was the oldest. The elephant said that the tree was already fully grown when he was young, the monkey that the tree was small when he was young, the hare that he saw the tree as a sapling when he was young and the bird claimed that he had excreted the seed from which the tree grew. So the bird was recognized by the other animals as the oldest, and the four animals lived together in co-dependence and cooperation, helping each other to enjoy the fruits of the tree.

Communal harmony and respect for seniority are the main moral of the story. Such respect stands in contrast with a [[pecking-order]] according to strength, size and power: it is {{em|the partridge}} which is most respected, not the elephant.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Penjore|first1=Ugyen|title=Understanding the symbolism of Thuenpa Puen Zhi|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=40,1531,0,0,1,0#.WI0s0FUrK70|via=The Buddhist Channel|accessdate=28 January 2017|work=Kuensel Online|date=2 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Buddha did sometimes downplay the value respecting older people merely for their age, in this story he illustrates that a senior person should nonetheless be respected for their experience, because, as Tachibana points out, "the maturity of age is generally the sign of much experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tachibana|first1=S.|title=The ethics of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BRWyqi2K4WUC|date=1992|publisher=[[Curzon Press]]|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=978-0-7007-0230-5|page=224|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story led to the establishment of several rules of conduct with regard to respect for seniority in the context of the monastic life, in which the {{em|number of years ordained}} as a [[Bhikkhu|monk]] (''{{lang-sa|bhikṣu}}''; ''{{lang-pi|bhikkhu}}'') is measured, rather than {{em|age}}.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Sarah|title=The Jatakas: Birth Stories of the Bodhisatta|date=2006|publisher=[[Penguin UK]]|isbn=9788184750348|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ay4WFGQtSy0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] explains the relation between respect for seniority and harmony, drawing from the story: "A hierarchy based on seniority, however, is both objective and, in the long run, less oppressive: One's place in the hierarchy is not a measure of one's worth.  Such a hierarchy also discourages the pride and competition that would come if bhikkhus could fight their way up the hierarchy by outdoing the measurable merit of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc2.pdf|title=The Buddhist Monastic Code|date=2013|publisher=[[Metta Forest Monastery]]|year=|isbn=|edition=3rd|volume=II|location=California|page=92|pages=|quote=|author-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|via=|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four animals represent the different [[habitats]] of the animal world—the sky, the trees, the ground, and underground.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The partridge assumes the role of the most senior animal: in pre-modern India, the partridge was highly regarded for its intelligence and understanding  of language.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez 2014"&gt;{{cite thesis|title=The Parrot’s Voice and the Partridge’s Feathers: The Languaging of Animals and Animal Language in Early Indian Texts|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/28521|first=Andrea Lorene|last=Gutiérrez|publisher=[[The University of Texas]]|type=M.A. Thesis|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excreting of the seed of the tree is relevant, because some Indian trees are believed to only sprout when the seed is excreted by a bird, thus further amplifying the concept of cooperation and mutual dependence.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|53}} The image of the animals standing on each other’s shoulders, on the back of a patient elephant, also portrays social and environmental harmony: the bird finds a seed and plants it, then the rabbit waters it, and the monkey fertilizes it. Once the seed sprouts and begins to grow, the elephant protects it. After some time, the small plant grows into a big, beautiful tree full of healthy fruit. By working together and using their individual talents, the four friends are able to reach and enjoy the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/pdf/Signs/Bhutan/BH_PRG_03.pdf|title=The Four Harmonious Friends|last=|first=|date=12 June 2008|website=[[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary source for the Buddhist legend of the four harmonious brothers is the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka|Vinayavastu]]'' ({{bo|w='dul ba'i gzhi}}), which forms the first section of the [[Kangyur]], the canon of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Dagyab 2016" /&gt;{{rp|107}}&lt;ref name="sagaster" /&gt; In canons of other Buddhist traditions, such as in the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravāda]] Buddhism, and in the texts of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]], [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūla-Sarvāstivāda]] and [[Sarvāstivāda]] orders, almost the same ''Jātaka'' tale is found in the ''Vinaya'' and ''Jātaka'' collections. The [[Dharmaguptaka]] and [[Mahīśāsaka]] orders did not consider the story part of the ''Jātaka'', however, and only included it in their ''Vinayas''. [[Bhikkhu Analayo]] believes that originally the story was not considered a previous life of the Buddha, but only a [[didactic]] [[parable]] taught by the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Analayo 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anālayo|first1=Bhikkhu|author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Canonical Jātaka Tales in Comparative Perspective: The Evolution of Tales of the Buddha's Past Lives|journal=Fuyan Buddhist Studies|date=2012|volume=7|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/38470683/CanonicalJatakas.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1485644573&amp;Signature=et7fWx%2FMyFxtAwEa%2BgTKug1ISow%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCanonical_Jataka_Tales_in_Comparative_Pe.pdf|publisher=Fuyan Buddhist Institute|location=[[Hsinchu]]|issn=2070-0512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Irish]] scholar [[Eleanor Hull]] has pointed out that the story may reveal a custom of the ancient world to determine the date based on the life spans of different animals. Stories dealing with the question which animal lives the longest are found throughout the world. Asiatic versions of the story usually feature three animals, as indeed, the Pali and Chinese versions of the ''Jātaka'' do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hull|first1=Eleanor|author-link=Eleanor Hull|title=The Hawk of Achill or the Legend of the Oldest Animals|journal=Folklore|date=December 1932|volume=43|issue=4|pages=377, 383|doi=10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ralston|first1=W.R.S.|title=The Bible of Tibet: Tibetan Tales from Indian Sources|date=2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-136-20297-1|page=302|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eoiZAeFA_8YC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the fourth animal not present in the Pali version, the hare—it was included in later versions.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimball|first1=Mike|title=Our heritage is already broken: meditations on a regenerative conservation for cultural and natural heritage|journal=Human Ecology Review|date=2016|page=13|doi=10.4225/13/581fcdf8dc329|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1885/100985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Heiling''' (Jan Svatoš in [[Czech language|Czech]]) is a legendary person in [[Germany|German]] and [[Bohemia]]n mythology.

The stories originate from German inhabitants of [[Loket (Sokolov District)|Loket]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]). The son of a water fairy from the river [[Ohře]], who taught him to master magic and command spirits. Once he had become rich and powerful, he ordered the spirits under his command to build a great city. The granite rocks above the Ohře, named [[Hans-Heiling-Felsen]] (Svatošské Skály in Czech), were believed to be the ruins of this city.&lt;ref name="cz"&gt;[http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5492 COT.cz tourism site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011002443/http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5492 |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hans Heiling discovered that he could not achieve human happiness even with his supernatural powers, he discarded them and died fighting a bear. Another variant of the story is that the rock formation is a [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]] wedding party. A notable [[opera]] of the [[Hans Heiling|same name]] was inspired by the tale.

The poem "Ballad", by [[Gerda Mayer]], is based on the wedding party variant and appears in The Oxford Book of Story Poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Book of Story Poems|year=1990|publisher=OUP|isbn=0 19 276087 4|pages=27–29|editor=Michael Harrison and Christopher Stuart-Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jackie Chan Stunt Team''' ({{zh|t=成家班|cy=Sing Ga Ban|l=Chan's Family Group}}), also known as '''Jackie Chan's Stuntmen Association''' is a group of [[stunt double|stuntmen]] and [[martial arts|martial artists]] who work alongside [[Jackie Chan]].

==History==
The JC Stunt Team was established in 1976 and originated from the relationships Chan formed in his early starring roles in [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action movies]]. Several of his co-stars and stuntmen hired by the [[movie studio|film studios]] began working together regularly. This engendered a familiarity of one another's skills and abilities and it made sense for them to become a working team. Some of the members had received training at the [[Peking Opera school]]s, similar to Chan.

By 1983, and the release of the film ''[[Project A]]'', the stunt team had become an official organisation of 6 members. The organisation meant that the stuntmen not only received [[Insurance|insurance coverage]], but also a monthly salary and higher pay.
By the time of ''[[Police Story 2]]'' in 1988, the team had expanded to around 20 members.
This incarnation of the team was disbanded in 1990 and thereafter, individual members were contracted and used on a film-by-film basis rather than all members remaining on the payroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The formation of Chan's team influenced others in the [[Film industry|business]] to follow suit, particularly his former co-stars and "brothers" [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]] (their stunt teams known as "Hung Ga Ban" and "Yuen Ga Ban" respectively). Other actors who formed their own stunt teams include [[Lau Kar-leung]], [[Philip Ko]], [[Stanley Tong]] and [[Bruce Law]].
Chan's stunt team worked in collaboration with Sammo Hung's team on films including [[Thunderbolt (1995 film)|Thunderbolt]] and [[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]].
A small number of films that Chan produced but did not appear in, or was not involved in at all, have utilised his stunt team. These include ''The Gold Hunters'' (1981), ''[[Rouge (film)|Rouge]]'' (1988), ''The Inspector Wears Skirts 2'' (1989), ''Stage Door Johnny'' (1990) and ''Angry Ranger'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Between July 5 and July 7, 2017, four young men were reported missing in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].  All were subsequently found murdered.  The victims were Dean A. Finocchiaro, age 19; Thomas C. Meo, age 21; Jimi T. Patrick, age 19; and Mark R. Sturgis, age 22.

The murders are suspected to have been carried out by cousins Cosmo DiNardo and Sean Michael Kratz, both age 20 at the times of the murder.&lt;ref name=CNNCousins&gt;{{cite web |last=Levenson|first=Eric |title=Cousins charged in homicides of four Pennsylvania men|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/14/us/missing-pennsylvania-men-charges/index.html |website=[[CNN]] |date=14 July 2017 |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four victims were murdered, in three separate incidents, after DiNardo arranged to sell them [[marijuana]].&lt;ref name=NBCDiNardoKratzKill&gt;{{cite web |last=McCrone|first=Brian |title=Cosmo DiNardo, Sean Kratz Charged With Allegedly Killing Young Men at Bucks County Farm|url=http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Second-Man-Sean-Michael-Kratz-Held-in-Connection-to-Four-Murders-at-Bucks-County-Pennsylvania-Farm-Day-After-Cosmo-DiNardo-Confesses-434503403.html |website=[[NBC]] Philadelphia |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt;

The disappearances began on July 5, with Patrick being the first of the men to vanish. Two days later, on July 7, Meo, Finocchiaro, and Sturgis were also reported missing.

His remains were found in a common grave on a [[Solebury Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Solebury Township]] farm (owned by DiNardo's parents), along with the remains of Mark Sturgis and Thomas Meo on July 12, 2017.

This was the first murder in which Kratz was involved; the two men repeatedly shot Finocchiaro. His body was placed in a metal oil tank that had been converted to a pork roaster.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt;
* Mark R. Sturgis (November 20, 1994 {{ndash}} July 7, 2017) went to meet his friend Thomas C. Meo (January 30, 1996 {{ndash}} July 7, 2017) at around 6:00 PM on July 7. Both men worked for Sturgis' father's construction company. The two did not show up for work and calls to their cellphones went directly to voice mail.&lt;ref name=NYTSearch/&gt; DiNardo met with Sturgis and Meo at a church to sell Meo marijuana.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt; Meo and Sturgis were both shot as they exited their truck.

DiNardo attempted unsuccessfully to burn the bodies using gasoline.&lt;ref name="CNNCousins" /&gt; He used the backhoe to bury the tank containing the three bodies.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt;

DiNardo, a drug dealer, confessed to killing the four men; he said he did so because he felt cheated or threatened during drug transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://articles.mlive.com/news/us-world/index.ssf/2017/07/suspect_in_pennsylvania_slayin.amp |title=Suspect in Pennsylvania slaying of 4 men burned bodies in a drum after drug deals, source said|first=Tanda |last=Gmiter|date=14 July 2017|work=MLive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only motive disclosed by investigators was that DiNardo said he wanted to set the victims up when they came to the farm to buy marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20170714/NEWS/170719777 |title=Grisly details revealed after 2 men charged in killing of missing men in Bucks|first1=Maryclaire|

Second cousins&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt; Cosmo DiNardo (born January 21, 1997) and Sean Michael Kratz (born February 14, 1997), both age 20, were charged in the murders.

On July 10, DiNardo was arrested for an unrelated weapons charge.&lt;ref name=NYTSearch/&gt; He was not allowed to own a firearm due to his [[schizophrenia]]; nevertheless, at least one of the firearms used by the perpetrators belonged to DiNardo's mother.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBCDiNardoKratzCharged&gt;{{cite web |last=McCausland|first=Phil |title=Cosmo Dinardo, Sean Michael Kratz Charged With Killing Four in Pennsylvania |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cosmo-dinardo-second-man-charged-killing-four-pennsylvania-n783086 |website=[[NBC News]] |date=14 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite 30 run-ins with local police, DiNardo, the son of a wealthy businessman, had, for unexplained reasons, never been convicted of a crime.&lt;ref name=NYTManAdmits&gt;{{cite web |last=Hurdle| first=Jon |title=Man Admits to Killings of 4 Missing Men in Pennsylvania, Lawyer Says |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/us/bucks-county-missing-pennsylvania.html |website=[[New York Times]] |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiNardo was later released after his father posted 10% of the $1 million bail.&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt;

On July 12, DiNardo was arrested and charged for stealing and attempting to sell a car that belonged to Thomas Meo for $500.&lt;ref name=BCCTCosmoConfessed&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Malley|first=James |title=BREAKING: Cosmo DiNardo defense attorney says client confessed to 'participation in murders of four young men'|url=http://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/news/crime/breaking-cosmo-dinardo-defense-attorney-says-client-confessed-to-participation/article_1d6dcb02-67d9-11e7-908b-1bc4ab8b99aa.html |website=Bucks County Courier Times |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicion was also raised by the fact that Meo left his [[insulin]] in the car, something his family said was unusual for him to do.&lt;ref name=BCCTCosmoConfessed/&gt; His bail was set at $5 million. The next day, DiNardo confessed to the murder of the four men. In exchange for his confession, prosecutors stated that they would not seek the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt;

The day after his confession, DiNardo was charged with four counts of criminal homicide, conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, abuse of corpse, and 12 other charges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4472">'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani''' is a name shared by two short-lived princes and heirs to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. Both were named after their father [[Kamehameha III]]. In [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], the name means "the red trail of heaven", signifying the roadway by which the god descends from heaven.

'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani I''' (1839–1839) was the eldest son of [[Kamehameha III]] and his queen consort [[Kalama Hakaleleponi-i-Kapakuhaili]].  The baby boy was named after his father whose full name was Keaweawe{{okina}}ula Kiwala{{okina}}o Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa Kalani Waiakua Kalanikau Iokikilo Kiwala{{okina}}o i ke kapu Kamehameha.  The royal suffix o-Kalani was added in to signified this Prince of [[Heaven]].

The young Prince Keawe died shortly after his birth. His death left Kamehameha III again childless. His younger brother, Keaweaweʻulaokalani II, would not be born until 1842.

'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani II''' (1842–1842) was the second son of [[Kamehameha III]] and his queen consort [[Kalama Hakaleleponi-i-Kapakuhaili]].  The baby boy was the namesake of his father and his brother.

Initially given in ''[[hānai]]'' to [[Kalākua Kaheiheimālie]], he was instead adopted or ''hānai'' by his grand aunt, [[Kekāuluohi]] and her husband [[Charles Kanaina|Kana{{okina}}ina]] when the old governess of Maui died not three days after his birth. The King promised that he would be sent to the [[Chiefs' Children's School]] once he was weaned and could walk. He soon developed a fever and died, at the age of only 31 days. Dr. Baldwin of Lahaina was convinced that the child was killed by traditional medicinal treatment.

'''Fib''' is a mythological Pictish prince mentioned in the [[Pictish Chronicle]]. He was king of the Fib Kingdom (Fife), he ruled for 24 years along with his brothers, Cat, Fidach, Cé, Fótla, Circinn and Fortriu. He was the son of Cruithne, king of all of the Picts who supposedly ruled for 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/GaelsPictland.htm|title=Kingdoms of Caledonia &amp; Ireland - Pictland|last=Kessler|first=P L|website=www.historyfiles.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fib's rule may of been 715-691 BCE according to the Pictish Chronicles "Fibaid xxiiij" which translates to Fib ruled for 24 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kjhskj75z.talktalk.net/pictish.html|title=THE PICTISH CHRONICLE|website=www.kjhskj75z.talktalk.net|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2017}} The chronicles also state that the brothers ruled one after the other.&lt;gallery&gt;

'''Liath Luachra''', the "'''Gray of Luachair'''", is the name of two characters in the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. Both appear in ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn]]'', which details the young life and adventures of the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]].

The first Liath Luachra is one of Fionn's foster mothers who raise him after the death of his father [[Cumhal]] at the hands of [[Goll mac Morna]]. She is a great warrior and a companion of Fionn's aunt, the druidess [[Bodhmall]]; together they raise the boy in secret in the forest of [[Slieve Bloom Mountains|Sliabh Bladhma]]. Eventually Fionn's ever-spreading fame threatens to bring his father's killers to him, and his caretakers send him to find his own way. By this point they have taught him enough that he can survive on his own, and he goes into the king of [[Bantry]]'s service.

The second Liath Luachra is a tall, hideous warrior and a member of the [[Fianna]]. He had been an enemy of Cumhal, and even dealt him the first blow in the battle at which he died. Later Goll mac Morna gave him possession of Cumhal's treasures, and made him the Fianna's official treasurer. His ''corrbolg'' or ''crane bag'' is one of the warrior band's great treasures. Eventually he kills a young warrior named Glonda; Fionn sees the man's mother crying blood over the murder and decides to avenge him. He kills Liath easily and takes his treasure from him. This Liath has a son, [[Conán mac Lia]], who becomes lord of Luchair and a marauder against Fionn and the Fianna. He is eventually reconciled with the group and joins them.

A [[polyglotism|polyglot]] is a person with a command of many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=polyglot &amp;#124; Collins Dictionary|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/polyglot|website=Collins Dictionary|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A polyglot may also be called a [[multilingualism|multilingual person]]; the label "multilingual" is used for communities as well as individual speakers.

[[Richard Hudson (linguist)|Richard Hudson]], professor emeritus of [[linguistics]] at [[University College London]], coined the term "hyperpolyglot" for "people 
who know dozens of languages well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson |first=Richard |year=2008 |chapter=Word grammar, cognitive linguistics, and second language learning and teaching |title=Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition |editor=P. Robinson and N. Ellis |pages=89–113 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Polyglot of Bologna |url=http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/06/26/the-polyglot-of-bologna/ |last=Erard |first=Michael |date=June 2012 |publisher=Public Domain Review |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars apply the label to speakers of even more languages: twelve, sixteen, or in the most extreme cases, even fifty or more.&lt;ref name="Poly"&gt;{{cite web|last=Erard |first=Michael |title=How many languages is it possible for a person to speak? |url=http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/11/how_many_langua_1.html |publisher=The Five Minute Linguist |accessdate=11 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413031021/http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/11/how_many_langua_1.html |archivedate=13 April 2010 |date=3 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to judge which individuals are polyglots, as there is no uncontroversial definition for what it means to "master" a language, and because it is not always clear where to distinguish a [[dialect]] from a [[language]].  Being able to communicate in a language does not mean the person has "mastered" a language.  There are far fewer who have attained higher levels of multi-linguistic skill, and there is no basis for testing those levels, or at least those levels of ability have not been noted here.

This list consists of people who have been noted in news media, historical texts, or academic work as speaking five or more languages fluently. For general discussion of the phenomenon, including discussion of polyglot [[savant syndrome|savants]], see [[polyglotism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15524">The entries in this tabulation cover some 150 years in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the private residents of [[Covent Garden]] included many people of rank and note. They ranged from [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|marquesses to barons]], foreign ambassadors and members of parliament to physicians, surgeons, antiquaries, artists, authors and dramatists. Some of the later arrivals were auctioneers, such as Christopher Cock and [[Abraham Langford]], who found rich sources for future sales amongst their neighbours. 

Most of the entries are derived from ''The Piazza: Notable private residents in the Piazza'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Piazza: Notable private residents in the Piazza | website = British History Online | publisher = Institute of Historical Research, University of London | date = | url = https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol36/pp96-97 | access-date = 10 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is based on Sheppard's ''Survey of London: Volume 36, Covent Garden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Survey of London: Volume 36, Covent Garden | website = British History Online | publisher = Institute of Historical Research, University of London | date = | url = https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol36 | access-date = 18 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources are noted where appropriate.

'''Llwyd ap Cil Coed''' is a character in the Third Branch of The [[Mabinogi]], known also as the story of ''[[Four Branches of the Mabinogi#Manawyddan, son of Llyr|Manawydan ap Llŷr]]''. 

==Role in the Third Branch==

Llwyd is a friend of [[Gwawl]] ap Clud, who had been insulted by [[Pwyll]] in the First Branch. Llwyd decides to avenge this insult upon [[Pryderi]] son of Pwyll by making barren and empty the kingdom of [[Dyfed]]. Later, by means of an enchanted bowl in a mysterious fortress, he imprisons Pryderi and [[Rhiannon]], Pwyll's widow and Pryderi's mother. Llwyd apparently makes Rhiannon bear the yokes of his horses, while Pryderi had to carry the gate hammers, while they are in captivity. 

Only [[Manawydan]], Rhiannon's new husband, and Pryderi's wife [[Cigfa]] remain in Dyfed. They try to plant grain, but their crop is destroyed by mice. Manawydan chases the pests away, but catches one that is fat and slower than the others, and sets out to hang it for theft. A cleric, a priest, and a bishop come by one at a time and beg Manawydan to spare the mouse, but he refuses until the bishop agrees to remove the enchantment from Dyfed. He finally reveals himself as Llwyd in disguise, and admits that the mice were really his attendants magically transformed. The mouse is his pregnant wife, Gwenaby, but Manawydan refuses to free her until Llwyd also releases Rhiannon and Pryderi and pledges to take no further revenge. Llwyd agrees to these terms, and turns his wife back into a beautiful woman.

==Other appearances==

A character named '''Llwydeu ap Cilcoed''' appears in the early [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'' in which he is named as one of the many knights of [[King Arthur|Arthur's]] court. After stealing a [[cauldron]] from Diwrnach the Irishman, Arthur and his men land at Llywdeu's house in Porth Cerddin in [[Dyfed]].

[[Saint]] '''Lupus of Sens''' (or '''Saint Loup de Sens''') (born c. 573; died c. 623)&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3D0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA716#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Sens |first=Georges |last=Goyau |editor1-last=Herberman |editor1-first=Charles G.|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia|The Catholic Encyclopedia]] |others=Volume 13: Revelation–Simon Stock |publisher=The Encyclopedia Press |location=New York |year=1913 |page=716|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an early French [[bishop of Sens]].

He was the son of Betton, Count of Tonnerre, "[[Blessed Betto]]," a member of the [[royal house]] of the [[Kingdom of Burgundy]].&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Church in Saint-Loup-de-Naud==

The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church dedicated to Saint Loup at [[Saint-Loup-de-Naud|Naud]], 8&amp;nbsp;km from [[Provins]] in Champagne in the east of France is distinguished by the outstanding sculptures in the porch of its great doorway, with an ambitious [[iconography|iconographic program]] in which Saint Loup mediates entry into the mystery of the [[Trinity]]. About 980, Sevinus, [[archbishop of Sens]], made a gift to the [[Benedictine order|Benedictine community]] of the [[abbey of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif]] at Sens of four altars ''in villa que dicitus Naudus, in honore sancti lupi consecratum''&amp;mdash;"in the demesne that is called Naud, consecrated in honor of Saint Loup"&amp;mdash;betokening the presence of a shrine already on this site, a priory under the direction of the abbot of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif. Other documents mention [[Saint-Loup-de-Naud]] among the possessions of the abbey at Sens, seat of an archbishop with close political ties to the French Crown, who had Paris within his diocese. Thus, though it lay so close to Provins, a seat of the [[counts of Champagne]] and the abbey church was completed by Henri le Libéral, comte de Champagne, the priory at Saint-Loup-de-Naud looked to Sens for its patronage: a visit from the abbot is documented in 1120. In 1160/61 Hugues de Toucy, Archbishop of Sens, presented to the priory the relic of Saint Loup, brought from the abbey of Sainte-Colombe, to that community's dismay;&lt;ref&gt;William W. Kibler, ed., ''Medieval France: an encyclopedia'', ''s.v.'' "Saint-Loup-de-Naud".&lt;/ref&gt; the sculpted ''portail'' with an iconography comparable to the royal portal at [[Chartres]]&lt;ref&gt;Clark Maines, ''The Western Portals at Saint-Loup-de-Naud'', (New York: Garland) 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; was doubtless undertaken shortly thereafter, when [[pilgrimage]]s brought wealth to the community.

The priory was laid waste by the English in 1432, during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and again by the [[Huguenots]] in 1567, during the [[French Wars of Religion]].

==Other saints Lupus/Loup==

Numerous communes of France are named Saint-Loup;&lt;ref&gt;For a full list of French places with this name, see [[Saint-Loup (disambiguation)|Saint-Loup]]. There is also a Saint-Loup in [[Namur (city)|Namur]], Belgium, and another in Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; they commemorate several venerable early saints with the Latinized Germanic name of ''Lupus'' ("wolf"): besides Saint Loup de Sens, venerated in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], [[Île-de-France]] and [[Picardy]] there are [[Lupus of Troyes|Saint Loup de Troyes]], Saint Loup de [[Bayeux]], one of the early Bishops of Bayeux; and—more locally venerated—Saint Loup de [[Limoges]], Saint Loup de [[Soissons]], and Saint Loup de [[Châlons-en-Champagne]]. A number of the communes called Saint-Loup in the west of France are not easily connected with a specific Saint Loup.

[[File:Melchior Lotter the Elder (1470-1549).jpg|thumb|Melchior Lotter the Elder]]
[[File:Lotterbibel.jpg|thumb|Bible printed by Lotter]]

'''Lotter''' was the last name of a family of [[Germany|German]] printers, intimately connected with the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

The founder of the family was '''Melchior Lotter''', the elder, born at [[Aue]], and well-known at [[Leipzig]] as early as 1491. He published [[missal]]s, [[Breviary|breviaries]], a ''[[Aulus Persius Flaccus|Persius]]'' (1512), ''Horatii Epistol&amp;aelig;'' (1522), and ''Luther Tessaradecos Consolatoria pro Laborantibus'' (1520). His relations with the Reformation are not perfectly clear, but he seems to have been a sympathizer.  An innovation by the elder Lotter was his use of [[Latin alphabet|Roman letters]] for [[Latin]], reserving the [[Gothic type]]s for [[German language|German]].

His son was also named Melchior (died c. 1542), which has resulted in some bibliographical confusion. '''Melchior''', the younger, is best known for printing [[Martin Luther]]'s Bible, ''[[Luther Bible|Das Neue Testament]]'' (1522), and the impressions of 1523 and 1524 of the [[Old Testament]], which was transferred afterward to [[Hans Lufft]].  He published many other German writings of Luther.  Only a little less important was his bringing a [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Typeface|font]] to [[Wittenberg]], thus giving [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] the means to carry on classes in Greek.  When he returned to Leipzig, about 1525, Lotter carried on his father's business.

The '''name-letter effect''' is the tendency of people to prefer the [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] in their [[personal name|name]] over other letters in the [[alphabet]]. Whether [[Human subject research|subjects]] are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out of a set of two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.

Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian [[psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]], the name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for [[initial]]s, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both [[given name|given]] and [[surname|family names]] still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.

Most people [[self-esteem|like themselves]]; the name is associated with the [[psychology of self|self]], and hence the letters of the name are preferred, despite the fact that they appear in many other words. People who [[self-hatred|do not like themselves]] tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to [[birthday]]s: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as [[mere-exposure effect|frequent exposure]] and early mastery, have been ruled out. In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate [[implicit self-esteem]].

There is some evidence that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor [[brand]]s matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to [[disaster relief]] following [[hurricane]]s with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following [[Hurricane Katrina]]). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.

== Background ==
Systematic interest in the letter preference began in 1959 with [[brand preference|brand-preference]] studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s for use in package labels.{{sfn|Mecherikoff|Horton|1959||p=114}} In an extension of the studies, [[Human subject research|subjects]] were asked to rank the [[English alphabet]] by the pleasantness of the appearance of [[letter case|capital letter]]s. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the [[coefficient of concordance|coefficients of concordance]] were low),{{sfn|Horton|Mecherikoff|1960|p=253}} a strong [[positive correlation]] was found between a letter's average rank and how [[frequency of letters|frequently]] it occurred as an initial letter of family names.{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|pp=124–125}}

[[Robert Zajonc]], a [[social psychologist]], published research in 1968 into preferences between pairs of [[word]]s (e.g. "on" or "off"): in the overwhelming majority of trials the preferred word was also the most common.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|pp=6–7}} Zajonc also tested preferences for [[nonsense word]]s and found that people liked them the more they heard them.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=24}} He interpreted these results as evidence that [[mere exposure effect|mere repeated exposure]] to a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is sufficient to enhance its attractiveness.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=1}}

Around 1977, Belgian [[experimental psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]] was driving on a highway looking at [[license plate]]s when he noticed that he preferred plates containing letters from his own name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} He wondered if people in general would prefer stimuli that are somehow connected to them; a "mere belongingness" as opposed to Zajonc's mere exposure.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}

In his lab at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], Nuttin [[Design of experiments|designed experiments]] to test the [[hypothesis]] that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}} It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}

To find an effect which ruled out mere exposure, Nuttin created a [[yoked control design]] in which two subjects evaluated the same letters separately. Some of the letters belonged to one subject's name, and some of the letters belonged to the other subject's name, while some were random. In this design, any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–355}}

For example, take the fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs as shown in the table. The first stimulus is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As can be seen in the table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–356}}

In the first trial, 38 [[Flemish|Dutch-speaking]] local [[primary school|elementary school]] girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant preference for the letters of one's own name over those of the other person was found.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=357}} No [[significant difference]] was found using family name rather than first name or both names.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent [[data analysis]] revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}}

=== Discussion ===
Nuttin concluded that the experiments showed that, independent of visual, [[psychoacoustics|acoustical]], [[applied aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[semantics|semantic]], and frequency characteristics, letters belonging to one's own first and family names are preferred above other letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} He framed the effect in the context of [[narcissism]], [[Gestalt theory]] and [[awareness]], as reflected in the title of his 1985 article "Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: the name letter effect", in which "beyond Gestalt" refers to the fact that subjects were not shown names, only letters in isolation, and "beyond awareness" to the fact that subjects did not realize that the letters of their own names were used.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=358–359}} Nuttin claimed the effect he found was the first to go beyond Gestalt and awareness.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}

== Second study ==
In 1987 Nuttin published his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 with the help of Hilde Sas.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=381}}{{sfn|Sas|1986}} Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying [[affect (psychology)|affective]] and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=384}}

=== Method ===
Cross-lingual studies were performed at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, [[English language|English]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]] (the only one with a non-[[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]]), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it was replaced by a simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=385–386}}

=== Discussion ===
Across languages and letters, the average probability of a letter being chosen as one of the six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=390}} The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=391}} There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=392}}

Nuttin analyzed the data to see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to find one. Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for [[Magyarország]]). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=396–397}}

The data also allowed for an investigation into whether visual prominence is an important factor in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have any impact on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=397}}

As in the first study, the second one also included a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=397–398}} This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While there was a large consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=398}}{{efn-ua|This asymmetry is similar to what Czapiński found when analyzing school-trip companion preferences: much consensus as to who were the three least preferred students, but little in who were the three most preferred.{{sfn|Czapiński|1980|p=203}}}}

== Reception ==
In the light of how surprising the finding was, Nuttin hesitated for seven years before finally going public with it. He first mentioned it at a conference of the [[European Association of Social Psychology|European Association of Experimental Social Psychology]] in 1984,{{sfn|Nuttin|1984}} followed by the 1985 and 1987 articles referred to above. His work was met with widespread skepticism, as he had expected.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} Loosen, a researcher at Nuttin's own university, called the name-letter effect "so strange that a down-to-earth researcher will spontaneously think of an [[artifact (error)|artifact]]".{{sfn|Loosen|1990|p=11}}{{efn-ua|Loosen's critique stemmed from misinterpreting Nuttin's experimental design. Loosen thought that subjects in the yoked experiments were randomly selected to form a pair. However, this had not been the case. Nuttin had selected pairs based on minimal overlap of syllables in the subjects' names.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}}} Other researchers did not explicitly say that the effect was [[spurious relationship|spurious]], but they doubted its psychological relevance.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} In the first five years after publication (1985–1989), Nuttin's 1985 article was cited only once and the effect was studied at only one other university ([[Ohio State University]], where Johnson replicated the effect using American students).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Johnson|1986}}{{efn-ua|Because the effect is most profound for initials, Johnson had christened the effect the ''initial-letter effect''. Nuttin did not agree with this [[reductionism]], saying there is no need to create the illusion of two phenomena where there is only one.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=396}}}}

This all changed in 1995, when Greenwald and Banaji pointed out that Nuttin's work was relevant to indirect measurement of self-esteem, which Nuttin himself had actually already suggested.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=11}} After that the original study was cited 14 times in the five years between 1995 and 1999, 50 times between 2000 and 2004, 114 times between 2005 and 2009, and approximately 200 times between 2010 and 2014.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} The name-letter effect is no longer disputed and Nuttin's work has been called "seminal" by Stieger, Voracek, and Formann in their 2012 meta-analysis of 44 publications on the effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}} Their meta-analysis found no trace of [[publication bias]].{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|pp=66–67}}

== Characteristics ==
In her 2014 [[meta-analysis]] of dozens of name-letter effect studies, Hoorens called the effect robust.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} She noted robustness in:

* Scope: The name-letter effect is stronger for initials than for non-initials, but generally still holds even when excluding initials from analysis.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua| Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, and Dijksterhuis found an effect only for initials, not for letters in other positions.{{sfn|Koole|Smeets|van Knippenberg|Dijksterhuis|1999|p=111}}}}
* Gender: All but two studies found the effect equally strong for women and men.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The exceptions are a study by Albers, Rotteveel, and Dijksterhuis, and one by Stieger, Preyss, and Voracek.{{sfn|Albers|Rotteveel|Dijksterhuis|2009|p=63}}{{sfn|Stieger|Preyss|Voracek|2012|p=51}}}}{{efn-ua|Gender-role orientation, the extent to which an individual adopts and displays traits, attitudes, and behaviors normatively identified as male-typical or female-typical, may also play a part in the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014|p=358}} It can be measured by the gender initial-preference task, which requires participants to rate letters for their gender typicality. Men have been shown to rate their initial letters as more male-typical, whereas women rate their initials as more female-typical.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014}}}}
* Age: The effect has been found in people ranging from school children to university students, middle-aged and old-aged adults.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The only known exception is a study by Kernis, Lakey, and Heppner.{{sfn|Kernis|Lakey|Heppner|2008|p=477}}}}
* Culture: Although there are many differences between [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western cultures]], including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the [[Thai name|family name]] is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=204}} Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for [[Japanese name|initials in Japan]], where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}
* Language: 15 languages have been tested ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, [[Thai language|Thai]]), covering four language families  ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Indo-Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Japonic]]) and five alphabets ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]], Roman, [[Cyrillic]], [[Devanagari]], [[Kana]]). In all cases a name-letter effect was found.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=184}}
* Time: In a study on preferences for initials, Stieger and LeBel found that people who had [[Maiden and married names|changed their name after marrying]] continued to show a preference for the initial of their abandoned birth name decades into their marriage. Also, subjects who had been married less than two years already showed a name-letter effect for their new last name initial.{{sfn|Stieger|LeBel|2012|p=10}}

== Explanations ==
Various explanations for the name-letter effect have been explored. Several explanations which seemed plausible at first have since been rejected.

=== Disproved causes ===

==== Mere exposure ====
People may simply like most what they see most. Letters that appear more frequently in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found a positive correlation between the frequency of occurrence of letters and [[phoneme]]s and how attractive they were judged to be.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=181}}{{sfn|Forer|1940|p=589}}{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|p=123}} Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it.{{sfn|Zajonc|1980|p=151}} Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{efn-ua|Nuttin made the assumption that for any given letter, total exposure has been roughly the same for each subject. That is, an adult's name is read or written infrequently compared to all other words.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} Other researchers agreed; Greenwald and Banaji spoke of "reaching an asymptote".{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}}} He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=399}} In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=398–400}}

==== Subjective frequency ====
Subjective frequency is how frequently subjects {{em|think}} a stimulus appears. Name letters may be noticed more and, consequently, assumed to occur more frequently than other letters. Early research into the impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when the {{em|actual}} frequency was identical.{{sfn|Matlin|1971|p=295}} Hoorens and Nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be an explanation for the name-letter effect by asking subjects to rank-order the entire alphabet twice, once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency. Subjects indeed significantly overestimated the frequency of letters in their names, although there was no significant positive correlation between the overestimation of frequency and the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}} The researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name. Subjects who liked their name had a stronger name-letter effect than those who did not like their name, but they did not overestimate the frequency of own-name letters more than subjects who did not like their names. Hoorens and Nuttin concluded that there is no support for the subjective frequency hypothesis.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}}

==== Evaluative conditioning ====
[[Evaluative conditioning]] suggests that if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of [[classical conditioning]] in which we come to like or dislike something through an association.{{sfn|Martin|Levey|1987|p=69}} Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the [[cocktail party effect]], it could be that the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}{{sfn|Mack|Rock|1998|p=18}} Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese [[kanji]]) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}

==== Subjective ownership ====
Subjective ownership would occur if subjects knowingly chose the letters from their own name. Nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests. Despite being given a monetary reward and unlimited time, none of the subjects of his original study were able to find a pattern in the stimulus lists, ruling out the possibility that they knew their own name-letters were there.{{sfn|Hoorens|1990|p=29}}

==== Mastery pleasure ====
The letters first learned by a child, commonly their own name,{{sfn|Treiman|Broderick|1998|p=112}} may come to have lasting positive associations.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their [[first language|mother tongue]] alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=365}} Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, there should be no name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}{{efn-ua|The effect was not due to the two alphabets sharing letters. It was found for common letters with identical pronunciation (AEKMT), common letters with different pronunciation (BCFPYU), and Roman capitals not appearing in Cyrillic (DFGIJNRVWZ).{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}}} The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principal cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=368}} In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, they found it increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=190}}{{efn-ua|Other studies have since also found the effect to increase over age, for instance, Corenblum and Armstrong in their study of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Native Canadian]] children.{{sfn|Corenblum|Armstrong|2012|p=130}}}} They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet at the same time as the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later.{{efn-ua|Only Thai [[consonant]]s were presented as stimuli. Thai [[vowel]]s can not be used in isolation as their sound depends on their context.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=192}}}} They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=196–201}}

=== Probable cause ===
The effect is thought to arise from unconscious, automatic processes of self-evaluation, with different research groups coming at it from two different angles.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}}

==== Mere ownership ====
Nuttin frames the cause in terms of ownership, which has roots in [[behavioral economics|economic psychology]]. The [[endowment effect]] has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.{{sfn|Kahneman|Knetsch|Thaler|1991|p=193}}{{sfn|Beggan|1992|p=229}} Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect is just one example of a more general [[mere ownership effect|mere-ownership effect]].{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.

* Most people should like their name. Those that do not should not like their name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name relatively highly. They also found that subjects who evaluated their own name relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their own name negatively.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|pp=177–200}}
* Bilinguals using two different alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should be found in the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}} This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=183–184}}
* Similar effects should be found for other attributes connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more.{{sfn|Nickell|Pederson|Rossow|2003|pp=161–163}} In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong [[birthday-number effect]] for the day of the month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}

==== Implicit self-esteem ====
Another group of researchers has framed the cause in terms of [[social psychology]], specifically the [[self-esteem]] theory. Beginning with [[Anthony Greenwald|Greenwald]] and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from [[implicit self-esteem]], a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}} Most people like themselves.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=10}} The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=10–11}} As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin.{{sfn|Syz|1926|pp=119–126}} It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|p=108}}

* To be an automatic process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time. Koole, [[Ap Dijksterhuis|Dijksterhuis]] and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each letter of the alphabet, together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. They found that preferences for name letters did not significantly change between the first and second rating.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=672–673}} Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row.{{sfn|Hoorens|Takano|Franck|Roberts|2015|p=910}}
* To be an automatic process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, be influenced by deliberate thought. Multiple studies have shown that thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|p=673}}{{sfn|Wilson|Dunn|Kraft|Lisle|1989|p=330}} Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of an automatic process.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=674–676}}
* Unconscious [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]] has been found to increase under psychological threat. For the effect to be one of unconscious self-regulation it too should increase under threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts found that when people who were high in explicit self-esteem were exposed to a psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency.{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Mirenberg|Hetts|2002|p=170}} Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of the English alphabet.{{sfn|Komori|Murata|2008|p=109}}
* If the effect is an automatic process, then the subliminal use of name letters should influence other preferences. Wentura, Kulfanek, and Greve investigated this by the use of a [[priming (psychology)|priming]] technique. They showed subjects the first and last initials of their own name or of a yoked subject's name, too briefly to be noticed. This was immediately followed by words such as "honest" and "lonely". Subjects had to quickly identify the word they had seen as positive or negative. It was found that subjects categorized positive words more quickly if they were first primed with their own initials. There was no effect for negative words. The effects of initial-letter priming were especially strong for subjects with high levels of explicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Wentura|Kulfanek|Greve|2001|p=657}}{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|pp=101–102}}
* If there is a halo effect spreading to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners.{{sfn|LeBel|Campbell|2009|p=1293}} DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.{{sfn|DeHart|Pelham|Fiedorowicz|Carvallo|2011|p=127}}

== Application ==
In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the name-letter effect has been exploited to measure self-esteem.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=64}} There are two types of self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}} Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to [[introspection]], measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.{{sfn|Spalding|Hardin|1999|p=535}}{{sfn|Krizan|Suls|2008|p=522}}

The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem, surpassed only by the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=233}} There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all the letters of the alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the [[Likert scale|rating scales]] (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}

There is no standard [[algorithm]] for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the [[ipsative|ipsatized]] double-correction algorithm (the so-called "I-algorithm"), as originally recommended and named by LeBel and Gawronski{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=101}}).{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In her meta-analysis, Hoorens does not recommend a specific algorithm as little is known about how name-letter preference scores obtained from different algorithms relate to the most important psychometric quality of all, [[content validity|validity]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=244}} The algorithms are typically applied to initials only, but can be used for all name letters.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}

Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}} They suggest it may be useful to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=248}} The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[physical health]], [[social acceptance]], [[unrealistic optimism]], feedback sensitivity, [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]], and [[defensiveness]].{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=86}}

== Wider implications ==
Researchers have looked for wider implications of the name-letter effect on preferences, both inside and outside the lab.

=== In the lab ===
In controlled studies in the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1099}}&amp;nbsp;The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did like&amp;nbsp;Honda&amp;nbsp;more than non-matching brands).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1108}}&amp;nbsp;They speculated that brand names are more likely to communicate identity to others than other everyday things.{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1109}}&amp;nbsp;Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1089}}&amp;nbsp;The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1095}}

Wiebenga and Fennis investigated whether the use of the&amp;nbsp;[[personal pronoun]]s&amp;nbsp;"I" and "my" in branding also had an effect on preferences, given the way these pronouns link to the self. They found that brand names with a generic self-referencing pronoun (e.g. [[iPhone]], [[Myspace]]) were evaluated more positively than non-self-referencing brand names (e.g.&amp;nbsp;[[Xbox]]). The effect behaved like the name-letter effect: when the self was put under threat the effect became stronger, and it disappeared for people with negative self-evaluations.{{sfn|Wiebenga|Fennis|2012|p=733}}

A study by Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing initials with members in a group can increase the quality of group work. In a study of&amp;nbsp;[[undergraduate]]&amp;nbsp;students they found that groups sharing initials performed better than groups that did not. Groups that had a higher proportion of shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials.{{sfn|Polman|Pollmann|Poehlman|2013}}

=== Outside the lab ===
==== Controversial studies ====
Researchers have looked for evidence of the driving force behind the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella of&amp;nbsp;[[implicit egotism]], starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}}{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Carvallo|Mirenberg|2004|p=665}} &amp;nbsp;Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}}

Simonsohn urged researchers to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis. An example of a confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters "Den" compared to with "Wal", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, and more likely to be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more "Den" dentists than "Wal" than implicit egotism.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=22–23}}&amp;nbsp;Using both a different data set ([[Twitter]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Google+]]&amp;nbsp;accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.{{sfn| Kooti|Magno|Weber|2014|p=216}}{{efn-ua|Overlooking a cohort confound was also the problem with controversial research that tied initials to death. Christenfeld, Phillips, and Glynn concluded that people who have positive [[monogram]]s (e.g. ACE or VIP) live significantly longer than those with negative initials (e.g. PIG or DIE). This conclusion was based on analysis of thousands of California death certificates between 1969 and 1995.{{sfn|Christenfeld|Phillips|Glynn|1999|p=241}} Morrison and Smith subsequently pointed out that this was an artefact of grouping data by age at death. Frequency of initials changing over time could be a confounding variable. When they grouped the same data by birth year, they found no statistically significant relationship between initials and longevity.{{sfn|Morrison|Smith|2005|p=820}} Similarly, Smith found statistical errors had led Abel and Kruger wrongly to conclude that [[Major League Baseball]] players whose names have positive initials live longer than players with negative initials.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=211}}{{sfn|Abel|Kruger|2007|p=179}}}}

Dyjas, Grasman, Wetzels, van der Maas, and Wagenmakers criticized the method Pelham et al. used in their analysis of archives of deaths in 23 "Saint cities" in the US, such as&amp;nbsp;[[St. Louis]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. Whereas Pelham et al. pooled all data together and concluded that people gravitate towards cities matching their first name (e.g. Louis or Paul), Dyjas et al. used&amp;nbsp;[[Bayesian network|Bayesian hierarchical modelling]]&amp;nbsp;to show that there are several cities where the opposite happens, people moving away from their name Saint city. They concluded that there is no evidence for an overall effect.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=7–10}}&amp;nbsp;A different set of cities containing 30 surnames, such as&amp;nbsp;[[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]], did reveal a disproportionately large number of deceased people with city–surname matches.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=8–9}} Dyjas et al. disputed that people gravitate towards cities of their surname, but instead cited Simonsohn's argument that many descendants of founders of these cities may never have moved away, a case of reverse causality.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|p=9}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=15}}

Simonsohn also raised the possibility of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.{{sfn|Anseel|Duyck|2008|p=1059}}&amp;nbsp;But Simonsohn suspected that, like&amp;nbsp;[[Walt Disney]] working for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011b|p=1087}}

A few controversial studies have linked performance to initials. However, McCullough and Williams found no evidence of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players [[strikeout|striking out]] (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams |2010|p=881}}{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}} Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower [[Academic grading in the United States|grades]] than others with initials A or B.{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}}&amp;nbsp;Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams|2011|p=340}}

In response to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something the&amp;nbsp;''[[New Scientist]]''&amp;nbsp;has coined&amp;nbsp;[[nominative determinism]].{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Feedback|1994}} Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points when it comes to names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were [[metalsmith|smiths]]. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.{{sfn|Voracek|Rieder|Stieger|Swami|2015}}

==== Undisputed studies ====
[[File:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Satellite image of a hurricane|upright|[[Hurricane Katrina]]: people with the initial K especially donated to the disaster relief.]]
Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a link between letter names and donations has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]], [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Mitch|Mitch]]). They found that people who shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.{{sfn|Chandler|Griffin|Sorensen|2008|pp=404–410}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|pp=44–45}}&amp;nbsp;Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=46}}

[[File:Battle of Poitiers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Battle of Poitiers]] 1356. The oriflamme can be seen on the top left.]]

The '''Oriflamme''' (from Latin ''aurea flamma'', "golden flame") was the [[battle standard]] of the [[King of France]] in the Middle Ages. It was originally the sacred banner of the [[Abbey of St. Denis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenophongroup.com/montjoie/orifl-fa.htm Oriflamme Society]&lt;/ref&gt; a monastery near Paris. When the oriflamme was raised in battle by the French royalty during the Middle Ages, most notably during the [[Hundred Years War]], no prisoners were to be taken until it was lowered. Through this tactic they hoped to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, especially the nobles, who could usually expect to be taken alive for ransom during such military encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Southey (1841) '' Joan of Arc: a poem'', Longman et autres. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TPRAhDvWDrwC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=oriflamme+no+quarter+given&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k7Nfv2vzz-&amp;sig=v2VEcfsGqIA6hlWsT62p_Jgrodg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAmoVChMIo6Du2dmMxwIVBL1yCh38WwSD#v=onepage&amp;q=oriflamme%20no%20quarter%20given&amp;f=false p. 280]&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, the term "''oriflamme''" has come to mean any banner with pointed ends; by association with the form of the original.

==Legendary origin==

The  Oriflamme was mentioned in the eleventh-century ballad the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' (vv. 3093-5) as a royal banner, first called ''Romaine'' and then ''Montjoie''.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt; According to legend, [[Charlemagne]] carried it to the Holy Land in response to a prophecy regarding a knight possessing a golden lance, from which flames would burn and drive out the [[Saracens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Distant Mirror |last=Tuchman |first=Barbara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1978|publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0140054073 |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the ''lance'' was originally the important object, with the banner simply a decoration, but this changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/oriflamm.htm Heraldica.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Oriflamme was first used by [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] in 1124 and was last flown in battle at Agincourt in 1415,&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Barber (1984) ''The Penguin guide to medieval Europe'', Penguin Books. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A9MYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;dq=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;pgis=1 p. 224]&lt;/ref&gt; though a version of it remained in the Abbey of St. Denis until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Book of Heraldry|last=Slater |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Hermes House |location= |isbn=1846819601 |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis VI replaced the earlier banner of Saint Martin with the oriflamme of the Abbey of St. Denis, which floated about the tomb of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the abbey by king Dagobert.
Until the 12th century the standard-bearer was the [[Comte de Vexin]], who, as vowed to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the abbey. Louis VI, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as war began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the tomb of the saint to carry it to the combat.

It is recorded as having been carried at the following battles/campaigns:{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Appearance ==
The banner was red or orange-red silk and flown from a gilded lance.&lt;ref&gt;Slater (2002), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, its colour stems from it being dipped in the blood of the recently beheaded [[Denis|St. Denis]].

The surviving descriptions of the Oriflamme are in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the "Chronicle of Flanders" (fourteenth century), in the "Registra Delphinalia" (1456) and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536). They show that the primitive Oriflamme was succeeded in the course of the centuries by newer Oriflammes which bore little resemblance to one another except for their colour.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Oriflamme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance on the battlefield ==
When the Oriflamme was displayed on the battlefield it indicated that [[no quarter]]
was to be given, its red colour being symbolic of cruelty and ferocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The laws of War in the late Middle Ages |last=Keen |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Keen |coauthors= |year=1965 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |location= London|isbn= |page= |pages= 105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the azure ground (from the blue cope of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]]) strewn with gold [[fleur-de-lis]] remained the symbol of royalty until the 15th century, the Oriflamme became the royal battle standard of the King of France, and it was carried at the head of the king's forces when they met another army in battle. In the fifteenth century, the fleur-de-lis on the white flag of [[Joan of Arc]] became the new royal standard replacing both the symbol of royalty and the Oriflamme on the battle field.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;&lt;!--cited for last sentence--&gt;

==Porte oriflamme==
The bearer of the standard, the ''porte-oriflamme'', became an [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|office]] (like that of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] or [[Constable of France|Constable]]) and a great honour, as it was an important and very dangerous job to take charge of such a visible symbol in battle.  If things went badly, the bearer was expected to die rather than relinquish his charge.

Froissart vividly describes ''porte-oriflamme'' Geoffroi de Charny's fall at the side of his king at the Battle of Poitiers in this passage:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“There Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him because he was carrying the king’s sovereign banner [the Oriflamme]. He also had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open the king’s battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jean Froissart; trans Geoffrey Brereton, ''Chronicles'' ( Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, 1978), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The Oriflamme in literature ==
The 19th-century poet [[Robert Southey]] refers to the Oriflamme and its reputation in his poem ''Joan of Arc''{{cquote|
:::::"Dark-minded man!"
:The Maid of Orleans answered, "to act well
:Brings with itself an ample recompense.
:I have not reared the oriflamme of death —
:Now God forbid! The banner of the Lord
:Is this; and, come what will, me it behooves,
:Mindful of Him whose minister I am,
:To spare the fallen foe: that gracious God
:Sends me a messenger of mercy forth,
:Sends me to save this ravaged realm of France,
:To England friendly as to all the world;
:Only to those an enemy, whose lust
:Of sway makes them the enemies of man."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3722">'''Philip Bellino''' and '''Edward Gertson''' (both died May 9, 1947) were the last persons [[capital punishment|executed]] by [[Massachusetts]].

==The murder==

Bellino and Gertson were two gangsters convicted of [[murder]]ing nineteen-year-old Robert "Tex" Williams, a former [[U.S. Marine]]. On August 3, 1945, Williams led Bellino, Gertson and Charles Mantia to a [[New Hampshire]] [[summer camp]]. He had learned there would be an illegal dice game taking place in the camp. The four men would rob the players at gunpoint. Williams had lured his accomplices with a promise of easily stealing up to $10,000. Instead they escaped with "a few hundred dollars".&lt;ref name = rogers&gt;Alan Rogers, [http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/lawreviews/meta-elements/journals/bctwj/22_2/02_TXT.htm "Success—At Long Last: The Abolition of the Death Penalty in Massachusetts, 1928–1984"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trio was enraged at Williams. They also feared the younger man could squeal on them to the police. On August 7, 1945, the four of them shared a taxi ride in the vicinity of [[Boston]]. The taxi stopped at an isolated location, not far from the shore. Williams, Bellino and Gertson stepped out for a walk. Mantia waited in the taxi with the cab driver. Bellino and Gertson returned without Williams, claiming the young man would spend his night with a girlfriend.&lt;ref name = rogers/&gt;

Williams' corpse was soon after discovered. He had been shot in the back of the head. Mantia was the one to lead the police to Bellino and Gertson. James Salah, the cab driver, also became a witness for the prosecution. On June 18, 1946, the duo were found guilty of first-degree murder in a trial by jury. There were originally 14 jurors. Two of them had been dismissed prior to the final verdict. A legal argument that this violated the rights of the defendants was eventually rejected by the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]]. A "mercy bill" discussed at the time in the [[Massachusetts General Court]] could have proven beneficial to the duo, but was vetoed by [[Robert F. Bradford]], [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|Governor of Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name = rogers/&gt;

==Execution and abolition of death penalty in Massachusetts==
Both Bellino and Gertson were executed in the [[electric chair]] at the [[Massachusetts State Prison at Charlestown]] shortly after midnight on the night of May 8–9, 1947.

On April 3, 1951, Massachusetts enacted a "mercy bill" which removed the mandatory death sentence for murder in all cases except for murder committed in the course of rape or attempted rape. No further executions were carried out and in 1984 the [[Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts]] ruled that capital punishment violated the [[constitution of Massachusetts|state constitution]].

A '''real-name system''' is a system in which when a user who wants to register an account on a [[blog]], website or [[bulletin board system]], is required to offer [[Identity document|identification credentials]] including their legal name to the network service centre. One may use an on-line [[pseudonym]], however, the person's real identity would be available if rules or laws are broken.

==Practice==

===South Korea===

[[South Korea]] is the first country to put the real-name system into practice. Since June 28, 2009, thirty-five Korean websites have implemented a name-registration system pursuant to the newly amended Information and Communications Network Act of Korea. It was enacted after the suicide of [[Choi Jin-sil]] which was said to be related to malicious comments about her on Internet bulletin boards. The new rule is aimed at minimizing the amount of negative information to make [[netizen]]s responsible for their behavior on the [[Internet]].

South Koreans have been familiar with the real-name system. Since the mid-1990s, doing real property transactions and financial transactions must be performed under a real name following relevant laws. The real-name system in real property transactions and financial transactions is believed to contribute to the sound economic order of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' the [http://koreanlii.or.kr/w/index.php/Real_name_system real name system] in Korea.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2012, however, the [[Constitutional Court of Korea]] ruled unanimously that the real-name requirements imposed on big portal service providers by a relevant law&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [http://koreanlii.or.kr/w/index.php/Real_name_system Korean Legal Information Institute] for further information of the Act.&lt;/ref&gt; is unconstitutional, citing such provision's violation of freedom of speech in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;Korea Times, "[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/08/117_118115.html Online real-name system unconstitutional]", August 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the so-called "Choi Jin-sil Law", under the deceased celebrity's name, is to be discarded. Until then, websites with more than 100 thousand visitors per day required users to authenticate their identities by entering their ID numbers when they used portals or other sites.

The Constitutional Court said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The system does not seem to have been beneficial to the public. Despite the enforcement of the system, the number of illegal or malicious postings online has not decreased. Instead, users moved to foreign Websites and the system became discriminatory against domestic operators. It also prevented foreigners who didn’t have a resident registration number here from expressing their opinions online.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Court Decision 2010Hun-Ma47 delivered on August 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Yonhap News Agency]], the public voice started to agree on the abolishment of a name-registration system because of the severe problem caused by information leakage. Now the official response from the administration is that they will supplement the certain regulations of personal information on the Internet.

===China===

The Chinese government stated in December 2011 that microblogging sites should make sure users are registered with their real names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China moves to tame microbloggers amid censorship claims|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-microblogging/china-moves-to-tame-microbloggers-amid-censorship-claims-idUSBRE84S03T20120529|agency=Reuters|date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the announcement of Regulations on the Development and Management of microblogging, Beijing in December 2011, the major microblogging sites like Sina, 163 and Sohu all put real name system into practice in 16 March 2012. The users in Beijing who hadn't provided their real information would be barred from posting and transmitting messages after 16 March 2012.{{cn|date=November 2018}}{{update inline|date=November 2018}}
&lt;!--describe more precisely with the history and nature of real name system in China--&gt;

==History==
The introduction to real names in modern society originated from state regulations. State governments, in order to monitor and keep track of its citizens, provided citizens with surnames. This allowed them to track property ownership and inheritance, collect taxes, maintain court records, perform police work, conscript soldiers, and control epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, James. (1998). Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social networking sites==

===Facebook===
{{see also|Facebook real-name policy controversy}}
Though the  [[Facebook]] [[social networking site]] does not directly employ the real-name system, the site's online Name Policy indicates the following:
"Facebook is a community where people use their real identities. We require everyone to provide their real names, so you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/help/292517374180078|title=Facebook's Name Policy - Facebook Help Center - Facebook|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that under Facebook's Name Policy, users are strongly encouraged to provide their real names when creating an account on Facebook. This, according to Facebook, ensures that its users remain safe by knowing who they are connecting and communicating with at all times.

Facebook was first launched at [[Harvard]], where the new social networking site provided a safe, intimate alternative to the other popular social networking sites. According to [[danah boyd]], a social media scholar, "people provided their name because they saw the site as an extension of campus life." Because of this, new users adopted the norms and practices of the early adopters and began to also see Facebook as a secure and private site. Through this early adoption, today, Facebook's astronomical value stems from the quality and quantity of information it has about its users. The social networking site has become an identity service by creating a value proposition based on social norms in which users would naturally share their real names instead of feeling forced to.&lt;ref name="real names"&gt;boyd, danah (2012). "The Politics of 'Real Names': Power, Context, and Control in Networked  Publics." Communications of the ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though requiring users to provide their real names such as the ones listed on credit cards, driver's licenses, and student IDs ensures safety for users, using real names could also be harmful. Emil Protalinski, technology journalist for The Next Web, states how many "Facebook users opt to use [[pseudonyms]] to hide from stalkers, abusive exes, and even governments that don't condone free speech."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2012/09/21/facebook-now-wants-snitch-friends-arent-using-real-name/|title=Facebook tests prompt asking you to snitch on your friends who aren't using their real name|first=Emil|last=Protalinski|date=2012-09-21|work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these specific users, using pseudonyms allows for them to still be able to connect with colleagues, friends, and family without having to entirely worry about their safety had they provided Facebook with their real names that others could find more easily. This brings up the issues of privacy for Facebook users. "People feel as though their privacy has been violated when their agency has been undermined or when information about a particular social context has been obscured in ways that subvert people's ability to make an informed decision about what to reveal."&lt;ref name="real names"/&gt; Some users may feel uncomfortable with the knowledge that their real names would be publicly displayed and choose, instead, to use a fake name that appears real to Facebook under its Name Policy.

===Twitter===
[[File:Twitter name looks great.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Twitter registration page saying "Name looks great" after a made-up, meaningless, and unformatted name is entered.]]
Unlike Facebook, the [[Twitter]] social networking site does not require users to enter real names when creating Twitter accounts, and the site is entirely void of the real-name system. According to Twitter's former [[CEO]], [[Dick Costolo]], the social networking site does not care what a user's real name is as long as the site connects users to the information that they care about. Whether the information comes from an account with a real name or one using a pseudonym does not matter. 
Yet, Costolo also points out that Twitter is not necessarily in full support of the idea of users having pseudonyms; instead, Twitter is simply "wedded to people being able to use the service as they see fit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2011/09/16/why-twitter-doesnt-care-what-your-real-name-is/|title=Why Twitter doesn’t care what your real name is|date=2011-09-16|work=Gigaom.com|first=Mathew|last=Ingram}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter emphasizes care in its services that it provides for users rather than requiring real names. This does not mean, however, that Twitter ignores the issue regarding real identities. Regarding this matter, Twitter is able to verify accounts of prominent Twitter users such as celebrities in order to ensure identity fraud is not being committed on the social networking site.

==In fiction==
[[Vernor Vinge]]'s novella ''[[True Names]]'' charts the idea of how serious knowing one's identity can be. As such it is also a part of [[cypherpunk]] culture.

A '''regnal name''', or '''reign name''', is the name used by [[monarch]]s and [[pope]]s during their [[reign]]s and, subsequently, historically. Since ancient times, some monarchs have chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. 
 
The regnal name is usually followed by a [[regnal number]], written as a [[Roman numeral]], to differentiate that monarch from others who have used the same name while ruling the same realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]], [[George Tupou V]] of [[Tonga]]. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name. For example, the same person was both [[James VI and I|King James I of England and King James VI of Scotland]].

The ordinal is not normally used for the first ruler of the name, but is used in historical references once the name is used again. Thus, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] of England was called simply "Elizabeth of England" until the accession of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] almost four centuries later in 1952; subsequent historical references to the earlier queen retroactively refer to her as Elizabeth I. However, [[Paul I of Russia|Tsar Paul I of Russia]], [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I of Italy]], [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I of Spain]], and [[Pope John Paul I]] all used the ordinal I (first) during their reigns, while [[Pope Francis]] does not. In spoken English, such names are pronounced as "Elizabeth the First", "George the Sixth" etc.

In some countries in Asia, monarchs took or take [[Chinese era name|era names]]. While era names as such are not used in many monarchies, sometimes eras are named after a monarch (usually long-lived), or a succession of monarchs of the same name. This is customary; there is no formal or general rule. The whole period during which a succession of four Georges ([[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[George II of Great Britain|II]], [[George III of Great Britain|III]], and [[George IV of Great Britain|IV]]) of the Hanoverian dynasty reigned in Great Britain became known as the [[Georgian era]]; although there were many Edwards, the [[Edwardian era]] always refers to the reign of [[Edward VII]] at the beginning of the 20th century.

==Monarchies==

===Ancient rulers===
{{Further|Throne name (Ancient Egypt)}}
Ancient rulers in many parts of the world took regnal names or throne names which were different from their personal name.  This is known to be true, for instance, of several kings of [[Assyria]], and appears to be the case for several Kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].  In [[Ancient Egypt]], Pharaohs took a number of names - the ''[[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary#(Throne name (praenomen)|praenomen]]'' being the most commonly used, on occasion in conjunction with their personal name.

=== Africa ===
==== Ethiopia ====
In the [[Ethiopian Empire]], especially during the [[Solomonic dynasty]], many [[List of Emperors of Ethiopia|Emperors]] would take a throne name, though this was not a general practice; a great number of rulers would remain known during their reign by their birth names. [[Yekuno Amlak of Ethiopia|Yekuno Amlak]], the founder of the Solomonic dynasty, took his father's name, Tasfa Iyasus, as his throne name. [[Yagbe'u Seyon of Ethiopia|Yagbe'u Seyon]], his son and heir, took the throne name [[Solomon|Salomon]] after the biblical figure. [[Amda Seyon I of Ethiopia|Amda Seyon]] took the throne name Gebre Mesqel, "slave of the [[Christian cross|cross]]"; [[Tewodros I of Ethiopia|Tewodros I]] was Walda Ambasa, "son of the lion"; [[Sarwe Iyasus]] was Mehreka Nañ "distributor of your [the [[Names of God|Lord]]'s] mercy"; etc. Tafari Makonnen, the last sovereign Emperor of Ethiopia, took as his throne name [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]], meaning "Power of the [[Trinity]]".

==== Nigeria ====
In the various extant [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of [[Nigeria]], the regnal names of the titled monarchs, who are known locally as the [[Nigerian traditional rulers|traditional rulers]], serve two very important functions within the monarchical system. Firstly, seeing as how most states are organised in such a way as to mean that ''all'' of the legitimate descendants of the first man or woman to arrive at the site of any given community are considered its dynastic [[heir]]s, their thrones are usually rotated amongst almost endless pools of contending cousins who all share the names of the founders of their houses as primary surnames. In order to tell them all apart from one another, secondary surnames are also used for the [[sept]]s of each of the royal families that are eligible for the aforementioned rotations, names that often come from the names of state of the first members of their immediate lineages to rule in their lands. Whenever any of their direct heirs ascend the thrones, they often use their septs' names as reign names as well, using the appropriate ordinals to differentiate themselves from  the founders of the said septs. An example of this is found in the kingdom of [[Lagos]], where the Adeniji-Adele family is distinguished from their numerous Adele cousins by the word ''Adeniji'', which was actually the first name of the reigning founder of their branch of the dynasty, the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] [[Adeniji Adele|Adeniji Adele II]]. This distinction notwithstanding, both groups of [[dynast]]s (as well as a number of other ones that don't have the name Adele as an official surname, such as that of the Oloye Adekunle Ojora, a prominent nobleman of royal descent) are part of what is known as the Adele Ajosun Ruling House of Lagos.

Beyond that which is described above, regnal names also serve in Nigeria and indeed in much of Africa as chronological markers in much the same way that those of Europe do (e.g. the ''Victorian'' era). Whenever one hears of a person describing what happened at the time when so and so ruled over any particular place or people, what he or she is actually saying is that an event happened within a finite period of time, one that is equal to the duration of the reign of the monarch in question. Now seeing as how it is possible (and in fact common, particularly among the southern tribes) for one individual to have several different names and aliases in a single life, a certain degree of uniformity in usage is required if the history of an entire state is to be tied to his or her name. It is for this reason that when new monarchs are enthroned, the uniqueness of their names is usually considered to be a matter of considerable importance (even when it is caused by nothing more than the adding of ordinals to them or the allowing of more than a generation to pass before their  subsequent usage). An example of this can be found in the [[kingdom of Benin]], where the throne name of [[Erediauwa I]] became the surname of all of his immediate family in the Eweka royal house of the state, thus nominally tying them and their descendants to the era of his reign. This is especially obvious when their branch's name is compared to the last names of the said king's brothers and their heirs, named the Akenzuas after his father [[Akenzua II]], and his uncles and their heirs, named the Ewekas after his grandfather [[Eweka II]].

In the case of the comparatively small number of Nigerian monarchs, such as Obi [[Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe|Nnaemeka Achebe]] of [[Onitsha]], who do not make use of regnal names as a result of a variety of reasons, pre-coronation names are maintained during their reigns.

===Asia===
In parts of east Asia, it is more a rule than an exception that monarchs take additional names when ascending, and quite often discard the name they were known by as princes. Often the assumed name is different from the childhood name, and a new [[temple name]] could be assumed. A [[posthumous name]] is sometimes accorded to a deceased monarch. Rebel leaders may also take regnal names. The regnal names of some monarchs were long, for example [[Lý Thái Tổ]], [[Jiajing Emperor|Emperor Shizong of Ming]] and [[Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire]]. While many rulers in east Asia (including in China, Vietnam, Korea and Japan) took regnal names based on [[Chinese characters]], some monarchs of [[Xu (state)|Xu]], [[Xiongnu]], [[Tuyuhun Kingdom]], [[Rouran Khaganate]], [[Göktürks]], [[Uyghur Khaganate]] and [[List of Mongol Khans|Mongol]] took Chinese transliterated non-Chinese regnal names. For details on the multiple names assumed by individual East Asian monarchs, see:
* [[Chinese era name]]
* [[Japanese era name]]
* [[List of Chinese monarchs]]
* [[List of Emperors of Japan]]
* [[List of Monarchs of Korea]]
* [[List of Mongolian monarchs]]
* [[List of Vietnamese monarchs]]
* [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)]]
* [[List of sovereign state leaders in the Philippines|List of Rulers in the Philippines]]
Some [[royal family]] members may receive honorary names such as [[:zh:徽号|Huihao]] and [[:ja:宮号|Miyagō]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cc.matsuyama-u.ac.jp/~tamura/itijikinn.pdf 紀宮は、宮号（みやごう＝皇族に天皇がおくる称号）]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Hungary====
During the Medieval Age, when the [[House of Árpád]] disappeared in 1301, two of the monarchs that claimed the throne and were crowned chose a different name. [[Otto III, Duke of Bavaria]] became Bela V of Hungary, taking the name of his maternal grandfather, [[Béla IV of Hungary]]. In the other hand, [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia]] signed his royal documents in Hungary as Ladislas, this being a very traditional name in the Kingdom.

Later during the first half of the 14th century, [[Charles I of Hungary]] signed as "''Carolus rex''", but in fact his birth name was the Italian ''Caroberto''. This is why he is often referred to by the Hungarian historians as "Charles Robert of Hungary".

====Netherlands====
All ruling male members of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] bore the name [[Willem]] (William). The current king of the Netherlands was christened [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]]. During an interview in 1997 he said he intended to rule under the name of Willem IV, but he had a change of mind. In a televised interview just before his inauguration, he announced he would continue to use the name Willem-Alexander, saying "I spent 46 years of my life under the name Willem-Alexander, and specifically under the nickname of Alexander. I think it would be weird to discard that because I become king of the country." Furthermore, he said he did not consider himself "a mere number", adding that regnal numbers reminded him of Dutch cattle naming conventions.&lt;ref&gt;http://nos.nl/koningshuis/video/496848-willem-4-staat-bij-bertha-38-in-de-wei.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
When the [[House of Piast]] disappeared and the [[Lithuania]]n [[House of Jagiellon]] was elected in the figure of the High Duke [[Jogaila]], this monarch took the name of Władysław II, in honour of the previous Polish king ([[Władysław I the Elbow-high]]) with this traditional name. Similarly, when the Elector of Saxony, Frederick Augustus I, was elected king in 1697, he took the name of Augustus II. His son Frederick Augustus II crowned in 1734, also took the name of Augustus, becoming Augustus III.

====Portugal====
The [[List of Portuguese monarchs|monarchs of Portugal]] have traditionally used their first baptismal name as their regnal name upon their accession. The only notable exception was [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], who was born Martin of Burgundy (''Martinho de Borgonha'', in Portuguese). As he was not the heir to the throne, Martin was expected to join the clergy, and was named after [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin of Tours]], on whose feast day he had been born. When the [[heir apparent]], Henry, died, the prince's name was changed to Sancho, one with a more established royal tradition in the other Iberian monarchies (Navarre, Castile and Aragon).

====United Kingdom====
Though most [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchs of the United Kingdom]] have used their first baptismal name as their regnal name, on three occasions monarchs have chosen a different name.

First, [[Queen Victoria]] had been christened Alexandrina Victoria, but took the throne under the name Victoria.

When Victoria's son, Prince Albert Edward, became king in 1901, he took the regnal name [[Edward VII]], against the wish of his late mother.&lt;ref name="Regnal Names"&gt;{{cite book |last=Panton |first=Kenneth |date= |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Monarchy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BiyyueBTpaMC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA392&amp;dq=Prince+Albert+Edward,+became+king+in+1901,+he+took+the+regnal+name+%5B%5BEdward+VII%5D%5D,+against+the+wish+of+his+late+mother&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bjK3UziERz&amp;sig=q8hJv92WqVVppR4SZvLTfleoHQY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUwdPAoe_OAhXEoJQKHb9RA1wQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Prince%20Albert%20Edward%2C%20became%20king%20in%201901%2C%20he%20took%20the%20regnal%20name%20%5B%5BEdward%20VII%5D%5D%2C%20against%20the%20wish%20of%20his%20late%20mother&amp;f=false |location=US |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=392 |isbn=978-0810857797}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new king declared that he chose the name Edward alone as an honoured name borne by six of his predecessors, and that he did not wish to diminish the status of [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|his father]], with whom alone among royalty the name Albert should be associated.

In 1936, after the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis]], Prince Albert, Duke of York, assumed the throne as [[George VI|King George VI]] rather than "King Albert". His full name was Albert Frederick Arthur George; like Edward VII and Victoria he used another of his names.

There has been speculation that the current [[heir apparent]] to the British throne, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], may elect not to be known as "Charles III" out of concern about comparisons with [[Charles II of England]] (who was known for his Catholic sympathies), [[Charles I of England]] (who was executed after the [[English Civil War]]) and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] memory of the "Young Pretender" [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (who claimed the title "Charles III").&lt;ref name="CallMeGeorge"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article782407.ece|work=The Times |location=UK | title=Call me George, suggests Charles | date=24 December 2005| accessdate=13 July 2009 | first=Andrew | last=Pierce}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may instead choose to be known as George VII in honour of his grandfather.&lt;ref name="CallMeGeorge" /&gt; However, the Prince has not as yet announced any decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/27/monarchy.michaelwhite|work=The Guardian |location=UK | title=Charles denies planning to reign as King George | date=27 December 2005| accessdate=2 October 2012 | first=Michael | last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt; His full name is Charles Philip Arthur George.

====Scotland====
When [[Robert III of Scotland|John, Earl of Carrick]] ascended the Scottish throne in 1390, it was deemed imprudent for him to take the regnal name of "John II", as recent kings named John had turned out badly: [[John of England|in England]] as well as [[John Balliol|in Scotland]]. Furthermore, royal propaganda of the time held that John Balliol had not been a legitimate king of Scotland, making the new king's [[regnal number]] also a tricky issue. To avoid these problems, John took the regnal name of ''Robert III'', honouring [[Robert II of Scotland|his father]] and [[Robert I of Scotland|great-grandfather]].&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, Magnus, ''Scotland: The Story of a Nation'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the accession, in 1952, of [[Elizabeth II]] the title ''Elizabeth II'' caused controversy in Scotland as there had never been a Scottish ''Elizabeth I''. The Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] informed the [[British House of Commons]] that the practice since the Union was to use the higher numeral. New [[Royal Mail]] post boxes in Scotland, bearing the [[Royal Cypher|cypher]] ''E&lt;small&gt;II&lt;/small&gt;R'', were vandalised, after which, to avoid further problems, post boxes and Royal Mail vehicles in Scotland bore only the [[Crown of Scotland]]. A legal case, ''[[MacCormick v. Lord Advocate]]'' (1953 SC 396), contested the right of the Queen to title herself ''Elizabeth II'' in Scotland, arguing that to do so would be a breach of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]]. The case, however, was lost on the grounds that the pursuers had no title to sue the Crown, and also that the numbering of monarchs was part of the [[royal prerogative]], and thus not governed by the Act of Union.

====The Roman Empire====
The Roman Emperors usually had the titles of Imperator Caesar Augustus in their names. (which made their regnal names) Caesar came from the cognomen of Gaius Julius Caesar, Imperator meant Commander and Augustus meant venerable or majestic. The name usually went in two ways, Imperator (Praenomen, Nomen and Cognomen) Caesar Augustus or Imperator Caesar (Praenomen, Nomen and Cognomen) Augustus. Also Imperator became a Praenomen of Roman Emperors, Augustus and Caesar became a cognomen of theirs.

==Religious offices==

===Catholic Church===
{{Main|Papal name}}
Immediately after a new pope is elected, and accepts the election, he is asked by the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], "By what name shall you be called?" The new pope chooses the name by which he will be known. The senior Cardinal Deacon, or [[Cardinal Protodeacon]], then appears on the balcony of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] to proclaim the new Pope, informing the world of the man elected Pope, and under which name he would be known during his reign.

&lt;blockquote lang="la" style="font-style:italic; width:42%; margin:1em 4%; float:left;"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum:
[[Habemus Papam]],
Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum,
Dominum [forename],
Sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ Cardinalem [surname],
qui sibi nomen imposuit [papal name].
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="width:42%; margin:1em 4%; float:left;"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I announce to you a great joy:
We have a Pope,
The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord,
Lord [forename],
Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church [surname],
who conferred upon himself the name [papal name].
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the first centuries of the church, priests elected [[bishop of Rome]] continued to use their baptismal names after their elections. The custom of choosing a new name began in AD 533 with the election of [[Pope John II|Mercurius]]. Mercurius had been named after the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], and decided that it would not be appropriate for a pope to be named after a Roman god. Mercurius subsequently decreed that he would be known as John II. Since the end of the tenth century the pope has customarily chosen a new name for himself during his Pontificate; however, until the 16th century some pontiffs used their [[Given name|baptismal names]].

The last pope to use his baptismal name was [[Pope Marcellus II]] in 1555, a choice that was even then quite exceptional. The names chosen by popes are not based on any system other than general honorifics. They have been based on immediate predecessors, mentors, political similarity, or even after family members—as was the case with [[Pope John XXIII]]. The practice of using the baptismal name as papal name has not been ruled out and future popes could elect to continue using their original names after being elected pope.

Often the new pontiff's choice of name upon being elected to the papacy is seen as a signal to the world of whom the new pope will emulate or what policies he will seek to enact. Such is the case with [[Benedict XVI]] who, in fact, explained the [[Pope Benedict XVI#Choice of name|reasons for his choice of name]] during his first General Audience in St. Peter's Square, on 27 April 2005. On that occasion, he said that he wanted to remember "[[Pope Benedict XV]], that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war," and also "[[Saint Benedict of Nursia]], co-patron of Europe, whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe."

There has never been a [[Pope Peter II]]. Even though there is no specific prohibition against choosing the name Peter, bishops elected to the Papacy have refrained from doing so even if their own given name was Peter. This is because of a tradition that only [[Saint Peter]] should have that honor. In the 10th century [[Pope John XIV|John XIV]] used the regnal name ''John'' because his given name was Peter. While some [[antipope]]s did take the name Peter II, their claims are not recognized by the mainstream Roman Catholic Church, and each of these men only either has or had a minuscule following that recognized their claims.

Probably because of the controversial [[Antipope John XXIII]], new popes avoided taking the regnal name John for over 600 years until the election of [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Cardinal Roncalli]] in 1958. Immediately after his election, there was some confusion as to whether he would be known as John XXIII or John XXIV. Cardinal Roncalli thus moved to immediately resolve by declaring that he would be known as John XXIII.

In 1978, [[Albino Luciani]] became the first pope to use two names for his regnal name when he took the name [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]], including the "I". He took the "John Paul" name to honor both John XXIII and [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]]. With the unexpected death of John Paul I a little over a month later, [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] took the name John Paul II to honor his immediate predecessor.

[[Antipope]]s also have regnal names, and also use the ordinal to show their position in the line of previous pontiffs with their names. For example, [[David Bawden]] took the name Michael I when declared pope in 1990.

===Coptic Church===
[[Coptic Pope]]s also choose regnal names distinct from their given names.

=== Islamic caliphates ===

{{see also|List of caliphs}}

[[File:Coat of Arms of Great Britain (1714-1801).svg|thumb|The Royal Arms of Great Britain from 1714 to 1801, with crest, supporters and motto]]

The '''Royal coat of arms of Great Britain''' was the [[coat of arms]] representing royal authority in the sovereign state of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], in existence from 1707 to 1801. The kingdom came into being on 1 May 1707, with the [[political union]] of the [[kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[kingdom of England]], which included [[Wales]]. With the 1706 [[Treaty of Union]] (ratified by the [[Acts of Union 1707]]), it was agreed to create a single kingdom, encompassing the whole of the island of Great Britain and its outlying islands, but not Ireland, which remained a separate realm under the newly created British crown.

On 1 January 1801, the royal arms of Great Britain were superseded by those of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], when Great Britain was united with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] by the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union of 1800]] following the suppression of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].

{{Italic title}}[[File:Oskar Schindler and a few of the Jews he rescued, 1946.jpg|300px|thumbnail|[[Oskar Schindler]] (second from the right) poses with a group of Jews he rescued during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. The picture was taken in 1946, one year after the war ended.]]
The '''''Schindlerjuden''''', literally translated from [[German language|German]] as "'''Schindler's Jews'''", were a group of roughly 1,200 [[Jews]] who were saved by [[Oskar Schindler]] during [[the Holocaust]]. They survived the years of the Nazi regime primarily through the intervention of Schindler, who found them protected status as industrial workers at his [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|enamelware factory]] in [[Kraków]] and, after 1944, in an [[Brünnlitz labor camp|armaments factory]] in [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|occupied Czechoslovakia]]. There, they avoided being sent to [[Extermination camp|death camps]] and survived the war. Schindler expended his personal fortune as an industrialist to save the ''Schindlerjuden''.

Their story has been depicted in the book ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'', by [[Thomas Keneally]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film adaptation of the novel, ''[[Schindler's List]]''. [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], one of the survivors, persuaded Thomas Keneally to write the novel and Steven Spielberg to produce the film.

In 2012, there were estimated to be over 8,500 descendants of ''Schindlerjuden'' living across the [[United States]], Europe, and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tribune242.com/news/2012/mar/28/survivor-of-the-holocaust-tells-how-schindler/|title=Survivor of the Holocaust tells how Schindler saved her life|last=Smith|first=Larry|date=28 March 2012|work=Tribune 242|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The List==
The original list of ''Schindlerjuden'' who were transported to [[Brünnlitz labor camp|Schindler's Brünnlitz factory]] in [[Brněnec]], [[Sudetenland|occupied Czechoslovakia]], was prepared by [[Mietek Pemper]], [[Itzhak Stern]] and Oskar Schindler during September and October of 1944.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title=Mietek Pemper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjJNDD9m?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date={{date|2011-6-11|mdy}} |archivedate=2012-10-27 |accessdate={{date|2012-10-27|mdy}} |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mg&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Oskar Schindler's collaborator, Mietek Pemper, has died |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Oskar+Schindler+collaborator+dies/4919305/story.html |work=[[Agence France-Presse]] |publisher=[[The Gazette (Montreal)]] |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2011-06-26}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Martin |title=Mietek Pemper, 91, Camp Inmate Who Compiled Schindler's List |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/world/europe/19pemper.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621040823/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/world/europe/19pemper.html?_r=1 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=18 June 2011 |archivedate=2011-06-21 |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; That list likely no longer exists.

Another list with 1,000 names, compiled by Pemper upon the prisoners' arrival 21 October 1944 at Schindler's [[Brünnlitz labor camp|Brünnlitz factory]], was presented by him to the [[International Tracing Service]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/help_and_faq/sample_documents/index.html#c2713 Sample Documents from the ITS Archives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721233447/http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/help_and_faq/sample_documents/index.html |date=2011-07-21}}, [[International Tracing Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two lists of 1,098 prisoners made by camp administration in Brünnlitz on 18 April 1945 are extant, and are preserved in [[Yad Vashem]] Memorial, where Oskar and [[Emilie Schindler]] are recognized among [[Righteous Among the Nations|the Righteous]].&lt;ref name="Righteous"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/stories/schindler|title=Oskar and Emilie Schindler {{!}} www.yadvashem.org|website=www.yadvashem.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oskarschindler.com/list.htm|title=Schindler's entire List|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oskarschindler.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first list contains 297 female prisoners while the second list contains 801 male prisoners. There are several preserved copies and carbon copies of the list from April 1945, with some in museums while others are in private hands, mostly of families of former prisoners. In April 2009, a carbon copy of the original list, documenting 801 names, was discovered among the documentation ''Schindler's Ark'' author Thomas Keneally had donated to the [[State Library of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/04/08/index.php?section=espectaculos&amp;article=a09n2esp|title=Hallan la lista de Schindler|author=Reuters|first=|date=8 April 2009|website=|publisher=[[La Jornada]]|language=es|trans-title=Finding Schindler's List|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior? Tomb Study Yields Clues|date=14 September 2017|first=Christina|last=Anderson|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men. [[Webiorg]] was also inspired with the same spirit, and was attended by Bo (Bui) Bramason and Brat the Jute, thirsting for war.|[[Saxo Grammaticus]]&lt;ref name=Saxo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=THE DANISH HISTORY,  BOOKS I-IX by  Saxo Grammaticus|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1150|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1423">'''Simhika''', or '''Sinhika''', was the daughter of Demon king [[Hiranyakashipu]] and was the sister of the [[Vishnu]] devotee Bhakt [[Prahlada]]. She is also considered as the mother of [[Svarbhānu]], who was beheaded into two by Lord Vishnu into [[Rahu]], the head part and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]], the remaining body.

==Simhika in Ramayana and her death==
Simhika got the boon from [[Brahma]] that she can control anyone's shadow. Later, she controlled Devi [[Chhaya]], mother of Lord [[Shani]] and wife of [[Surya]], the sun god. And eventually got defeated by Shani and [[Hanuman]]. Simhika was forgiven by monkey god, Hanuman, but Hanuman told her that whenever he finds her in later phase of life he'll kill her. Later, when Hanuman was climbing the ocean to [[Lanka]], the kingdom of Demon [[Ravana]], Simhika was hiding in the ocean and captured Hanuman's shadow, Hanuman jumped into her mouth and came out tearing her stomach, ending the life of Simhika.

'''"Sing girls"''' ({{zh|c=星女郎|p=''xīng nǚ láng''}}) is a nickname for actresses who starred alongside [[Stephen Chow]], often as the main character's romantic interest.&lt;ref name=eastday&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enjoy.eastday.com/e/20071012/u1a3160012.html | title=张雨绮亲述一夜成名:30秒搞定周星驰 (Zhang Yuqi's overnight fame: 30 seconds to win over Stephen Chow) | author=邱致理 (Qiu Zhili) | publisher=南都周刊 | date=10 December 2007 | accessdate=28 June 2009|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are young, new actresses who go on to receive considerable media attention after appearing in one of Chow's films,&lt;ref name=dayoo&gt;{{cite web | publisher=大洋 (dayoo.com) | accessdate=28 June 2009 | url=http://life.dayoo.com/fashion/200906/09/33683_7956406_5.htm | title=从"翻版张柏芝"看女星整容是非 (From "New Cecilia Cheung", seeing if female stars are having makeovers or not) | editor=许慧健 (Xu Huijian) | date=9 June 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705203656/http://life.dayoo.com/fashion/200906/09/33683_7956406_5.htm | archivedate=5 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their success is often attributed to the attention brought to them by Chow&amp;mdash;[[Zhang Yuqi]], for example, has been referred to as Chow's "[[:wikt:protégée|protégée]]" after appearing in the 2007 film ''[[CJ7]]''.&lt;ref name="ChowsPlay"&gt;&lt;!--This URL should not be linked, as it appears to be copyvio, but here it is for quick reference: http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/158-Stephen-Chows-Play-CJ7.html--&gt;{{cite news |work = [[Straits Times]]|author = Boon Cheng|title = Stephen Chow's Play: CJ7|date = 6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese word 星 ''xīng'' refers both to Chow's nickname 星爷 (''Sing Yeh'', "Grandmaster Sing")&lt;ref name=dayoo/&gt; and to [[:wikt:明星|明星]], the word for a star or [[celebrity]].

Chow has not always chosen newcomer actresses to co-star with him; for example, [[Zhao Wei|Vicki Zhao]] already had a successful music and film career when she appeared as the female lead in ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'',&lt;ref name=eastday/&gt; and [[Gong Li]] was already famous as an "Yimou girl" ([[:zh:谋女郎|谋女郎]]) for her frequent collaboration with director [[Zhang Yimou]] before she starred in two Stephen Chow films in the early 1990s. Many times, though, starring with Chow has been a "Sing girl"'s first major role and has kick-started her career, as ''[[King of Comedy (film)|King of Comedy]]'' did for [[Cecilia Cheung]]. [[Eva Huang]] and [[Kitty Zhang]] both gained considerable attention from media and [[netizens]] after appearing in ''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]'' and ''[[CJ7]]'', respectively, even though their roles were relatively small (Huang's role had no lines at all).&lt;ref name=eastday/&gt;

[[Kingdom Yuen]] appeared in numerous 1990s Stephen Chow films not as a lead female or romantic interest, but rather in minor roles as a comedic [[stock character]].&lt;ref name=kingdom&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=4 July 2009 | url=http://www.brns.com/hkactors/pages/page48.html | title=Yuen King-tan/Kingdom Yuen | work=Hong Kong Cinema: View from the Brooklyn Bridge | first=Yves | last=Gendron | date=5 October 2004}} {{Unreliable source?|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The youngest "Sing girl" is 7 year old Zhang Yuwen, who appears in ''[[Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunantv.com/c/20130218/0947217139.html|title=揭秘《西游》最小星女郎 张煜雯喊星爷哥哥|publisher=Hunan TV|accessdate=2013-03-28|date=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soslan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dancing Soslan, [[Vladikavkaz]]]]
[[File:Sosruko DSC06305.JPG|thumb|Sosruko tower in [[Nalchik]]]]
'''Sosruko''' or '''Sosriqwa''' ({{lang-os|Сослан}}, ''Soslan''; {{lang-kbd|Сосрыкъуэ}}, ''Sosryqwa''; {{lang-krc|Сосурукъ/Сосуркъа}}, ''Sosuruq/Sosurqa'') is a central character in many cycles of the [[Nart sagas]] of the [[Caucasus]].

Sosruko is a powerful but devious man who is the smallest of the Narts; as a character, he is sometimes cast in the light of the [[trickster]] god, comparable to the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Loki]] (who finds a closer parallel in the Nart [[Syrdon]] however), [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[Amirani]], or the [[Ancient Greek]] [[Prometheus]]. It is possible that at least in the latter case, Sosruku served as a direct inspiration.

In Circassian mythology, it was Nart Sosriqwe, minion of the gods and his doting mother, Lady [[Satanaya]], who stole fire from the giant.

== Etymology ==
The name etymologically came from Turkic languages: [[Nogai language|Nogai]] ''suslan-'' "to look menacing", ''suslä'' "menacing, gloomy" (hence {{lang-os|Soslan}}). The variants {{lang-ab|Sasərqwa}}, {{lang-ady|Саусырыкъо}} [{{ipa|saːwsərəqʷa}}], {{lang-kbd|Сосрыкъуэ}} [{{ipa|sawsərəqʷa}}], [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]]: [{{ipa|sawsərəqʷa}}], [[Digor dialect|Digor]] {{lang-os|Sosruqo, Sozyryqo, Sozuruqo}}.
The name Sosruko [{{ipa|saːwsərəqʷa}}] is from [[Circassian language|Circassian]] {{ipa|sa}} "sword" + {{ipa|wa}} "hit" + {{ipa|sər}} "heat" + {{ipa|qʷa}} "son"; hence literally “The son of the fiery sword hit”.

'''The Bowery Boys''' are fictional [[New York City]] characters, portrayed by a [[repertory theater|company]] of New York actors, who were the subject of feature films released by [[Monogram Pictures]] from 1946 through 1958.

The Bowery Boys were successors of the "[[East Side Kids]]," who had been the subject of films since 1940. The group originated as the "[[Dead End Kids]]", who originally appeared in the 1937 film ''[[Dead End (1937 film)|Dead End]].'' A few of the actors previously appeared together as "[[Little Tough Guys|The Little Tough Guys]]."

==Origins==

===The Dead End Kids===
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
"The Dead End Kids" originally appeared in the 1935 play ''Dead End,'' dramatized by [[Sidney Kingsley]]. When [[Samuel Goldwyn]] turned the play into a [[Dead End (1937 film)|1937 film]], he recruited the original "kids" from the play—[[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Bobby Jordan]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Billy Halop]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]—to appear in the same roles in the film. This led to the making of six other films that shared the collective title "The Dead End Kids".

===The Little Tough Guys===
{{main|Little Tough Guys}}
In 1938, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] launched its own tough-kid series, "[[Little Tough Guys]]." Gradually, Universal recruited most of the original Dead End Kids, so the series ultimately featured "[[The Dead End Kids]] and [[Little Tough Guys]]." Universal made twelve feature films, and three 12-chapter serials with the gang. The final film in Universal's series, ''[[Keep 'Em Slugging]],'' was released in 1943, with [[Bobby Jordan]] replacing erstwhile ringleader [[Billy Halop]].

===The East Side Kids===
{{main|East Side Kids}}
When Warner Brothers released the remaining Dead End Kids from their contracts in 1939, producer [[Sam Katzman]] at Monogram acted quickly and hired several of them, including Jordan and the Gorcey brothers, Leo and David, as well as some of the Little Tough Guys, including Hally Chester, to star in a new series using the team name "The East Side Kids."  These films also introduced [[Sammy Morrison|'Sunshine' Sammy Morrison]], one of the original members of the [[Our Gang]] comedy team, as part of the gang.

The original members of the "Dead End Kids" were now working at several studios, so these films were made at the same time that Universal was making "The Dead End Kids" and "Little Tough Guys" series. A total of 21 films were made, with the final one, ''Come Out Fighting'', released in 1945.

==The Bowery Boys==

In 1945, when East Side Kids producer Katzman refused to grant Leo Gorcey's request to double his weekly salary, Gorcey quit the series, which then ended immediately. Bobby Jordan then suggested a meeting with his agent, Jan Grippo. Grippo, Gorcey, and Hall formed Jan Grippo Productions, revamped the format, and rechristened the series ''The Bowery Boys.'' (The earlier films's credits appear as "Leo Gorcey ''and'' The Bowery Boys".) Gorcey, who owned 40 percent of the company, starred, produced, and contributed to the scripts. The new series followed a more established formula than the prior incarnations of the team, with the gang usually hanging out at Louie's Sweet Shop (at 3rd &amp; Canal St.) until an adventure came along.

The original main characters were Terrence Aloysius "Slip" Mahoney ([[Leo Gorcey]]), Horace Debussy "Sach" Jones ([[Huntz Hall]]), Bobby ([[Bobby Jordan]]), Whitey ([[William "Billy" Benedict|Billy Benedict]]), and Chuck ([[David Gorcey]], sometimes billed as David Condon). [[Ernest Morrison|"Sunshine" Sammy Morrison]], "Scruno" in the East Side Kids films, declined the invitation to rejoin the gang. (He later stated in an interview that he "didn't like the setup", possibly referring to the idea of Gorcey and Hall being in the forefront, and being paid much more than the other members.) When Bobby Jordan quit the series for the same reason, his character was replaced by Butch Williams, with former East Side Kids [[Bennie Bartlett]] and [[Buddy Gorman]] alternating in the role. The proprietor of the malt shop where they hung out was the panicky Louie Dumbrowski ([[Bernard Gorcey]], Leo's and David's real-life father).

Like the previous incarnations of the team, the members went through a number of changes over the course of the series. Thirteen actors were members of the team at one time or another. Bobby Jordan, an original Dead End Kid, appeared in the first eight films, but left after being injured in an elevator accident. Jordan was also unhappy with the direction of the series, which favored Gorcey and Hall, and limited the participation of the other gang members.

[[Gabriel Dell]] returned in the fourth entry, ''[[Spook Busters]]'' (1946), as "Gabe Moreno," a former member of the gang just out of the Navy with a French war-bride in tow. He remained (minus spouse) for the next 16 features. Gabe was a convenient "utility" character, frequently changing jobs (private investigator, policeman, songwriter, reporter, Nazi spy) to suit the story at hand—and the limited casting budget. Dell often acted as a bridge between the real world and those of the Boys who he would summon to assist him. He reprised one of his East Side Kids roles in ''[[Hard Boiled Mahoney]]'' (1947), playing Gabe as a myopic nerd with thick glasses, ascot and cap. His final appearance was in ''[[Blues Busters (1950 film)|Blues Busters]]'' in 1950, generally regarded as one of the funniest in the series.

The early films such as ''[[In Fast Company]]'' (1946) flirted with the same humor-laced crime drama of the previous series, but they gradually shifted to all-out comedy, growing more slapstick and fantasy-oriented over the next decade. After 1950, the series began to resemble the farcical [[Abbott and Costello]] comedies—a far cry from the grim social realism of their 1930s films. The grittiness of the old days was sanitized with the gang's dingy basement club-house replaced by an ice cream parlor. The "boys" also adopted a more adult look, exchanging their sloppy, juvenile wardrobe for suits.

The team spirit of the ensemble cast faded as Huntz Hall was elevated to co-star status to showcase his comedic skills. The stories now focused entirely on Slip (the self-proclaimed leader of the bunch) and his zany sidekick, Sach, with the diminished three or four "boys" receding into the background with little to do. Time and again the plot revolved around Sach accidentally acquiring some strange power or ability (he becomes a psychic, champion wrestler, crooner, etc.) that Slip is quick to exploit. In most of the films, the gang pursues a scheme for quick riches or gets mixed up with neighborhood thugs. Story elements from their earlier films (haunted houses, mad scientists, nefarious spies) were also frequently incorporated into the new series.

Like a streetwise [[Abbott and Costello]], Gorcey and Hall became a cohesive comedy duo, extending their verbal and physical humor into broader slapstick comedy that served to increase the popularity of the series.  In 1953, [[Edward Bernds]], a new producer and director who had previously worked with [[The Three Stooges]], transformed the series into lucrative kiddie-matinée fodder, with Gorcey and Hall re-enacting gags borrowed from the Stooges. (Huntz Hall cited [[Shemp Howard]], who had appeared in three Little Tough Guys films, as a major influence during this latter phase in the series.)

Leo's character "Slip" was famed for his [[malaprop]]s (always delivered in a [[Brooklyn accent]]), such as "a clever seduction" for "a clever deduction," "I depreciate it!" ("I appreciate it!"), and "I regurgitate" ("I reiterate").

In the 1940s, [[Abbott and Costello]] appeared in a quartet of "service comedies", one for each branch of the military. The Bowery Boys duplicated this feat a decade later with ''[[Bowery Battalion]],'' ''[[Let's Go Navy!]],'' ''[[Here Come the Marines]],'' and ''[[Clipped Wings (1953 film)|Clipped Wings]].'' Abbott and Costello spoofed westerns: ''[[Ride 'Em Cowboy (1942 film)|Ride 'Em Cowboy]]'' (1942), the upper-classes: ''[[In Society]]'' (1944), and hillbillies: ''[[Comin' Round the Mountain]]'' (1951). The Bowery Boys repeated this formula in ''[[Bowery Buckaroos]]'' (1947), ''[[High Society (1955 film)|High Society]]'' (1955), and ''[[Feudin' Fools]]'' (1952), respectively.

Abbott and Costello went on safari: ''[[Africa Screams]]'' (1949), to the Middle East: ''[[Lost in a Harem]]'' (1944), and even tangled with pirates in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd]]'' (1952). Once again, the Bowery Boys followed suit with ''[[Jungle Gents]]'' (1954), ''[[Bowery to Bagdad]]'' (1955), and ''[[Hold That Hypnotist]]'' (1957). Abbott and Costello become private detectives in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man]]'' (1951); the Bowery Boys open up a detective agency in 1953's ''Private Eyes''.

After Abbott and Costello's haunted-house comedy ''[[Hold That Ghost]]'' (1941) became a smash hit, the East Side Kids released the similar ''Spooks Run Wild'' with Bela Lugosi later that year. Lugosi went on to help make ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]],'' one of A&amp;C's most popular and critically acclaimed comedies. The basic premise, centered around Dracula's scheme to transplant Costello's brain into the Frankenstein monster (played by [[Glenn Strange]]), was duplicated a few months later by The Bowery Boys in ''[[Master Minds]]'' (1949). Glenn Strange once again plays a hulking monster who switches minds with Sach (Huntz Hall). With a title suggesting a send-up of the Abbott and Costello "Meet" films, ''[[The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters]]'' (1954) was the highest grossing entry in the series.

After filming ''[[Dig That Uranium]]'' in 1955, Bernard Gorcey was killed in an automobile accident, devastating his son Leo, who began to drink heavily, and it visibly affected his performance in the following film, ''Crashing Las Vegas'', which was his last. (During filming, he became violently unhinged, trashing the set and destroying every prop in sight.{{cn|date=December 2017}}) At a subsequent meeting with Allied Artists, Gorcey demanded an increase on the 40% interest he held in the series. This was denied, and after a heated exchange, he quit the series and stormed off the studio lot.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The studio owed exhibitors three more films for the 1956 season, so Gorcey was replaced by [[Stanley Clements]], a former tough-teen actor who had been in a few East Side Kids movies. Clements, as "Duke Coveleskie," adapted to the series easily and completed the three films, which now starred "Huntz Hall and The Bowery Boys." The new Hall-Clements partnership was successful enough to be renewed for the 1957 season. Four more films were made, with Eddie LeRoy joining the cast as bespectacled "Blinky." With Bernard Gorcey gone, Louie's Sweet Shop was replaced by Clancy's Cafe with a similarly put-upon proprietor, "Mike" ([[Percy Helton]], later played by [[Dick Elliott]]).

==Legacy==

In all, there were 48 Bowery Boys films, making it the longest feature-film series of American origin in motion picture history (only the Mexican ''[[El Santo|Santo]]'' film series ran longer), with the final film, ''[[In the Money]],'' being released in 1958. Only Huntz Hall and David Gorcey had remained with the series since 1946.&lt;ref&gt;''Me and the Dead End Kid,'' Leo Gorcey, Jr., Spirit of Hope Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bowery Boys and East Side Kids picked up a new generation of mostly younger fans when the films were repackaged and syndicated for television in the 1960s and 1970s. They became a staple for independent stations across the U.S., often used to fill up the early-afternoon time-slots on weekends.

All 48 Bowery Boys films were released on DVD by Warner Brothers via their "made-to-order" Archive Collection label in four volumes, each consisting of 12 films on 4 recordable media discs, beginning November 20, 2012. Initial distribution was advertised by Warner as being traditionally replicated on "pressed disc" media in anticipation of high demand for these first Bowery Boy releases to be "remastered from the best available elements."

They fought to have women legally considered persons so that women could be appointed to the Senate. The petition was filed on August 27, 1927,&lt;ref name="Alberta1999"&gt;{{cite book| title=Alberta History| volume=47–49| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jL06AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=famous+five+persons+case+august+27&amp;dq=famous+five+persons+case+august+27| accessdate=May 10, 2013| year=1999| publisher=Historical Society of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 24, 1928, Canada's Supreme Court summarized its unanimous decision that women are not such "persons".&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt;

The last line of the judgement reads, "Understood to mean 'Are women eligible for appointment to the [[Senate of Canada]],' the question is answered in the negative." This judgement was overturned by the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] on October 18, 1929. This case came to be known as the "[[Persons Case]]". Although Canadian women (those who were British/Canadian citizens) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929, the case was part of a continent-wide drive for political equality, coming seven years after discrimination against women's voting rights was prohibited in the United States through the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and thus had important ramifications.

Some saw this as "radical change"; others saw it as a restoration of the original framing of the English constitutional documents, including the [[1689 Bill of Rights]], which uses only the term "person", not the term "man" (or "woman" for that matter).

Some others have interpreted the Privy Council rule as causing a change in the Canadian judicial approach to the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], an approach that has come to be known as the "[[living tree doctrine]]".

==The Five==
The famous five women were:

* [[Emily Murphy]] (1868–1933), the [[British Empire]]'s first female judge;
* [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]] (1868–1965), farm women's leader, political activist and first female [[Cabinet minister]] in Alberta, still serving in that capacity at the time of the court case;
* [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]] (1873–1951), a [[suffragist]] and author, member of the Alberta Legislature 1921–1926;
* [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] (1868–1931), the first woman elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], or any legislature in Canada or the rest of the British Empire, but no longer MLA at the time of the court case;
* [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]] (1849–1931), an advocate for working women, author and a founding member of the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]].

===Emily Murphy===
{{Main|Emily Murphy}}
Emily Murphy stood out in the famous five, bringing them to a victory in 1929. Emily was appointed to the office of Magistrate of the Edmonton Juvenile Court in 1916 and later became the magistrate of the newly created Women's Court. At the time, no woman had held such a position and many men objected.&lt;ref name=MacEwan&gt;{{cite book |first=Grant| last=MacEwan| title=...and Mighty Women too: Stories of Notable Western Canadian Women| year=1975| publisher= Western Producer Prairie Books| isbn=978-0919306653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career as a writer, Murphy used the pen name "Janey Canuck". In 1922, she wrote ''The Black Candle'' which detailed her beliefs on race and drug use in Canada and strongly influenced the drug policy of the day. Murphy came from a privileged background in which white women were protected from many topics.&lt;ref name="Millar"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Millar |title=The Famous Five: Five Canadian Women and Their Fight to Become Persons |year=1999 |publisher=Western Heritage Centre| isbn=978-0920109168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irene Parlby===
{{Main|Irene Parlby}}
In 1916, Irene Parlby was elected as the first president of the United Farm Women of Alberta and in 1921, was elected to the Alberta legislature and received a cabinet post in the United Farmers of Alberta government, becoming the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial rank. She served as cabinet minister until the downfall of the government in 1935. Parlby worked with the Red Cross during [[World War I]] and later served on the Board of Governors of the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Nellie McClung===
{{Main|Nellie McClung}}
Nellie McClung's jobs in her lifetime included teacher, author, public speaker, temperance activist, internationally known women's rights activist, and politician {Warne, Literature as Pulpit]. In 1918, she was a member of the Dominion War Council and the only woman representative at the League of Nations.  She represented Canada at the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist church in 1921 and was the first woman on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Board of the Governors.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;  In 1921, McClung was elected to the Alberta legislature as an MLA in Edmonton for the Liberal Party.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt; She served one term, not being re-elected in 1926. She was a member of the Political Equality League of Manitoba, and she played the leading role in the Mock Parliament held on January 29, 1914, at the Walker Theatre in Winnipeg, which humorously discussed Votes for Men.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Louise McKinney===
{{Main|Louise McKinney}}
Louise McKinney became one of the first two women elected to a legislature in the British Empire, and the first to take her seat. She was a founder of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in Alberta and the West – she served as the organization's vice-president for more than 22 years beginning in 1906 – and regularly attended World Meetings of the WCTU. She signed the appeal to the Privy Council in 1929. In 1931, she became president of the Canadian Union, Woman's Christian Temperance Union. McKinney was also named to be Commissioner for the first General Council of the [[United Church of Canada]], and was the only woman to sign the Basis of Union.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Henrietta Muir Edwards===
{{Main|Henrietta Muir Edwards}}
Henrietta Muir Edwards, author and researcher on women's topics, held an influence within the National Council of Women&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt; and held chairmanship of the Committee in Law in the National Council of Women for more than 35 years. She was also a Red Cross leader during the war years. Edwards was the secretary of the National Subcommittee which focused on thrift and economy in Canadian homes.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Honorary senators===
None of the five became [[Senate of Canada#Senators|senators]]; the first female senator was Quebecer [[Cairine Reay Wilson]], appointed four months after the ruling. Nearly 80 years later, on October 8, 2009, the Senate voted to make the five the first "honorary senators".&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2009/10/10/calgary-famous-five-honourary-senators.html |title='Famous 5' named honorary senators |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=CBC.ca |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hansard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/..%5C40%5C2%5Cparlbus%5Cchambus%5Csenate/deb-E/059db_2009-10-08-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=2#53|title=Senate of Canada – Debates|first=Senate of|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women.

Some might well question the overall significance of the decision, noting that by the 1920s the Senate of Canada was a largely powerless body. The more powerful [[House of Commons of Canada]] had elected its first female member ([[Agnes Macphail]]) in 1921, well before the Persons Case. However, the precedent did establish the principle that women could hold any political office in Canada. Moreover, the Five clearly did devote their energies to increasing women's participation on legislative bodies with greater power: three had been members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta legislature]]. The controversy surrounding the women has made commemoration difficult.{{Citation needed|date = August 2012}} The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children.

===Opinions on the Famous Five===
Opinions on the Famous Five vary considerably. Many laud them as trailblazers for women. Others are disturbed by the opinions of some of the women on other issues, such as opposition to non-white immigration and their successful campaigns to have [[eugenics]] legislation introduced in Canadian provinces, which resulted in the sterilization of thousands of those deemed "mentally deficient" or "insane" in Alberta and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/eugenics-keeping-canada-sane-feature/&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Murphy was not shy with her opinions and her outspoken nature had a tendency to give her a negative reputation. She wrote letters of her opinions to police chiefs, government officials, social service agencies and judicial officials about the extent of drug traffic and possible cures. Nellie McClung was known as the most memorable and popular of the famous five. Her causes included women's right to vote, prohibition, women in the church and women in public life.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;  Henrietta Muir Edwards was described as "tenacious" with her work with prohibition.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. Emily Murphy dealt with single mothers and issues of child support, child welfare, and adoption by lobbying for women's rights.&lt;ref name = Sharpe&gt;{{cite book| first=Robert J.| last=Sharpe| title=The Persons Case: The Origins and Legacy of the Fight for Legal Personhood| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOwC1vcGgcEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4| isbn=978-0802096289| year=2007| publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nellie McClung favoured free medical and dental treatment for school children as well as mothers' allowances and better property rights for women. She was open to divorce and birth control but opposed the sale and use of liquor. Louise McKinney believed strongly in the "evils of alcohol" and pushed to enact prohibition measures. She advocated excluding cigarettes from parcels sent to soldiers in World War&amp;nbsp;I in 1917. She supported reasonable measures for social welfare and health as well as introducing bills intended to make prohibition more effective, to improve the lot of immigrants and bring better security to widows. She was responsible for the introduction of a motion which led to the [[Dower Act]]. Irene Parlby in her position as cabinet minister in Alberta pursued these goals expressed by McKinney. Henrietta Edwards worked with property law and sought to protect women and children.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;

===Commemorations===
The Famous Five have been commemorated with individual and group plaques in the [[Centre Block#Senate foyer|foyer]] and antechamber of Canada's Senate, and two identical sculptures by Canadian artist [[Barbara Paterson]], one on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]], the other at the [[Olympic Plaza (Calgary)|Olympic Plaza]] in [[Calgary]]. The sculpture on Parliament Hill was unveiled on October 18, 2000, in a public ceremony that included [[French language in Canada|French]] and [[Canadian English|English]] singers, [[Inuit]] dancers, and speeches by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]]. A sculpture of the Famous Five by sculptor Helen Granger Young stands on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Commissioned by the Nellie McClung Foundation, it was unveiled at a ceremony on June 18, 2010.

The City of [[Edmonton]] has named one park in its River Valley Parks System after each of the "Famous Five".&lt;ref name="edmonton"&gt;{{cite web| title=Alphabetical Park Listing| url=http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| publisher=City of Edmonton| date=May 14, 2012| accessdate=May 14, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115516/http://edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| archivedate=November 27, 2012| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy had many accomplishments, such as becoming the first president of the Federated Women's Institute of Canada, vice-president of [[National Council of Women]] of Canada, president of [[Canadian Women's Press Club]], director of the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Child Protection, first president of the Women's Canadian Club of Edmonton and vice-president of the Social Service Council of Canada. Emily Murphy also received many honours for her life's work including being decorated by King [[George V]] to be a Lady of Grace of the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Order of St. John of Jerusalem]].

Irene Parlby was honoured in 1935 at spring convocation at the [[University of Alberta]] with an honorary LL.D. degree. Tributes in honour of Henrietta Edwards can be found on a plaque in the Senate Chamber in Ottawa and another in the post office in Fort Macleod. Nellie McClung spoke in Calgary after Edwards' passing and spoke of Edwards, "who for 40 years was convener of laws for the National Council of Women" should not be forgotten.&lt;ref name="MacEwan" /&gt;

Along with [[Thérèse Casgrain]], the Five were commemorated in the 2001 [[Journey Series (banknotes)|Journey Series]] of Canada's [[Canadian fifty-dollar bill|fifty-dollar bill]].&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt;  In December 2011, the [[Bank of Canada]] announced that the Famous Five would not appear on the redesigned $50 [[Frontier Series]] banknote that it issued in 2012.&lt;ref name="50dollars"&gt;{{cite news| title=Should the new $50 bill show an Arctic research boat instead of the Famous Five?| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2011/12/should-the-new-50-bill-show-an-arctic-research-boat-instead-of-the-famous-five.html| work=CBC News| date=December 7, 2011| publisher=cbc.ca| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. To honour the Five and continue to involve women in leadership roles in Canada, Frances Wright and others established the non-profit Famous Five Foundation on October 18, 1996, the 70th anniversary of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council's decision.&lt;ref name="5foundation"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225022456/http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| dead-url=yes| archive-date=December 25, 2012| title=About Us| publisher=Famous 5 Foundation| date=| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New York Five''' refers to a group of five [[New York City]] [[architect]]s ([[Peter Eisenman]], [[Michael Graves]], [[Charles Gwathmey]], [[John Hejduk]] and [[Richard Meier]]) whose photographed work was the subject of a CASE (Committee of Architects for the Study of the Environment) meeting at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], organized by [[Arthur Drexler]] and [[Colin Rowe]] in 1969, and featured in the subsequent book ''Five Architects'', published by Wittenborn in 1972, then more famously by Oxford Press in 1975.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{Citation

These five had a common allegiance to a pure form of architectural [[modernism]], harking back to the work of [[Le Corbusier]] in the 1920s and 1930s, although on closer examination their work was far more individual.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;  The grouping may have had more to do with social and academic allegiances, particularly the mentoring role of [[Philip Johnson]].

The book evoked a stinging rebuke in the May 1973 issue of ''[[Architectural Forum]]'', a group of essays called "Five on Five", written by architects [[Romaldo Giurgola]], [[Allan Greenberg]], [[Charles Willard Moore|Charles Moore]], [[Jaquelin T. Robertson]], and [[Robert A. M. Stern]].&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;  These five architects [Guirgola et al.], known as the "Greys", attacked the "Whites" [Eisenmann et al.] on the grounds that this pursuit of the pure modernist aesthetic resulted in unworkable buildings that were indifferent to site, indifferent to users, and divorced from daily life.  These "Grays" were aligned with [[Philadelphia]] architect [[Robert Venturi]] and the emerging interest in [[vernacular architecture]], [[New Classical Architecture]] and early [[postmodernism]].  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Eisenman and Robertson were in partnership, though they designed and credited their work separately.

John Hejduk, the oldest of the five, is known as a pedagogue and the visionary composer of drawings, buildings, poetry, and theoretical writings from the mid-1950s on. Charles Gwathmey is known for his prolific practice (a partnership with Robert Siegel).  While Gwathmey remained true to modernist style, the purity of his work is tempered by the evolving capital realities of corporate and public commissions. Meier is similarly prolific, yet known best for a continuous refinement of the purist voyage on which they initially embarked.  Meier's buildings remain truest to the modernist aesthetic and especially to a neo-Corbusian form.  Eisenman, the most printed writer of the five was perhaps the one who best navigated the line between theory and practice.  And along with this navigation came infamy as a critic.  Eisenman is associated with [[Deconstructivism]].  Graves defected from modernism; he was the first to disavow his relationship with the others and he has worked subsequently as a [[post-modern]] architect.

'''The Missing 54''' are the soldiers and officers of [[Indian armed forces]] who have been given status of missing in action or killed in action in [[1971 Indo-Pak war]] by government. But they are believed to be alive and imprisoned in various Pakistani jails. Though Pakistan have denied existence of any Indian POW's of 1971 Indo-Pak war; there is strong evidence to suggest that they were captured alive and some or all of them still languish in Pakistani jails. The list of names of these soldiers/officers and their respective service units are as follows.

''(This list was tabled in the Lok Sabha in 1979 by Samarendra Kundu, Minister of State of External Affairs, in reply to unstarred question 6803 raised by Amarsingh Pathawa.)
''
''Note - Initial list consisted of 40 names which later on expanded to 54.''

"If the cause be just and mind be strong,
No force is great, No distance long,
If selfless souls with such a strength,
Face hazards all, they win at length."
THIS is a diary noting in Dr R.S. Suri's diary, father of Major Ashok Suri, captured in the 1971 war. The Army had declared Major Suri as "Killed in action". DR Suri who ran a Yoga Ashram in New Delhi did not believe it. He was sent a helmet with a bullet hole in it and someone else's name written on it. 
 
During the war, the fifth battalion of the Assam Regiment was deployed as part of 191 Infantry Brigade on the west of Munnawar Tawi River in Chambb sector. 10 Infantry Division on the Indian side faced 23 Division on the Pakistani side. 5 Sikh were at Chhamb and were in the middle of the brigade group with 5 Assam and 4/1 Gorkha Rifles on either side. Throughout 4 December Pakistani artillery and PAF were very active in the areas of 5 Sikh and 5 Assam. On Dec 4th Pakistani infantry supported by armour captured Mandiala North after bitter hand-to-hand fighting. On 5 December, 2 tanks of Deccan Horse and a platoon of 5 Sikh recaptured the MandialaBridge. The battle raged on through the day and night of 5 December. These three battalions were subjected to intense shelling and repeated PAF attacks. During this battle, Maj Ashok Suri went missing.
 
Then on December 26, 1974, R.S. Suri received a hand-written note dated December 7, 1974 from his son. The letter contained a slip in which his son had written, "I am okay here." The covering note read, "Sahib, valaikumsalam, I cannot meet you in person. Your son is alive and he is in Pakistan. I could only bring his slip, which I am sending you. Now going back to Pak." Signed M. Abdul Hamid.
In August, 1975, he received another missive postmark dated 'June 14/15/16, 1975, Karachi.' The letter said, "Dear Daddy, Ashok touches thy feet to get your benediction. I am quite ok here. Please try to contact the Indian Army or Government of India about us. We are 20 officers here. Don't worry about me. Pay my regards to everybody at home, specially to mummy, grandfather – Indian government can contact Pakistan government for our freedom." The then Defence Secretary had the handwriting confirmed as Ashok's and changed the official statement from "killed in action" to "missing in action"!
When one gets one's son's letter from a prison in Pakistan, what does one do? Well, R.S. Suri spent the rest of his life making weekly trips to the Ministry of External Affairs where everyone got to know him well. He worked with the government, careful not to involve the media because MEA officials advised him that the missing servicemen were in danger of being killed if they did so. He along with other Delhi-based families formed the Missing Defence Personnel Relative's organization. He used to write to family members based in other parts of the country updating them on what all had transpired. He wrote regularly to the Prime Minister and received regular replies. The overriding concern was that the issue should be taken up whenever the two sides met as a matter of urgency.
In a letter on Jul 15th, 1980, Dr Suri writes from the Delhi Based Next of Kin to the Honourable Minister of External Affairs of Pakistan, Mr Agha Shahi. Talking of the Missing men and welcoming Pakistan's gesture to search for these men, "…….. You will appreciate that the family members have undergone enough agony and misery and some have become mental as well as physical wrecks. The suspense for them is unbearable. ….settle this issue on humanitarian grounds." 
 
In 1983, after what seemed like a breakthrough, the Pakistan government invited family members to Pakistan to identify, if found, its missing defence personnel. This happened after November, 1982 when India and Pakistan signed a protocol on exchange of prisoners when Zia Ul Haque visited India.
On May 30, 1983 – Narasimha Rao said that he would take up at the highest level the visit of the parents of missing defence personnel to Pakistan, since India had allowed the visit of some Pakistani family members to India in 1972. Dr.Suri on behalf of the missing defence families, was assured that Rao would try to facilitate this visit.
 
A delegation of six next-of-kin were allowed to go. It was made very clear that this was a classified visit that the press should not get wind of. There was a feeling of some deal having been done. The families were told to " Get the men back. They may not be in good health but you can nurse them back to health."
The families left on September 12, 1983, Monday for Lahore. This was the first time the Indians had got consular access after 1971. The families got to know that some officials of the MEA will also be going with them toMultan jail. Indira Gandhi in India was meanwhile making aggressive statements in favour of Khan Abdul Gafar Khan &amp; the MQM movement which was irritating Pak. On Sept 14th they flew to Multan. There was a sense of enthusiasm. That day India was supposed to grant Pak officials reciprocal access to 25 Pakistani prisoners at Patiala jail which did not happen. The news came in Pakistani papers that "India goes back on its words".

On Sept 15, 1983, the families visited Multan jail. Dr.Suri was getting hysterical, laughing and crying at the same time. The Pakistani newspaper report of India going back on its word in showing 25 prisoners in Patialajail was at the back of his mind at that time. However, they still clung to the promise and hope that the Indian Govt. had given them.
 
. The jail official who was present commented when Mrs.Tambay was signing her name remarked "Sorry Mrs.Tambay, Tambay is not here." They did not find any of the people they were looking for there. 200 odd prisoners were being offered repatriation by Pakistan, subject to verification during the consular access. The families including Dr Suri wondered when Pakistan had already offered to repatriate these people where was the need for the visit?
 
The family members sat through the consular access process for about 6 people, after which they were asked to go out as their part was done. The jail officials told them that only Zia ul Huq could help us with this category of prisoners.
 
Even after the visit, disheartening though it had been, did not dampen Dr Suri's commitment. He believed the government was doing all it could to get the men back. He never gave up hope. Finally, though his body gave up and he died in 1999 saying, "Perhaps I will finally find peace in the grave."

As per the Geneva Conventions, "Parties to the conflict shall communicate to each other the names of any prisoners of war who are detained till the end of proceedings or until punishment has been completed. By agreement between the parties to the conflict, commissions shall be established for the purpose of searching for dispersed prisoners of war and assuring their repatriation with the least possible delay."

On the Eastern front where there were 93,007 POWs (of which 72795 were soldiers), an agreement was signed by the Foreign Ministers of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan on 30 April 1974 at New Delhi. Thereafter the Pakistani POWs captured on the Eastern front were also repatriated.

SOME OF THE MAIN EVIDENCES

Flight Lt. V.V. Tambay ( the following is often cited as evidence- however if you note, the paper report ison 5th dec. Tambay went missing on 6th dec. SO the newspaper report is wrong.)
Maj Ghosh's photograph published in Time Magazine 
Maj AK Ghosh's photograph was published in Time Magazine dated 27-12-1971
The photograph is proof that Maj AK Ghosh was in Pakistani custody when the war ended on 17 December 1971. He did not return with the POWs in 1972 at the time of the Simla agreement. He may have died in the interim period in a Pakistani jail. Surely there must be some record of that. The Indian and Pakistan governments can work together to find out what happened to such men. Why were some names not included in the POW list is again a moot point. 
A brief note from Maj Ashok Suri followed by another letter in 1975
On 26 December 1974, R S Suri received a hand written note dated 07-12-1974 the words " I am okay here: scribbled on a tiny scrap of paper from Ashok Suri. His father also received letters from a Karachi jail on August 13th 1975 dated June 14/15/16th 1975 stating that there were 20 other officers with him there. The handwriting was authenticated by the Indian government and Indian Ministry of External Affairs officials on many occasions expressed to Dr RS Suri that they believed Ashok Suri was there. 
Why would someone come and send the note to Maj Suri's distraught father if there was no basis for it. What purpose would it serve? 
Mohanlal Bhaskar repatriated on 09.12.1974- writes "Main Bharat ka jasoos tha" or " I spied for India" 
Mohanlal Bhaskar, who was in a jail between 1968 and 1974 and repatriated on 09.12.1974 wrote a book in Hindi ( I was a spy for India) and gave a signed affidavit stating that he met a Col Asif Shafi of Second Punjab regt of Pakistan and a Maj Ayaaz Ahmed Sipra in Fort of Attock imprisoned for conspiring against Bhutto in the infamous "Attock conspiracy" . The Pakistani Major Ayaaz Ahmed Sipra spoke of his befriending a Gill of the Indian Air Force and a Captain Singh of the Indian Army as well as mentioning that there were around 40 Pows of the 1965 and 1971 wars in that jail who had no chances of release. 
In the Attock Conspiracy, several officers of Pakistan's army and air force were arrested on March 30, 1973, on charges of conspiring to overthrow the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The detainees included Major Farooq Adam, Major Nadir Pervez (who later became a federal minister in the Nawaz Sharif government), Brigadier Wajid Ali Shah, Colonel Hamdani, and Major Ayaz Sipra, and a total of 59 officers were declared conspirators. The case is well known as the Attock conspiracy. Fifteen army and four air-force officers were found guilty of conspiracy and were handed jail terms ranging from three months to life.

In this conspiracy, 15 officers were sentenced to terms in prison- among them Maj Ayaaz Ahmed Sipra and Col Asif Shafi. Others such as Farooq Adam ( a Gallian, i.e. from Lawrence school, Ghoraghali) were also sentenced in the Attock conspiracy .

Ayaaz Ahmed and Shafi later apparently moved to the US where Shafi was again traced by Manish Jain ( son in law of Sqn Ldr Jain, another Indian Officer missing and believed to be in Pakistani jails since the 1971 war) and Shafi confirmed to Jain unofficially that he had met Wg Cdr Gill in Attock in 2000 in a telephonic conversation.

A Pakistani General, General Riaz, Governor NWFP who subsequently died in an accident informed Mr Ashwini Kumar, then IG of the Border Security Force as a personal favour to him at the Munich Olympics in 1972 that Major Waraich was being held in Dargai jail, NWFP. 
The earlier sightings in 1972, 1975 seem true even if later sightings may have been mistakes. This is because at that time noone knew of the case of Missing defence personnel. Mohan Lal Bhaskar had no knowledge that some Indian Officers were kept back in Pakistan when he returned and wrote his book. In those days there was no internet or even widespread television. That is why the movement to trace the Indian POWs has remained so strong.

The '''traitorous eight''' was a group of eight employees who left [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]] in 1957 to found [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. [[William Shockley]] had in 1956 recruited a group of young PhD graduates with the goal to develop and produce new semiconductor devices. While Shockley had received a [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics and was an experienced researcher and teacher, his management of the group was authoritarian and unpopular.&lt;ref group=note name=NESP/&gt; This was accentuated by the fact that Shockley's research focus wasn’t proving fruitful.&lt;ref group=note name=PARA/&gt; After the demand for Shockley to be replaced was rebuffed, the eight left to form their own company.  

Shockley described their leaving as a "betrayal". The eight who left Shockley Semiconductor were [[Julius Blank]], [[Victor Grinich]], [[Jean Hoerni]], [[Eugene Kleiner]], [[Jay Last]], [[Gordon Moore]], [[Robert Noyce]] and [[Sheldon Roberts]]. In August 1957 they reached an agreement with [[Sherman Fairchild]] and on September 18, 1957, they formed [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. The newly founded Fairchild Semiconductor soon grew into a leader of the semiconductor industry. In 1960 it became an incubator of [[Silicon Valley]] and was directly or indirectly involved in the creation of dozens of corporations including [[AMD]] and [[Intel]].&lt;ref name=BW/&gt; These many spin-off companies came to be known as "[[#Fairchildren|Fairchildren]]".

==Initiation==
[[File:William Shockley, Stanford University.jpg|thumb|200px|Shockley in 1975]]

In the winter of 1954–1955, William Shockley, an inventor of the transistor and a visiting professor at [[Stanford University]], decided to establish his own mass production of advanced transistors and [[Shockley diode]]s.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=67}} He found a sponsor in [[Raytheon]], but Raytheon discontinued the project after a month.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=69}} In August 1955 Shockley turned for advice to the financier [[Arnold Beckman]], the owner of [[Beckman Instruments]].{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|pp=164–165}} Shockley needed one million dollars.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=69}} Beckman knew that Shockley had no chance in the business, but believed that Shockley's new inventions would be beneficial for his own company and did not want to give them to his competitors.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=68, 86: For example, the field-effect transistor with a p-n junction proposed by Shockley ideally suited for DC modulators was produced by Beckman Instruments.}} Accordingly, Beckman agreed to create and fund a laboratory under the condition that its discoveries should be brought to mass production within two years.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=68}}

The new department of Beckman Instruments took the name Shockley Semi-Conductor Laboratories (the hyphen was conventional in those years).{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=68, 73}} During 1955 Beckman and Shockley signed the deal,{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=168}} bought licenses on all necessary patents for $25,000,{{sfn |Lojek|2007 |pp=81–82: Shockley had access to all developments of Bell; he obtained licenses on the newest technologies involving lithographic photoresist and silicon oxide passivation.}} and selected the location in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], near [[Palo Alto, California]].{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=68}} The place did not prove very successful: Shockley's colleagues at [[Bell Labs]] and [[RCA]] refused to move to a rural location with no long-distance phone service.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=69–70: a long-distance line has since been brought to Palo Alto, in 1957}} The vast majority of semiconductor-related companies and professionals were based on the East Coast, so Shockley posted ads in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=70–71}} Early respondents included Sheldon Roberts of [[Dow Chemical]], Robert Noyce of [[Philco]] and [[Jay Last]], a former intern of Beckman Instruments.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=141: Last turned down an offer from Beckman Instruments in favor of Shockley Labs.}}{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=71–73}} The newspaper campaign brought some three hundred responses, and fifteen people, including Gordon Moore and David Allison,{{sfn|Lécuyer|2000|p=241: Allison left Shockley for Fairchild after the traitorous eight, and later founded [[Signetics]]}} Shockley himself recruited at a meeting of the American Physical Society.

Selection continued throughout 1956. Shockley was a proponent of social technologies (which later led him to [[eugenics]]) and asked each candidate to pass a psychological test,{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=170: The consultants found Shockley, Noyce and Moore "very bright, but they would never make good managers"}} followed by an interview.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|pp=164–165}}

Blank, Last, Moore, Noyce and Roberts started working in April–May, and Kleiner, Grinich and Hoerni came during the summer.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=74}} By September 1956, the lab had 32 employees, including Shockley.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=75}} Each successful candidate had to negotiate his salary with Shockley. Kleiner, Noyce and Roberts settled for $1,000 per month; the less-experienced Last got $675. Hoerni did not bother about his payment.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=75}} Shockley set his own salary at $2,500 and made all salaries accessible to all employees.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=74}} Two of Shockley's choices later appeared to be mistakes: William Happ was proven insufficiently competent for the work,{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=89}} and technologist [[Dean Knapic]] had forged his university degree and certificate of military service. He later brought Shockley's technologies to competitors.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=91}}{{sfn|Brock|2010|pp=45, 69}}

The members of the future traitorous eight were aged between 26 (Last) and 33 (Kleiner); six of them held a PhD.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=9}} Hoerni was an experienced scientist and gifted manager, and, according to [[Bo Lojek]], matched Shockley in intellect.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=125}}{{sfn|Lécuyer|2006|p=276}} Only Noyce was involved in semiconductor research,{{sfn|Lécuyer|2000|p=160}} and only Grinich had experience in electronics.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=56}}

==Research strategy==
Throughout 1956 most members of the lab were assembling and tuning the equipment, and "pure scientists" Hoerni and Noyce carried out individual applied research.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=75}} Shockley refused to hire technical staff, believing that his scientists should be able to handle all technological processes.{{sfn|Berlin|2005|pp=86–87}} After resettlement, he focused on fine-tuning Shockley diodes for mass production, and five employees, led by Noyce, continued the work on a field effect transistor for Beckman Instruments.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=79, 80}} Shockley refused to work on bipolar transistors, which later was proven a strategic mistake. Because the work on Shockley diodes took so much effort the produced devices were commercial failures.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=80–81}}{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=171}}

According to Noyce and Moore, as well as David Brock and [[Joel Shurkin]], the shift from bipolar transistors to Shockley diodes was unexpected.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=80}}{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=12}}{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=171}} Shockley initially planned to work on the mass production of diffusion bipolar transistors, but then set up a "secret project" on Shockley diodes, and in 1957 stopped all works on bipolar transistors.{{sfn|Holbrook|2003|p=54}}&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Gordon (2001) ''[http://www-siepr.stanford.edu/conferences/silicon_papers/moore.pdf Learning the Silicon Valley Way]''. stanford.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this turn are unknown.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=171}} According to Beckman's biographer, Shockley regarded his diode as an interesting scientific problem, and chose it, neglecting Beckman's commercial interests.{{sfn|Thackray|2000|p=245}}

Bo Lojek, based on the archives of Shockley, believes that Shockley Labs never worked on bipolar transistors; that Shockley diodes were Shockley and Beckman's original target, for which Beckman Instruments received military R&amp;D contracts;{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=79–81}} and that Shockley diodes could have found widespread use in telephony if Shockley had improved their reliability.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=80–81}}

==Frictions==
&lt;!--[[File:Отмечают Нобелевскую Шокли 2 ноября 1956.jpg|thumb|Staff of Shockley Labs celebrate the announcement of the Shockley's Nobel Prize award on November 2, 1956. Sitting, left to right: Moore, Roberts, Jones, Shockley. Standing: Noyce (center, dark suit), Last (far right).]] --&gt;
Historians and colleagues generally agree that Shockley was a poor manager and businessman.&lt;ref group=note name=NESP/&gt; From early childhood he was prone to outbursts of unprovoked aggression,{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|pp=9–11}} which were suppressed due to the internal discipline of his past working environment. He also tended to see rivals, even in his own subordinates.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=175}}

On November 1, 1956, it was announced that the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics would be awarded to Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=76}} The related public events of November–December overtired Shockley and took him away from the lab in a time when it had several management problems. Despite the festivities, the atmosphere in the lab was unhealthy.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=76–80}}

Although Shockley was never diagnosed by psychiatrists,{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=77: "Shockley's autism was unavoidable and was a reason for many of Shockley's social confrontations"}} historians characterized Shockley's state of mind in 1956–1957 as paranoia&lt;ref group=note name=PARA/&gt; or [[autism]]. All phone calls were recorded,{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=232}} and the staff was not allowed to share their results with each other, which was not feasible since they all worked in a small building.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|pp=175–176}} Shockley, not trusting his employees, was sending their reports to Bell Labs for double-checking.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=174}} At some point he sent the entire lab for a lie detector test, though everyone refused.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=45}}&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;

The team started losing its members, starting with Jones, a technologist, who left in January 1957 due to a conflict with Grinich and Hoerni. Noyce and Moore then stood on different sides: Moore led the dissidents, whereas Noyce stood behind Shockley and tried to resolve conflicts.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=90}} Shockley appreciated that and considered Noyce as his sole support in the group.{{sfn|Berlin|2001}}

==Resignation==
[[File:Gordon Moore.jpg|thumb|left|Gordon Moore in 2004]]

In March 1957, Kleiner, who was beyond Shockley's suspicions, asked permission ostensibly to visit an exhibition in Los Angeles. Instead he flew to New York to seek investors for a new company, and his parents, New York residents, assisted him.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=89}} Kleiner was supported by Blank, Grinich, Last, Roberts, Hoerni and Moore.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=49}} [[Arthur Rock]] and Alfred Coyle from [[Hayden, Stone &amp; Co.]] became interested in the offer, believing that trainees of a Nobel laureate were destined to succeed.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=89}}

As a last resort, on May 29, 1957 a group led by Moore presented Arnold Beckman with an ultimatum: solve the "Shockley problem" or they would leave. Moore suggested finding a professor position for Shockley and replacing him in the lab with a professional manager.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=90}}{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=177}} Beckman refused, believing that Shockley could still improve the situation, later regretting this decision.{{sfn|Thackray|2000|loc=p. 249: "I didn't know enough about Shockley at the time when this group came up to me and said it's either Shockley or us. If I had known what I know now, I'd have said good-bye to Shockley and I probably would have been very much involved in the semiconductor business. But I didn't. We carried on for a while, and finally it got to the point where we could see that [Shockley] was just incapable of running an operation".}}

&lt;!--[[File:Учредительный доллар Fairchild Semiconductor.png|thumb|One of the ten one-dollar bills signed by the founding members of Fairchild Semiconductor, from the Stanford University collection.]]--&gt;
In June 1957, Beckman finally put a manager between Shockley and the team, but by then seven key employees had already made their decision.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=90}} At the last minute they were joined by Noyce. Roberts persuaded him to attend the meeting of the "California group", as they called themselves in the agreement with Fairchild.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=103}} The meeting was held at the [[Clift (hotel)|Clift Hotel]] in California and was attended by Rock and Coyle.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=91}} These ten people became the core of a new company.

{{quote|Coyle, a ruddy-faced Irishman with a fondness for ceremony, pulled out 10 newly minted $1 bills and laid them carefully on the table. "Each of us should sign every bill", he said. These dollar bills, covered with signatures, he explained, would be their contracts with each other.&lt;ref name=SFG/&gt;}}

Finding investors proved to be difficult.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=91}} The US electronics industry was concentrated in the east, and the California group preferred to stay near Palo Alto.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=49}} In August 1957, Rock and Coyle met with the inventor and businessman Sherman Fairchild, founder of [[Fairchild Aircraft]] and [[Fairchild Camera]].&lt;ref name=r4/&gt;{{sfn|Thackray|2015|pp=164-165}}  Fairchild sent Rock to his deputy, Richard Hodgson. Hodgson, risking his reputation, accepted the offer and within a few weeks completed all paperwork.{{sfn|Berlin|2005|p=89, Hodgson: "I hope to hell you guys know what you're doing. Because if you don't, I'm losing my job"}}{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=91}} The capital of the new company, Fairchild Semiconductor, was divided into 1,325 shares. Each member of the traitorous eight received 100 shares, 225 shares went to Hayden, Stone &amp; Co and 300 shares remained in reserve. Fairchild provided a loan of $1.38 million.{{sfn|Berlin|2005|p=88}} To secure the loan, the traitorous eight gave Fairchild the voting rights on their shares, with the right to buy their shares at a fixed total price of $3 million.{{sfn|Berlin|2005|p=89}}{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=182}}

On September 18, 1957, Blank, Grinich, Kleiner, Last, Moore, Noyce, Roberts and Hoerni resigned from Shockley Labs.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=91}} They became known as the "traitorous eight", though it is not known who coined the term.&lt;ref name=B1/&gt;{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=181}} Shockley could never understand the reasons for this defection.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=92}} After that time, he never talked to Noyce again,{{sfn|Berlin|2005|p=88}} but continued to follow the work of "The Eight".{{sfn|Berlin|2005|p=87}} He also combed through all records left by The Eight, basing patents, held as Shockley Labs' intellectual property, on any important ideas.{{sfn|Berlin|2005|p=87}} (Technically, in accordance with U.S. law, those patents were issued to the respective inventing employees.)

In 1960, with the help of a new team,{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=101}} Shockley brought his own diode to serial production, but time had been lost, and competitors had already come close to the development of integrated circuits.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=88}}{{sfn|Thackray|2000|p=249}} Beckman sold the unprofitable Shockley Labs to investors from Cleveland. On July 23, 1961, Shockley was seriously injured in a car crash,{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=188}} and after recovery left the company and returned to teaching at Stanford.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=97}} In 1969,{{sfn|Coller|2009|p=174}} [[IT&amp;T]], the new owners of Shockley Labs moved the company to Florida. When the staff refused to move, the lab ceased to exist.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=187}}

{{quote|We were all focused on the single goal of producing our first product, a double diffused silicon mesa transistor ... We were all very young (27 to 32), only a few years beyond our school days. We were a very compatible group, and spent a lot of time outside our working hours. Most of the founders were married, busy starting their families and raising small children in addition to all the time and effort they were spending building Fairchild ... I am struck by what a remarkable time it was and what innovative opportunities. – ''Jay T. Last, 2010''{{sfn|Last|2010|pp=vii–viii}} }}

In November 1957, The Eight moved out of Grinich's garage{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=106}} into a new, empty building on the border of Palo Alto and Mountain View.{{sfn|Brock|2010|pp=54–55}} Their starting salaries ranged from $13,800 to $15,600 per year.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=88}} Hodgson, who headed the board of directors, suggested Noyce as the operational manager of the company, but Noyce refused.{{sfn|Berlin|2005|pp=89–90}} Fairchild, knowing Noyce's personality, also opposed his leadership.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=146, 161}} Regardless of the will of Fairchild, Noyce and Moore, who were responsible for the research and production, respectively, became the "leaders among equals".{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=183}}

The group immediately set a clear goal to produce an array of silicon diffusion mesa transistors for digital devices, utilizing the research results of Bell Labs and Shockley Labs.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p=56}} Moore, Hoerni and Last led three teams working on three alternative technologies.{{sfn|Brock|2010|pp=55–56}}{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=113}} The technology of Moore resulted in a higher yield of operational n-p-n transistors, and in July–September 1958, they went into mass production.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=114}} The release of p-n-p transistors of Hoerni was delayed until early 1959.{{sfn|Brock|2010|pp=24, 27}} This created the Moore-Hoerni conflict at Fairchild: Moore ignored the contribution of Hoerni, and Hoerni believed that his work was unfairly treated.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=114}} However, the Moore transistors formed the prestige of Fairchild Semiconductor – for several years, they beat all the competitors.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=114}}

In 1958, Fairchild mesa transistors were considered for the [[D-17B]] [[Minuteman I]] guidance computer, but they did not meet military standards of reliability.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=108}} Fairchild already had a solution in the planar technology of Hoerni proposed on December 1, 1957. In the spring of 1958, Hoerni and Last were spending nights on experiments with the first planar transistors.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=121–122}} The planar technology later became the second most important event in the history of microelectronics, after the invention of the transistor, but in 1959 it went unnoticed.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=123}} Fairchild announced the transition from mesa to planar technology in October 1960.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=126}} However, Moore refused to credit this achievement to Hoerni, and in 1996 even attributing it to unnamed Fairchild engineers.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=125}}

In 1959, Sherman Fairchild exercised his right to purchase shares of the members of the traitorous eight. Jay Last recalled (in 2007) that this event happened too early and turned former partners into ordinary employees, destroying the team spirit.&lt;ref name=SL/&gt; In November 1960, Tom Bay, the Vice President of Marketing at Fairchild, accused Last of squandering money and demanded termination of Last's project of developing integrated circuits. Moore refused to help Last, and Noyce declined to discuss the matter.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=133, 138}} This conflict was the last straw: on January 31, 1961 Last and Hoerni left Fairchild and to head [[Amelco]], the microelectronics branch of [[Teledyne]]. Kleiner and Roberts joined them after a few weeks. Blank, Grinich, Moore and Noyce stayed with Fairchild. The traitorous eight split into two groups of four.

[[File:IC Plaque.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The historic marker at the Fairchild building at which the "traitorous eight" set up shop and the first commercially practical integrated circuit was invented]]

In 1960–1965 Fairchild was the undisputed leader of the semiconductor market, both technologically and in terms of sales. {{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=157–159}} Early 1965 brought the first signs of management problems.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=158}} In November 1965, the creators of integrated operational amplifiers [[Bob Widlar]] and David Talbert left for [[National Semiconductor]].{{sfn|Lojek|2007|pp=282–283}} In February 1967, they were followed by five top managers who disagreed with Noyce.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=159}} Noyce started litigation with shareholders and effectively removed himself from the operational management.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=158}} In July 1967, the company became unprofitable and lost their leading position in the market to Texas Instruments.{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=159}}

In March 1968, Moore and Noyce decided to leave Fairchild and again, as nine years prior, turned to Arthur Rock. In the summer of 1968, they founded [[Intel#Origins|NM Electronics]].{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=162}} Blank, Grinich, Kleiner, Last, Hoerni and Roberts, set aside the past disagreements and financially supported the company of Moore and Noyce.{{sfn|Shurkin|2008|p=184}} A year later, N-M Electronics bought the trade name rights from the hotel chain Intelco and took the name of [[Intel]]. Moore held senior positions at Intel until 1997, when he was named Chairman Emeritus of Intel Corporation. Noyce left Intel in 1987 to lead the non-profit consortium [[Sematech]]. He died suddenly in 1990, the first of The Eight.

Grinich left Fairchild in 1968 for a short sabbatical,{{sfn|Lojek|2007|p=161}} and then taught at [[UC Berkeley]] and [[Stanford]], where he published the first comprehensive textbook on integrated circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introduction to integrated circuits | author = Victor H. Grinich|author2= Horace G. Jackson | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1975 | isbn = 0-07-024875-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later co-founded and ran several companies developing industrial [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] tags.&lt;ref name=G1/&gt;

Blank was the last of The Eight to leave Fairchild, in 1969. He founded the financial firm [[Xicor]] specializing in innovative start-ups, and in 2004 sold it for $529 million.&lt;ref name=B1/&gt;

Hoerni headed Amelco until the summer of 1963, and, after the conflict with the Teledyne owners, for three years headed [[Union Carbide Electronics]].{{sfn|Lécuyer|2006|p=263}} In July 1967, supported by the watch company [[Société Suisse pour l'Industrie Horlogère]] (the predecessor of [[Swatch Group]]) founded [[Intersil]], the company that created the market for custom CMOS circuits.&lt;ref name=G2/&gt;{{sfn|Lécuyer|2006|pp=263–264}} The circuits developed by Intersil for [[Seiko]] in 1969–1970 contributed to the rise of Japanese electronic watches.{{sfn|Lécuyer|2006|pp=277–279}}&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; Intersil and Intel weren't competitors as Intel released a limited set of templated circuits for computers and sold them initially only in the U.S. market, whereas Intersil focused on custom CMOS circuits with low power consumption and sold them worldwide.{{sfn|Lécuyer|2006|p=276}}

Last remained with Amelco and for twelve years served as Vice President of Technology at Teledyne. In 1982, he founded Hillcrest Press specializing in art books.&lt;ref name=SL/&gt;&lt;ref name=r6/&gt; After leaving Amelco, Roberts led his own business, and in 1973–1987 served as a trustee of the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].&lt;ref name=SR/&gt; Amelco, after numerous mergers, acquisitions and renaming, became a subsidiary of [[Microchip Technology]].

In 1972, Kleiner and Tom Perkins from [[Hewlett-Packard]] founded the venture capital fund Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, which has been involved in the creation and/or funding of Amazon.com, Compaq, Genentech, Intuit, Lotus, Macromedia, Netscape, Sun Microsystems, Symantec and dozens of other companies. Kleiner later wrote that his goal was to geographically spread the venture financing.{{sfn|Gupta|2000|p=106}}

==Honors==
In May 2011, the [[California Historical Society]] gave the "Legends of California Award" to The Eight. Blank, Last, Moore, and Roberts' son Dave attended the event in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=r12/&gt;&lt;ref name=MW01/&gt;

==Fairchildren==
{{redirect|Fairchildren|the 2015 album|Fairchildren (album)|other uses|Fairchild (disambiguation)}}
In research, reporting, and popular lore related to Silicon Valley, the term "Fairchildren" has been used to refer to:

*The [[corporate spin-off]]s created by former employees of Fairchild Semiconductor.{{sfn|Manners|1995|p=111}}{{sfn|Castilla|2000|p=224}} This usage was propagated by historian Leslie Berlin through her 2001 review article,&lt;ref name=r6/&gt; PhD thesis,&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; and biography of [[Robert Noyce]].{{sfn|Berlin|2005}}
* The founders of such firms. This is the earliest usage, e.g., in the 1978 [[BBC Horizon|BBC ''Horizon'']] documentary "Now the chips are down",&lt;ref&gt;"Now the chips are down", Horizon, BBC. First broadcast 31st March 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Wolfe's 1983 profile of Noyce&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; or a 5,000-word profile of Silicon Valley in 1999.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt;
* Former Fairchild Semiconductor employees, as in a 1988 ''New York Times'' article.&lt;ref name=r10/&gt;
* The original founders of Fairchild Semiconductor, more commonly known as the traitorous eight. This has been used by the [https://www.pbs.org/transistor/background1/corgs/fairchild.html PBS website] and a book by Blasi ''et al''.&lt;ref name=r11/&gt;

One of the first articles to identify Fairchild as the parent of so many spin-offs appeared in ''Innovation Magazine'' in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Nilo Lindgren, "The Splintering of the Solid-State Electronics Industry," reprinted in ''Dealing with Technological Change: Selected Essays from Innovation'', New York: Auerbach Publishers, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The spin-off companies, such as AMD, Intel, Intersil and restructured National Semiconductor, were different from those of the east coast and California's electronic companies established in the 1940s and 1950s. "Old Californians" like Beckman and [[Varian Associates]] did not trust [[Wall Street]] and kept control of their companies for decades, whereas the new companies of the 1960s were created for a quick (within 3–5 years) public sale of shares. Their founders built a business strategy based on the expectations of the investment banks.{{sfn|Lécuyer|2006|pp=264}} Another characteristic of Silicon Valley was the mobility of managers and professionals among companies.{{sfn|Castilla|2000|p=220}} Partly because of Noyce, Silicon Valley developed a culture of openly denying the hierarchical culture of traditional corporations.{{sfn|Castilla|2000|p=225}} People remained faithful to each other, but not to the employer or the industry. Fairchild "alumni" can be found not only in electronics-related, but also financial and public relations companies.{{sfn|Castilla|2000|pp=220–221}}

'''Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker''' (abbreviated to '''ZAZ''') were an American comedy filmmaking trio consisting of [[Jim Abrahams]] and brothers [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] who specialized in writing [[slapstick comedy]] films during the 1980s. The trio knew each other during their childhood years, growing up in [[Shorewood, Wisconsin]] and attending [[Shorewood High School (Wisconsin)|Shorewood High School]] which is sometimes referenced in their work. While attending the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the trio founded a small theater known as The Kentucky Fried Theater in 1971 which led to their [[sketch comedy]] film ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]''.

This was followed in 1980 by the trio's breakout hit ''[[Airplane!]]'', which remains a revered comedic milestone. Subsequent collaborations include the TV series ''[[Police Squad!]]'', its subsequent ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' trilogy and the films ''[[Top Secret!]]'' and ''[[Ruthless People]]''. All of their projects relied heavily on [[Parody|parodies]], [[visual gag]]s and [[Fourth wall|breaking of the fourth wall]], and established a strong cult following. The notable stylistic exception is ''Ruthless People'', a more traditional farce that was directed by the trio but unlike their other productions, not written by them.

Prominent ZAZ actors and actresses include [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Lloyd Bridges]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Charlie Sheen]]. The trio's status as a three-person team of co-directors is highly unusual, although some of their later projects were directed by David Zucker working solo and with Jerry Zucker and Abrahams credited only as producers and/or writers. Each member of the group also had individual solo careers:

* David Zucker directed ''[[BASEketball]]'', ''[[My Boss's Daughter]]'', ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie 4|4]]''.
* Abrahams directed ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' and ''[[Mafia!|Jane Austen's Mafia!]]''.
* Jerry Zucker directed ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[First Knight]]'' and ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]''. Of the three, Jerry Zucker has found the most mainstream non-comedic success including ''Ghost'' and ''First Knight'', which grossed $505 million and $127 million worldwide respectively.

==Filmography==
&lt;!--Do NOT add Police Squad! It's a TV show, not an actual film. Also do NOT add the Naked Gun movies. They were not directed by ZAZ, only written. Thank you.!--&gt;
Below is a filmography chart on which films the trio have directed together and solo:
