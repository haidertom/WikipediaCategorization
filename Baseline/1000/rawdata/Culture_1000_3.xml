'''Artistic license''' (also known as '''art license''', '''historical license''', '''dramatic license''', '''poetic license''', '''narrative license''', '''licentia poetica''', '''creative license''', or simply '''license''') is a colloquial term, sometimes a [[euphemism]], used to denote the distortion of fact, alteration of the conventions of [[grammar]] or language, or rewording of pre-existing text made by an [[artist]] in the name of [[art]].

==History==
The artistic license may also refer to the ability of an artist to apply smaller distortions, such as a poet ignoring some of the minor requirements of grammar for poetic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harvey, Thomas Wadleigh |year=2008 |title=A Practical Grammar of the English Language |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC. |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Mark Antony]]'s "Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears" from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' would technically require the word "and" before "countrymen", but the conjunction "and" is omitted to preserve the rhythm of [[iambic pentameter]] (the resulting conjunction is called an [[Asyndeton|asyndetic]] [[tricolon]]). Conversely, on the next line, the end of "I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him" has an extra syllable because omitting the word "him" would make the sentence unclear, but adding a syllable at the end would not disrupt the meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herzberg, Max John |year=1933 |title=Off to Arcady: adventures in poetry |publisher=American book co. |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are examples of artistic license. 

Another example of artistic license is the way in which stylized images of an object (for instance in a [[stylized painting|painting]] or an [[stylized animation|animated movie]]) are different from their real life counterparts, but are still intended to be interpreted by the viewer as representing the same thing. This can mean the omission of details, or the simplification of shapes and color shades, even to the point that the image is nothing more than a [[pictogram]]. It can also mean the addition of non-existing details, or exaggeration of shapes and colours, as in [[fantasy art]] or a [[caricature]].

Certain stylizations have become fixed conventions in art; an agreement between artist and viewer that is understood and undebatable. A striking example is how in simple cartoon drawings' monochromatic white parts on a dark colored surface are immediately recognized by most viewers to represent the reflection of light on a smooth or wet surface.

In summary, artistic license is:

* Entirely at the artist's discretion
* Intended to be tolerated by the viewer (cf. "willing [[suspension of disbelief]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis, Tracy C. |year=2005 |title=Do you believe in fairies? The hiss of dramatic license |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=57&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Useful for filling in gaps, whether they be factual, compositional, historical or other gaps&lt;ref&gt;Goodsell, David S.; Johnson, Graham T. (2007). "Filling in the Gaps: Artistic License in Education and Outreach". ''PLoS Biol'' '''5''' (12). {{doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.0050308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Used consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally or in tandem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Esaak, Shelley |url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/artspeak_faqs/f/artisticlicense.htm |title=What is artistic license? |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic license==
Artistic license is often referred to as dramatic license when it involves the glamorization of real-world occupations for the sake of exciting television or cinematic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'sa, Benicia |year=2005 |title=Social Studies in the Dark: Using Docudramas to Teach History |journal=The Social Studies |volume=96 |number=1 |pages=9&amp;ndash;13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and other [[police procedural]] programs typically omit completely the more mundane aspects of the occupation such as paperwork, reports, administrative duties and other daily "business-oriented" aspects which in reality often constitute the majority of police work. They will also present other duties with much more action, suspense or drama than would be experienced in reality. The same is also true for many military-oriented adventure stories which often show high-ranking characters being allowed to continuously enter dangerous situations when in reality, they would usually be restricted to command-oriented and administrative duties.

==Controversy and criticism==
Artistic license often provokes [[controversy]] by offending those who resent the reinterpretation of cherished beliefs or previous works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Toplin, Robert Brent |year=2002 |title=Reel history: in defense of Hollywood |publisher=University Press of Kansas |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists often respond to these criticisms by pointing out that their work was not intended to be a [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] portrayal of something previous and should be judged only on [[artistic merit]]. Artistic license is a generally accepted practice, particularly when the result is widely acclaimed. [[William Shakespeare]]'s historical plays, for example, are gross distortions of historical fact but are nevertheless lauded as outstanding literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barroll, J. Leeds |year=1975 |title=Shakespeare Studies: An Annual Gathering of Research, Criticism, Reviews |publisher=Ayer Publishing |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical voices are sometimes raised when artistic license is applied to cinematic and other depictions of real historical events. While slight manipulation for dramatic effect of chronology and character traits are generally accepted, some critics feel that depictions that present a significantly altered reality are irresponsible, particularly because many viewers and readers do not know the actual events and may thus take the dramatized depiction to be true to reality. Examples of films and television series criticized for excessive use of dramatic license include Disney's ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', Oliver Stone's ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', the HBO series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'', 20th Century Fox's ''[[The Greatest Showman]]'' and Showtime's ''[[The Tudors]]''. 

Writers adapting a work for another medium (e.g., a film screenplay from a book) often make significant changes, additions to, or omissions from the original plot in the book, on the grounds that these changes were necessary to make a good film.&lt;ref&gt;''Film review'' (1999). Issues 14-16. Orpheus Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are sometimes to the dismay of fans of the original work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6369">{{Segregation}}

'''Auto-segregation''' or '''self-segregation''' is the [[Separatism|separation]] of a [[religious]] or [[ethnic]] group from the rest of [[society]] in a [[Sovereign state|state]] by the group itself. This could also mean inability for a normal social interaction and a form of [[social exclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicaldaily.com/interracial-friendships-less-likely-self-segregation-more-common-larger-schools-245037 Interracial Friendships Less Likely, Self-Segregation More Common in Larger Schools], ''Medical Daily'', Apr 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Through auto-segregation, the members of the separate group can establish their own services, and maintain their own [[tradition]]s and [[Norm (sociology)|customs]]. For example, some of the world's [[uncontacted peoples]] have preferred not to interact with the rest of the globally integrated human population. By remaining in a reserve and in isolation, they can preserve their [[culture]]s intact as long as they choose and the surrounding states protect them.

On the other hand, some groups self-segregate to avoid integrating with other groups, either to protect their culture or some may self-segregate from others that they consider intellectually and/or socially inferior. Nationalists (non-racists) or racists, [[ultranationalists]], other 'supremacist' or [[Ethnocentrism|ethno-centric]] groups commonly segregate themselves from other communities through various practices like [[endogamy]]. The [[apartheid]] system in South Africa was an example of this trend.

==Examples of auto-segregation==

=== Sweden ===
According to researcher Emma Neuman at [[Linnaeus University]], segregation sets in at population share around 3-4% of non-European migrants in a district, while European immigration shows no such trend. The study comprised the 12 largest [[municipalities of Sweden]] for the period 1990-2007. High income earners and highly educated move out of non-European migrant districts first where [[Racial segregation|ethnic segregation]] in turn leads to [[social segregation]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fof.se/tidning/2015/7/artikel/segregeringen-okar-i-sverige|title=Segregeringen ökar i Sverige|work=Forskning &amp; Framsteg|access-date=2017-12-02|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at [[Örebro University]] concluded that while Swedish parents stated positive views towards the values of [[multiculturalism]], in practice they still chose Swedish-majority schools for their offspring so their children won't be an [[ethnic minority]] during their formative years and to get a good environment to develop their native Swedish language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===United States===

In May 2017, black students at the University of California at Santa Cruz occupied one of the university’s administration buildings. They were demanding that the Rosa Parks House, a dormitory on campus, be painted black, red and green which are the colors of the [[Pan-African flag]].  Other demands included that only black students of Caribbean descent be guaranteed housing in that dormitory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/students-occupy-academic-building-at-uc-santa-cruz/vi-BBAIm8C Students occupy academic building at UC Santa Cruz], ‘’MSN’’, May 04, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the same month, students at Harvard University organized the school’s first all black commencement ceremony,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/harvard-university-black-commencement-700-students-guests-registered/ Hundreds of students, guests registered to attend Harvard's first Black Commencement, CBS News May 17, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; citing the need to highlight achievements made by black students and faculty.

Pundits argue that both of these events are examples of auto-segregation and compared them to the “[[Jim Crow]]” era&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow Laws]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}  when the forced segregation of schools was legal in the United States. Prior to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], "[[separate but equal]]" housing and ceremonies were commonplace in America. Civil rights activists of the early 1960s, such as [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], successfully marched in protest to abolish such segregation.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_to_Montgomery_marches Marches to End Segregation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endogamy as self-segregation==
{{main|Endogamy}}
Endogamy, the practice of marrying within a group, encourages group affiliation and bonding. It is a common practice among [[diaspora|displanted cultures]] attempting to make roots in new countries whilst still resisting complete integration, as it encourages group solidarity and ensures greater control over group resources (which may be important to preserve when a group is attempting to establish itself within an alien culture). 

However endogamy can also serve as a form of self-segregation and helps a community to resist integrating with surrounding populations. It thus helps minorities to survive as separate communities over a long time, in societies with other practices and beliefs.

Examples of ethno-religious groups with higher levels of endogamy that have successfully resisted cultural destruction and assimilation for centuries are the [[Romani people|Romani]] (colloquially referred to by non-members as "Gypsies"), the [[Ashkenazi]] Jews of Europe and the Americas and the Afrikaners of [[South Africa]].{{facts|date=May 2013}}

In fashion, a '''[[ballerina]] neckline''' refers to the classic necklines styles on the dance attire, or [[leotard]]s, worn by the dancers.

Popularized especially by designers and fashion icons of the mid-twentieth century, the term ballerina (or ballet) neckline can be construed in a variety of ways. Some classically styled or traditional [[leotard]]s have a low, wide, vertically scooped neckline and others are cut in a high horizontal oval shape. Both styles may be accompanied by a very low scooped back opening.

Most often, a ballerina neckline is a relatively high cut horizontal oval shape intended to frame the collarbone.  It is this particular oval shape that distinguishes the ballerina (or "ballet") neckline from a jewel neckline or a crew neck, which are round. Similar [[Neckline|neckline styles]] would be the bateau neckline (also known as a [[boat neck]]) and a scoop neck cut.

Currently, in the early 21st century, neckline styles on adult women's [[leotard]]s and children's [[leotard]]s include an array of variations on the classic necklines, including a front V-neck, front and back V-neck, or a sweetheart neckline with or without ruching at the bust.

{{Politics}}
The interdisciplinary study of '''biology and political science''' is the application of theories and methods from the biology toward the scientific understanding of [[political behavior]]. The field is sometimes called '''[[biopolitics]]''', a term that will be used in this article as a synonym although it has other, less related meanings. More generally, the field has also been called "[[politics]] and the [[life sciences]]".&lt;ref&gt;Blank, Robert H., and Samuel M. Hines. 2001. ''Biology and Political Science''. New York: Routledge; Somit, A., and S. A. Peterson. 1998. "Review article: Biopolitics after three decades - A balance sheet." British Journal of Political Science 28:559-71; Masters, Roger D. 1989. ''The Nature of Politics''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}
The field can be said to originate with the 1968 manifesto of [[Albert Somit]], ''Towards a more Biologically Oriented Political Science'', which appeared in the ''[[Midwest Journal of Political Science]]''.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Maxwell|title=The Sociobiological Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9OPxMX-2h2cC&amp;pg=PA142|year=1991|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0768-4|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{jstor|2110295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "biopolitics" was appropriated for this area of study by [[Thomas Thorton]], who used it as the title of his 1970 book.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1991"/&gt;

The [[Association for Politics and the Life Sciences]] was formed in 1981 and exists to study the field of biopolitics as a subfield of political science. APLS owns and publishes an academic peer-reviewed journal called ''Politics and the Life Sciences'' (PLS). The journal is edited in the [[United States]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]’s School of Public Policy, in [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association for Politics and the Life Sciences|url=http://www.aplsnet.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1990s and since, biopolitics research has expanded rapidly, especially in the areas of [[evolutionary theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Sidanius, Jim, and Robert Kurzban. 2003. "Evolutionary Approaches to Political Psychology." In ''Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology'', ed. D. O. Sears, L. Huddie and R. Jervis. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[genetics]],&lt;ref&gt;Alford, J. R., C. L. Funk, and J. R. Hibbing. 2005. "Are political orientations genetically transmitted?" American Political Science Review 99 (2):153-67; Hatemi, Peter K., Carolyn L. Funk, Hermine Maes, Judy Silberg, Sarah E. Medland, Nicholas Martin, and Lyndon Eaves. 2009. "Genetic Influences on Political Attitudes over the Life Course." Journal of Politics 71 (3):1141-56.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Darren. 2011. "From SCAN to Neuropolitics. In ''Man is By Nature a Political Animal'', edited by P. K. Hatemi and R. McDermott. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical link between biology and politics on the one hand, and sociological organicism on the other, is inescapable.  The essential difference here is that the early modern application of biological ideas to politics revolved around the idea that society was a ‘social organism’, whereas the subject this article describes expressly sets out to separate the essential logic of the association of biology to human social life, from this earlier model.  Hence the emphasis upon ‘politics’, denoting the primacy of the individual who engages in social life, as in political behaviour, underpinned by biological foundations.  In this sense the rise of Biopolitics represents the replacement of sociological organicism that had been eradicated by the end of the Second World War, with an acceptable form of political organicism.  Some discussion bearing on this point may be found in ''Biology and Politics : Recent Explorations'' by Albert Somit, 1976, which is a collection of essays, one brief essay by William Mackenzie is ''Biopolitics : A Minority Viewpoint'', in which he talks about the ‘founding father’ of Biopolitics as being Morley Roberts, because of his 1938 book of that name.  But Roberts was not using the term in its modern, politically sanitized sense, but in the context of society viewed as a true living being, a social organism.  And in a reply to Somit’s ''Towards a more Biologically Oriented Political Science'', published in the same journal, we find ''Some Questions about a More Biologically Oriented Political Science'' by Jerone Stephens, which sets out to warn against lurching back into the errors of previous venturers into the realms of biology and politics, as in sociological organicism.

&lt;!--TO EDITORS: The lyrics to the "Bruces' Song" are copyrighted and are not to be included in this article.--&gt;
"'''Bruces' Philosophers Song (Bruces' Song)'''" is a popular [[Monty Python]] song written and composed by [[Eric Idle]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Monty Python Sings]]'' CD booklet. 1989 Virgin Records&lt;/ref&gt; that was a feature of the group's stage appearances and its recordings.

==Origins==
The Bruces' Philosophy Song is sung by '''''the Bruces''''', stereotypical "[[ocker]]" Australians of the period. The Bruces are kitted out in [[khaki]]s, [[slouch hat]]s and a [[cork hat]] and are faculty members of the Philosophy Department at the fictional University of Woolamaloo. (N.B. there is no such place as Woolamaloo in Australia but [[Woolloomooloo, New South Wales|Woolloomooloo]] is an inner suburb of [[Sydney]]. There is no university there, though the real-life [[University of Sydney]] is not far away.)

The Bruces themselves first appeared in the [[Bruces sketch]] which featured in episode 22 "How to Recognise Different Parts of the Body" of the TV show ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', first broadcast on 24 November 1970. The sketch shows an English academic (played by [[Terry Jones]]) coming to a hot and perhaps remote part of Australia and being inducted by the Bruces ([[John Cleese|Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman|Chapman]], [[Eric Idle|Idle]] and [[Michael Palin|Palin]]) into their Philosophy Department, seemingly located in a simple wooden shack. The Bruces are lounging around a wooden table and soon start drinking cans of [[Foster's Lager]].

The song was not part of the TV sketch; it first appeared on the Monty Python's 1973 album ''[[Matching Tie and Handkerchief]]'' as a coda for the album version of the sketch. The song was subsequently included in most of the Monty Python team's live shows, sometimes as a singalong with musical accompaniment provided by a [[Jew's harp]].

==Lyrics==
The song's lyrics make a series of scandalous allegations about a number of highly respected philosophers, usually with regard to their capacity or incapacity for imbibing [[alcoholic drink|intoxicating beverages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wPQelKFNA5MC&amp;pg=RA1-PA274 |title=Monty Python and philosophy: nudge nudge, think think! |author=Gary L. Hardcastle, George A. Reisch|isbn=9780812695939 |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some debate{{who|date=July 2015}} over whether the sixth line is supposed to be "[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]" or just "Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel". The reason for the confusion is that existing live recordings of the song (included in the ''Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl'' film and on the albums ''Live at Drury Lane'' and ''Live at City Center'') have the "Schopenhauer and Hegel" version, while the studio recording on ''[[The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief|Matching Tie and Handkerchief]]'' features the "Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel" version. However, the publication of the lyrics with the release of ''[[Monty Python Sings]]'' suggests{{or|date=July 2015}} that the "Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel" version is the official one. (The reason for the change of lyric may be that the philosopher in question's name is actually ''Georg'' Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and that Georg is pronounced in German with two syllables (GAY-org) making it difficult for the philosopher's full name to fit in the song.)

==The philosophers==
[[File:Heidegger 4 (1960) cropped.jpg|180px|thumb|Heidegger in 1960.]]

All the philosophers whom the song mentions were dead by the time it appeared, apart from [[Martin Heidegger]].

Philosophers mentioned in the song (in order):

#[[Immanuel Kant]] (a real pissant)
#[[Martin Heidegger]] (a boozy beggar) 
#[[David Hume]] (able to out consume both Schopenhauer and Hegel)
#[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (some versions) (out consumed by Hume) 
#[[G. W. F. Hegel]] (Id.) 
#[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (a beery swine)
#[[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]] and/or [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] (Wittgenstein is alleged be just as sloshed as)
#[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (particularly knowledgeable about "the raising of the wrist") 
#[[Socrates]] (the only one mentioned twice in the song) (permanently pissed) 
#[[John Stuart Mill]] (particularly ill after half a pint of shandy) 
#[[Plato]] (said to regularly consume half a crate of whiskey daily) 
#[[Aristotle]] (a bugger for the bottle) 
#[[Thomas Hobbes]] (fond of his dram) 
#[[René Descartes]] (a drunken fart) 
#Socrates (second mention) (particularly missed, noted as both a lovely little thinker and a bugger when intoxicated) 

===Philosophical references===
{{original research|section|date=July 2015}}

Some of the philosophers are portrayed according to their works.
* Kant being "very rarely stable" harkens to his theory of a stable universe.
* John Stuart Mill becoming ill "of his own free will" alludes to his 1859 work ''[[On Liberty]]'', which argues for liberty that does no harm to others.
* Plato is, famously, the author of the dialogue ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', taking place at a drinking party, as the title itself says. Socrates appears prominently in it.
* The Descartes line, "I drink therefore I am", is a twist on his well-known phrase "Cogito, ergo sum," or "[[I think therefore I am]]".

'''Caucasology''', or '''Caucasiology''' refers to the [[history|historical]] and [[geopolitical]] studies of [[Caucasus]] region. The branch has more than 150 years history. In 1972, the Caucasiological Center (renamed to International Caucasiological Center in 2000) was founded under the auspices of the [[Israel President]] [[Zalman Shazar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">'''Cultural analytics''' is the exploration and analysis of massive [[Culture|cultural]] data sets of visual material – both digitized visual artifacts and contemporary visual and interactive media.  Taking on the challenge of how to best explore large collections of rich cultural content, cultural analytics researchers developed new methods and intuitive visual techniques which rely on high-resolution [[visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] and [[digital image processing]]. These methods are used to address both the existing research questions in humanities, to explore new questions, and to develop new theoretical concepts which fit the mega-scale of [[digital culture]] in the early 21st century.

== History ==
The term "cultural analytics" was coined by [[Lev Manovich]] in 2007. Cultural analytics shares many ideas and approaches with [[visual analytics]] ("the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by visual interactive interfaces") and visual [[data analysis]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Visual data analysis blends highly advanced computational methods with sophisticated graphics engines to tap the extraordinary ability of humans to see patterns and structure in even the most complex visual presentations. Currently applied to massive, heterogeneous, and dynamic datasets, such as those generated in studies of astrophysical, fluidic, biological, and other complex processes, the techniques have become sophisticated enough to allow the interactive manipulation of variables in real time. Ultra high-resolution displays allow teams of researchers to zoom in to examine specific aspects of the renderings, or to navigate along interesting visual pathways, following their intuitions and even hunches to see where they may lead. New research is now beginning to apply these sorts of tools to the social sciences and humanities as well, and the techniques offer considerable promise in helping us understand complex social processes like learning, political and organizational change, and the diffusion of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four to Five Years: Visual Data Analysis|url=http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/chapters/visual-data-analysis/|work=2010 Horizon Report|publisher=The New Media Consortium|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810143644/http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/chapters/visual-data-analysis/|archivedate=2011-08-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

While increased computing power and technical developments allowing for interaction visualization have made the exploration of large data sets using visual presentations possible, the intellectual drive to understand cultural and social processes and production pre-dates many of these computational advances. Charles Joseph Minard's famous dense graphic showing Napoleon's March on Moscow&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/minard Napoleon's March on Moscow]&lt;/ref&gt; (1869) offers a 19th-century example. More recently, [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s historical survey of the cultural consumption practices of mid-century Parisians, documented in [[La Distinction]], foregrounds the study of culture and aesthetics through the lens of large data sets. Most recently, [[Franco Moretti]]'s ''Graphs, maps, trees: abstract models for a literary history.''&lt;ref name = "Moretti, 2005"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with many projects in the Digital Humanities reveal the benefit of large scale analysis of cultural material.

== Current research ==
To date, cultural analytics techniques have been applied to films, animations, video games, comics, magazines, books, and other print publications, artworks, photos, and a variety of other media content.  The technology used ranges from open-source programs downloadable on any personal computer to supercomputer processing and large-scale displays such as the HIPerSpace (42,000 x 8000 pixels).&lt;ref&gt;[http://vis.ucsd.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Research_Projects:_HIPerSpace HIPerSpace]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies ==
The methodologies which fall under the umbrella of cultural analytics includes the [[data mining]] of large sets of culturally-relevant data (such as studies of library catalogs, image collections, and social networking databases.) [[Image processing]] of still and moving video, with feature recognition as well as image data extraction is used to support research into cultural and historical change. Cultural analytical methodologies are deployed to study and interpret videogames and other software forms, both at the phenomonological level ([[human-computer interface]], feature extraction) or at the object level (the analysis of source code.)

Cultural analytics relies heavily on software-based tools, and the field is related to the nascent discipline of [[software studies]]. While the objects of a cultural analytical approach are often digitized representations of the work, rather than the work in its original material form, the objects of study need not be digital works in themselves.

The '''culture of Jiangxi''' refers to the culture of the people based in [[Jiangxi]].&lt;ref&gt;许怀林. "江西历史文化特征概说." 江西广播电视大学学报 2 (1999): 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; It has changed greatly over several millenniums, from the land's prehistoric period to its contemporary culture, which incorporates ancient and traditional Chinese culture and modern culture influenced by [[Western culture]].

Geographic situation makes Jiangxi distinguish from its neighbours, as high mountains separate it from [[Zhejiang]] to the east, [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] to the south, [[Hunan]] to the west and [[Yangzi River]] forms a natural division between the South and northern China.

==Language==
{{Main|Gan Chinese}}
Gan Chinese has always played a significant role in Jiangxi culture. The [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese variety]] is spoken mainly in Jiangxi but also in surrounding regions such as [[Hunan]], [[Hubei]], [[Anhui]], and [[Fujian]]. Modern Gan is considered as one of [[Sinitic languages]], which [[History of Gan Chinese|derives from Old Gan]] and still keeps some linguistic traces of ancient languages in [[Northern and southern China|South China]].

Gan Chinese is written in traditional [[Chinese characters]] with Gan variants. Many vocabulary items are no longer used in most Chinese varieties, particularly in Mandarin, while they remain in daily usage in Gan. For example, cooking utensils are called ''[[Wok|uoh]]'' (鑊) or ''[[Ding (vessel)|tiang]]'' (鼎) in Gan which date back to the [[Shang Dynasty]]. The [[Bible]] was also translated into [[List of Chinese Bible translations#Gan Chinese|some Gan dialects]] as the Christianity was introduced into Jiangxi as early as the 16th century, with the arrival of [[Marco Polo]].

==Academy culture==
Since the academy represents the historical and cultural progress in a place, the importance of it gradually increased during the thousands of years in China. In ancient China, Jiangxi had four famous academies and they brought special learning atmosphere to Jiangxi for more than 2000 years.&lt;ref&gt;The academy culture in Jiangxi.

==Tea culture==
Tea is one of the most famous drink in the world; as a national drink in China, it represents not only the property of drinker but also the inspiration and tradition within the tea.

====Short story====
Different from the novels, the majority of short stories of Jiangxi closely related to the practice world.
Urbanization beings several topics for writers to discuss how it changes and reforms the structure of society.

From late Qing Dynasty to now, there were about 150 Nuo opera performing groups. A [[temple]] for the ''nuo'' god, which was built in the Ming Dynasty, is still in good function today for people to worship the nuo god. About 80 nuo opera programs date from the past still exist today. The number of nuo opera [[masks]] in Jiangxi is over 2000, and there are approximately 2000 professional nuo opera performing folk artists.

[[File:Good thief (c. 1560, Moscow Kremlin).jpg|thumb|right|x324px|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of [[Saint Dismas|The Good Thief]] in Paradise (Moscow School, c. 1560)]]

A '''deathbed conversion''' is the adoption of a particular [[religious]] [[faith]] shortly before dying.  Making a [[Religious conversion|conversion]] on one's [[:wikt:deathbed|deathbed]] may reflect an immediate change of belief, a desire to formalize longer-term beliefs, or a desire to complete a process of conversion already underway. Claims of the deathbed conversion of famous or influential figures have also been used in history as [[rhetorical devices]].

==Overview==
[[File:Raphael Baptism Constantine.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Baptism of Constantine]]'', as imagined by students of [[Raphael]]]]
Conversions at the point of death have a long history.  The first recorded deathbed conversion appears in the [[Gospel of Luke]] where [[Saint Dismas|the good thief]], crucified beside Jesus, expresses belief in Christ.  Jesus accepts his conversion, saying “Today you shall be with Me in Paradise".

Perhaps the most momentous conversion in Western history was that of [[Constantine I]], [[Roman emperor|Roman Emperor]] and later proclaimed a Christian [[Saint]] by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. While his belief in Christianity occurred long before his death, it was only on his deathbed that he was [[baptism|baptised]], in 337.  While traditional sources disagree as to why this happened so late, modern historiography concludes{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} that Constantine chose religious tolerance as an instrument to bolster his reign.

== Notable deathbed conversions==

===King Charles II===
[[Charles II of England]] reigned in a Protestant nation at a time of strong religious conflict.  Though his sympathies were at least somewhat with the Catholic faith, he ruled as an Anglican, though he attempted to lessen the persecution and legal penalties affecting non-Anglicans in England, notably through the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]].  As he lay dying following a stroke, released of the political need, he was received into the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|authorlink=Ronald Hutton|title=Charles II: King of England, Scotland, and Ireland|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=0-19-822911-9|pages=443, 456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jean de La Fontaine ===
The most famous French fabulist published a revised edition of his greatest work, ''Contes'', in 1692, the same year that he began to suffer a severe illness. Under such circumstances, [[Jean de La Fontaine]] turned to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jean-delafontaine.com/|title=Jean de La Fontaine Biography - Infos - Art Market|author=|date=|website=www.jean-delafontaine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A young priest, M. Poucet, tried to persuade him about the impropriety of the ''Contes'', and it is said that the destruction of a new play of some merit was demanded and submitted to as a proof of repentance. La Fontaine received the [[Viaticum]], and the following years, he continued to write poems and fables.&lt;ref name="Sanctis1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sante De Sanctis|title=Religious Conversion: A Bio-psychological Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXeMAA0gmk8C|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-21111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1695.

=== Sir Allan Napier MacNab ===
[[Allan MacNab|Sir Allan Napier MacNab]], Canadian political leader, died 8 August 1862 in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. His deathbed conversion to Catholicism caused a furor in the press in the following days. The ''[[The Globe and Mail|Toronto Globe]]'' and the ''[[Hamilton Spectator]]'' expressed strong doubts about the conversion, and the Anglican rector of [[Christ's Church Cathedral (Hamilton, Ontario)|Christ Church]] in Hamilton declared that MacNab died a [[Protestant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacNab's Catholic baptism is recorded at St. Mary's Cathedral in Hamilton, performed by John, Bishop of Hamilton, on 7 August 1862.  Lending credibility to this conversion, MacNab's second wife, who predeceased him, was Catholic, and their two daughters were raised as Catholics.&lt;ref name=conversion&gt;

While Wilde's conversion may have come as a surprise, he had long maintained an interest in the Catholic Church, having met with [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1877 and describing the Roman Catholic Church as "for saints and sinners alone – for respectable people, the Anglican Church will do". However, how much of a believer in all the tenets of Catholicism Wilde ever was is arguable: in particular, against Ross's insistence on the truth of Catholicism: "No, Robbie, it isn't true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-vatican-wakes-up-to-the-wisdom-of-oscar-wilde-1750093.html |title=The Vatican wakes up to the wisdom of Oscar Wilde – Europe, World |publisher=The Independent |date= 17 July 2009|accessdate=2009-11-15 | location=London | first1=Jerome | last1=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9404|title=Oscar Wilde: The Final Scene|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/arts/al0010.html|title=The Long Conversion of Oscar Wilde|last=McCracken|first=Andrew|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; "My position is curious," Wilde epigrammatised, "I am not a Catholic: I am simply a violent Papist."&lt;ref name="Frankel2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Frankel|title=Oscar Wilde: The Unrepentant Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4M4DwAAQBAJ|date=16 October 2017|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-98202-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his poem ''Ballad of Reading Gaol'', Wilde wrote:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Ah! Happy they whose hearts can break
And peace of pardon win!
How else may man make straight his plan
And cleanse his soul from Sin?
How else but through a broken heart
May Lord Christ enter in?

===Wallace Stevens===
The poet [[Wallace Stevens]] is said to have been baptized a Catholic during his last days suffering from [[stomach cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria J. Cirurgião, “Last Farewell and First Fruits: The Story of a Modern Poet.” ''Lay Witness'' (June 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  This account is disputed, particularly by Stevens's daughter, Holly,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brazeau, ''Parts of a World: Wallace Stevens Remembered'', New York, Random House, 1983, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; and critic, [[Helen Vendler]], who, in a letter to [[James Wm. Chichetto]], thought Fr. Arthur Hanley was "forgetful" since "he was interviewed twenty years after Stevens' death."&lt;ref&gt;Archives of the Holy Cross Fathers (Eastern Province) (AHCFE), North Easton, Massachusetts, 02356. Helen Vendler's letter (dated 8/28/09): "Dear Father Chichetto: I am sorry to have annoyed you by my putting of quotes around the word 'baptism.' I simply wanted to indicate by the quotation marks my skepticism about the fact. Of course, I did find something 'arwy' in Father Hanley's account, but I have never accused Father Hanley of prevarication, only of forgetfulness. I  believe he believed that things happened as he said, but he was interviewed twenty years after Stevens' death. Of course I credit the first part of Father Hanley's story concerning conversations with Stevens during Stevens' first day in the hospital between 26 April and 11 May. He returned to the hospital with disseminated cancer in July, and Father Hanley says that the baptism took place 'a few days before his death.' Stevens had not apparently requested baptism in April during his first stay in the hospital. Of course, I can imagine Stevens discussing religion with a priest who was attempting to convert him, but nothing in his poetry or prose suggests any wish to be a member of any church. It's therefore hard to believe Father Hanley's recollection. And it is harder to believe because there is no written record and no  contemporaneous evidence. I can understand reasons why people might request that a baptism be kept private. Father Hanley does not describe any such request by Stevens, so the absence of a written record becomes more inexplicable. Father Hanley, in his long service, no doubt conseled, consoled, and baptized many dying people. It seems to me quite possible that he confused Stevens with someone else. Faulty memories are common in all of us, and it does not seem to me at all probable that Stevens would have requested baptism, have requested secrecy, or have responded with the cliche, 'Now I am in the fold.' Such language is inconsistent with Stevens' abhorrence of chiche.

I do not impugn Father Hanley's veracity, only his memory. In the absence of any contemporary testimony and any recorded notice, I think that any biographer would agree that an unsupported recollection,  voiced twenty years after the fact, cannot be taken as conclusive. There is nothing in Stevens' life and writing that makes a request on his part for baptism plausible or believable. It makes no difference to the  writing, of course, which was in any case complete before Stevens' hospitalization.  Yours truly, Helen Vendler"&lt;/ref&gt;  In his response, Chichetto noted that Vendler ignored "the testimony of Dr. Edward Sennett (in charge of the Radiology Dept. at St. Francis Hospital when Stevens was admitted both times) and the Sisters with whom he [Chichetto] talked in 1977 (and later) who believed Fr. Hanley's account."&lt;ref&gt;AHCFE, Fr. Chichetto's letter (dated 9/2/09): "Dear Helen Vendler,  I didn't expect you to agree with everything I put down in my letter to you. It is  disturbing, however, when you ignore  the testimony of Dr. Edward Sennett (in charge of the Radiology Dept. at St. Francis Hospital when Stevens was admitted  both times [1955]) and the Sisters with whom I talked in 1977 (and later) who believed Fr. Hanley's account. They never spoke of any kind of forgetfulness or memory loss on Fr. Hanley's part, whether noble (when one intentionally does not remember injuries, mischief, etc.) or unmeant (when one unintentionally cannot remember things owing to trauma, confusion or some other mental impairment). What provoked me NOT to visit Fr. Hanley in 1977 was their testimony that his account in 1955 was credible and that they believed Stevens was baptized. The Sisters had no reason to doubt Hanley's word, one of whom worked with him and knew him quite well. You seem to want to ignore that. Do you really believe they were ALL taken in by Fr. Hanley's 'forgetfulness,' by his 'mental impairment,' in 1977, when he was alive, retired, and in touch with them? (He lived only a half hour away from them!) Dr. Sennett was too sharp a person and knew the Sisters too well to believe they were being deluded and misled owing to Fr. Hanley's 'memory loss.'

Also, in your response, you ignore the fact that a number of priests in the past refrained from recording (in nearby parishes and hospitals) the baptisms of certain dying people. I myself, for example, remember baptizing two people and leaving their baptisms unrecorded on two different occasions. That is, I  baptized two people (unconditionally and absolutely), gave them Communion, and didn't record their baptisms in a nearby parish or at the hospital – for many reasons, not the least being that the dying person wanted no Catholic funeral and preferred that his/her 'reception' remain private (i.e., between himself/herself and God). I mentioned this in my first letter. Such private baptisms did occur in New England and elsewhere! (Today, of course, federal law and new legislation requires that some sort of record of a person's baptism be kept in the hospital as part of the deceased person's medical history. But that was not always the case in the past. And it is anyone's guess as to whether priests abide by those rules today; they pick and chose so freely.)

Finally, to assume that because 'nothing in his [Stevens'] poetry or prose suggests any wish to be a member of any church' he therefore could never have requested a private baptism flies in the face of so many 'hour of death' accounts of the dying, many of whose private testimonies, disclosures, groundless terrors contradict the reckonings and calculations erected or founded on their earlier lives (and, in this case, the person's writings). The dying often believe for themselves; not for another person or for the sake of some book they wrote. Any person who has witnessed the dying also knows that they 'say' and disclose their sentiments (in words and gestures) better than the witnesses or those around them can, foolish cliches and all.

In conclusion, I don't think this response to your letter will dissuade you from holding your own belief that Fr. Hanley was forgetful, etc. Indeed, reasoning further against your opinion in this matter would be like fighting against a shadow – all-consuming, exhausting without affecting the shadow. I also sincerely believe you can't change. As a critic, you have too much invested in your opinion. (One of my colleagues lent me her THE MUSIC OF WHAT HAPPENS to read. In that book you are quite adamant about Hanley on page 80.) However, based on Dr. Sennett's and the Sisters' propriety of feeling for Fr. Hanley and their belief that he was telling the truth in 1977 as he was in 1955, I do believe Stevens was baptized privately (though in academic journals his baptism will always be lightly condemned, censured, or laid aside as 'inconsistent' with his writings). I also believe that the baptism should never have been made public. Stevens was a great 'unnamer,' to quote Harold Bloom, and Fr. Hanley should have left his baptism unnamed, as it were, anonymous, like a 'blindness cleaned.' Sincerely, (Fr.) James Chichetto, C.S.C."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spurious deathbed conversions==

===Charles Darwin===
[[File:Charles Darwin by Julia Margaret Cameron 2.jpg|thumb|upright|After [[Charles Darwin]] died, rumours spread that he had converted to Christianity on his deathbed. His children denied this occurred.]]
One famous example is [[Charles Darwin]]'s deathbed conversion in which it was claimed by [[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope|Lady Hope]] that Darwin said:
"How I wish I had not expressed my theory of [[evolution]] as I have done." He went on to say that he would like her to gather a congregation since he "would like to speak to them of Christ Jesus and His salvation, being in a state where he was eagerly savoring the heavenly anticipation of bliss."&lt;ref name="stephenjaygould1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/ladyhope.html#Autobiography |title=The Lady Hope Story: A Widespread Falsehood |publisher=Stephenjaygould.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lady Hope's story was printed in the ''Boston Watchman Examiner''. The story spread, and the claims were republished as late as October 1955 in the ''Reformation Review'' and in the ''Monthly Record'' of the [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] in February 1957.

Lady Hope's story is not supported by Darwin's children. Darwin's son [[Francis Darwin]] accused her of lying, saying that "Lady Hope's account of my father's views on religion is quite untrue. I have publicly accused her of falsehood, but have not seen any reply." &lt;ref name="stephenjaygould1"/&gt; Darwin's daughter [[Henrietta Litchfield]] also called the story a fabrication, saying "I was present at his deathbed. Lady Hope was not present during his last illness, or any illness. I believe he never even saw her, but in any case she had no influence over him in any department of thought or belief. He never recanted any of his scientific views, either then or earlier. We think the story of his conversion was [[Lie#Fabrication|fabricated]] in the U.S.A. The whole story has no foundation whatever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hope.html |title=Lady Hope Story |publisher=Talkorigins.org |date=23 February 1922 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberate destruction and theft of cultural heritage has been conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] since 2014 in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and to a lesser extent in [[Libya]]. The destruction targets various places of worship under ISIL control and ancient historical artifacts. In Iraq, between the [[fall of Mosul]] in June 2014 and February 2015, ISIL had plundered and destroyed at least 28 historical religious buildings.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01 |title=Iraq churches, mosques under ISIS attack |author=Khalid al-Taie |publisher=mawtani.al-shorfa.com |date=13 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219092526/http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01 |archivedate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valuable items from some buildings were looted in order to smuggle and sell them to finance ISIS activities.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt;

ISIL uses a unit called the ''Kata'ib Taswiyya'' (settlement battalions) to select targets for demolition.&lt;ref name="gi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4973/destruction-middle-east-antiquities |title=The Destruction of the Middle East |author=Denis MacEoin |publisher=[[Gatestone Institute]] |date=27 December 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] Director-General [[Irina Bokova]] branded the ISIS activities in this respect as "a form of [[cultural cleansing]]"&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt; and launched the [[Unite4Heritage]] campaign to protect heritage sites threatened by extremists.

==Motivation==
{{See also|Aniconism in Islam}}
ISIL justifies the destruction of cultural heritage sites with its extreme following of [[Salafism]] which, according to its followers, places "great importance on establishing [[tawhid]] (monotheism)", and "eliminating [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] (polytheism)." While it is often assumed that the group's actions are mindless acts of vandalism, there is an ideological underpinning to the destruction. ISIL views its actions in sites like Palmyra and Nimrud as being in accordance with Sunni [[Islam]]ic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/religion-geopolitics/commentaries/glance/dont-be-surprised-isis-destroying-history |title=Don't Be Surprised by ISIS Destroying History |publisher=Tony Blair Faith Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the ideological aspects of the destruction, there are other, more practical, reasons behind ISIL's destruction of historic sites. Grabbing the world's attention is easily done through the destruction of such sites, given the extensive media coverage and international condemnation that comes afterwards. Destroying historic ruins also allows ISIL to wipe the slate clean and to start afresh, leaving no traces of any previous culture or civilization, while also providing an ideal platform for the group to establish its own identity and leave its mark on history. Despite the images showing extreme destruction, ISIL has also been making use of the looted antiquities to finance their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/15/iraq-isis-arrest-jihadists-wealth-power |title=How an arrest in Iraq revealed Isis's $2bn jihadist network |author=Martin Chulov |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the UN's ban on the trade of artifacts looted from Syria since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/12/us-mideast-crisis-un-idUSKBN0LG1YN20150212 |title=U.N.

====Palmyra====
[[File:Temple of Bel, Palmyra 02.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of Bel]] in [[Palmyra]], which was blown up by ISIL in August 2015]]
Following the [[Tadmur offensive (2015)|capture of Palmyra]] in Syria, ISIL was reported as not intending to demolish the city's World Heritage Site (while still intending to destroy any statues deemed '[[Polytheism|polytheistic]]').&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/27/isis-releases-footage-of-palmyra-ruins-intact |title=Syria: Isis releases footage of Palmyra ruins intact and 'will not destroy them' |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2015, ISIL released a 87-second video showing parts of the apparently undamaged ancient [[colonnade]]s, the [[Temple of Bel]] and the [[Roman Theatre at Palmyra|Roman theatre]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"/&gt; On 27 June 2015, however, ISIL demolished the ancient [[Lion of Al-lāt]] statue in Palmyra. Several other statues from Palmyra reportedly confiscated from a smuggler were also destroyed by ISIL.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; On 23 August 2015, it was reported that ISIL had blown up the 1st-century [[Temple of Baalshamin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34036644 Palmyra's Baalshamin temple 'blown up by IS'], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/isis-blows-up-temple-dating-back-to-17ad-in-unesco-listed-syrian-city Isis 'blows up temple dating back to 17AD' in Syrian city of Palmyra], TheGuardian.com; accessed 25 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August 2015, ISIL demolished the [[Temple of Bel]] with explosives.

According to the report issued on September 3, 2015 by ASOR Syrian Heritage initiative, ISIL also destroyed seven ancient tower tombs in Palmyra since the end of June over two phases.&lt;ref name="natpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/intolerable-crime-against-civilization-isil-destroys-three-ancient-tower-tombs-in-palmyra |title=In latest round of destruction, ISIL reduces three ancient tower tombs in Palmyra to rubble |work=[[National Post]] |date=September 4, 2015 |accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last phase of destruction occurred between August 27 and September 2, 2015, including the destruction of the 2nd-century AD [[Tower of Elahbel]], called "the most prominent example of Palmyra's distinct funerary monuments".&lt;ref name="natpost"/&gt; Earlier, the ancient tombs of Iamliku and Atenaten were also destroyed.&lt;ref name="natpost"/&gt; The [[Monumental Arch of Palmyra|Monumental Arch]] was also blown up in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shaheen |first1=Kareem |title=Isis blows up Arch of Triumph in 2,000-year-old city of Palmyra |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/05/isis-blows-up-another-monument-in-2000-year-old-city-of-palmyra |accessdate=5 October 2015 |work=The Guardian |date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL has also looted and demolished the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]/[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of [[Dura-Europos]] in east of Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/09/232028.htm |title=We're sorry, that page can't be found. |website=www.state.gov |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknamed "the [[Pompeii]] of the desert", the city was of particular archaeological significance.

====Hatra====
[[Hatra]] (Arabic: الحضر al-Ḥaḍr) was an ancient city in the Ninawa Governorate and al-Jazira region of Iraq. A large fortified city and capital of the first Arab Kingdom, Hatra withstood invasions by the Romans in A.D. 116 and 198 thanks to its high, thick walls reinforced by towers.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/277&lt;/ref&gt; However about 240 ce,  the city fell to Shāpūr I (reigned c. 240–272), the ruler of the Persian Sāsānian dynasty, and was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Hatra&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the city, especially the temples where Hellenistic and Roman architecture blend with Eastern decorative features, attest to the greatness of its civilization.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"/&gt; The city lies 290&amp;nbsp;km (180&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of Baghdad and 110&amp;nbsp;km (68&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of Mosul.
On 7 March 2015, various sources including Iraqi officials reported that the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) had begun demolishing the ruins of Hatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-08/islamic-state-militants-raze-iraq-ancient-hatra-city/6288618 |title=IS continues cultural cleansing of Iraq with Hatra's destruction: UNESCO |date=8 March 2015 |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video released by ISIL the next month showed destruction of the monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bcdd18ddfe5143f08e5e2335e19e5af9/video-islamic-state-group-shot-hammered-away-iraqs-hatra |title=Video: Islamic State group shot, hammered away Iraq's Hatra |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient city was recaptured by the [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] on 26 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-39726244 |title=IS conflict: Iraqi force 'retakes ancient city of Hatra' |date=26 April 2017 |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017 |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libraries===

ISIL has burned or stolen collections of books and papers from various locations, including the [[Central Library of Mosul]] (which they rigged with explosives and burned down),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-burns-down-mosul-library-destroys-8000-rare-books-manuscripts-624375 |title=Isis Burns Down Mosul Library, Destroys 8,000 Rare Books and Manuscripts |first=Johnlee |last=Varghese |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the library at the [[University of Mosul]], a Sunni Muslim library, a 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers, and the Mosul Museum Library. Some destroyed or stolen works date back to 5000 BC and include "Iraq newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire, and book collections contributed by about 100 of Mosul’s establishment families."

The general director of the [[National Museum (Prague)|Czech National Museum]], Michal Lukeš, signed an agreement in June 2017 committing the institution to help Syria save, preserve and conserve much of its cultural and historical heritage damaged by war, including the ancient site of Palmyra; he met with Maamoun Abdulkarim and discussed plans for the works that are said to last until 2019.&lt;ref name=czradio&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnstone |first1=Chris |title=Czechs sign up to help save Syrian cultural heritage |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/czechs-sign-up-to-help-save-syrian-cultural-heritage |accessdate=24 June 2017 |work=Radio Praha |date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, The World Monuments Fund (WMF) announced launching a £500,000 scheme to train Syrian refugees near the Syrian-Jordanian border in traditional stone masonry.

In [[literature]], an '''epigraph''' is a phrase, [[quotation]], or [[poem]] that is set at the beginning of a document or component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/~eng217/student_projects/araisininthesun/epigraph.html |title=Epigraph |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epigraph may serve as a preface, as a summary, as a counter-example, or to link the work to a wider [[Canon (fiction)|literary canon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://literarydevices.net/epigraph/ |title=Definition of Epigraph |publisher=Literary Devices |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; either to invite comparison or to enlist a conventional context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bridgeman  |first=Teresa |date= |title=Negotiating the New in the French Novel: Building Contexts for Fictional Worlds |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfOt4zvrTn4C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=Epigraph+(literature)++conventional+context&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=94AZEeRyEu&amp;sig=fcuDwtLOdrjm54hGJoK4MrFe4Lg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R4-wUrzpOMmPrQe9xIDQAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Epigraph%20(literature)%20%20conventional%20context&amp;f=false |location=Page No-129 |publisher=Psychology Press, 1998 |isbn=0415131251 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book, it is part of the [[front matter]].

==Examples==
* As the epigraph to ''[[The Sum of All Fears]]'', [[Tom Clancy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clancy, Tom |title= The Sum of All Fears|date= 1991|publisher= Harper Collins Publishing|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; quotes [[Winston Churchill]] in the context of [[thermonuclear war]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Why, you may take the most gallant sailor, the most intrepid airman or the most audacious soldier, put them at a table together – what do you get? The sum of their fears.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* The long quotation from [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'' that prefaces [[T. S. Eliot]]'s "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]" is part of a speech by one of the damned in Dante's Hell. Linking it to the monologue which forms Eliot's poem adds a comment and a dimension to Prufrock's confession. * 
* The epigraph to [[E. L. Doctorow]]'s ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'' quotes [[Scott Joplin]]'s instructions to those who play his music, "Do not play this piece fast. It is never right to play ''Ragtime'' fast."
*The epigraph to [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' is John 12:24. "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."
*The epigraph to Eliot's ''Gerontion'' is a quotation from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Measure for Measure]]''. 
*Eliot's "[[The Hollow Men]]" uses the line "Mistah [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]], he dead" from [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' as one of its two epigraphs.
* As an epigraph to ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', [[Ernest Hemingway]] quotes [[Gertrude Stein]], "You are all a lost generation."
* The epigraph to [[Theodore Herzl]]'s '[[Altneuland]]' is "If you will it, it is no dream..." which became a slogan of the Zionist movement.
* A [[Samuel Johnson]] quote is used as an epigraph in [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s novel ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'': "He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man."
* [[Stephen King]] uses many epigraphs in his writing, usually to mark the beginning of another section in a novel. An unusual example is ''[[The Stand]]'' wherein he uses lyrics from certain songs to express the metaphor used in a particular part.
[[File:House of the Wolfings Title Page 1890.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Epigraph, consisting of an excerpt from the book itself,  [[William Morris]]'s ''[[The House of the Wolfings]]'']]
* [[Jack London]] uses the first stanza of [[John Myers O'Hara]]'s poem "Atavism" as the epigraph to ''[[The Call of the Wild]]''.
* The epigraphs to the preamble of [[Georges Perec]]'s ''[[Life: A User's Manual]]'' (''La Vie mode d'emploi'') and to the book as a whole warn the reader that tricks are going to be played and that all will not be what it seems.
[[File:TheWasteLandEpigraph.jpg|thumb|right|Epigraph and dedication page, ''[[The Waste Land]]'']]
* [[J. K. Rowling]]'s novels frequently begin with epigraphs relating to the themes explored. For example, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' features a quotation from [[Aeschylus|Aeschylus']] tragedy, ''[[Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|The Libation Bearers]]''.

===Fictional quotations===
Some writers use as epigraphs fictional quotations that purport to be related to the fiction of the work itself. Examples include:
====In films====
* The film ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby]]'' opens with a fictional quotation attributed to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] for comedic effect.

====In literature====
* Some science fiction works, such as [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation Trilogy]]'', [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' series, and [[Jack McKinney (writer)|Jack McKinney]]'s the ''[[Robotech]]'' novelizations use quotations from an imagined future history of the period of their story.
* Fantasy literature may also include epigraphs.  For example, [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula K. Le Guin's]] ''[[Earthsea]]'' series includes epigraphs supposedly quoted from the epic poetry of the Earthsea archipelago.
* The first and last books of [[Diane Duane]]'s ''[[Rihannsu]]'' series of ''[[Star Trek]]'' novels pair quotations from ''[[Lays of Ancient Rome]]'' with imagined epigraphs from [[Romulan]] literature.
* [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' opens with a poem entitled "Then Wear the Gold Hat," purportedly written by [[Thomas Parke D'Invilliers]]. D'Invilliers is a character in Fitzgerald's first novel, ''[[This Side of Paradise]]''. 
**This cliché is parodied by [[Diana Wynne Jones]] in ''[[The Tough Guide To Fantasyland]]''.
* [[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[The Eyre Affair]]'' has quotations from supposedly future works about the action of the story.
* [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]'' has a quotation from a fictitious novel, ''An Imperial Affliction'', which features prominently as a part of the story. 
* [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Half]]'' has epigraphs taken from the fictitious novels written by the protagonist.
* [[Dean Koontz]]'s ''[[The Book of Counted Sorrows]]'' began as a fictional book of poetry from which Koontz would "quote" when no suitable existing option was available;  Koontz simply wrote all these epigraphs himself.  Many fans, rather than realizing the work was Koontz' own invention, apparently believed it was a real, but rare, volume; Koontz later collected the existing verse into an actual book.&lt;ref name="DKPodcast25"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://www.deankoontz.com/podcast-episode-25-book-of-counted-sorrows-1 |title=Podcast Episode 25: Book of Counted Sorrows 1 |people=[[Dean Koontz|Koontz, Dean]] |medium=Podcast |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A poem at the beginning of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]' ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' describes the [[Rings of Power]], the central plot device of the novel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5737">{{About|the narrative device|other uses of "epilogue" and "epilog"|Epilogue (disambiguation)}}
An '''epilogue''' or '''epilog''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐπίλογος ''epílogos'', "conclusion" from ἐπί ''epi'', "in addition" and λόγος ''logos'', "word") is a piece of writing at the end of a work of literature, usually used to bring closure to the work.&lt;ref name="EpiDevice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://literarydevices.net/epilogue/ | title=Literary Devices: Definition and Examples of Literary Terms: Epilogue|date=2014| publisher=Literary Devices | work=Literary Devices Website | accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is presented from the perspective of within the story. When the author steps in and speaks indirectly to the reader, that is more properly considered an [[afterword]]. The opposite is a [[prologue]]&amp;mdash;a piece of writing at the ''beginning'' of a work of literature or drama, usually used to open the story and capture interest.&lt;ref name="ProDevice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://literarydevices.net/epilogue/ | title=Literary Devices: Definition and Examples of Literary Terms: Prologue|date=2014| publisher=Literary Devices | work=Literary Devices Website | accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some genres, for example [[television programs]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[video games]], call the epilog an "outro" patterned on the use of "intro" for "introduction".

==In literature==
[[Image:Grandville, Autre Monde, Epilog.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Illustration from ''Un Autre Monde'' epilogue, by [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville|Grandville]].]]

An epilogue is the final [[chapter (books)|chapter]] at the end of a [[narrative|story]] that often serves to reveal the fates of the [[Character (arts)|character]]s. Some epilogues may feature [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] only tangentially related to the subject of the story. They can be used to hint at a sequel or wrap up all the loose ends. They can occur at a significant period of time after the main [[plot (narrative)|plot]] has ended. In some cases, the epilogue is used to allow the main character a chance to "speak freely".

An epilogue can continue in the same narrative style and perspective as the preceding story, although the form of an epilogue can occasionally be drastically different from the overall story. It can also be used as a [[sequel]].

==In film==
In [[film]]s, the final scenes may feature a montage of images or clips with a short explanation of what happens to the characters. A few examples of such films are ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', ''[[American Graffiti]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]'', ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', ''[[Remember the Titans]]'', and ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]''.

There are many films which do not only include a few glimpses of the character's future, but also are based on an epilogue. Most epilogues in films are shown in a dramatic fashion, usually in silence, to commemorate an important happening, for example, the fate of a character in the film.

The epilogue of ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' shows a happy ending, an alternative to the actual ending. 

In many [[documentaries]] and [[biopics]], the epilogue is text-based, explaining what happened to the subjects after the events covered in the film.

==In video gaming==
In [[Video game|video gaming]], epilogues can occur at the end of the story, usually after the [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]] have rolled. An epilogue in a game functions similarly to an epilogue in [[film]] and [[literature]], providing closure to the end of a story.

However, the way in which an epilogue is interacted with in a video game can then determine how a story ends, in works of fiction that contain [[Types of fiction with multiple endings#Video games|multiple endings]]. For example, there are four possible endings to ''[[Spec Ops: The Line]]'', and three of the endings are chosen by what the player does in the epilogue.

In games that feature the [[Permadeath|permanent death]] of [[Player character|playable characters]], an epilogue can chronicle what has happened to the various characters that have survived the events of the game, depicting how their situation has changed after the story has come to a conclusion. For example, the 2015 video game ''[[Until Dawn]]'' features those who survived recounting their experiences to the Police after being rescued. This system can also be expanded on. In most games of the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, relationships can be built between characters, allowing for unique outcomes to happen for characters depending on the actions of the player throughout the campaign.

A [[visual novel]] can also feature a type of epilogue, which will wrap up all of the scenarios encountered by a player, most often after the game has been fully completed by reaching all of the multiple endings; as is the case with ''[[Tsukihime]]'', featuring an epilogue that expands on the endings of all completable routes, as well as providing context for the rest of the game by explaining events in the prologue.

==In television==
For many years ''[[The Epilogue]]'', a reflective 5-minute [[sermonette]], was the last programme of the day broadcast on a Sunday evening by [[BBC]] radio and later television. The format was picked up by the independent broadcaster [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1956 and was adopted across its various franchises until 1988.

A '''generation''' is "all of the people [[Childbirth|born]] and [[Personhood|living]] at about the same time, regarded [[collective]]ly". It can also be described as, "the average [[Era|period]], generally considered to be about thirty years, during which children are born and [[Aging|grow up]], become adults, and begin to have children of their own".&lt;ref&gt;generation. Dictionary.com. ''Dictionary.com Unabridged''. Random House, Inc. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/generation&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed: 22 December 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[kinship]] terminology, it is a structural term designating the parent-child relationship. It is also known as [[biogenesis]], [[reproduction]], or [[procreation]] in the [[biology|biological sciences]].

"Generation" is also often used synonymously with ''[[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]]'' in [[social science]]; under this formulation it means "people within a delineated population who experience the same significant events within a given period of time".&lt;ref name=Pilcher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pilcher|first=Jane|title=Mannheim's Sociology of Generations: An undervalued legacy|journal=British Journal of Sociology|date=September 1994|volume=45|issue=3|pages=481–495|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/94PilcherMannheimSocGenBJS.pdf|accessdate=10 October 2012|doi=10.2307/591659|jstor=591659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generations in this sense of birth cohort, also known as "social generations", are widely used in popular culture, and have been the basis for sociological analysis. Serious analysis of generations began in the nineteenth century, emerging from an increasing awareness of the possibility of permanent social change and the idea of youthful rebellion against the established social order. Some analysts believe that a generation is one of the fundamental social categories in a society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed by other factors including class, gender, race, education, among others.

==Etymology==
The word ''generate'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''generāre'', meaning "to beget".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/generate |title=Generate &amp;#124; Define Generate at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=15 June 1995 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''generation'' as a ''[[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]]'' in [[social science]] signifies the entire body of individuals born and living at about the same time, most of whom are approximately the same age and have similar ideas, problems, and attitudes (e.g., [[Beat Generation]] and [[Lost Generation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary.com definition of the word "generation"|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/generation?s=t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Familial generation==
[[File:Lynch Armenia Five generations.png|thumb|right|Five generations of one Armenian family—a child with her mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother.]]

A familial generation is a group of living beings constituting a single step in the line of descent from an ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Generation|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/generation|publisher=Miriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; In developed nations the [[generation time|average familial generation length]] is in the high 20s and has even reached 30 years in some nations.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Social Policy Division [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/62/49/41919586.pdf] SF2.3: Mean age of mothers at first childbirth. Retrieved 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as greater industrialisation and demand for cheap female labour, urbanisation, delayed first pregnancy and a greater uncertainty in relationship stability have all contributed to the increase of the generation length from the late 18th century to the present. These changes can be attributed to both social factors, such as [[GDP]] and state policy, and related individual-level variables, particularly a woman's educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;Bedasso, Biniam Egu. {{cite web|url=http://www.uneca.org/acgs/mdgs/Education_Empirical_report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601030316/http://www.uneca.org/acgs/mdgs/Education_Empirical_report.pdf |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy }} Investing in education as a means and as an end: exploring the microfoundations of the MDGs.

==Social generation==
Social generations are cohorts of people born in the same date range and who share similar cultural experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mannheim|first1=k|title=Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge|date=1952|publisher=RKP|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of a social generation, in the sense that it is used today, gained currency in the 19th century. Prior to that the concept "generation" had generally referred to family relationships and not broader social groupings. In 1863, French [[lexicographer]] [[Emile Littré]] had defined a generation as, "all men living more or less at the same time".&lt;ref name=Wohl203&gt;{{Cite book| last=Wohl | first=Robert | authorlink=Robert Wohl | title=The generation of 1914 | year=1979 | publisher=Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts  | isbn=978-0-674-34466-2 | pages=203–209 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YLe3e3FDXQkC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=wohl%201914&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several trends promoted a new idea of generations, as the 19th century wore on, of a society divided into different categories of people based on age. These trends were all related to the processes of [[modernisation]], [[industrialisation]], or [[westernisation]], which had been changing the face of Europe since the mid-18th century. One was a change in mentality about time and social change. The increasing prevalence of [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] ideas encouraged the idea that society and life were changeable, and that civilization could [[Social progress|progress]]. This encouraged the equation of youth with social renewal and change. Political rhetoric in the 19th century often focused on the renewing power of youth influenced by movements such as [[Young Italy]], [[Young Germany]], [[Sturm und Drang]], the [[German Youth Movement]], and other [[romantic movement]]s. By the end of the 19th century, European intellectuals were disposed toward thinking of the world in generational terms—in terms of youth rebellion and emancipation.&lt;ref name=Wohl203 /&gt;

Two important contributing factors to the change in mentality were the change in the economic structure of society. Because of the rapid social and economic change, young men particularly were less beholden to their fathers and family authority than they had been. Greater social and economic mobility allowed them to flout their authority to a much greater extent than had traditionally been possible. Additionally, the skills and wisdom of fathers were often less valuable than they had been due to technological and social change.&lt;ref name=Wohl203 /&gt; During this time, the period between [[childhood]] and [[adulthood]], usually spent at university or in military service, was also increased for many people entering [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] jobs. This category of people was very influential in spreading the ideas of youthful renewal.&lt;ref name=Wohl203 /&gt;

Another important factor was the breakdown of traditional social and regional identifications. The spread of [[nationalism]] and many of the factors that created it (a national press, linguistic homogenisation, [[public education]], suppression of local particularities) encouraged a broader sense of belonging beyond local affiliations. People thought of themselves increasingly as part of a society, and this encouraged identification with groups beyond the local.&lt;ref name=Wohl203 /&gt;[[Auguste Comte]] was the first philosopher to make a serious attempt to systematically study generations. In ''Cours de philosophie positive'' Comte suggested that social change is determined by generational change and in particular conflict between successive generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/85JaegerGenInHistHISTTHEO.pdf |title=Hans Jaeger. Generations in History: Reflections on a Controversy. Translation of "Generationen in der Geschichte: Überlegungen zu einer umstrittenen Konzeption," originally published in Geschichte und Gesellschaft 3 (1977), 429–452. p 275. |format=PDF |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the members of a given generation age, their "instinct of social conservation" becomes stronger, which inevitably and necessarily brings them into conflict with the "normal attribute of youth"—innovation. Other important theorists of the 19th century were [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].

Sociologist [[Karl Mannheim]] was a seminal figure in the study of generations. He elaborated a [[theory of generations]] in his 1923 essay ''The Problem of Generations''.&lt;ref name="Pilcher" /&gt; He suggested that there had been a division into two primary schools of study of generations until that time.  Firstly, positivists such as Comte measured social change in designated life spans.  Mannheim argued that this reduced history to "a chronological table". The other school, the "romantic-historical" was represented by Dilthey and [[Martin Heidegger]]. This school focused on the individual qualitative experience at the expense of social context. Mannheim emphasised that the rapidity of social change in youth was crucial to the formation of generations, and that not every generation would come to see itself as distinct. In periods of rapid social change a generation would be much more likely to develop a cohesive character. He also believed that a number of distinct sub-generations could exist.&lt;ref name="Pilcher" /&gt;

According to Gilleard and Higgs, Mannheim identified three commonalities that a generation shares:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Gilleard, C. &amp; Higgs, P.|title=The third age: Class, cohort or generation?|journal=Ageing and Society|year=2002|volume=22|issue=3|pages=369–382|doi=10.1017/s0144686x0200870x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]] developed the [[Strauss-Howe generational theory]] outlining what they saw as a pattern of generations repeating throughout American history. This theory became quite influential with the public and reignited an interest in the sociology of generations. This led to the creation of an industry of consulting, publishing, and marketing in the field.&lt;ref name="COHE"&gt;{{cite web|first=Eric |last=Hoover|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Millennial-Muddle-How/48772/ |title=The Millennial Muddle|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has alternatively been criticized by social scientists and journalists who argue it is non-[[falsifiability|falsifiable]], [[determinism|deterministic]], and unsupported by rigorous evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=David|authorlink=David Brooks (cultural commentator)|title=What's the Matter With Kids Today?

==Generational theory==

While the concept of a generation has a long history and can be found in ancient literature,&lt;ref name="Biggs 2007 695–711"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biggs|first=Simon|title=Thinking about generations: Conceptual positions and policy implications.|journal=Journal of Social Issues|year=2007|volume=63|issue=4|pages=695–711|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00531.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are also psychological and sociological dimensions in the sense of belonging and identity which may define a generation.

The concept of a generation can also be used to locate particular birth cohorts in specific historical and cultural circumstances, such as the "[[Baby boomers]]".&lt;ref name="Biggs 2007 695–711"/&gt;

While all generations have similarities, there are differences among them as well. A 2007 [[Pew Research Center]] report called "Millennials: Confident. Connected. Open to Change" noted the challenge of studying generations: "Generational analysis has a long and distinguished place in social science, and we cast our lot with those scholars who believe it is not only possible, but often highly illuminating, to search for the unique and distinctive characteristics of any given age group of Americans. But we also know this is not an exact science. We are mindful that there are as many differences in attitudes, values, behaviors, and lifestyles within a generation as there are between generations. But we believe this reality does not diminish the value of generational analysis; it merely adds to its richness and complexity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Millennials. Confident, Connected. Open to Change.|authors=Taylor, P. &amp; Keeter, S. (Eds.)|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1501/millennials-new-survey-generational-personality-upbeat-open-new-ideas-technology-bound|pages=5|date=24 February 2010|access-date=24 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227045407/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1501/millennials-new-survey-generational-personality-upbeat-open-new-ideas-technology-bound|archive-date=27 February 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another element of generational theory is recognizing how youth experience their generation, and how that changes based on where they reside in the world. "Analyzing young people's experiences in place contributes to a deeper understanding of the processes of individualization, inequality, and of generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Youth and Generation|last = Dan Woodman|first = Johanna Wyn|publisher = SAGE|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-4462-5904-7|location = Los Angeles, London, New Delhi.Singapore, Washington DC|pages = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to take a closer looks at youth cultures and subcultures in different times and places adds an extra element to understanding the everyday lives of youth. This allows a better understanding of youth and the way generation and place play in their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Youth and Generation Rethinking Change and Inequity in the Lives of Young People|last = Woodman|first = Dan|publisher = Sage Publications Ltd|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-4462-5904-7|location = London|pages = 122|last2 = Wyn|first2 = Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not where the birth cohort boundaries are drawn that is important, but how individuals and societies interpret the boundaries and how divisions may shape processes and outcomes. However, the practice of categorizing age cohorts is useful to researchers for the purpose of constructing boundaries in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grenier|first=Amanda|title=Crossing age and generational boundaries: Exploring intergenerational research encounters|journal=Journal of Social Issues|year=2007|volume=63|issue=4|pages=713–727|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00532.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generational tension==

Norman Ryder, writing in ''[[American Sociological Review]]'' in 1965, shed light on the [[sociology]] of the discord between generations by suggesting that society "persists despite the mortality of its individual members, through processes of demographic metabolism and particularly the annual infusion of birth cohorts". He argued that generations may sometimes be a "threat to stability" but at the same time they represent "the opportunity for social transformation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryder|first=Norman|title=The cohort as a concept in the study of social change|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|year=1965|volume=30|issue=6|pages=843–861|doi=10.2307/2090964|jstor=2090964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryder attempted to understand the dynamics at play between generations.

Amanda Grenier, in a 2007 essay published in ''[[Journal of Social Issues]]'', offered another source of explanation for why generational tensions exist. Grenier asserted that generations develop their own linguistic models that contribute to misunderstanding between age cohorts, "Different ways of speaking exercised by older and younger people exist, and may be partially explained by social historical reference points, culturally determined experiences, and individual interpretations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grenier|first=Amanda|title=Crossing age and generational boundaries: Exploring intergenerational research encounters|journal=[[Journal of Social Issues]]|year=2007|volume=63|issue=4|page=718|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00532.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Mannheim]], in his 1952 book ''[[Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge]]'' asserted the belief that people are shaped through lived experiences as a result of social change. Howe and Strauss also have written on the similarities of people within a generation being attributed to social change. Based on the way these lived experiences shape a generation in regard to values, the result is that the new generation will challenge the older generation's values, resulting in tension. This challenge between generations and the tension that arises is a defining point for understanding generations and what separates them.&lt;ref&gt;Mannheim, Karl. (1952) 'The problem of generations', in K. Mannheim, Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge, London: RKP&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of generations==

===Western world===
[[Image:Baby Mother Grandmother and Great Grandmother.jpg|250px|thumb|This photograph depicts four generations of one family: a baby boy, his mother, his maternal grandmother, and one of his maternal great-grandmothers.]]
For the purposes of this list, "[[Western world]]" can be taken to include [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Many variations may exist within these regions, both geographically and culturally, which means that the list is broadly indicative, but necessarily very general. The contemporary characterization of these cohorts used in media and advertising borrows from the [[Strauss–Howe generational theory]] among others.
*The [[Lost Generation]], also known as the ''Generation of 1914'' in Europe,&lt;ref name=Wohl&gt;{{Cite book| last=Wohl | first=Robert | title=The generation of 1914 | year=1979 | publisher=Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts  | isbn=978-0-674-34466-2 | pages= | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YLe3e3FDXQkC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=wohl%201914&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term originating with [[Gertrude Stein]] to describe those who fought in [[World War I]]. The members of the lost generation were typically born between 1883 and 1900. All members of this generation are now deceased.
*The [[G.I. Generation]], is the generation that includes the [[veterans]] who fought in [[World War II]]. They were born from around 1901 to 1924, coming of age during the [[Great Depression]]. Journalist [[Tom Brokaw]] described American members of this cohort as the "greatest generation" in his book ''[[Greatest Generation|The Greatest Generation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hunt | first = Tristram | date = 6 June 2004 | title = One last time they gather, the Greatest Generation | work = [[The Observer]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jun/06/secondworldwar | accessdate = 24 August 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Baby Boomer]]s, also known as the [[Me generation|Me Generation]], are the generation that were born mostly following [[World War II]]. There are no precise dates when the cohort birth years start and end. Typically, they range from the early-to-mid 1940s and end from 1960 to 1964. Increased birth rates were observed during the [[post–World War II baby boom]] making them a relatively large demographic cohort.&lt;ref&gt;See:

* [[Generation X]], commonly abbreviated to ''Gen X'', is the generation following the baby boomers. Demographers and researchers typically use starting birth years ranging from the early-to-mid 1960s and ending birth years in the early 1980s. The term has also been used in different times and places for a number of different [[subcultures]] or [[counterculture]]s since the 1950s.
** In the U.S., some called Generation Xers the "baby bust" generation because of the drop in the birth rate following the baby boom.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Identity"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C2WmSCOBR2IC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;dq=%22Generation+X%22+%22baby+bust%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1COvTNWNIsSclgfgjMHnDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Generation%20X%22%20%22baby%20bust%22&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Identity] By Ronald L. Jackson, II&lt;/ref&gt; The drop in fertility rates in America began in the late 1950s. But according to authors and demographers William Strauss and Neil Howe (who use 1961 to 1981 for Gen X birth years), by 1991 there were approximately 88.5 million Gen Xers in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=William Strauss|first=Neil Howe|title=Generations|year=1991|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-688-11912-3|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid 1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years.

Their discourse mainly develops around themes such as [[anti-colonialism]], [[sustainable development]], and democracy.
*In [[Germany]], generations widely follow the Western world pattern but have many aspects of different ''[[Vergangenheitsbewältigung]]''. In German history the start and abolition of [[Gleichschaltung]] in [[mass movement]]s ([[nazism|Nazi]] ''[[Hitler Youth|Hitlerjugend]]'' and later [[communism|communist]] [[Free German Youth]]) also shaped generations.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The baby boomer generation was heavily challenging their parents and relatives with their past in [[Nazi Germany]] and in [[World War II]] as well as their (individual) [[responsibility for the Holocaust]] but also the survival of the ''Third Reich'' in (West) German administration, science, legislation and culture due to claimed unsuccessful [[denazification]]. It formed [[German student movement]] which translated West Germany in some aspects.

Indian "boomers", those born after independence and into the early 1960s, tended to link success to leaving India and were more suspicious of traditional social institutions. Events like the [[Indian Emergency]] between 1975 and 1977 made them more sceptical of government. Gen Xers experienced India's economic ascendance and are more comfortable with diverse perspectives.

==Other terminology==
The term generation is sometimes applied to a cultural movement, or more narrowly defined group than an entire demographic. Some examples include:

*The [[Stolen Generations]], refers to children of [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] (AATSI) descent, who were removed from their families by the Australian Federal and State government agencies and church missions, under acts of their respective parliaments between approximately 1869 and 1969.
*The [[Beat Generation]], refers to a popular American cultural movement widely cited by social scholars as having laid the foundation of the pro-active American [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. It consisted of Americans born between the two world wars who came of age in the rise of the automobile era, and the surrounding accessibility they brought to the culturally diverse, yet geographically broad and separated nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/periods/beat.php|title=The Beat Generation|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

===Background===
According to de Swaan, the global language system has been constantly evolving since the time period of the early 'military-agrarian' regimes.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt; Under these regimes, the rulers imposed their own language and so the first 'central' languages emerged, linking the peripheral languages of the agrarian communities via bilingual speakers to the language of the conquerors. Then was the formation of empires, which resulted in the next stage of integration of the world language system.

Firstly, Latin emerged from Rome. Under the rule of the [[Roman Empire]], under which an extensive group of states were ruled by, the usage of Latin stretched along the Mediterranean coast, the southern half of Europe, and more sparsely to the North and then into the Germanic and Celtic lands. Thus, Latin evolved to become a central language in Europe from 27 BC to 476 AD.

Secondly, there was the widespread usage of the pre-classical version of Han Chinese in contemporary China due to the unification of China in 221 BC by [[Qin Shi Huang]].

Thirdly, [[Sanskrit]] started to become widely spoken in South Asia from the widespread teaching of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] in South Asian countries.

Fourthly, the expansion of the Arabic empire also led to the increased usage of Arabic as a language in the Afro-Eurasian land mass.

Military conquests of preceding centuries generally determine the distribution of languages today.
Supercentral languages spread by land and sea. Land-bound languages spread via marching empires: [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hindi]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. However, when the conquerors were defeated and were forced to move out of the territory, the spread of the languages receded. As a result, some of these languages are currently barely supercentral languages and are instead confined to their remaining state territories, as is evident from German, Russian and Japanese.

On the other hand, sea-bound languages spread by conquests overseas: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Consequently, these languages became widespread in areas settled by European colonisers and relegated the indigenous people and their languages to peripheral positions.

Besides, the [[world-systems theory]] also allowed the global language system to expand further. It focuses on the existence of the core, semi-peripheral and peripheral nations. The [[core countries]] are the most economically powerful and the wealthiest countries. Besides, they also have a strong governmental system in the country, which oversees the bureaucracies in the governmental departments. There is also the prevalent existence of the [[bourgeois]], and core nations have significant influence over the non-core, smaller nations. Historically, the core countries were found in northwestern Europe and include countries such as England, France and the Netherlands. They were the dominant countries that had colonized many other nations from the early 15th century to the early 19th century.

Then is the existence of the [[periphery countries]], the countries with the slowest economic growth. They also have relatively weak governments and a poor social structure and often depend on primary industries as the main source of economic activity for the country.

The extracting and exporting of raw materials from the peripheral nations to core nations is the activity bringing about the most economic benefits to the country. Much of the population that is poor and uneducated, and the countries are also extensively influenced by core nations and the multinational corporations found there. Historically, peripheral nations were found outside Europe, the continent of colonial masters. Many countries in [[Latin America]] were peripheral nations during the period of colonization, and today peripheral countries are in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

Lastly, the presence of the [[semiperiphery countries]], those in between the core and the periphery. They tend to be those which started out as peripheral nations and are currently moving towards industrialization and the development of more diversified labour markets and economies. They can as well come about from declining core countries. They are not dominant players in the international trade market. As compared to the peripheral nations, semi-peripheries are not as susceptible to manipulation by the core countries. However, most of these nations have economic or political relations with the core. Semi-peripheries also tend to exert influence and control over peripheries and can serve to be a buffer between the core and peripheral nations and ease political tensions. Historically, Spain and Portugal were semi-peripheral nations after they fell from their dominant core positions. As they still maintained a certain level of influence and dominance in Latin America over their colonies, they could still maintain their semi-peripheral position.

According to [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], one of the most well-known theorists who developed the world-systems approach, a core nation is dominant over the non-core nations from its economic and trade dominance. The abundance of cheap and unskilled labour in the peripheral nations makes many large [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs), from core countries, often outsource their production to the peripheral countries to cut costs, by employing cheap labour. Hence, the languages from the core countries could penetrate into the peripheries from the setting up of the foreign MNCs in the peripheries. A significant percentage of the population living in the core countries had also migrated to the core countries in search of jobs with higher wages.

The gradual expansion of the population of migrants makes the language used in their home countries be brought into the core countries, thus allowing for further integration and expansion of the world language system. The semi-peripheries also maintain economic and financial trade with the peripheries and core countries. That allows for the penetration of languages used in the semi-peripheries into the core and peripheral nations, with the flow of migrants moving out of the semi-peripheral nations to the core and periphery for trade purposes.

Thus, the global language system examines rivalries and accommodations using a global perspective and establishes that the linguistic dimension of the world system goes hand in hand with the political, economic, cultural and ecological aspects. Specifically, the present global constellation of languages is the product of prior conquest and domination and of ongoing relations of power and exchange.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

===Q-value===
&lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is the communicative value of a language ''i'', its potential to connect a speaker with other speakers of a constellation or subconstellation, "S".  It is defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;Q_i=p_i \times c_i = \left ( \frac{P_i}{N^S} \right ) \times \left ( \frac{C_i}{M^S} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

The prevalence &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; of language ''i'', means the number of competent speakers in ''i'',  &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;, divided by all the speakers, &lt;math&gt;N^S&lt;/math&gt; of constellation ''S''. Centrality, &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of multilingual speakers &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; who speak language ''i'' divided by all the multilingual speakers in constellation ''S'',  &lt;math&gt;M^S&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the Q-value or communication value is the product of the prevalence &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and the centrality &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; of language ''i''  in constellation ''S''.

Consequently, a peripheral language has a low Q-value and the Q-values increase along the sociology classification of languages, with the Q-value of the hypercentral language being the highest.

De Swaan has been calculating the Q-values of the official [[European Union]](EU) languages since 1957 to explain the acquisition of languages by EU citizens in different phases.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=de Swaan |first=Abram |editor-last=Ammon |editor-first=Ulrich |editorlink1=Ulrich Ammon |editor2-last=Mattheier |editor2-first=Klaus J. |editor3-last=Nelde |editor3-first=Peter H. |title=Sociolinguistica: International Yearbook of European Sociolinguistics, Vol. 21: Linguistic Consequences of the EU-Enlargement |publisher=Tübingen |date=2007 |pages=1–21 |chapter=The language predicament of the EU since the enlargements [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Ao2XIClUKd8C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=The+language+predicament+of+the+EU+since+the+enlargements.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=93hHwBadOP&amp;sig=DewiQDKr-XCxt81IDwkRxLRFa-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=plxAVOfjAc6RuATT1oGQDw&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=de%20swaan&amp;f=false] |isbn=978-3-484-60490-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, when there were only four language constellations, Q-value decreased in the order of French, German, Italian, Dutch. In 1975, the [[European Commission]] enlarged to include Britain, Denmark and Ireland. English had the highest Q-value followed by French and German.
In the following years, the European Commission grew, with the addition of countries like Austria, Finland and Sweden. Q-value of English still remained the highest, but French and German swapped places.

In EU23, which refers to the 23 official languages spoken in the [[European Union]], the Q-values for English, German and French were 0.194, 0.045 and 0.036 respectively.

===Theoretical framework===
De Swaan likens the global language system to contemporary political [[macrosociology]] and states that language constellations are a social phenomenon, which can be understood by using social science theories. In his theory, de Swaan uses the [[#Political Sociology of Language|Political Sociology of Language]] and [[#Political Economy of Language|Political Economy of Language]] to explain the rivalry and accommodation between language groups.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

====Political sociology====
This theoretical perspective centres on the interconnections among the state, nation and citizenship. Accordingly, bilingual elite groups try to take control of the opportunities for mediation between the monolingual group and the state. Subsequently, they use the official language to dominate the sectors of government and administration and the higher levels of employment. It assumes that both the established and outsider groups are able to communicate in a shared vernacular, but the latter groups lack the literacy skills that could allow them to learn the written form of the central or supercentral language, which would, in turn allow, them to move up the social ladder.

====Political economy====
This perspective centres on the inclinations that people have towards learning one language over the other. The presumption is that if given a chance, people will learn the language that gives them more communication advantage. In other words, a higher [[#Q-Value|Q-Value]]. Certain languages such as English or Chinese have high Q-values since they are spoken in many countries across the globe and would thus be more economically useful than to less spoken languages, such as Romanian or Hungarian.

From an economic perspective, languages are ‘hypercollective’ goods since they exhibit properties of [[collective goods]] and produce external network effects. Thus, the more speakers a language has, the higher its communication value for each speaker. The hypercollective nature and [[#Q-Value|Q-Value]] of languages thus help to explain the dilemma that a speaker of a peripheral language faces when deciding whether to learn the central or hypercentral language. The hypercollective nature and Q-value also help to explain the accelerating spread and abandonment of various languages. In that sense, when people feel that a language is gaining new speakers, they would assign a greater Q-value to this language and abandon their own [[firzt language|native]] language in place of a more central language. The hypercollective nature and Q-value also explain, in an economic sense, the ethnic and cultural movements for language conservation.

Specifically, a minimal Q-value of a language is guaranteed when there is a critical mass of speakers committed to protecting it, thus preventing the language from being forsaken.

===Characteristics===
The global language system theorises that language groups are engaged in unequal competition on different levels globally. Using the notions of a periphery, semi-periphery and a core, which are concepts of the [[world system theory]], de Swaan relates them to the four levels present in the hierarchy of the global language system: peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

De Swaan also argues that the greater the range of potential uses and users of a language, the higher the tendency of an individual to move up the hierarchy in the global language system and learn a more "central" language. Thus, de Swaan views the learning of [[second language]]s as proceeding up rather than down the hierarchy, in the sense that they learn a language that is on the next level up. For instance, speakers of Catalan, a peripheral language, have to learn Spanish, a [[#Central languages|central language]] to function in their own society, Spain. Meanwhile, speakers of Persian, a central language, have to learn Arabic, a [[#Supercentral languages|supercentral language]], to function in their region. On the other hand, speakers of a supercentral language have to learn the [[#Hypercentral languages|hypercentral language]] to function globally, as is evident from the huge number of non-native English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Vivian|title=Second language learning and language teaching|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Ma0uAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Second+Language+Learning+and+Language+Teaching+Fourth+Edition&amp;ots=uXerrKESf8&amp;sig=In7biboNQq0s5b_8fPB6y9fF4-s#v=onepage&amp;q=Second%20Language%20Learning%20and%20Language%20Teaching%20Fourth%20Edition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to de Swaan, languages exist in "constellations" and the global language system comprises a sociological classification of [[language]]s based on their social role for their speakers. The world's languages and multilinguals are connected in a strongly ordered, hierarchical pattern. There are thousands of peripheral or minority languages in the world, each of which are connected to one of a hundred central languages. The connections and patterns between each language is what makes up the global language system. The four levels of language are the peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral languages.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

[[File:Hierarchy of the global language system (adapted from de Swaan, 2001).jpg|thumb|This flowchart depicts the hierarchy of the languages in de Swaan's (2001) global language system theory.]]

====Peripheral languages====
At the lowest level, peripheral languages, or [[minority languages]], form the majority of languages spoken in the world; 98% of the world's languages are peripheral languages and spoken by less than 10% of the world’s population. Unlike central languages, these are "languages of conversation and narration rather than reading and writing, of memory and remembrance rather than record".&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt; They are used by native speakers within a particular area and are in danger of becoming extinct with increasing globalisation, which sees more and more speakers of peripheral languages acquiring more central languages in order to communicate with others.

====Central languages====
The next level constitutes about 100 central languages, spoken by 95% of the world's population and generally used in education, media and administration. Typically, they are the 'national' and [[official languages]] of the ruling state. These are the languages of record, and much of what has been said and written in those languages is saved in newspaper reports, minutes and proceedings, stored in archives, included in history books, collections of the 'classics', of folk talks and folk ways, increasingly recorded on electronic media and thus conserved for posterity.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

Many speakers of central languages are [[multilingual]] because they are either native speakers of a peripheral language and have acquired the central language, or they are native speakers of the central language and have learned a supercentral language.

====Supercentral languages====
At the second highest level, 13 supercentral languages are very widely spoken languages that serve as connectors between speakers of central languages: [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hindi]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

These languages often have colonial traces and "were once imposed by a colonial power and after independence continued to be used in politics, administration, law, big business, technology and higher education".&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

====Hypercentral languages====
At the highest level is the language that connects speakers of the supercentral languages. Today, [[English language|English]] is the only example of a hypercentral language as the standard for science, literature, business, and law, as well as being the most widely spoken [[Second language|second language]].

==Applications==

===Pyramid of languages of the world===
[[File:The world language hierarchy (adapted from Graddol, 1997).jpg|thumb|This pyramid illustrates the hierarchy of the world's languages as proposed by Graddol (1997) in his book, 'The future of English? A guide to forecasting the popularity of the English language in the 21st century', published by the British Council.]]

According to [[David Graddol]] (1997), in his book titled ''The Future of English'',  the languages of the world comprise a "hierarchical pyramid", as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maurais |first=Jacques |editor1-last=Maurais |editor1-first=Jacques |editor1link=Jacques Maurais |editor2-last=Morris |editor2-first=Michael A. |title=Languages in a Globalising World|date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=United Kingdom |pages=13–36 |chapter=Chapter 2:Towards a new global linguistic order? [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=NZ5LBcUMr28C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=graddol&amp;f=false] |isbn=0-521-82173-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The big languages''': [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]].
* '''Regional languages''' (languages of the [[United Nations]] are marked with asterisk): [[Arabic]]*, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]*, English*, French*, [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]]*, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]*.
* '''National languages''': around 80 languages serving over 180 nation states.
* '''Official languages within nation states''' (and other "safe" languages): around 600 languages worldwide (e.g. [[Marathi language|Marathi]]). 
* '''Local vernacular languages''': the remainder of the world's 6,000+ languages.

===Translation systems===
The global language system is also seen in the international translation process as explained by Johan Heilbron, a historical sociologist: "translations and the manifold activities these imply are embedded in and dependent on a world system of translation, including both the source and the target cultures".&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heilbron|first1=Johan|title=Structure and Dynamics of the World System of Translation|url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/40619/12684038723Heilbron.pdf/Heilbron.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchical relationship between global languages is reflected in the global system for translations. The more "central" a language, the greater is its capability to function as a bridge or vehicular language to facilitate communication between peripheral and semi-central languages.&lt;ref name=Heilbron /&gt;

Heilbron's version of the global system of language in translations has four levels:

'''Level 1''': Hypercentral position — 
English currently holds the largest market share of the global market for translations; 55–60% of all book translations are from English. It strongly dominates the hierarchical nature of book translation system.

'''Level 2''': Central position — 
German and French each hold 10% of the global translation market.

'''Level 3''': Semi-central position — 
There are 7 or 8 languages "neither very central on a global level nor very peripheral",&lt;ref name=Heilbron/&gt; making up 1 to 3% of the world market (like Spanish, Italian and Russian).

'''Level 4''': Peripheral position — 
Languages from which "less than 1% of the book translations worldwide are made", including Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Despite having large populations of speakers, "their role in the translation economy is peripheral as compared to more central languages".&lt;ref name=Heilbron/&gt;

==Acceptance==
According to the [[Google Scholar]] website, de Swaan's book, ''Words of the world: The global language system'', has been cited by 546 other papers, as of 16 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Swaan|first1=Abram|title=Words of the world: The global language system|url=https://scholar.google.com.sg/scholar?q=abram+de+swaan+global+language+system&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5|website=Google Scholar|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have also been several concerns regarding the global language system:

===Importance of Q-value===
Van Parijs (2004)&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2007" /&gt; claimed that 'frequency' or likelihood of contact is adequate as an indicator of language learning and language spread. However, de Swaan (2007) argued that it alone is not sufficient. Rather, the [[#Q-value|Q-value]], which comprises both frequency (better known as prevalence) and 'centrality', helps to explain the spread of (super)central languages, especially former colonial languages in newly independent countries where in which only the elite minority spoke the language initially. Frequency alone would not be able to explain the spread of such languages, but [[#Q-value|Q-value]], which includes centrality, would be able to.

In another paper, Cook and Li (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Vivian |editor-last=Cook |editor-first=Vivian |editor1link= Vivian Cook (academic) |editor2-last=Li |editor2-first=Wei |title=Big Contemporary Applied Linguistics: Language Teaching and Learning, Vol. 1 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=2009 |pages=54–74 |chapter=Chapter 3: Language user groups and language teaching [https://books.google.com.sg/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=_5evAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Contemporary+Applied+Linguistics+cook&amp;ots=glSUNb01Ei&amp;sig=zQc-xnrhpNkI_4iTwlaR51x8L7E#v=onepage&amp;q=swaan&amp;f=false] |isbn=978-0-8264-9680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the ways to categorise language users into various groups. They suggested two theories: one by Siegel (2006) who used 'sociolinguistic settings', which is based on the notion of dominant language, and another one by de Swaan (2001) that used the concept of hierarchy in the global language system. According to them, de Swaan's hierarchy is more appropriate, as it does not imply dominance in power terms. Rather, de Swaan's applies the concepts of geography and function to group languages and hence language users according to the global language system. De Swaan (2001) views the acquisition of [[second language]]s (L2) as typically going up the hierarchy.

However, Cook and Li argues that this analysis is not adequate in accounting for the many groups of L2 users to whom the two areas of territory and function hardly apply. The two areas of territory and function can be associated respectively with the prevalence and centrality of the [[#Q-value|Q-value]]. This group of L2 users typically doez not acquire an L2 going up the hierarchy, such as users in an intercultural marriage or users who come from a particular cultural or ethnic group and wish to learn its language for identity purposes. Thus, Cook and Li argue that de Swaan's theory, though highly relevant, still has its drawbacks in that the concept behind [[#Q-value|Q-value]] is insufficient in accounting for some L2 users.

===Choice of supercentral languages===
There is disagreement as to which languages should be considered more central. The theory states that a language is central if it connects speakers of "a series of central languages". [[Robert Phillipson]] questioned why [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is included as one of the supercentral languages but [[Bengali language|Bengali]], which has more speakers, is not on the list.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillipson|first1=Robert|title=English in Globalization: Three Approaches|journal=Journal of Language, Identity &amp; Education|date=2004|volume=3|issue=1|pages=73–78|doi=10.1207/s15327701jlie0301_4|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327701jlie0301_4?journalCode=hlie20#.VDN8XfmSzuw|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inadequate evidence for a system===
Michael Morris argued that while it is clear that there is language hierarchy from the "ongoing interstate competition and power politics", there is little evidence provided that shows that the "global language interaction is so intense and systematic that it constitutes a global language system, and that the entire system is held together by one [[global language]], English". He claimed that de Swaan's case studies demonstrated that hierarchy in different regions of the world but did not show the existence of a system within a region or across regions. The global language system is supposed to be part of the international system but is "notoriously vague and lacking in operational importance"  and therefore cannot be shown to exist.  However, Morris believes that this lack of evidence could be from the lack of global language data and not negligence on de Swaan's part. Morris also believes that any theory on a global system, if later proved, would be much more complex than what is proposed by de Swaan. Questions on how the [[#Hypercentral language|hypercentral language]] English holds together the system must also be answered by such a global language system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|title=Words of the World: The Global Language System by Abram De Swaan|journal=Language in Society|date=Sep 2004|volume=33|issue=4|pages=620–624|jstor=4169377|doi=10.1017/S0047404504334068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory built on inadequate foundations===
Robert Phillipson states that the theory is based on selective theoretical foundations. He claimed that there is a lack of consideration about the effects of [[globalization]], which is especially important when the theory is about a global system: "De Swaan nods occasionally in the direction of linguistic and cultural capital, but does not link this to class or linguistically defined social stratification ([[linguistic discrimination|linguicism]]) or linguistic inequality"  and that "key concepts in the [[sociolinguistics|sociology of language]], language maintenance and [[language shift|shift]], and language spread are scarcely mentioned".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;

On the other hand, de Swaan's work in the field of sociolinguistics has been noted by other scholars to be focused on "issues of economic and political sociology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tonkin|first1=Humphrey|title=Abram de Swaan. Words of the World: The Global Language System|journal=Language Problems &amp; Language Planning|date=2005|volume=29|issue=2|pages=201–203|doi=10.1075/lplp.29.2.12ton}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "politic and economic patterns",&lt;ref name="LINGUIST List 13.3274"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Augustyn|first1=Prisca|title=Review: Sociolinguistics: De Swaan(2001)|url=http://linguistlist.org/issues/13/13-3274.html|website=http://linguistlist.org/|accessdate=21 October 2014|ref=LINGUIST List 13.3274}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may explain why he makes only 'cautious references to socio-linguistic parameters".&lt;ref name="LINGUIST List 13.3274" /&gt;

{{Nihongo3|"fifth generation"|五世|'''Gosei'''}} is a [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese diasporic]] term used in countries, particularly in [[North America]] and in [[Latin America]], to specify the great-great-grandchildren of [[Japanese immigrants]] ([[Issei]]).  The children of Issei are [[Nisei]] (the second generation).  [[Sansei]] are the third generation, and their offspring are [[Yonsei (fourth-generation Nikkei)|Yonsei]].&lt;ref&gt;In Japanese counting, "one, two, three, four, five" is "''ichi, ni, san, yon, go''". Future generations would be called  ''rokusei'' (6th), 7th: ''nanasei'' (7th), etc. -- ''see'' [[Japanese numerals]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The children of at least one ''Yonsei'' parent are called ''Gosei''.&lt;ref&gt;Nomura, Gail M.

''Gosei'' is a term used in these geographic areas outside Japan.  ''Gosei'' characterizes the child of at least one ''Yonsei'' (fourth generation) parent.  Differences among these national ''Gosei'' developed because of the varying historical processes throuogh which their Japanese emigrant forebears became Nikkei.&lt;ref&gt;Ichioka, Yuji '' et al.''

'''Heritage studies''' looks at the relationship between people and tangible and intangible [[History|heritage]] through the use of social science research methods. The publication of the book by [[David Lowenthal]], ''The Past is a Foreign Country'', in 1985 is credited with creating the field (Carman &amp; Sørensen 2009). While related to the disciplines of [[history]], [[heritage conservation]], and [[historic preservation]], heritage studies is not necessarily concerned with the objective representation of the past. History is "the raw facts of the past" (Aitchison, MacLeod, &amp; Shaw 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;96) while heritage "is history processed through mythology, ideology, nationalism, local pride, romantic ideas or just plain marketing" (Schouten 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;21). The meanings of heritage are therefore subjective and rooted in the present; these meanings are defined by social, cultural, and individual processes. In other words, the meanings of heritage can be understood through contemporary sociocultural and experiential values. Lowenthal (1985, p.&amp;nbsp;410) argues that in the realm of human experience, we create heritage; to most people, heritage is therefore more important than history and is a product of human invention and creativity.

'''Historical languages''' (also known as '''historic languages''') are [[languages]] that were spoken in a historical period, but that are distinct from their modern form; that is, they are forms of languages historically attested to from the past which have evolved into more modern forms. Thus, historical languages contrast with dead languages (languages which have become extinct, or undergone [[language death]]). Also, historical languages contrast with reconstructed languages (that is, the [[proto-languages]]) of [[theoretical linguistics]]. One of the approaches to defining and using the concept of historical languages is implemented in the ISO 639 standards.

==ISO 639==
The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (sometimes by means of a [[registration authority]]) maintains and publishes standards for languages, among [[List of International Organization for Standardization standards|other things]]: the [[ISO 639-3]] standards for languages include type '''H''', for historical languages, part of a five-way typology to classify languages. Besides the historic languages, there are also ISO 639-3 classifications for living languages (languages with currently living native speakers), extinct languages (for languages whose last native speaker died within the last few centuries), ancient languages (whose last attested native speaker died more than a millennium ago), and [[constructed languages]] (which may or may not have native speakers). [[Old English]] is an example of a historic language. The ISO 639 language code for Old English is &lt;code&gt;ang&lt;/code&gt;. A further ISO 639-3 criterion for historic languages is that they have a distinct literature from their descendant languages: in the example of Old English, [[Beowulf]] and other works of [[Old English literature]] form a distinct body of material.

The '''history of art criticism''', as part of art history, is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts, i.e. [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]], which include aesthetic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the "major" arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture as well as the "minor" arts of ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.

As a term, the history of art history (also [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying and assessing the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the history of art criticism is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement from the standpoint of its history and of its major scholars. It is also distinguished from [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and How did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of art criticism is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. The history of art criticism often roots its studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. It attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
The history of art criticism as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians, in performing their assessment within the history of art criticism,  employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Practitioners of art criticism often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Practitioners of art criticism also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many practitioners of art criticism use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

==Timeline of Prominent Methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history or art criticism are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/xenocrates.htm Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''. Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were "Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome (Fuseli published an English translation in 1765 under the title Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks), and Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (History of Art in Antiquity), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyone Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Nochlin and feminism===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "Why have there been no great women artists?" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. In it she applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training. Nochlin argues that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields. The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success.[[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above. While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women.

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the [[Mona Lisa]]. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum Studies and Collecting===

Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New Materialism===

Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

[[Contemporary Art History]] refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2014}}

The '''hook''' is the nucleus of both a film and its [[screenplay]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} It is what grabs the viewer's attention, preferably in the first 5–10 minutes, as a reader might expect to find a literary [[Narrative hook|hook]] in the first chapter of a novel.

During the [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] process, a screenwriter will use a hook to prove the "bankable" quality of their screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craftyscreenwriting.com/hook.html |title=The Hook |publisher=Crafty Screenwriting |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing the importance of a good hook, many screenwriters write their hooks first. Conceivably, the life of a screenplay might evolve from hook to 1-page synopsis, to 4-page treatment, to full [[Film treatment|treatment]], to [[scriptment]], to screenplay.

One can briefly state a good hook in one or two sentences, introducing the protagonist, the conflict that drives the story, and what the [[protagonist]] will achieve with either triumph or defeat. The "hook" is the viewer's own question of whether the conflict can be resolved, so a screenwriter might want to test the hook by turning it into a question. For example, "Johnny must catch the murderer so that he can get the girl" might become "Will Johnny catch the murderer? Or will he lose the girl?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scriptfly.com/sceneanalysis/index.shtml |title=How to Write Your Screenplay's Hook |publisher=Scriptfly.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the screenwriter can use the hook as a tool when writing the screenplay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26842">'''Human placentophagy''', or consumption of the [[placenta]], is defined as "the ingestion of a human placenta [[postpartum]], at any time, by any person, either in raw or altered (e.g., cooked, dried, steeped in liquid) form".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Numerous historical occurrences of [[placentophagy]] have been recorded throughout the world, whereas modern occurrences of placentophagy are rare since most contemporary societies do not promote its practice. Since the 1970s, however, consumption of the placenta believing that it has health benefits has been a growing practice among clients of [[midwife|midwives]] and [[alternative medicine|alternative-health]] advocates in the U.S. and Mexico.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young |first=Sharon |first2= Daniel |last2=Benyshek |title=In Search of Human Placentophagy: A Cross-Cultural Survey of Human Placenta Consumption, Disposal Practices, and Cultural Beliefs |journal= Ecology of Food and Nutrition |volume=49 |issue=6 |year=2010 |pages= 467–84 |doi=10.1080/03670244.2010.524106|pmid=21888574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human placentophagy is undergoing a small revival&lt;!-- wrong word here as it was not common to Western cultures before --&gt; in Western cultures,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does eating placenta offer postpartum health benefits?|journal = British Journal of Midwifery|date = 2012-07-01|issn = 0969-4900|pages = 464–469|volume = 20|issue = 7|doi = 10.12968/bjom.2012.20.7.464|first = Michelle|last = Beacock}}&lt;/ref&gt; fostered by celebrities like [[January Jones]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Human placentophagy after childbirth is touted by some as a treatment for postpartum depression and fatigue, among other health benefits, given its high protein, rich iron and nutrient content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1946-11-01|title=Composition of the human placenta: III Vitamin content|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002937846901858|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|language=en|volume=52|issue=5|pages=783–787|doi=10.1016/0002-9378(46)90185-8|issn=0002-9378|last1=Pratt|first1=J.P.|last2=Roderuck|first2=Charlotte|last3=Coryell|first3=Margaret|last4=Macy|first4=Icie G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientific research is inconclusive as to whether consuming the placenta prevents or treats postpartum depression or to any other health benefits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The risks of human placentophagy are also still unclear.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid = 26043976|title = Placentophagy: therapeutic miracle or myth?|date = October 2015|journal = Archives of Women's Mental Health|doi = 10.1007/s00737-015-0538-8|volume=18|issue = 5|pages=673–80 | last1 = Coyle | first1 = CW | last2 = Hulse | first2 = KE | last3 = Wisner | first3 = KL | last4 = Driscoll | first4 = KE | last5 = Clark | first5 = CT|pmc = 4580132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Placentophagy can be divided into two categories, maternal placentophagy and non-maternal placentophagy.

==Maternal placentophagy==
Maternal placentophagy is defined as "a mother’s ingestion of her own placenta postpartum, in any form, at any time".&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;  Of the more than 4000 species of placental mammals, most, including herbivores, regularly engage in maternal placentophagy, thought to be an instinct to hide any trace of childbirth from predators in the wild. The exceptions to placentophagy include mainly [[human]]s, [[Pinnipedia]], [[Cetacea]], and [[camel]]s.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

=== Ingestion in time period immediately after birth ===
Midwifery practices anecdotally document the practice of consumption of a small portion of the raw placenta with honey to resolve postpartum hemorrhage, succeeding in instances where conventional administration of pitocin did not fully resolve bleeding.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Placenta : the forgotten chakra|last=1956-|first=Lim, Robin,|publisher=|others=Akiyama, Miyuki,|isbn=978-0976290773|edition=Revised|location=Bali, Indonesia|pages=122, 128|oclc=951498666|date = 2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ingestion in postpartum period ===
Preparation of the placenta for consumption can include domestic culinary recipes such as for pâté, or may involve outsourcing to encapsulation specialists for the freezing, cooking, and drying of the placenta, and crushing it into pill form. There is the question of whether the drying process affects the potentially beneficial proteins and hormones; there has even been one specific case in which a newborn developed sepsis after the mother consumed contaminated capsules and the centre for disease control thus issued a warning behind the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://placentaservices.com.au/what-do-we-know-about-placenta-encapsulation-and-group-b-strep/ | title=Placenta Encapasulation and Group B Strep| date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mothers planning on keeping their placentas after birthing in hospitals may need to check with hospital policies regarding authorization to do so.

==Non-maternal placentophagy==
Non-maternal placentophagy is defined as "the ingestion of the placenta by any person other than the mother, at any time".&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;  Such instances of placentophagy have been attributed to the following: a shift toward carnivorousness at [[parturition]], specific hunger, and general hunger. With most [[Eutheria]]n mammals, the placenta is consumed postpartum by the mother. Historically, humans more commonly consume the placenta of another woman under special circumstances.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

==Historical occurrences of human placentophagy==

In a 1979 volume of the Bulletin of the [[New York Academy of Medicine]], William Ober's article "Notes on Placentophagy" evaluates the possibility that certain ancient cultures that practiced human sacrifice may also have practiced human placentophagy, including [[Egyptians]], [[Tasian culture|Tasians]], Badarians, Amrateans, Gerzeans, Semainians.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ober |first=William B. |title=Notes on Placentophagy | journal=[[Journal of Urban Health]] |volume=55 |issue=6 |year=1979 |pages= 591–99 |pmc=1807646 |pmid=111747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Placentophagy might have occurred during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)]], due to the excessive famine experienced by the Judeans, according to scholar [[Jack Miles]] in his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[God: A Biography]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Y7c6XwOI68C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;q=%22god%3A%20a%20biography%22%20%2B%20afterbirth|quote=The sickening image of a woman fighting with her husband and children over who will eat her afterbirth is just the kind of unimaginable detail that only the actual experience can provide a writer.|last=Miles|first=Jack|title=God: A Biography|page=146|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=2011|isbn=9780307789136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Miles argues that the curse in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|28:56–57|HE}}, written in the form of [[prophecy]], is far too vivid not to have been seen personally by the author of the verses.

In early Brazil, there is extensive reportage of [[cannibalism]] among the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinamba]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal | last1 = Métraux | first1 = Alfred | authorlink = Alfred Métraux | year = 1949 | title = Warfare, Cannibalism, and Human Trophies | url = | journal = [[Handbook of South American Indians]] | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 383–409 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recorded about the natives of the captaincy of [[Sergipe]] in Brazil: "They eat human flesh when they can get it, and if a woman miscarries devour the abortive immediately. If she goes her time out, she herself cuts the navel-string with a shell, which she boils along with the secondine [i.e. [[placenta]]], and eats them both."&lt;ref&gt;E. Bowen, 1747: 532&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional medicine ===
Human placenta has been used traditionally in [[Chinese medicine]], though the mother is not identified as the recipient of these treatments.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;  A sixteenth-century Chinese medical text, the [[Compendium of Materia Medica]], states in a section on medical uses of the placenta that, "when a woman in [[Liuqiu]] has a baby, the placenta is eaten", and that in Bagui, "the placenta of a boy is specially prepared and eaten by the mother’s family and relatives."&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Another Chinese medical text, the Great Pharmacopoeia of 1596, recommends placental tissue mixed with human milk to help overcome the effects of Ch'i exhaustion.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; These include "[[anemia]], weakness of the extremities, and coldness of the sexual organs with involuntary ejaculation of semen".&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; Dried, powdered placenta would be stirred into three wine-cups of milk to make a Connected Destiny Elixir.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;  The elixir would be warmed in sunlight, then taken as treatment.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;  It is not known exactly how traditional this remedy was, nor exactly how far back it dates.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

Ober also identified many cultures known to have practiced placentophagy for medicinal purposes, and one for its flavor.

The Araucanian Native Americans of Argentina dried and ground a child's umbilical cord, giving the child a little of the powder when it was sick.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

In Jamaica, bits of placental membranes were put into an infant's tea to prevent convulsions caused by ghosts.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

The [[Chaga]] of [[Tanganyika]] place the placenta in a receptacle for two months to dry. Once dry, it is ground into flour from which a porridge is made.  The porridge is served to old women of the family as a way of preserving the child's life.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

In Central India, women of the [[Kol people|Kol]] Tribe eat placenta to aid reproductive function. It is believed that consumption of placenta by a childless woman "may dispel the influences that keep her barren".&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

The Kurtachi of the [[Solomon Islands]] mixed placenta into the mother's supply of powdered lime for chewing with the [[areca nut]].&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

=== Cultural and spiritual beliefs ===
Beliefs behind the practices of consuming the placenta, whether in part or in whole, commonly reflect acknowledgment for the vast work of this organ for the baby in utero, serving as its 'protector' and providing critical vital functions for the baby before birth. The placenta can be seen as the Tree of Life, as a genetic 'twin' to the fetus, an angel, and reasons for ingesting the placenta may reflect spiritual beliefs as much as the pragmatic ones listed above.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Traditional practices to revere and honor the placenta that do not include consumption may include placenta burial, such as in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/television/2011/08/horizon-months-placenta-during|title=Horizon: the Nine Months That Made You (BBC 2)|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that such traditions reflect human birthing practices wherein umbilical cords may not have been severed while the cord is still pulsing, avoiding blood loss and infection, and may include practices that retain the placental connection until after it has been delivered and the baby is already nursing.

==Modern placentophagy==
[[File:PlacentaSlice.jpg|thumb|A slice of placenta, being prepared for consumption.]]
Modern practice of placentophagy is rare, as most contemporary human cultures do not promote its consumption.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Placentophagy did receive popular culture attention in 2012, however, when American actress [[January Jones]] credited eating her placenta as helping her get back to work on the set of Mad Men after just six weeks.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = January Jones Eats Her Own Placenta|url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/03/26/mad-mom-january-jones-eats-her-own-placenta/|website = ABC News|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2011 CNN Hero of the Year [[Robin Lim]], midwife, founder of Yayasan Bumi Sehat birthing center and author, accounts for the medical use of eating a small portion of the placenta accompanied by some honey to successfully control [[Postpartum bleeding|postpartum hemorrhage]]. This technique has seemed to work successfully even after typical administration of herbs or pitocin only temporarily stopped bleeding.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;[[File:Ziheche.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dried human placenta as medicine - Ziheche (紫河车)]]

Instances of placentophagy have been recorded among certain modern cultures.  In the 1960s "male and female Vietnamese nurses and midwives of Chinese and Thai background consum[ed] the placentas of their young, healthy patients" for reasons unspecified, as reported by a [[Czechoslovakian]] medical officer in at the Hospital of Czechoslovak-Vietnamese Friendship in [[Haiphong]].&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Placentas were stripped of their membranous parts and fried with onions before being eaten.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

A more recent cross-cultural ethnographic study by researchers at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] surveyed 179 contemporary human societies, and identified only one culture ([[Chicano]], or Mexican-American) that mentioned the practice of maternal placentophagy.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; This account, centering on Chicano and Anglo midwifery in San Antonio, Texas, stated, "cooking and eating part of the placenta has…been reported by a couple of midwives. One Anglo mother ... was reported to have roasted the placenta."&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; This instance, however, may not be indicative of any larger cultural trends, as no other records of placentophagy were found in the Chicano culture.  This same study also recorded three references of non-maternal placentophagy:
*[[File:CookbookPlacentaBroccoli.jpg|left|thumb|Placenta prepared in a stir-fry with [[broccoli]]]]Traditional [[Gullah]] medicine dictates that when a baby is born with a [[caul]], with amniotic membranes over the face at birth, the placenta is made into a tea and then consumed by the child to "prevent them from seeing spirits that would otherwise haunt [them]".&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;
*Practice of paternal placentophagy was identified in the [[Malekula]] of Melanesia.  "In [[Espiritu Santo]], the new father [eats] a pudding made from the cooked placenta and blood."&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;
*Oral administration of the placenta was reported in [[Sino-Vietnamese (disambiguation)|Sino-Vietnamese]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2017}} medicine to aid the recovery of those suffering from [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

In a follow-up study, the UNLV researchers were joined by colleagues at the [[University of South Florida]], and surveyed women who had engaged in maternal placentophagy previously. Of the 189 placentophagic women surveyed, the researchers found that 95 percent of participants had "positive" or "very positive" subjective experiences from eating their own placenta, citing beliefs of "improved mood", "increased energy", and "improved lactation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.unlv.edu/article/steamed-dehydrated-or-raw-placentas-may-help-moms%E2%80%99-post-partum-health|publisher=UNLV News Center|title=Steamed, Dehydrated or Raw: Placentas May Help Moms' Post-Partum Health.

Recent examples of placentophagy in the popular media include [[Time Magazine]]’s "Afterbirth:  It’s What’s for Dinner",&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Stein |first=Joel |title=Afterbirth: It's What's For Dinner |date= 3 July 2009 |magazine=[[Time Magazine]] | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1908442,00.html |accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[USA Today]]’s "Ingesting the placenta: Is it healthy for new moms?"&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite news|last=Freiss |first= Steve |title=Ingesting the Placenta: Is It Healthy for New Moms? |work=[[USA Today]] |date= 19 July 2007 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-07-18-placenta-ingestion_N.htm |accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current beliefs among placentophagists==

===Nutritional benefits===

Despite placentophagy advocates' claims that the placenta provides an excellent source of dietary iron, and may therefore improve maternal postpartum iron status, a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study conducted by researchers at UNLV found that consuming a commonly recommended daily intake of encapsulated placenta (approximately 3,000&amp;nbsp;mg per day) only provides about one-quarter of the RDA for iron for lactating women. The study found no differences in maternal iron status over a three-week postpartum period between women consuming 3300&amp;nbsp;mg/day of cooked, encapsulated placenta, and study participants taking a placebo.&lt;ref name="nineteen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gryder |first=Laura |title=Effects of Human Maternal Placentophagy on Maternal Postpartum Iron-Status: A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Pilot Study |journal=Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health |volume=62 |issue=1 |year=2017 |pages=68–79 |doi= 10.1111/jmwh.12549|pmid=27809380 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The placenta transports nutrients to the fetus during gestation, as well as producing and regulating hormones and [[opioids]].&lt;ref name="apari-rozsa2006"&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Apari P, Rózsa L | title = Deal in the womb: fetal opiates, parent-offspring conflict, and the future of midwifery | journal = [[Medical Hypotheses]] | volume = 67| pages = 1189–1194| year = 2006 | url = http://www.zoologia.hu/list/apari_rozsa.pdf | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2006.03.053 | pmid = 16893611 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of modern placentophagy argue that the placenta retains some of these substances after delivery, and that consumption of the placenta by the mother will help her recover more quickly following childbirth by replenishing nutrients and hormones lost during parturition.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; One birthing website run by two Minnesota [[doulas]] lists possible health benefits including replenishing lost nutrients, increasing milk production, curbing [[postpartum depression]] and slowing [[postpartum hemorrhage]].&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite web |last=Biermeier |first=Sarah |title=The Placenta-an Unappreciated Organ |work=Geneabirth |url=http://www.geneabirth.com/placentasandplacentophagy.htm |accessdate=5 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111160106/http://www.geneabirth.com/placentasandplacentophagy.htm |archivedate=11 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientific study has found very limited and inconclusive evidence for any health benefits of placentophagy. A 2012 study by Michaelle Beacock out of Edge Hill University found that evidence to support midwives' and mothers' reported experiences of placentophagy is limited, dated, and ultimately inconclusive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A 2015 review of placentophagy research since 1950 again found limited and inconclusive evidence for placentophagy's health benefits, while also stating that its potential risks are yet unclear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to protein and various vitamins, placenta contains high levels of CRH ([[corticotropin-releasing hormone]]), known to reduce stress.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; {{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed; study mentioned on website cited is in re to CRH production during pregnancy, not evidence of placental nutritional value postpartum|date=September 2013}} Though CRH is normally secreted by the [[hypothalamus]], during pregnancy production of CRH by the placenta dramatically increases levels of CRH in the blood stream, which peak at delivery.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson |first=Murray |title=The Effects of Placental Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone on the Physiology and Psychology of the Pregnant Woman |journal=Current Women's Health Reviews |volume=4 |issue=4 |year=2008 |pages= 270–279 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cwhr/2008/00000004/00000004/art00007 |doi=10.2174/157340408786848197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even postpartum, the placenta still contains very high levels of CRH, and some believe eating it can bring the mother's CRH levels back to a healthy range.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; {{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed; study mentioned on website cited is in re to CRH production during pregnancy, not evidence of placental nutritional value postpartum|date=September 2013}}

Consumption of the placenta is also believed to cause the release of the chemical [[oxytocin]] in the brain.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed|date=September 2013}}  Oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions leading to the onset of labor, and after childbirth can also cause the uterus to contract and sooner reach its pre-pregnancy size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date=August 2013|volume=1832|issue=8|pages=1149–1158|doi=10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.04.006|pmid=23579073|last1=Sonne|first1=S.

B.|last9=Offermanns|first9=S.|last10=Ganapathy|first10=V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="three"/&gt;

==Preparation==

In many areas a placenta encapsulation specialists can be found to professionally prepare the placenta for consumption. Also, many online alternative health sources give instructions for preparing it personally.  One common method of preparation is [[:wikt:encapsulation|encapsulation]]. The encapsulation process can be one of two ways: steamed or raw. With the steamed encapsulation process, the placenta is gently steamed with various herbs (ginger, lemon, frankincense, myrrh, etc.), then fully dehydrated, ground into a fine powder, and put into capsules. The raw method does not involve steaming first. The placenta will be fully dehydrated, then ground and put into capsules. Other options for placenta consumption are tinctures and smoothies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dcplacentas.com|title=Life After Birth|website=Life After Birth Placenta Encapsulation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also meal recipes include lasagna, spaghetti, stew, and pizza.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt;

==Controversy==
Many researchers remain skeptical of whether the practice of placentophagy is of value to humans. A 2015 review of the last 64 years of placentophagy research found that while a minority of women in western countries perceive placentophagy as reducing the risk of postpartum depression and enhancing recovery, there is really no evidence that this is the case.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The same study also found inconclusive evidence that placentophagy was of any benefit to facilitating uterine contraction, resumption of normal cyclic estrogen cycle, and milk production. As well, the authors stated that the risks of placentophagy also warrant more investigation. A researcher who had previously researched why animals eat their placentas stated in 2007 that "people can believe what they want, but there’s no research to substantiate claims of human benefit. The cooking process will destroy all the protein and hormones.  Drying it out or freezing it would destroy other things."&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; Two recent studies by researchers from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, however, appear to be at odds with such claims. UNLV researchers found that some essential nutrients and steroid hormones remained in human placenta that was cooked and processed for encapsulation and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = SM | last2 = Gryder | first2 = L | last3 = David | first3 = W | last4 = Teng | first4 = Y | last5 = Gerstenberger | first5 = S | last6 = Benyshek | first6 = DC | year = 2016 | title = Human Placenta Processed for Encapsulation Contains Modest Concentrations of Fourteen Trace Minerals and Elements | url = | journal = Nutrition Research | volume = 36 | issue = 8| pages = 872–878 | doi=10.1016/j.nutres.2016.04.005| pmid = 27440542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 =  | last2 = Gryder | first2 = SM LK | last3 = Zava | first3 = D | last4 = Kimball | first4 = DW | last5 = Benyshek | first5 = DC | year = 2016 | title = Presence and Concentration of 17 Hormones in Human Placenta Processed for Encapsulation and Consumption | url = | journal = Placenta | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 86–89 | doi=10.1016/j.placenta.2016.05.005| pmid =  27324105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fee charged by encapsulation specialists for processing human placenta in a woman's home is typically $200 - $300.

Although human placentophagy entails the consumption of human tissue by a human or humans, its status as [[cannibalism]] is debated.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;[[Harriet A. Hall|Hall, Harriet]]. [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/eating-placentas-cannibalism-recycling-or-health-food/ Eating Placentas: Cannibalism, Recycling, or Health Food?] ''Science-Based Medicine'', March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson-Smyth&gt;Watson-Smyth, Kate. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/placenta-chef-accused-of-cannibalism-1140048.html Placenta chef accused of cannibalism]. ''[[The Independent]]'', 22 January 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks involved==

There is a risk of spreading blood-borne illness, only present in cases of non-maternal placentophagy, where the mother's blood is shared with another human.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; As a meat, proper storage and preparation procedures must be followed to prevent [[bacterial infection]] in the placenta. Researchers assert that the risks of placenta consumption still warrant further investigation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Hussaini Brahmin'''  is a [[Mohyal]] community with links to both [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]]. They are spread across Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan; Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi and other parts of India, and also in Arabia.

Among various legends about Hussaini Barahmin it is also described that a childless Dutt personally visited Hussain Ibn Ali and submitted his wish to have a child.  In response to his desire, he was informed that he had no child in his fate. Hearing that he cannot be a father of  son Dutt became senseless and broke down in crying with pain for grant of a child by [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Hussain]] with recommendations to God.  At this moment, Hussain pacified him saying he will have one soon.  Suddenly someone observing the event questioned Hussain stating that he had challenged the will  of Allah. Upon hearing this Imam told Dutt he will have one more child. This continued till Imam gave him good news of seven children.&lt;ref name="Zeba T Hashmi, Daily Times"&gt;{{cite web|author=Zeba T Hashmi |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/opinion/17-Mar-2015/ashura-and-pluralism |title=Ashura and pluralism |publisher=Daily Times, Pakistan |date=March 17, 2015 |accessdate=November 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117023612/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/opinion/17-Mar-2015/ashura-and-pluralism |archivedate=November 17, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abul Fazl in Kashmir Observer"&gt;{{cite web |author=Abul Fazl| url= http://www.kashmirobserver.net/news/features/brahmins-who-fought-imam-hussain-karbala| title= The Brahmins Who Fought For Imam Hussain At Karbala | publisher= Kashmir Observer Online| date=November 5, 2014|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussaini Brahmins used to live in [[Lahore]] till 1947 and after that date they migrated to other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sheik|first1=Majid|title=Karbala and how Lahore was involved|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/766877/karbala-and-how-lahore-was-involved|accessdate=22 January 2016|agency=Dawn News Paper, Lahore|publisher=Dawn|date=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ajmer]], [[Rajasthan]], a place of Sunni Muslim pilgrimage, where [[Moinuddin Chishti]] lived and passed his last days, there is even today a class of people who call themselves Hussaini Brahmins, who are neither orthodox Hindus nor orthodox Muslims. Hussaini Brahmins practiced a mixed blend of Hinduism and Islamic traditions. A popular saying in Hindi/Urdu language refers to the Hussaini Brahmans thus: "Wah Datt Sultan, Hindu ka dharm, Musalman ka Iman, Adha Hindu adha Musalman (Well Datt Sultan, declaring Hindu religion and following Muslim faith, Half Hindu and Half Muslman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitra |first1= Sisir Kumar |title=The Vision of India |publisher= Jaico Publishing House |location=Bombay, India |pages=229–230 (First Print 1949) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Virag Pachpore"&gt;{{cite news

The '''iceberg theory''' (sometimes known as the "'''theory of omission'''") is a style of [[writing]] (turned colloquialism) coined by American writer [[Ernest Hemingway]]. As a young journalist, Hemingway had to focus his newspaper reports on immediate events, with very little context or interpretation. When he became a writer of short stories, he retained this [[Minimalism|minimalistic]] style, focusing on surface elements without explicitly discussing underlying themes. Hemingway believed the deeper meaning of a story should not be evident on the surface, but should shine through implicitly.

== Background ==
Like other American writers such as  [[Mark Twain]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Willa Cather]], Hemingway worked as a journalist before becoming a novelist. After graduating from high school he went to work as a cub reporter for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'',&lt;ref name="Meyers p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he quickly learned that truth often lurks below the surface of a story.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1998 17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds|1998|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned about corruption in city politics, and that in hospital emergency rooms and police stations a mask of cynicism was worn "like armour to shield whatever vulnerabilities remained".&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1998 17"/&gt; In his pieces he wrote about relevant events, excluding the background. As foreign correspondent for the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', while living in Paris in the early 1920s,  he covered the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] in more than a dozen articles. As his biographer Jeffrey Meyers explains, "he objectively reported only the immediate events in order to achieve a concentration and intensity of focus—a spotlight rather than a stage".&lt;ref name="Meyers pp98-99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Greco-Turkish War he gained valuable writing experience that he translated to the writing of fiction. He believed fiction could be based on reality, but that if an experience were to be distilled, as he explained,  then "what he made up was truer than what he remembered".&lt;ref name="Meyers pp98-99"/&gt;

|style="text"-align: left;"|—Ernest Hemingway in ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]''&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in {{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

In 1923, Hemingway conceived of the idea of a new theory of writing after finishing his short story "Out of Season". In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'', his posthumously published memoirs about his years as a young writer in Paris, he explains: "I omitted the real end [of "Out of Season"] which was that the old man hanged himself. This was omitted on my new theory that you could omit anything&amp;nbsp;... and the omitted part would strengthen the story."&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;  In chapter sixteen of ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'' he compares his theory about writing to an iceberg.&lt;!-- expand and add quotation here --&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

Hemingway's biographer [[Carlos Baker]] believed that as a writer of short stories Hemingway learned "how to get the most from the least, how to prune language and avoid waste motion, how to multiply intensities, and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth."&lt;ref name ="Baker p117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|p= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker also notes that the writing style of the "iceberg theory" suggests that a story's narrative and nuanced complexities, complete with symbolism, operate under the surface of the story itself.&lt;ref name ="Baker p117"/&gt;

For example, Hemingway believed a writer could describe an action, such as Nick Adams fishing in "[[Big Two-Hearted River]]," while conveying a ''different'' message about the action itself—Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about the unpleasantness of his war experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|pp=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his essay "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway is clear about his method: "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit."&lt;ref name="HemingwaySS"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hemingway, The Art of the Short Story}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer explained how it brings a story ''gravitas'':

{{quote|Hemingway said that only the tip of the iceberg showed in fiction—your reader will see only what is above the water—but the knowledge that you have about your character that never makes it into the story acts as the bulk of the iceberg. And that is what gives your story weight and gravitas.|[[Jenna Blum]] in ''The Author at Work'', 2013&lt;ref name=JennaBlum8&gt;Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 9, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}, "... that is what gives your story weight and gravitas. ... "&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From reading [[Rudyard Kipling]] Hemingway absorbed the practice of shortening [[prose]] as much as it could take. Of the concept of omission, Hemingway wrote in "The Art of the Short Story": "You could omit anything if you knew that you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood."&lt;ref name="Meyers p114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making invisible the structure of the story, he believed the author strengthened the piece of fiction and that the "quality of a piece could be judged by the quality of the material the author eliminated."&lt;ref name="Meyers p114"/&gt; His style added to the aesthetic: using "declarative sentences and direct representations of the visible world" with simple and plain language, Hemingway became "the most influential prose stylist in the twentieth century" according to biographer Meyers.&lt;ref name="Meyers p114"/&gt;

In her paper "Hemingway's Camera Eye", Zoe Trodd explains that Hemingway uses repetition in prose to build a collage of snapshots to create an entire picture. Of his iceberg theory, she claims, it "is also a glacier waterfall, infused with movement by his multi-focal aesthetic".&lt;ref name="Trodd"&gt;{{Harvnb|Trodd|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, she believes that Hemingway's iceberg theory "demanded that the reader feel the ''whole'' story" and that the reader is meant to "fill the gaps left by his omissions with their feelings".&lt;ref name="Trodd"/&gt;

Hemingway scholar Jackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details to work as framing devices to write about life in general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out further with "what if" scenarios: "what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" By separating himself from the characters he created, Hemingway strengthens the drama. The means of achieving a strong drama is to minimize, or omit, the feelings that produced the fiction he wrote.&lt;ref name ="Benson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Benson|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway's iceberg theory highlights the symbolic implications of art. He makes use of physical action to provide an interpretation of the nature of man's existence. It can be convincingly proved that, "while representing human life through fictional forms, he has consistently set man against the background of his world and universe to examine the human situation from various points of view."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Early fiction and short stories ==
Gwendolyn Tetlow believes that Hemingway's early fiction such as "[[Indian Camp]]" shows his lack of concern for [[Character (arts)|character development]] by simply placing the character in his or her surroundings. However, in "Indian Camp" the use of descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound build a sense of veracity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetlow|pp=53–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, a story can communicate by [[subtext]]; for instance, Hemingway's "[[Hills Like White Elephants]]" does not mention the word "abortion", although in the story the male character seems to be attempting to convince his girlfriend to have an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Big Two-Hearted River" Hemingway explains "is about a boy ... coming home from the war ... So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war, is omitted."&lt;ref name="HemingwaySS"/&gt; Hemingway intentionally left out something in "Indian Camp" and "Big Two-Hearted River"—two stories he considered to be good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker explains that Hemingway's stories about sports are often about the athletes themselves and that the sport is incidental to the story. Moreover, the story "[[A Clean Well Lighted Place]]" which on the surface is about nothing more than men drinking in a cafe late at night, is in fact about that which brings the men to the cafe to drink, and the reasons they seek light in the night—none of which is available in the surface of the plot, but lurks in the iceberg below.&lt;ref name="Baker 1972 123–125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway's story "Big Two-Hearted River" is ostensibly about nothing, as is "A Clean Well Lighted Place", but within nothing lies the crux of the story.&lt;ref name="Baker 1972 123–125"/&gt;

== Novels ==
Benson believes that the omission Hemingway applies functions as a sort of buffer between himself as the creator of a character and the character. He explains that as an author creates a "distance" between himself and the character he "becomes more practiced, it would seem." Benson says in Hemingway's fiction the distance is necessary, and successful in early fiction such as in ''[[The Sun Also Rises]],'' but if he as "the author does not deliberately create such distance the fiction fails," as in the later works such as ''[[Across the River and into the Trees]]''.&lt;ref name ="Benson"/&gt;

Baker calls Hemingway's ''Across the River and into the Trees'' a "lyric-poetical novel" in which each scene has an underlying truth presented via [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].&lt;ref name= "Baker1972 pp274-255"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meyers an example of omission is that Renata, like other heroines in Hemingway's fiction, suffers a major "shock"—the murder of her father and the subsequent loss of her home—to which Hemingway alludes only briefly.&lt;ref name= "Meyers1985 p445"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway's pared down narrative forces the reader to solve connections. As Stoltzfus remarks: "Hemingway walks the reader to the bridge that he must cross alone without the narrator's help."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stoltzfus|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway believed that if context or background had been written about by another, and written about well, then it could be left out of his writing. Of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' he explains: "In writing you are limited to by what has already been done satisfactorily. So I have tried to do something else. First I have tried to eliminate everything unnecessary to conveying experience to the reader so that after he has read something it will become part of his experience and seem actually to have happened."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;qtd in {{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Smith, author of ''Hemingway's Early Manuscript: The Theory and Practice of Omission'', believes Hemingway applied the theory of omission in effort to "strengthen [the] iceberg".&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
In October 1954 Hemingway received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He jokingly told the press he believed [[Carl Sandburg]] and [[Isak Dinesen]] deserved the prize more than he, but that the prize money would be welcome.&lt;ref name="Baker p338"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972| p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was awarded to Hemingway "for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 |year=1954 |work= Nobelprize.org|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the announcement, Hemingway spoke with a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent, while on his boat fishing off the coast of Cuba. When asked about the use of symbolism in his work, and particularly in the most recently published ''Old Man and the Sea'', he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No good book has ever been written that has in it symbols arrived at beforehand and stuck in ... That kind of symbol sticks out like raisins in raisin bread. Raisin bread is all right, but plain bread is better. ... I tried to make a real old man, a real boy, a real sea, a real fish and real sharks. But if I made them good and true enough they would mean many things. The hardest thing is to make something really true and sometimes truer than true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935439-5,00.html|title= An American Storyteller |date=13 December 1954 |work= Time Magazine |publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Homicide}}

'''Infanticide''' (or '''infant homicide''') is the intentional killing of [[infant]]s.

Parental infanticide researchers have found that mothers are far more likely than fathers to be the perpetrators of [[neonaticide]]&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Neil S. Kaye M.D - Families, Murder, and Insanity: A Psychiatric Review of Paternal Neonaticide&lt;/ref&gt; and slightly more likely to commit infanticide in general.&lt;ref&gt;MARLENE L. DALLEY, Ph.D. The Killing of Canadian Children by Parent(s) or Guardian(s): Characteristics and Trends 1990-1993, January 1997 &amp; 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Laila Williamson notes that "Infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by people on every level of cultural complexity, from hunter gatherers to high civilizations, including our own ancestors. Rather than being an exception, then, it has been the rule."&lt;ref name="InfAnAn"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Williamson  | first = Laila  | contribution = Infanticide: an anthropological analysis  | editor-last = Kohl  | editor-first = Marvin  | title = Infanticide and the Value of Life  | volume =  | pages = 61–75  | publisher = [[Prometheus Books]]  | place = NY  | year = 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}}

In many past societies, certain forms of infanticide were considered permissible.

==History==
[[File:InfanticidioGarciaVega.jpg|thumb|''Infanticidio'' by Mexican artist [[Antonio García Vega]].]]
The practice of infanticide has taken many forms over time. [[Child sacrifice]] to supernatural figures or forces, such as that believed to have been practiced in ancient [[Carthage]], may be only the most notorious example in the [[ancient world]]. 

A frequent method of infanticide in ancient Europe and Asia was simply to [[child abandonment|abandon the infant]], leaving it to die by exposure (i.e. [[hypothermia]], hunger, thirst, or animal attack).&lt;ref name = "Justin Martyr"&gt;[[Justin Martyr]], ''[[First Apology]].''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ex&amp;Ob"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Boswell| first = John Eastburn| authorlink = John Boswell| title =  Exposition and oblation: the abandonment of children and the ancient and medieval family  | jstor = 1855916| journal= [[American Historical Review]]| volume = 89  | pages = 10–33  | year = 1984| doi =  10.2307/1855916  | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In at least one island in [[Oceania]], infanticide was carried out until the 20th century by suffocating the infant,&lt;ref name="Collapse"&gt;[[Jared Diamond|Diamond, Jared]] (2005). ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''. {{ISBN|0-14-303655-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and in the [[Inca Empire]] it was carried out by sacrifice (see below).

===Paleolithic and Neolithic===
Many Neolithic groups routinely resorted to infanticide in order to control their numbers so that their lands could support them. [[Joseph Birdsell]] believed that infanticide rates in [[prehistory|prehistoric times]] were between 15% and 50% of the total number of births,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Birdsell  | first = Joseph, B.  | contribution = Some predictions for the Pleistocene based on equilibrium systems among recent hunter gatherers  | editor-last = Lee  | editor-first = Richard &amp; Irven DeVore  | title = Man the Hunter  | volume =  | pages = 239  | publisher =Aldine Publishing Co.  | place =  | year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while Laila Williamson estimated a lower rate ranging from 15% to 20%.&lt;ref name="InfAnAn"/&gt;{{rp|66}} Both [[anthropologist]]s believed that these high rates of infanticide persisted until the development of agriculture during the [[Neolithic Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Hardness" /&gt;{{rp|19}} Comparative anthropologists have calculated that 50% of female newborn babies were killed by their parents during the [[Paleolithic]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Hoffer|first = Peter| authorlink = Peter Hoffer|author2=N.E.H.

{{Main|Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures}}

[[Archaeologist]]s have uncovered physical evidence of [[child sacrifice]] at several locations.&lt;ref name="Hardness"/&gt;{{rp|16–22}} Some of the best attested examples are the diverse rites which were part of the religious practices in [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Inca Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Reinhard  | first = Johan  | authorlink =Johan Reinhard|author2=Maria Stenzel  | title = A 6,700 metros niños incas sacrificados quedaron congelados en el tiempo  | journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]  | pages = 36–55  |date=November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exn.ca/mummies/story.asp?id=1999041452 |title=Discovery Channel: The mystery of Inca child sacrifice |publisher=Exn.ca |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = de Sahagún  | first = Bernardino | authorlink = Bernardino de Sahagún  | title = ''Florentine Codex: History of the Things of New Spain''| publisher = University of Utah Press| date = 1950–1982  | location = Utah  | pages =  | url =  | doi =  | title-link = Florentine Codex }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the Old World====
Three thousand bones of young children, with evidence of sacrificial rituals, have been found in [[Sardinia]].  [[Pelasgians]] offered a sacrifice of every tenth child during difficult times. [[Syrians]] sacrificed children to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]. Many remains of children have been found in [[Gezer]] excavations with signs of sacrifice. Child skeletons with the marks of sacrifice have been found also in [[Egypt]] dating 950–720 BCE.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In [[Carthage]] "[child] sacrifice in the ancient world reached its infamous zenith".{{attribution needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="Hardness" /&gt;{{rp|324}} Besides the Carthaginians, other [[Phoenicians]], and the [[Canaanites]], [[Moabites]] and [[Sepharvite]]s offered their first-born as a sacrifice to their gods.

=====Ancient Egypt=====
In Egyptian households, at all social levels, children of both sexes were valued and there is no evidence of infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;''Egypt and the Egyptians'', Emily Teeter, p. 97, Cambridge University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0521449847}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of the [[Ancient Egyptian Religion|Ancient Egyptians]] forbade infanticide and during the [[Greco-Roman]] period they rescued abandoned babies from manure heaps, a common method of infanticide by Greeks or Romans, and were allowed to either adopt them as foundlings or raise them as slaves, often giving them names such as "copro -" to memorialise their rescue.&lt;ref&gt;"''Eroticism and Infanticide at Ashkelon"'', Lawrence E. Stager, Biblical Archaeology Review, July/August 1991&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] considered it a peculiarity of the Egyptians that every child must be reared.&lt;ref&gt;''Folkways: A Study of Mores, Manners, Customs and Morals'', [[William Graham Sumner]], p. 318, org pub 1906, Cosmo 2007, {{ISBN|9781602067585}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus]] indicates infanticide was a punishable offence.&lt;ref&gt;''Life in Ancient Egypt'', [[Adolf Erman]],  Translated by H. M. Tirard, p. 141, org pub 1894, republished Kessinger  2003, {{ISBN|0-7661-7660-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt was heavily dependent on the annual flooding of the Nile to irrigate the land and in years of low inundation severe famine could occur with breakdowns in social order resulting, notably between 930–1070 AD and 1180–1350 AD. Instances of cannibalism are recorded during these periods but it is unknown if this happened during the pharaonic era of Ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Egypt'', David P. Silverman, p. 13, Oxford University Press US, 2003, {{ISBN|0-19-521952-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrix Midant-Reynes describes human sacrifice as having occurred at Abydos in the early dynastic period (c. 3150–2850 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt'', Ian Shaw, p. 54, Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-280293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jan Assmann]] asserts there is no clear evidence of human sacrifice ever happening in Ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;''Of God and Gods'', Jan Assmann, p. 32, University of Wisconsin Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-299-22554-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Carthage=====
&lt;!--

Before making any edits regarding the alleged practice of child sacrifice, please read the archived discussion at [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]]. We have been around this block several times before.

Please refrain from entering text that comes down conclusively on the question of whether or not child sacrifice was, in fact, practiced in Carthage. This question has been the subject of long and heated debate among editors of this article and has occasioned edit warring, semi-protection, etc.

The current consensus is that nobody knows for sure and that we should simply report both sides of the question without asserting which one is right. Any departure from this stance is likely to get edited out fairly quickly.

Parts of this section may be canted towards the assertion that child sacrifice ''was'' practiced in Carthage. It is reasonable to put in qualifying text that asserts that the details of the child sacrifice are based on accounts which may not be altogether reliable.

We are in the process of looking for sources for these details so that the descriptions can be based on [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].

See [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]] for details of past debate on this topic.

{{Main|Religion in Carthage#Child sacrifice|l1=Carthaginian religion - Child Sacrifice Question}}

According to Shelby Brown, [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]s, descendants of the [[Phoenicia]]ns, sacrificed infants to their gods.&lt;ref name="Brown 1991"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brown | first = Shelby | title = Late Carthaginian Child Sacrifice and Sacrificial Monuments in their Mediterranean Context| publisher = Sheffield Academic Press| year = 1991| location = Sheffield | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charred bones of hundreds of infants have been found in Carthaginian archaeological sites. One such area harbored as many as 20,000 burial [[urn]]s.&lt;ref name="Brown 1991"/&gt;  Skeptics suggest that the bodies of children found in Carthaginian and Phoenician cemeteries were merely the cremated remains of children that died naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Ribichini, "Beliefs and Religious Life" in Moscati, Sabatino (ed), ''The Phoenicians'', 1988, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] (c. 46–120 [[Common Era|AD]]) mentions the practice, as do [[Tertullian]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], Diodorus Siculus and [[Philo]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] also mentions what appears to be child sacrifice practiced at a place called the [[Tophet]] (from the Hebrew ''taph'' or ''toph'', to burn) by the [[Canaan]]ites. Writing in the 3rd century BCE, [[Kleitarchos]], one of the historians of [[Alexander the Great]], described that the infants rolled into the flaming pit. [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote that babies were roasted to death inside the burning pit of the god [[Baal#Ba'al of Carthage|Baal Hamon]], a bronze statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brown  | first = Shelby  | title = Late Carthaginian Child Sacrifice and Sacrificial Monuments in their Mediterranean Context| publisher = Sheffield Academic Press| year = 1991| location = Sheffield | pages = 22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stager| first = Lawrence| authorlink = Lawrence Stager|author2=Samuel R.

=====Greece and Rome=====
[[File:Eugène Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 031.jpg|thumb|[[Medea]] killing her sons, by [[Eugène Ferdinand Victor Delacroix]] (1862).]]

The historical Greeks considered the practice of adult and child sacrifice [[Barbarian|barbarous]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Hughes|first = Dennis D.|title = Human Sacrifice in Ancient Greece | publisher = Routledge|year = 1991|location = |page = 187|url =| isbn=978-0-415-03483-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the exposure of newborns was widely practiced in [[ancient Greece]], it was even advocated by Aristotle in the case of congenital deformity — "As to the exposure of children, let there be a law that no deformed child shall live.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aristotle (384–322 bc): philosopher and scientist of ancient Greece| pmc=2672651 | pmid=16371395|doi=10.1136/adc.2005.074534|volume=91| issue=1 |year=2006|pages=F75–7 | author = Dunn PM| journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece the decision to expose a child was typically the father's, although in Sparta the decision was made by a group of elders.&lt;ref&gt;See Plutarch's ''Life of Lycurgus''.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure was the preferred method of disposal, as that act in itself was not considered to be murder; moreover, the exposed child technically had a chance of being rescued by the gods or any passersby.&lt;ref&gt;See (e.g.) Budin 2004, 122-23.&lt;/ref&gt; This very situation was a recurring motif in [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Infant exposure]]&lt;/ref&gt;
To notify the neighbors of a birth of a child, a woolen strip was hung over the front door to indicate a female baby and an olive branch to indicate a boy had been born. Families did not always keep their new child. After a woman had a baby, she would show it to her husband. If the husband accepted it, it would live, but if he refused it, it would die. Babies would often be rejected if they were illegitimate, unhealthy or deformed, the wrong sex, or too great a burden on the family. These babies would not be directly killed, but put in a clay pot or jar and deserted outside the front door or on the roadway. In ancient Greek religion, this practice took the responsibility away from the parents because the child would die of natural causes, for example hunger, asphyxiation or exposure to the elements.

The practice was prevalent in [[ancient Rome]], as well. [[Philo]] was the first philosopher to speak out against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Philo| authorlink = Philo| title =  The Special Laws| publisher =  [[Harvard University Press]]| year =  1950| location =  Cambridge| pages =  III, XX.117, Volume VII, pp. 118, 551, 549| url =| doi= | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter from a Roman citizen to his sister, or a pregnant wife from her husband,&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;q=letter+pregnant|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating from 1 BC, demonstrates the casual nature with which infanticide was often viewed:

In some periods of [[Roman history]] it was traditional for a newborn to be brought to the ''[[pater familias]]'', the family [[Patriarchy|patriarch]], who would then decide whether the child was to be kept and raised, or left to die by exposure.&lt;ref name=Crossan&gt;John Crossan, ''The Essential Jesus: Original Sayings and Earliest Images'', p. 151 (Castle, 1994, 1998).  {{ISBN|978-1-55635-833-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Twelve Tables]] of [[Roman law]] obliged him to put to death a child that was visibly deformed.  The concurrent practices of [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slavery]] and infanticide contributed to the "background noise" of the [[Crisis of the Roman Republic#Institution of Slavery|crises during the Republic]].&lt;ref name=Crossan /&gt;

Infanticide became a [[capital offense]] in Roman law in 374 [[Common Era|AD]], but offenders were rarely if ever prosecuted.&lt;ref name="SXR"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Radbill  | first = Samuel X.  | contribution = A history of child abuse and infanticide  | editor-last = Steinmetz  | editor-first = Suzanne K. and [[Murray A.

According to mythology, [[Romulus and Remus]], twin infant sons of the war god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], survived near-infanticide after being tossed into the Tiber River. According to the myth, they were raised by wolves, and later founded the city of Rome.

=====Judaism=====
Judaism prohibits infanticide, and has for some time, dating back to at least early [[Common Era]].  Roman historians wrote about the ideas and customs of other peoples, which often diverged from their own. [[Tacitus]] recorded that the Jews "regard it as a crime to kill any late-born children".&lt;ref name="Histories"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Tacitus| authorlink = Tacitus| title =  The Histories| publisher =  William Heinemann| year =  1931| location =  London|  pages=  Volume II, 183|url =  | doi=    | nopp = true  | title-link = The Histories (Tacitus)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]], whose works give an important insight into 1st-century Judaism, wrote that God "forbids women to cause abortion of what is begotten, or to destroy it afterward".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Josephus| authorlink = Josephus| title =  The Works of Flavius Josephus, "Against Apion"| publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]| year =  1976| location =  Cambridge| pages =  II.25, p. 597| url =  | doi=     }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pagan European tribes=====
In his book ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', [[Tacitus]] wrote that the ancient [[Germanic tribes]] enforced a similar prohibition. He found such mores remarkable and commented: ''"[The Germani] hold it shameful to kill any unwanted child."'' Modern scholarship differs. [[John Boswell]] believed that in ancient Germanic tribes unwanted children were exposed, usually in the forest.&lt;ref name="KofS"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Boswell| first = John| authorlink = John Boswell| title =  The Kindness of Strangers| publisher = Vintage Books| year =  1988| location =  NY| pages =  | url =| doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|218}} "It was the custom of the [Teutonic] pagans, that if they wanted to kill a son or daughter, they would be killed before they had been given any food."&lt;ref name="KofS"/&gt;{{rp|211}} Usually children born out of wedlock were disposed that way.

In his highly influential ''Pre-historic Times'', [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] described burnt bones indicating the practice of child sacrifice in pagan Britain.&lt;ref name="Pre-historic Times"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lubbock| first = John| authorlink = John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury| title =  Pre-historic Times, as Illustrated by Ancient Remains, and the Manners and Customs of Modern Savages| publisher =  Williams and Norgate | year =  1865| location =  London| page =  176| url =  | doi=     | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last canto, ''Marjatan poika'' (Son of Marjatta), of Finnish [[national epic]] [[Kalevala]] describes an assumed infanticide. [[Väinämöinen]] orders the infant [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]] son of Marjatta to be drowned in [[marsh]].

The [[Íslendingabók]], a main source for the early history of [[Iceland]], recounts that on the [[Íslendingabók#7. Conversion of Iceland to Christianity|Conversion of Iceland to Christianity]] in 1000 it was provided – in order to make the transition more palatable to Pagans – that "the old laws allowing exposure of newborn children will remain in force".
However, this provision – like other concessions made at the time to the Pagans – was abolished some years later.

===Christianity===
[[Christianity]] rejects infanticide. The ''Teachings of the [[Apostles]]'' or ''[[Didache]]'' said "thou shalt not kill a child by [[abortion]], neither shalt thou slay it when born".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last =Robinson  | first =Charles (translator)  | title =The Didache  | pages =76  | publisher =David Nutt   | place =Oxford | year =1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]'' stated an identical command, both thus conflating abortion and infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]'', xix.5d.&lt;/ref&gt; Apologists [[Tertullian]], [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], [[Minucius Felix]], [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Lactantius]] also maintained that exposing a baby to death was a wicked act.&lt;ref name="Justin Martyr"/&gt; In 318 [[AD]], [[Constantine I]] considered infanticide a crime, and in 374 [[AD]], [[Valentinian I]] mandated the rearing of all children (exposing babies, especially girls, was still common). The [[Council of Constantinople (1094)|Council of Constantinople]] declared that infanticide was homicide, and in 589 [[AD]], the [[Third Council of Toledo]] took measures against the custom of killing their own children.&lt;ref name="SXR"/&gt;

====Middle Ages====
Whereas theologians and clerics preached sparing their lives, newborn abandonment continued as registered in both the literature record and in legal documents.&lt;ref name="Ex&amp;Ob"/&gt;{{rp|16}} According to [[William L. Langer]], exposure in the [[Middle Ages]] "was practiced on gigantic scale with absolute impunity, noticed by writers with most frigid indifference".&lt;ref name="InfHisSu"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Langer| first = William L.| authorlink = William L. Langer|title = Infanticide: a historical survey| journal = History of Childhood Quarterly| volume = 1  | pages = 353–366  | year = 1974  | pmid = 11614564  | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|355–356}} At the end of the 12th century, notes [[Richard Trexler]], Roman women threw their newborns into the [[Tiber river]] in daylight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Trexler| first = Richard| authorlink = Richard Trexler|title = Infanticide in Florence: new sources and first results| journal = History of Childhood Quarterly| volume = 1  | page = 99  | year = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it also conjectured that the notion of "rampant" infanticide is a myth pushed by modern historians inferring from lack of particular records, and "there is absolutely no evidence to support such carnage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/medieval-child-surviving-infancy-1789124|title=Surviving Infancy in the Middle Ages|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other European regions, in the Middle Ages the German mother had the right to expose the newborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Westrup| first = C.W.| title =  Introduction to Roman Law| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| year = 1944| location =  London| page = 249| url =  | doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gotland]], [[Sweden]], children were also sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Turville-Petre|first = Gabriel | authorlink = Gabriel Turville-Petre| title =Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia | publisher = Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston|year = 1964|location =NY |page = 253|url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the High Middle Ages, abandoning unwanted children finally eclipsed infanticide.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Unwanted children were left at the door of church or abbey, and the clergy was assumed to take care of their upbringing. This practice also gave rise to the first [[orphanage]]s.

However, very high sex ratios were common in even late medieval Europe, which may indicate sex-selective infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Cox Russell, 1958, ''Late Ancient and Medieval Population,'' pp. 13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabia===
Some Muslim sources allege that [[pre-Islamic Arabia]]n society practiced infanticide as a form of "post-partum birth control".&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], ''Children''&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''waʾd'' was used to describe the practice.&lt;ref name="EoQ-Infanticide"&gt;Donna Lee Bowen, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an, Infanticide&lt;/ref&gt; These sources state that infanticide was practiced either out of destitution (thus practiced on males and females alike), or as "disappointment and fear of social disgrace felt by a father upon the birth of a daughter".&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt;

Some authors believe that there is little evidence that infanticide was prevalent in pre-Islamic [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] or early [[Muslim history]], except for the case of the [[Banu Tamim|Tamim tribe]], who practiced it during severe famine according to Islamic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Lammens|first = Henri| title = Islam.

Other passages condemning infanticide in the Qur'an appear in LXXXI:8-9, XVI:60-62, XVII:42 and XLII:48.&lt;/ref&gt;
Together with [[polytheism]] and [[homicide]], infanticide is regarded as a grave sin (see {{cite quran|6|151|style=nosup|expand=no}} and {{cite quran|60|12|style=nosup|expand=no}}).&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt; Infanticide is also implicitly denounced in the story of Pharaoh's slaughter of the male children of Israelites (see  {{cite quran|2|49|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|7|127|style=nosup|expand=no}};   {{cite quran|7|141|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|14|6|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|28|4|style=nosup|expand=no}} ;{{cite quran|40|25|style=nosup|expand=no}}).&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt;

Infanticide may have been practiced as human sacrifice, as part of the [[pagan]] cult of [[Perun]]. [[Ibn Fadlan]] describes sacrificial practices at the time of his trip to Kiev Rus (present day Ukraine) in 921–922, and describes an incident of a woman voluntarily sacrificing her life as part of a [[funeral rite]] for a prominent leader, but makes no mention of infanticide. The [[Primary Chronicle]], one of the most important literary sources before the 12th&amp;nbsp;century, indicates that human sacrifice to idols may have been introduced by [[Vladimir the Great]] in 980. The same Vladimir the Great formally converted Kiev Rus into [[Christianity]] just 8&amp;nbsp;years later, but pagan cults continued to be practiced clandestinely in remote areas as late as the 13th&amp;nbsp;century.

In [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]], babies were killed and thrown to the dogs.&lt;ref name="StAnHist"/&gt;{{Rp|105}} American explorer [[George Kennan (explorer)|George Kennan]] noted that among the [[Koryaks]], a [[Mongoloid]] people of north-eastern [[Siberia]], infanticide was still common in the nineteenth century.

=== United Kingdom ===
Infanticide (as a crime) gained both popular and bureaucratic significance in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Great Britain|Britain]]. By the [[Mid-19th century|mid 19th century]], in the context of criminal lunacy and the [[Insanity defense|insanity defence]], killing one's own child(ren) attracted ferocious debate, as the role of women in society was defined by motherhood, and it was thought that any woman who murdered her own child was by definition insane and could not be held responsible for her actions. Several cases were subsequently highlighted during the [[Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864–66|Royal Commission on Capital Punishment (1864-66)]], as a particular felony where an effective avoidance of the [[Death penalty in the UK|death penalty]] had informally begun.

The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|New Poor Law Act of 1834]] ended [[English Poor Laws|parish relief]] for unmarried mothers and allowed fathers of illegitimate children to avoid paying for "child support".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1989-0/haller.htm|title=Bastardy and Baby Farming in Victorian England|last=Haller|first=Dorothy L.|date=|website=Loyola University New Orleans|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unmarried mothers then received little assistance and the poor were left with the option either entering the [[workhouse]], prostitution, infanticide or abortion. By the middle of the century infanticide was common for social reasons, such as illegitimacy, and the introduction of [[child life insurance]] additionally encouraged some women to kill their children for gain. Examples are [[Mary Ann Cotton]], who murdered many of her 15 children as well as 3 husbands, [[Margaret Waters]], the 'Brixton Baby Farmer', a professional [[Baby farming|baby-farmer]] who was found guilty of infanticide in 1870, Jessie King hanged in 1889, [[Amelia Dyer]], the 'Angel Maker', who murdered over 400 babies in her care, and [[Ada Williams (baby farmer)|Ada Chard-Williams]], a baby farmer who was later hanged at Newgate prison.

The Times reported that 67 infants were murdered in London in 1861 and 150 more recorded as "found dead", many of which were found on the streets. Another 250 were suffocated, half of them not recorded as accidental deaths. The report noted that "infancy in London has to creep into life in the midst of foes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS135043741&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=Infanticide in London|last=|first=|date=29 April 1862|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|page=8|via=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording a birth as a [[Stillbirth|still-birth]] was also another way of concealing infanticide because still-births did not need to be registered until 1926 and they did not need to be buried in public cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002148/18950201/084/0006|title=Trafficking in Babies.

There are a large number of cases of what are called newly-born children, which are found all over England, more especially in London and large towns, abandoned in streets, rivers, on commons, and so on." He continued "a great deal of that crime is due to what are called lying-in houses, which are not registered, or under the supervision of that sort, where the people who act as midwives constantly, as soon as the child is born, either  drop it into a pail of water or smother it with a damp cloth. It is a very common thing,  also, to find that they bash their heads on the floor and break their skulls."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secret Commissions: An Anthology of Victorian Investigative Journalism|last=Donovan|first=Stephen|last2=Rubery|first2=Matthew|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2012|isbn=9781551113302|location=Peterborough, Ontario|pages=232–269|chapter=Herbert Cadett.

The last British woman to be executed for infanticide of her own child was [[Rebecca Smith (infanticide)|Rebecca Smith]], who was hanged in Wiltshire in 1849.

The [[Infant Life Protection Act 1897|Infant Life Protection Act of 1897]] required local authorities to be notified within 48 hours of changes in custody or the death of children under seven years. Under the [[Children Act 1908|Children’s Act of 1908]] "no infant could be kept in a home that was so unfit and so overcrowded as to endanger its health, and no infant could be kept by an unfit nurse who threatened, by neglect or abuse, its proper care and maintenance."

Short of execution, the harshest penalties were imposed on practitioners of infanticide by the legal codes of the Qin dynasty and Han dynasty of ancient China.&lt;ref name="Makeham2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Makeham|title=China: The World's Oldest Living Civilization Revealed|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TQ4NAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=oldest+living+civilization+revealed&amp;q=child|year=2008|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-25142-3|pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infanticide was known in China as early as the 3rd century BC, and, by the time of the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279 AD), it was widespread in some provinces. [[Buddhist]] belief in transmigration allowed poor residents of the country to kill their newborn children if they felt unable to care for them, hoping that they would be reborn in better circumstances. Furthermore, some Chinese did not consider newborn children fully "human", and saw "life" beginning at some point after the sixth month after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fate and fortune in rural China: social organization and population behavior in Liaoning, 1774–1873|authors=James Z. Lee, Cameron D. Campbell|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary writers from the Song dynasty note that, in [[Hubei]] and [[Fujian]] provinces, residents would only keep three sons and two daughters (among poor farmers, two sons and one daughter), and kill all babies beyond that number at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drowning girls in China: female infanticide since 1650|author=David E. Mungello|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the sex of the child was only one factor to consider. By the time of the Ming Dynasty, however (1368–1644), male infanticide was becoming increasingly uncommon. The prevalence of female infanticide remained high much longer. The magnitude of this practice is subject to some dispute; however, one commonly quoted estimate is that, by late [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]], between one fifth and one quarter of all newborn girls, across the entire social spectrum, were victims of infanticide. If one includes excess mortality among female children under 10 (ascribed to gender-differential neglect), the share of victims rises to one third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drowning daughters: A cultural history of female infanticide in late nineteenth century China|author=Michelle Tien King}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fate and fortune in rural China: social organization and population behavior in Liaoning, 1774-1873|authors=James Z.

Meanwhile, much has been gained. Whereas the effort to argue parents into leaving a child at once and the difficulty of winning the frightened child are enormous. The Chinese infant usually has a pretty good start in life.

====Japan====

Since feudal [[Japan]] the common slang for infanticide was ''"mabiki"'' (間引き) which means to pull plants from an overcrowded garden. A typical method in Japan was smothering through wet paper on the baby's mouth and nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00000433-198607020-00004 | last = Shiono| first = Hiroshi| authorlink = |author2=Atoyo Maya |author3=Noriko Tabata |author4=Masataka Fujiwara |author5=Jun-ich Azumi |author6=Mashahiko Morita| title =  Medicolegal aspects of infanticide in Hokkaido District, Japan| journal =  American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 104–6| year = 1986| url = | pmid = 3740005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became common as a method of population control.

[[Female infanticide]] of newborn girls was systematic in feudatory [[Rajputs]] in [[South Asia]] for [[illegitimate]] female children during the Middle Ages. According to [[Firishta]], as soon as the illegitimate female child was born she was held "in one hand, and a knife in the other, that any person who wanted a wife might take her now, otherwise she was immediately put to death".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Westermarck| first = Edward| authorlink = Edward Westermarck| title =  A Short History of Marriage| publisher =  Humanities Press| year =  1968| location =  NY| pages =  Vol. III, 162| url = | doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of female infanticide was also common among the Kutch, Kehtri, Nagar, Bengal, Miazed, Kalowries in [[India]] inhabitants, and also among the [[Sindh]] in [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Panigrahi| first = Lalita |title =  British Social Policy and Female Infanticidein India| publisher =  Munshiram Manoharlal| year =  1972| location = New Delhi| page = 18| url = | doi=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===

In some [[Africa]]n societies some neonates were killed because of beliefs in evil omens or because they were considered unlucky. Twins were usually put to death in Arebo; as well as by the [[Nama people]] of [[South West Africa]]; in the [[Lake Victoria|Lake Victoria Nyanza]] region; by the [[Tswana people|Tswana]] in [[Portuguese East Africa]]; in some parts of [[Igboland]], [[Nigeria]] twins were sometimes abandoned in a forest at birth (as depicted in ''[[Things Fall Apart]]''), oftentimes one twin was killed or hidden by midwives of wealthier mothers; and by the [[!Kung people]] of the [[Kalahari Desert]].&lt;ref name="Hardness"/&gt;{{rp|160–161}} The [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], [[Kenya]]'s most populous ethnic group, practiced ritual killing of twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = LeVine  | first = Sarah and Robert LeVine  | contribution = Child abuse and neglect in Sub-Saharan Africa  | editor-last = Korbin  | editor-first = Jill  | title = Child Abuse and Neglect  | volume =  | pages = 39  | publisher = [[University of California Press]]  | place = Berkeley  | year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infanticide is rooted in the old traditions and beliefs prevailing all over the country. A survey conducted by [[Disability Rights International]] found that 45% women interviewed by them in Kenya were pressured to kill their children born with disabilities. The pressure being much higher in the rural areas, with every second mother being forced out of three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45670750|title=Infanticide in Kenya: 'I was told to kill my disabled baby'|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Literature suggests infanticide may have occurred reasonably commonly among Indigenous Australians, in all areas of Australia prior to European settlement.  Infanticide may have continued to occur quite often up until the 1960s.  An 1866 issue of ''The Australian News for Home Readers'' informed readers that "the crime of infanticide is so prevalent amongst the natives that it is rare to see an infant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My First Born|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63170296|accessdate=13 April 2013|location=Victoria, Australia|date=20 January 1866|page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Susanna de Vries]] in 2007 told a newspaper that her accounts of Aboriginal violence, including infanticide, were censored by publishers in the 1980s and 1990s.  She told reporters that the censorship "stemmed from guilt over the stolen children question".&lt;ref name="Aboriginalviolence'Sanitised'2007"&gt;{{cite news|title=Aboriginal violence was 'sanitised'|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/aboriginal-violence-was-sanitised/story-e6frg6nf-1111113906387|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=13 April 2013|author=Justine Ferrari|date=7 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Keith Windschuttle]] weighed in on the conversation, saying this type of censorship started in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Aboriginalviolence'Sanitised'2007" /&gt;  In the same article [[Louis Nowra]] suggested that infanticide in customary Aboriginal law may have been because it was difficult to keep an abundant number of Aboriginal children alive; there were life-and-death decisions modern-day Australians no longer have to face.&lt;ref name="Aboriginalviolence'Sanitised'2007" /&gt;

====South Australia and Victoria====
According to [[William D. Rubinstein]], "Nineteenth-century European observers of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] life in South Australia and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] reported that about 30% of Aboriginal infants were killed at birth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Rubinstein | first = W.

[[James Dawson (activist)|James Dawson]] wrote a passage about infanticide among Indigenous people in the western district of Victoria, which stated that "Twins are as common among them as among Europeans; but as food is occasionally very scarce, and a large family troublesome to move about, it is lawful and customary to destroy the weakest twin child, irrespective of sex.
It is usual also to destroy those which are malformed."&lt;ref name=VictorianAboriginalInfanticide&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Aborigines: The Languages and Customs of Several Tribes of Aborigines in the Western District of Victoria, Australia|publisher=George Robertson (reissued by Cambridge University Press, 2009; {{ISBN|978-1-108-00655-2}})|author=James Dawson|year=1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote "When a woman has children too rapidly for the convenience and necessities of the parents, she makes up her mind to let one be killed, and consults with her husband which it is to be. As the strength of a tribe depends more on males than females, the girls are generally sacrificed.
The child is put to death and buried, or burned without ceremony; not, however, by its father or mother, but by relatives. No one wears mourning for it.
Sickly children are never killed on account of their bad health, and are allowed to die naturally."&lt;ref name=VictorianAboriginalInfanticide /&gt;

====Western Australia====
In 1937, a reverend in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] offered a "baby bonus" to Aboriginal families as a deterrent against infanticide and to increase the birthrate of the local Indigenous population.&lt;ref name=RevLoveBabyBonus&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron-Roofed Cottage as Baby Bonus|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article85590904|publisher=The Daily News|accessdate=13 April 2013|location=Perth, Western Australia|date=11 March 1937 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australian Capital Territory====
A [[Canberra]]n journalist in 1927 wrote of the "cheapness of life" to the Aboriginal people local to the Canberra area 100&amp;nbsp;years before.  "If drought or bush fires had devastated the country and curtailed food supplies, babies got short shift. Ailing babies, too would not be kept" he wrote.&lt;ref name=CanberraBlacks1927&gt;{{cite web|title=Canberra Blacks.

====New South Wales====
A bishop wrote in 1928 that it was common for Aboriginal Australians to restrict the size of their tribal groups, including by infanticide, so that the food resources of the tribal area may be sufficient for them.&lt;ref name=AustraliaSMH1928&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aboriginal.

====Northern Territory====
Annette Hamilton, a professor of anthropology at [[Macquarie University]] who carried out research in the Aboriginal community of Maningrida in Arnhem Land during the 1960s wrote that prior to that time part-European babies born to Aboriginal mothers had not been allowed to live, and that 'mixed-unions are frowned on by men and women alike as a matter of principle'.&lt;ref name=Australia1999Brunton&gt;{{cite web|title=Moral Dilemma Not Merely A Question of Black and White|url=http://www.ipa.org.au/news/682/moral-dilemma-not-merely-a-question-of-black-and-white/pg/8|publisher=Courier Mail|accessdate=13 April 2013|author=Ron Brunton|date=13 March 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522000520/http://www.ipa.org.au/news/682/moral-dilemma-not-merely-a-question-of-black-and-white/pg/8|archive-date=22 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inuit====
There is no agreement about the actual estimates of the frequency of newborn female infanticide in the [[Inuit]] population. [[Carmel Schrire]] mentions diverse studies ranging from 15–50% to 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Schrire  | first = Carmel  | authorlink = Carmel Schrire  |author2=William Lee Steiger  | title = A matter of life and death: an investigation into the practice of female infanticide in the Arctic  | journal = Man  | volume = 9  | issue = 2  | page = 162  | year = 1974  | doi=10.2307/2800072| jstor = 2800072  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008 it was reported that in Agibu and Amosa villages of Gimi region of [[Eastern Highlands (Papua New Guinea)|Eastern Highlands]] province of [[Papua New Guinea]] where tribal fighting in the region of Gimi has been going on since 1986 (many of the clashes arising over claims of [[Witchcraft|sorcery]]) women had agreed that if they stopped producing males, allowing only female babies to survive, their tribe's stock of boys would go down and there would be no men in the future to fight. They agreed to have all newborn male babies killed. It is not known how many male babies were killed by being smothered, but it had reportedly happened to all males over a 10-year period and probably was still happening.

===England and Wales===

In England and Wales there were typically 30 to 50 homicides per million children less than 1 year old   between 1982 and 1996.&lt;ref name=Marks2009&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Psychiatry | doi = 10.1016/j.mppsy.2008.10.017 | title = Infanticide | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–12 | author = Maureen Marks | url = http://www.psychiatryjournal.co.uk/article/S1476-1793(08)00217-6/abstract| year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The younger the infant, the higher the risk.&lt;ref name=Marks2009 /&gt;  The rate for children 1 to 5 years was around 10 per million children.&lt;ref name=Marks2009 /&gt;  The homicide rate of infants less than 1 year is significantly higher than for the general population.&lt;ref name=Marks2009 /&gt; 

In [[English law]] infanticide is established as a distinct offence by the [[Infanticide Act]]s.

==Modern proposals==
In a 2012 article in the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]'', a philosopher and a bioethicist jointly proposed that infanticide be legalized, calling it "after-birth abortion", and claiming that both "the fetus and the newborn are potential persons". Many replies were published to this article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alberto Giubilini1,2, Francesca Minerva3 |url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/03/01/medethics-2011-100411.full |title=After-birth abortion: why should the baby live? - Giubilini and Minerva - Journal of Medical Ethics |publisher=Jme.bmj.com |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child euthanasia===
{{Main|Child euthanasia}}
[[Euthanasia]] applied to children that are gravely ill or that suffer from significant birth defects is legal in the [[Netherlands]] under rigidly controlled conditions, but controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Groningen Protocol — Euthanasia in Severely Ill Newborns| doi=10.1056/NEJMp058026 | volume=352|issue = 10|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|pages=959–962|pmid=15758003|date=March 2005|vauthors=Verhagen E, Sauer PJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have compared child euthanasia to infanticide.

==Explanations for the practice==

There are various reasons for infanticide.  Neonaticide typically has different patterns and causes than for killing of older infants. Traditional neonaticide is often related to economic necessity - inability to provide for the infant.

In the United Kingdom and the United States, older infants are typically killed for reasons related to [[child abuse]], [[domestic violence]] or [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name=Marks2009/&gt; For infants older than one day, younger infants are more at risk, and boys are more at risk than girls.&lt;ref name=Marks2009/&gt;  Risk factors for the parent include: Family history of violence, violence in current relationship, history of abuse or neglect of children, and personality disorder and/or depression.&lt;ref name=Marks2009/&gt;

===Religious===
In the late seventeenth and early  eighteenth centuries, "loopholes" were invented by those who wanted to avoid the damnation that was promised by most Christian doctrine as a penalty of suicide. One famous example of someone who wished to end their life but avoid the eternity in hell was [[Christina Johansdotter]] (died 1740).  She was a Swedish murderer who killed a child in Stockholm with the sole purpose of being executed.  She is an example of those who seek suicide through execution by committing a murder.  It was a common act, frequently targeting young children or infants as they were believed to be free from sin, thus going straight to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Jeffrey Rodgers (2004) From Sin to Insanity: Suicide in Early Modern Europe. Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, Lieut. F. Elton reported that Ugi beach people in the [[Solomon Islands]] killed their infants at birth by burying them, and women were also said to practice abortion. They reported that it was too much trouble to raise a child, and instead preferred to buy one from the bush people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Elton| first = Lieut. F.| title =  Notes  on Natives of the Solomon Islands | journal =  The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland| volume = 17| issue = | pages = 90–99| year = 1988| jstor =2841588| doi =  10.2307/2841588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
Many historians believe the reason to be primarily economic, with more children born than the family is prepared to support.  In societies that are [[patrilineal]] and [[patrilocal]], the family may choose to allow more sons to live and kill some daughters, as the former will support their birth family until they die, whereas the latter will leave economically and geographically to join their husband's family, possibly only after the payment of a burdensome [[dowry]] price.  Thus the decision to bring up a boy is more economically rewarding to the parents.&lt;ref name="Hardness"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Milner  | first = Larry S.  | title = Hardness of Heart / Hardness of Life: The Stain of Human Infanticide  | publisher = University Press of America  | location =  Lanham/New York/Oxford| year = 2000| url =  | doi =   |isbn=978-0-7618-1578-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|362–368}} However, this does not explain why infanticide would occur equally among rich and poor, nor why it would be as frequent during decadent periods of the [[Roman Empire]] as during earlier, less affluent, periods.&lt;ref name="Hardness"/&gt;{{rp|28–34, 187–192}}

Before the appearance of effective [[contraception]], infanticide was a common occurrence in ancient brothels. Unlike usual infanticide - where historically girls have been more likely to be killed - prostitutes in certain areas preferred to kill their male offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14401305 ''Roman dead baby 'brothel' mystery deepens''], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

====UK 18th and 19th century====
Instances of infanticide in Britain in 18th and 19th&amp;nbsp;centuries is often attributed to the economic position of the women, with juries committing [[Jury nullification|“pious perjury”]] in many subsequent murder cases. The knowledge of the difficulties  faced in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century by those women who attempted to keep their children can be seen as reason for juries to show compassion. If the woman chose to keep the child, society was not set up to ease the pressure placed upon the woman, legally, socially or economically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McLynn |first=Frank |title=Crime and Punishment in 18th&amp;nbsp;Century England |publisher=Routledge |location=London, UK |year=1989 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-18th century Britain there was assistance available for women who were not able to raise their children. The [[Foundling Hospital]] opened in 1756 and was able to take in some of the illegitimate children. However, the conditions within the hospital caused [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] to withdraw funding and the governors to live off of their own incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Foundling Hospital and Neighbourhood |journal=Old and New London Journal |volume=5 |year=1878 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a stringent entrance policy, with the committee requiring that the hospital:

:Will not receive a child that is more than a year old, nor the child of a domestic servant, nor any child whose father can be compelled to maintain it.&lt;ref name="unknown 1878"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Foundling Hospital and Neighbourhood |journal=Old and New London Journal |volume=5 |year=1878  |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a mother had admitted her child to the hospital, the hospital did all it could to ensure that the parent and child were not re-united.&lt;ref name="unknown 1878"/&gt;

MacFarlane argues in ''Illegitimacy and Illegitimates in Britain'' (1980) that English society greatly concerned itself with the burden that a bastard child places upon its communities and had gone to some lengths to ensure that the father of the child is identified in order to maintain its well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacFarlane |first=Alan |title=Illegitimacy and Illegitimates in English History |page=75 |publisher=Arnold |year=1980 |work=Bastardy and its Comparative History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistance could be gained through maintenance payments from the father, however, this was capped "at a miserable 2&amp;nbsp;[[shilling|s]] and 6&amp;nbsp;[[pence|d]] a week".&lt;ref name="Rose 1986 28"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose  |first=Lionel |title=Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800–1939 |page=28 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan |location=London, UK |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the father fell behind with the payments he could only be asked "to pay a maximum of 13&amp;nbsp;weeks arrears".&lt;ref name="Rose 1986 28"/&gt;

Despite the accusations of some that women were getting a free hand-out there is evidence that many women were far from receiving adequate assistance from their parish. "Within Leeds in 1822 ... relief was limited to 1&amp;nbsp;[[shilling|s]] per week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Lionel |title=Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800–1939 |page=25 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan |location=London, UK |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield required women to enter the [[workhouse]], whereas Halifax gave no relief to the women who required it. The prospect of entering the workhouse was certainly something to be avoided. Lionel Rose quotes Dr&amp;nbsp;[[Joseph Rogers (physician)|Joseph Rogers]] in ''Massacre of the Innocents ...'' (1986). Rogers, who was employed by a London workhouse in 1856 stated that conditions in the nursery were ‘wretchedly damp and miserable ... [and] ... overcrowded with young mothers and their infants’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Lionel |title=Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800–1939 |pages=31–33 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan |location=London, UK |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of social standing for a servant girl was a particular problem in respect of producing a bastard child as they relied upon a good character reference in order to maintain their job and more importantly, to get a new or better job. In a large number of trials for the crime of infanticide, it is the servant girl that stood accused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McLynn |first=Frank  |title=Crime and Punishment in 18th Century England |publisher=Routledge |location=London, UK |year=1989 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disadvantage of being a servant girl is that they had to live to the social standards of their superiors or risk dismissal and no references. Whereas within other professions, such as in the factory, the relationship between employer and employee was much more anonymous and the mother would be better able to make other provisions, such as employing a minder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Lionel |title=Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800–1939 |page=19 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan |location=London, UK |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the lack of basic social care in Britain in the 18th and 19th&amp;nbsp;century is the numerous accounts in court records of women, particularly servant girls, standing trial for the murder of their child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hitchcock |first1=Tim |last2=Shoemaker |first2=Robert |url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org |title=The Proceedings of the Old Bailey |publisher=University of Sheffield and University of Hertfordshire |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may have been no specific offence of infanticide in England before about 1623 because infanticide was a matter for the  by [[ecclesiastical court]]s, possibly because [[infant mortality]] from natural causes was high (about 15% or one in six).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Urban disease and mortality in nineteenth-century England |author1=Woods, R. |author2=Woodward, J. |publisher=Batsford |location=London |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-7134-3707-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter the accusation of the suppression of bastard children by lewd mothers was a crime incurring the presumption of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The history of infanticide in England |first=Alan |last=MacFarlane |year=2002 |accessdate=2012-11-07 |url=http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/savage/A-INFANT.PDF |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Infanticide Act]]s are several [[English Law|laws]]. That of 1922 made the killing of an infant child by its mother during the early months of life as a lesser crime than murder. The acts of 1938 and 1939 abolished the earlier act, but introduced the idea that [[postpartum depression]] was legally to be regarded as a form of [[diminished responsibility]].

===Population control===
[[Marvin Harris]] estimated that among [[Paleolithic]] hunters 23–50% of newborn children were killed.  He argued that the goal was to preserve the 0.001% population growth of that time.&lt;ref name="Cannibals&amp;Kings"/&gt;{{RP|15}}  He also wrote that female infanticide may be a form of [[population control]].&lt;ref name="Cannibals&amp;Kings"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Harris  | first = Marvin  | authorlink = Marvin Harris  | title = Cannibals and Kings: The Origins of Cultures  | publisher = Random House  | year = 1977   | location = NY  | url =  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|5}}  Population control is achieved not only by limiting the number of potential mothers; increased fighting among men for access to relatively scarce wives would also lead to a decline in population.

===Psychological===

====Evolutionary psychology====
[[Evolutionary psychology]] has proposed several theories for different forms of infanticide. Infanticide by stepfathers, as well as child abuse in general by stepfathers, has been explained by spending resources on not genetically related children reducing  [[reproductive success]] (See the [[Cinderella effect]] and  [[Infanticide (zoology)]]). Infanticide is one of the few forms of violence more often done by women than men. Cross-cultural research has found that this is more likely to occur when the child has deformities or illnesses as well as when there are lacking resources due to factors such as poverty, other children requiring resources, and no male support. Such a child may have a low chance of reproductive success in which case it would decrease the mother's [[inclusive fitness]], in particular since women generally have a greater [[parental investment]] than men, to spend resources on the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Liddle | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Shackelford | first2 = T. K. | last3 = Weekes–Shackelford | first3 = V. A. | title = Why can't we all just get along?

===="Early infanticidal childrearing"====
A minority of academics subscribe to an alternate school of thought, considering the practice as "[[early infanticidal childrearing]]".&lt;ref name="EMOL"&gt;{{Cite book| last = deMause  | first = Lloyd  | authorlink = Lloyd deMause | title = The Emotional Life of Nations  | publisher = Karnak  | year = 2002  | location = NY, London  | pages = 258–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|246–247}} They attribute parental infanticidal wishes to massive [[projection (psychology)|projection]] or [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] of the parents' [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] onto the child, because of intergenerational, ancestral abuse by their own parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Godwin   | first = Robert W.  | title = One cosmos under God  | publisher = Paragon House  | year = 2004  | location = Minnesota  | pages = 124–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, an infanticidal parent may have multiple motivations, conflicts, emotions, and thoughts about their baby and their relationship with their baby, which are often colored both by their individual psychology, current relational context and attachment history, and, perhaps most saliently, their psychopathology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Almeida A, Merminod G, Schechter DS | year = 2009 | title = Mothers with severe psychiatric illness and their newborns:  a hospital-based model of perinatal consultation | url = | journal = Journal of ZERO-TO-THREE: National Center for Infants, Toddlers, and Families | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 40–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also Psychiatric section below) Almeida, Merminod, and Schechter suggest that parents with fantasies, projections, and delusions involving infanticide need to be taken seriously and assessed carefully, whenever possible, by an interdisciplinary team that includes infant mental health specialists or mental health practitioners who have experience in working with parents, children, and families.

====Wider effects====
In addition to debates over the morality of infanticide itself, there is some debate over the effects of infanticide on surviving children, and the effects of childrearing in societies that also sanction infanticide. Some argue that the practice of infanticide in any widespread form causes enormous psychological damage in children.&lt;ref name="EMOL"/&gt;{{rp|261–262}} Conversely, studying societies that practice infanticide [[Géza Róheim]] reported that even infanticidal mothers in [[New Guinea]], who ate a child, did not affect the personality development of the surviving children; that "these are good mothers who eat their own children".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Róheim| first = Géza| authorlink = Géza Róheim| title =  Psychoanalysis and Anthropology| publisher = International Universities Press | year = 1950 | location = NY | pages =  60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris and Divale's work on the relationship between female infanticide and warfare suggests that there are, however, extensive negative effects.

===Psychiatric===
{{see also|Psychiatric disorders of childbirth}}

[[Postpartum psychosis]] is also a causative factor of infanticide. Stuart S. Asch, MD, a Professor of Psychiatry at [[Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University|Cornell University]] established the connections between some cases of infanticide and post-partum depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Crib deaths: their possible relationship to post-partum depression and infanticide|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=5239550 | volume=35 |issue=3 |journal=J Mt Sinai Hosp N Y |pages=214–20 | author = Asch SS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Postpartum reactions: some unrecognized variations|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=4857893 | doi=10.1176/ajp.131.8.870 |volume=131 |issue=8 |journal=Am J Psychiatry |pages=870–4 |vauthors=Asch SS, Rubin LJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The books, ''From Cradle to Grave'',&lt;ref&gt;Egginton, Joyce.

In addition, severe [[postpartum depression]] can lead to infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Perspect Public Health| year = 2009 | volume = 129 | number = 5 | pages = 221–7 | title = Postnatal depression: a global public health perspective | author = Almond P. | doi=10.1177/1757913909343882| pmid = 19788165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex selection===
&lt;!-- Female infanticide redirects here --&gt;
[[Sex selection]] may be one of the contributing factors of infanticide. In the absence of [[sex-selective abortion]], sex-selective infanticide{{Dead link|date=August 2013}} can be deduced from very skewed birth statistics. The biologically normal [[sex ratio for humans]] at birth is approximately 105 males per 100 females; normal ratios hardly ranging beyond 102–108.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barclay |first=George W. |title=Techniques of Population Analysis |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1958n|location=New York, NY |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a society has an infant male to female ratio which is [[statistical significance|significantly]] higher or lower than the biological norm, and biased data can be ruled out, sex selection can usually be inferred.&lt;ref&gt;This is a major issue in [[classical demography|ancient]] and [[medieval demography]] Josiah Cox (1958) notes evidence of sex-selective infanticide in the Roman world and very high sex ratios in the medieval world. See: {{cite book |first=Josiah Cox |last=Russell |year=1958 |title=Late Ancient and Medieval Population |pages=13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current law==

===Australia===
In [[New South Wales (Australia)|New South Wales]], infanticide is defined in Section 22A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|22A}} Infanticide; see also {{cite AustLII|NSWSC|1755|2014|litigants=R v MB (No. 2) |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Where a woman by any willful act or omission causes the death of her child, being a child under the age of twelve months, but at the time of the act or omission the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child, then, notwithstanding that the circumstances were such that but for this section the offence would have amounted to murder, she shall be guilty of infanticide, and may for such offence be dealt with and punished as if she had been guilty of the offence of manslaughter of such child.}}

Because Infanticide is punishable as manslaughter, as per s24,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|24}} Manslaughter--punishment.&lt;/ref&gt; the maximum penalty for this offence is therefore 25 years imprisonment.

===India===
Infanticide is illegal in India, but rarely enforced in the rural parts of India. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Canada===
In Canada, a mother commits infanticide, a lesser offence than homicide, if she killed her child while "not fully recovered from the effects of giving birth to the child and by reason thereof or of the effect of lactation consequent on the birth of the child her mind is then disturbed".&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']], [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-124.html#docCont RSC 1985, c C-46, s 233].&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
In [[England and Wales]], the [[Infanticide Act 1938]] describes the offence of infanticide as one which would otherwise amount to murder (by his/her mother) if the victim was older than 12 months and the mother was not suffering from an imbalance of mind due to the effects of childbirth or lactation. Where a mother who has killed such an infant has been charged with murder rather than infanticide s.1(3) of the Act confirms that a jury has the power to find alternative verdicts of [[manslaughter|Manslaughter in English law]] or guilty but insane.

===Romania===
Article 200 of the [[Penal Code of Romania#The Penal Code of 2014|Penal Code of Romania]] stipulates that the killing of a newborn during the first 24 hours, by the mother who is in a state of mental distress, shall be punished with imprisonment of one to five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avocatura.com/ll491-noul-cod-penal.html|title=Noul Cod Penal (2014)|website=avocatura.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Romanian Penal Code also defined infanticide (''pruncucidere'') as a distinct criminal offence, providing for a punishment of two to seven years imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legeaz.net/cod-penal-actualizat-2011/art-177-cpen|title=Art. 177 Cod penal Pruncuciderea Omuciderea INFRACŢIUNI CONTRA VIEŢII, INTEGRITĂŢII CORPORALE ŞI SĂNĂTĂŢII|website=legeaz.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizing the fact that a mother's judgment may be impaired immediately after birth, but did not define the term "infant", and this had led to debates regarding the precise moment when infanticide becomes homicide. This issue was resolved by the new Penal Code, which came into force in 2014.

===United States===
In 2009, [[Texas]] state representative [[Jessica Farrar]] proposed legislation that would define infanticide as a distinct and lesser crime than [[homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/032209dnmetinfanticide.3030173.html Proposed Texas House bill would recognize postpartum psychosis as a defense for moms who kill infants] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417132305/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/032209dnmetinfanticide.3030173.html |date=April 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the proposed legislation, if jurors concluded that a mother's "judgment was impaired as a result of the effects of giving birth or the effects of lactation following the birth", they would be allowed to convict her of the crime of infanticide, rather than murder.&lt;ref name="When Infanticide Isn't Murder"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/when-infanticide-isnt-mur_b_279703.html |title=When Infanticide Isn't Murder |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2013-07-18 |date=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty for infanticide would be two years in prison.&lt;ref name="When Infanticide Isn't Murder"/&gt; Farrar's introduction of this bill prompted liberal bioethics scholar [[Jacob M. Appel]] to call her "the bravest politician in America".&lt;ref name="When Infanticide Isn't Murder"/&gt;

==Prevention==

Since infanticide, especially neonaticide, is often a response to an unwanted birth,&lt;ref name=Marks2009/&gt; preventing [[unwanted pregnancies]] through improved [[sex education]] and increased [[birth control|contraceptive]] access are advocated as ways of preventing infanticide.&lt;ref name=Friedman2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman SH, Resnick PJ |title=Neonaticide: Phenomenology and considerations for prevention |journal=Int J Law Psychiatry |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=43–7 |year=2009 |pmid=19064290 |doi=10.1016/j.ijlp.2008.11.006 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased use of contraceptives and access to safe legal abortions&lt;ref name="Hardness" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Paul/&gt;{{rp|122–123}} have greatly reduced neonaticide in many developed nations.  Some say that where abortion is illegal, as in Pakistan, infanticide would decline if safer legal abortions were available.&lt;ref name =tribune /&gt;

Screening for psychiatric disorders or risk factors, and providing treatment or assistance to those at risk may help prevent infanticide.&lt;ref name=FriedmanDepress&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman SH, Resnick PJ |title=Postpartum depression: an update |journal=Women's Health (Lond Engl) |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=287–95 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19392614 |doi=10.2217/whe.09.3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in developed world significant proportions of neonaticides that are detected occur in young women who deny their pregnancy, and avoid outside contacts, so they may have limited contact with health care services.&lt;ref name=Marks2009/&gt;

In some areas [[baby hatch]]es or ''safe surrender sites'', safe places for a mother to anonymously leave an infant, are offered, in part to reduce the rate of infanticide.  In other places, like the United States, [[safe-haven law]]s allow mothers to anonymously give infants to designated officials; they are frequently located at hospitals and police and fire stations.  Typically such babies are put up for adoption, or cared for in orphanages.

Granting women employment raises their status and autonomy. Having a [[gainful employment]] can raise the perceived worth of females. This can lead to an increase in the number of women getting an education and a decrease in the number of female infanticide. As a result, the [[infant mortality]] rate will decrease and economic development will increase.&lt;ref name="Fuse"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuse|first=K|author2=Crenshaw, E.M|title=Gender imbalance in infant mortality: A cross-national study of social structure and female infanticide|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2006|volume=62|issue=2|pages=360–374|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.06.006|pmid=16046041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
[[File:Mones.jpg|thumb|Infanticide occurs in other animals, such as in [[Hanuman langur]]s.]]

{{Main|Infanticide (zoology)}}
Although human infanticide has been widely studied, the practice has been observed in many other species of the [[animal]] kingdom since it was first seriously studied by [[:jp:杉山幸丸|Yukimaru Sugiyama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sugiyama Y | year = 1965 | title = On the social change of Hanuman langurs (''Presbytis entellus'') in their natural conditions | url = | journal = Primates | volume = 6 | issue = 3–4| pages = 381–417 | doi=10.1007/bf01730356}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include from microscopic [[rotifer]]s and [[insect]]s, to [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, including primates such as [[chacma baboon]]s.&lt;ref name="Hoogland"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hoogland J.

According to studies carried out by [[Kyoto University]] in non-human primates, including certain types of gorillas and chimpanzees, several conditions favor the tendency to infanticide in some species (to be performed only by males), among them are: Nocturnal live, the absence of nest construction, the marked sexual dimorphism in which the male is much larger than the female, the mating in a specific season and the high period of lactation without resumption of the estrus state in the female.

[[Image:Beetle collection.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Beetle]] collection at the [[Melbourne Museum]], Australia]]
'''Insect collecting''' refers to the collection of [[insect]]s and other [[arthropod]]s for scientific study or as a [[hobby]]. Because most insects are small and the majority cannot be identified without the examination of minute morphological characters, [[entomologist]]s often make and maintain insect collections. Very large collections are conserved in [[natural history museum]]s or [[University|universities]] where they are maintained and studied by specialists. Many college courses require students to form small collections. There are also amateur entomologists and collectors who keep collections.

Historically, insect collecting has been widespread and was in the [[Victorian age]] a very popular educational [[hobby]]. Insect collecting has left traces in European [[cultural history]], literature and songs (e.g., [[Georges Brassens]]'s ''La chasse aux papillons'' (''The Hunt for Butterflies'')). The practice is still widespread in many countries, and is particularly common among [[Japan]]ese youths.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Collecting techniques==
{{details|Insect trap}}
[[Image:Robinson trap.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Moth trap|Robinson light trap]] for collecting moths]]
Insects are passively caught using [[Tullgren funnel|funnels]], [[pitfall trap]]s, [[Bottle trap for insects|bottle traps]], [[Malaise Trap|malaise traps]], [[flight interception trap]]s and other passive types of [[insect trap]]s, some of which are baited with small bits of sweet foods (such as honey). Different designs of ultraviolet light traps such as the [[Robinson trap]] are also used by entomologists for collecting nocturnal insects (especially moths) during faunistic survey studies. Aspirators or "[[pooter]]s" suck up insects too small or delicate to handle with fingers.&lt;ref name=" Martin, J.E.H. 1977 " &gt;Martin, J.E.H. 1977.

[[Image:Little Haven Nature Reserve, sweep-netting - geograph.org.uk - 1581841.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sweep netting for grassland insects]]
Several different types of nets are commonly used to actively collect insects. [[Butterfly net|Aerial insect nets]] are used to collect flying insects. The bag of a butterfly net is generally constructed from a lightweight mesh to minimize damage to delicate [[butterfly]] wings. A [[sweep net]] is used to collect insects from grass and brush. It is similar to a butterfly net, except that the bag is generally constructed from more rugged material.The sweep net is swept back and forth through vegetation quickly turning the opening from side to side and following a shallow figure eight pattern. The collector walks forward while sweeping, and the net is moved through plants and grasses with force.This requires a heavy net fabric such as sailcloth to prevent tearing, although light nets can be used if swept less vigorously. Sweeping continues for some distance and then the net is flipped over, with the bag hanging over the rim, trapping the insects until they can be removed with a pooter. Other types of nets used for collecting insects include [[beating net]]s and aquatic nets.&lt;ref name="Charles"&gt;[[Charles Valentine Riley]], 1892 ''Directions for collecting and preserving insects'' Bulletin (United States National Museum) no. 39, pt. F. Washington,Govt. Printing Off. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/20176  Full text online here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leaf litter sieve]]s are used by [[Coleoptera|coleopterists]] and to collect larvae.

Once collected, a [[killing jar]] is used to kill required insects before they damage themselves trying to escape. However, killing jars are generally only used on hard-bodied insects.  Soft-bodied insects, such as those in the [[larvae|larval]] stage, are generally [[Fixation (histology)|fixed]] in a vial containing an [[ethanol]] and water solution.&lt;ref name ="Hongfu, Zhu, 1949" &gt;Hongfu, Zhu, 1949 ''How to know the immature insects; an illustrated key for identifying the orders and families of many of the immature insects with suggestions for collecting, rearing and studying them, by H.

==Storage and curation==
{{details|Entomological equipment for mounting and storage}}
[[Image:MuseumfürNaturkundeInsectPreparation (2).jpg|thumb|left|Equipment for preparation]]
The usual method of display is in a glass-covered box, with the insects mounted on specially made non corrosive [[Entomological equipment for mounting and storage|insect pins]] stuck into suitable foam plastic or paper covered cork at the bottom of the box. Common [[pin]]s are not used. Very small insects may be pinned on "minuten" (very tiny headless pins) stuck into a block of foam plastic on a standard insect pin. Alternatively they may be glued onto a small piece of card on the pin. There are specific procedures for proper mounting that are used to show off the insects' essential characteristics. Techniques and equipment may be varied to deal with various species or requirements. For example, one or both of the wings of a [[beetle]] or [[grasshopper]] can be pulled open and fanned out to show the wing structure that otherwise would be hidden. At least the date and place of capture should be written or computer printed onto a piece of paper or card transfixed by the pin. This is called a data label.&lt;ref name="Uys &amp; Urban"&gt;V.M.

[[Image:Insect Safari - beetle 36.jpg|thumb|200px|Part of a beetle collection. The insects are transfixed by entomological pins which allow handling and which also pierce the data label]]

Rare insects, or those from distant parts of the world, may also be acquired from dealers or by trading. Some noted insect collections have been sold at [[auction]].&lt;ref name ="Murray S.

[[File:Visitbamiyan.JPG|thumb|VisitBamiyan was created in August 2009 to market [[Bamiyan]] to the rest of the world.]]

'''International tourism advertising''' is [[tourism]]-related marketing on the part of a private or public entity directed towards audiences abroad, and might target potential travelers and non-travelers alike.  Wholly private firms such as travel agencies, hotel chains, cruise agencies, [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations (NGOs)]] often run their own advertising campaigns to market their existence, mission, or services and/or goods offered to the consumer, and these advertisements seldom carry intentional political messages.

On the other hand, advertising distributed by governments themselves, such as through tourism ministries or government-owned private sector enterprises, is sometimes intended to convey more than simply the value of the product, service, or experience; governments can use tourism ads as a channel for communicating directly to the public of other countries because tourism is a common and internationally encouraged industry and the advertising of it is subject to minimal content regulation.

As the global travel market continues to expand with yearly increasing flights among international destinations, advertising efforts on the part of the major actors in this market are also increasing. [[Advertising]] campaigns to promote travel to destinations abroad are particularly prevalent in western countries where the general public's expenditures on tourism tend to be consistently high, even in light of the [[Late-2000s recession|economic recession]]. 

Many advertisers, which include both private entities and foreign governments themselves, share the intended goal of increasing their own revenue by popularizing their service (e.g., airline or hotel chain) or destination to boost receipts from travelers; however, some travel campaigns have additional or alternative purposes, such as promoting good public sentiments or improving existing ones towards them among the target audience.  Sometimes, states may use the branding of a product or service, itself, as a means of conveying a specific message without explicitly stating the message; this tactic is often used to soften the implied message itself, thus allowing the brander to sidestep or minimize controversy and/or opposition.

==Types==
Tourism advertising can take many forms, utilize a wide array of advertising tactics, and be driven by a scope of private or public intents. ''Destination advertising'' is designed to make a location itself seem more appealing, while ''travel services advertising'' seeks to gain an audience's buy-in for the tourism-related service or product. Below are some instances of international tourism advertising overlapping with states' political, economic, and/or social interests.

===Destination advertising===
A great degree of ads promoting foreign countries are produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often serve as [[Public diplomacy|vehicles for political statements and/or depictions]] of the destination country's desired foreign public perception(s).  Following are only a few of the many examples of government-produced tourism destination advertising that also serve political or social functions.

====Bahamas====
The Bahamas are commonly considered to be a focal point of leisure and recreational travel in the Caribbean and the island nation advertises itself as such.  Television ads and website produced by the government of the Bahamas specifically foster the image of the islands providing a care-free, exciting, culturally rich, and even romantic experience for travelers; a recent slogan for the marketing campaign was "It's better in the Bahamas" to reinforce the contrast between the desired perception as a low-stress getaway and the hectic nature of whatever living environment tourists would be leaving behind.  The Bahamas have, however, actually traditionally seen high violent crime rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahamasb2b.com/news/2010/11/pm-addresses-issue-of-rising-violent-crime-4224.html|title=PM Addresses Issue Of Rising Violent Crime|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the tourism marketing attempts to focus the audience's attention on the azure water and beaches and draw it away from any negative elements of life there.  [[Perception management|Managing perceptions]] is a common part of advertising of many consumer products and services, focusing the audience's mind solely on the desirable aspects of whatever is being sold and away from any possible drawbacks or consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahamas.com/ |title=Official tourism website of the Bahamas |publisher=Bahamas.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
The common impression of [[India]] in the West has long been either negative—including perceptions of widespread poverty, lack of sophisticated hygiene, and violent ethnic and religious clashes—or ambivalent, so the Indian government's Ministry of Tourism began a marketing campaign, "Incredible !ndia," to emphasize the country's rich culture, historic sites, tourist attractions, and general sense of excitement and dynamism to western audiences.  Tourism is an extremely lucrative and growing global industry so it is no surprise that India, a developing nation, is striving to capitalize on that market to boost its economy.  In addition, India is also looking to strengthen its international security and diplomatic ties while broadening and deepening its trade relationships, especially with the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/itp/us-india.asp |title=U.S.-India Trade Relations, U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service, 4 August 2010 |publisher=Fas.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; so it is in India's interest to promote a positive light for itself among the American and western voting populations in order to garner future international support and aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incredibleindia.org/index.html |title=Indian Ministry of Tourism's official advertising website |publisher=Incredibleindia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kazakhstan====
After the 2006 release of the [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] comedy ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan|Borat]]'', which depicts a politically incorrect and socially oblivious fictional Kazakhi reporter who travels throughout the United States interviewing and meeting Americans from various walks of life, the government of [[Kazakhstan]] was highly offended by the depiction of its less than two-decade-old country and [[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan#Criticism by Kazakhstan|criticized the film]] and its creator as being defamatory and slanderous.  The issue of preserving Kazakhstan's public image in light of the movie was of such high importance that Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] had it listed as a main issue when he traveled to the U.S. in September 2006 to meet with then-President [[George W. Bush]].  Coupled with Nazarbeyev's visit, according to Kazakhstan embassy spokesman Roman Vassilenko, the Kazakh government staged a large-scale public relations "blitz," including "running four-page ads in The New York Times and U.S. News and World Report and commercials on CNN and the local ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6276973 |title=Kazakhstan Embassy Responds to Borat, 16 October 2006 |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as launching TV ads to promote tourism to Kazakhstan.  These travel ads specifically featured cultural and historical features of the country as well as views of its developed infrastructure, specifically to counter the type of impression given by the Borat character to the West that Kazakhstan is socially and physically underdeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kazakhembus.com/index.php?page=travel-tourism |title=Kazakh Embassy's official travel &amp; tourism website |publisher=Kazakhembus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
Recently in 2010 the Tourism Board of [[Mexico]], a public office that aggregates the resources and interests of the federal, state, and municipal governments, launched a tourism advertising campaign in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]—Mexico's two [[North American Free Trade Agreement|North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)]] partners—geared towards renovating common public political and social perceptions of Mexico, including impressions of poverty, government and law enforcement corruption, petty and organized crime and drug trading, and illegal immigration into the U.S.; the new campaign's purpose is expressly demonstrated by its marketing slogan, "Mexico, the place you thought you knew."  The print and television ads feature views of Mexico's beaches, natural wonders, cultural festivities, and historical artifacts like Mayan pyramids and Spanish churches in order to provide a counterbalance to the less preferable popular preconceptions.  The Tourism Board's stated goal of the advertising surge is to "generat[e] more than three [positive] impressions per person" among the North American audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Otilia Otlacan |url=http://www.adoperationsonline.com/2010/08/18/mexico-tourism-board-launches-advertising-campaign-in-north-america/ |title=Mexico Tourism Board Launches Advertising Campaign in North America, 18 August 2010 |publisher=Adoperationsonline.com |date=2010-08-18 |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The eventual goal is likely to increase tourism revenue for the country, but, for now, the Tourism Board is focusing on [[Public diplomacy|managing perceptions]] among the general populations of Mexico's two major neighboring trade partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmexico.com/wb/Visitmexico/Visi_Home?show=regions%2F|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20110720100348/http://www.visitmexico.com/wb/Visitmexico/Visi_Home?show=regions%2F|deadurl=yes|title=::- VISIT MEXICO -:: Home|date=20 July 2011|archivedate=20 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Destination slogans====

Many countries use slogans in their international tourism advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.familybreakfinder.co.uk/holidays/map-every-countrys-tourism-slogan/|title=Map Shows Every Country's Tourism Slogan|website=www.familybreakfinder.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Destination slogans aim to promote a positive identity for the country. Academic studies of these slogans have identified several common themes such as the physical beauty of the location or the positive experiences travellers can expect to have there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/100085/GRADU-1479373517.pdf?sequence=1|title="Be Our Guest" – A Linguistic Study of Destination Slogans|last=Häkkinen|first=Minttu-Maari|date=October 2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel services advertising===

Additionally, a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which also advertise separately from the destinations, themselves, are owned by their respective governments, such as the [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airline]] ([[Dubai]]), [[Qatar Airways]] ([[Qatar]]), [[China Airlines]] ([[Taiwan]]/[[Republic of China]]), and [[Air China]] ([[People's Republic of China]]).

====China Airways and Air China====
[[China Airlines]] is the official flag carrier airline of [[Taiwan]].  The Taiwanese government refers to its state as the Republic of China and considers itself to be the legitimate, non-Communist leadership-in-exile of all of China since the Communist overthrow in the mid-1950s.  The name of the airline carries the message of the long-lasting and ongoing cultural and [[Cross-Strait relations|political conflict]] between Communist "mainland" [[People's Republic of China|China (PRC)]] and Taiwan, that the Republic of China is the "true" China and that the state commonly referred to as "China" is illegitimate and usurped control of the country from the rightful leadership.  Similarly, the PRC counters this message by having named one of its largest international carriers "[[Air China]]" to reinforce the PRC's claim to be the legitimate of the "two Chinas."  The implicit conflict between the two states is likely lost on the majority of the general public outside the [[East Asia|immediate region]], such as the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], but the strategic use of using advertising and targeting the international community through tourism is apparent on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china-airlines.com/en/index.htm |title=Official global website of China Airlines |language=zh |publisher=China-airlines.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507051752/http://www.china-airlines.com/en/index.htm |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airchina.com/ |title=Official global website of Air China |publisher=Airchina.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emirates====
Through advertising for the Emirates airline, one of the major themes that Dubai promotes is its evolving status as a geographic and economic player in the Middle East.  Emirates advertising describes Dubai as "the perfect hub for an expanding global network" and illustrates this claim in the airline's "Centre of the World" television ad.  On the other hand, Dubai subtly promotes an official stance of multinationalism and a stated intent to cater to the comfort of travelers from abroad in the Emirates' "Multinational Cabin Crew" television ad.  These positions, among others, are portrayed via visually and audibly appealing commercials which are designed to relate to the target audience(s) and make the ads' messages maximally amenable to global viewers.  Emirates additionally adds to its effort to appeal to the West through its sponsorship of the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal Football Club]], including constructing the team's new venue, [[Emirates Stadium]], which opened in July 2006 and prominently displays the Emirates branding on the exterior; in this way, any depictions of the stadium will result in de facto advertising and reinforce the public recognition of the Emirates company as one that is associated with western sports and culture. In May 2013 three Arsenal players, Kieran Gibbs, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Carl Jenkinson took an A380 flight simulator challenge. Swapping their usual airline passenger seats and stepping into the cockpit, the players attempted to land an A380 in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaichronicle.com/2013/05/28/arsenals-trio-attempts-to-land-an-a380-in-dubai/|title=Arsenal's trio attempts to land an A380 in Dubai|author=Editor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emirates, along with the aviation services company [[Dnata]], is owned by the parent company [[The Emirates Group]] which, in turn, is wholly owned by the Government of Dubai.  The chairman and CEO of The Emirates Group, HH Sheikh [[Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], is the younger brother of the former ruler of Dubai, HH Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], and uncle of the current ruler, HH Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum]].  In 1985, Sheikh Ahmed was appointed President of the Dubai Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), the governing body for airline regulation and airport control and operation.  The DCA was restructured and expanded in 2007, thus creating the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) which has since been the airline regulatory authority in the Emirate and the Dubai Airports company which owns and operates Dubai’s airports, Dubai International and the currently under-construction Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International.&lt;ref name="theemiratesgroup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theemiratesgroup.com/english/our-company/leadership/hh-sheikh-ahmed-bin-saeed-al-maktoum.aspx |title=HH Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, The Emirates Group (Leadership profiles), 2010 |publisher=Theemiratesgroup.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dubai International]] (IATA: DXB) is a primary international hub in the Middle East, offering flights to every continent except Antarctica.  As of November 2010, DXB is the 6th busiest airport in the world for cargo traffic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-212-219-227_666_2__ |title=Year to date Cargo Traffic, Airports Council International, 11 November 2010 |publisher=Airports.org |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 14th highest passenger throughput of all international airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-212-218-222_666_2__ |title=Year to date passenger traffic, Airports Council International, 11 November 2010 |publisher=Airports.org |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2012-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111152406/http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-212-218-222_666_2__ |archivedate=11 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Ahmed currently simultaneously holds the positions of Chairman and CEO of Emirates Airline &amp; Group, which includes the Emirates airline and Dnata air services company, Chairman of the Dubai Airports company, and President of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority.&lt;ref name="theemiratesgroup.com"/&gt;  Because Dubai's government leadership is directly involved and intertwined with private-sector enterprises, including the Emirates airline and many other facets of the tourism industry, the government there necessarily has a vested interest in the public perception of Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emirates.com |title=Official global website of Emirates |publisher=Emirates.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2014}}

[[File:In Flanders Fields (1921) intro 1.png|thumb|First page, introduction to ''[[In Flanders Fields]]'']]
In an [[essay]], [[Article (publishing)|article]], or [[book]], an '''introduction''' (also known as a '''prolegomenon''') is a beginning section which states the purpose and goals of the following writing.  This is generally followed by the body and conclusion.

The introduction typically describes the scope of the document and gives the brief explanation or summary of the document. It may also explain certain elements that are important to the essay if explanations are not part of the main text. The readers can have an idea about the following text before they actually start reading it.

ln [[technical writing]], the introduction typically includes one or more standard subsections: [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] or summary, [[preface]], acknowledgments, and [[foreword]]. Alternatively, the section labeled ''introduction'' itself may be a brief section found side-by-side with abstract, foreword, etc. (rather than containing them). In this case the set of sections that come before the body of the book are known as the '''front matter'''. When the book is divided into numbered chapters, by convention the introduction and any other front-matter sections are unnumbered and precede chapter 1.

Keeping the concept of the introduction the same, different documents have different styles to introduce the written text. For example, the introduction of a Functional Specification consists of information that the whole document is yet to explain. If a Userguide is written, the introduction is about the product. In a report, the introduction gives a summary about the report contents.

{{Judaism}}
'''Jewish studies''' (or '''Judaic studies''') is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] centered on the study of [[Jew]]s and [[Judaism]]. Jewish studies is [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] and combines aspects of [[history]] (especially [[Jewish history]]), [[Middle Eastern studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[Oriental studies]], [[religious studies]], [[archeology]], [[sociology]], [[language]]s ([[Jewish languages]]), [[political science]], [[area studies]], [[women's studies]], and [[ethnic studies]]. Jewish studies as a distinct field is mainly present at colleges and universities in [[North America]].

Related fields include [[Holocaust research]] and [[Israel Studies]], and in Israel, [[Jewish thought]].

==History==
[[File:Kurtze Beschreibung einer wohleingerichteten Synagog.jpg|thumb|300px|In the 18th century, as interest in the "curiosities" of the Jewish religion rose, some non-Jews had models of synagogues erected, furnished with a full array of Jewish books and ceremonial objects, and accessible to a broad public, constituting the world's first "Jewish museums." This title page is from a book by Moritz Wilhelm Christiani, which describes such a replica, owned by Georg Serpilius, a Christian Hebraist.]]
The Jewish tradition generally places a high value on learning and study, especially of [[religious text]]s. [[Torah study]] (study of the [[Torah]] and more broadly of the entire [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as [[Rabbinic literature]] such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]) is considered a [[Mitzvah|religious obligation]].

Since the [[Renaissance]] and the growth of [[higher education]], many people, including people not of the Jewish faith, have chosen to study Jews and Judaism as a means of understanding the Jewish religion, heritage, and Jewish history.

Religious instruction specifically for Jews, especially for those who wish to join the [[rabbi]]nate, is taught at Jewish [[Seminary|seminaries]] (and in [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[yeshiva]]s). Among the most prominent are the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] and the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[Hebrew Union College]]. For the majority of Jewish students attending regular academic colleges and universities there is a growing choice of Jewish studies courses and even degrees available at many institutions.

The subject of [[antisemitism]] and [[the Holocaust]], as well as the establishment of the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]] and the revival of the [[Hebrew language]] have all stimulated unusual interest in greater in-depth academic study, research, reading and lecturing about these core areas of knowledge related to current events. In the United States, the unique position that [[American Jews|Jewish Americans]] have held within the nation's complex social structure has created substantial scholarship, especially with regards to topics such as interfaith marriage, political activism, and influence on popular culture.

In a 1966 article published in the ''[[American Jewish Year Book]]'', the Hebrew literature scholar [[Arnold Band|Arnold J. Band]] was among the first to call attention to the "spread of Jewish studies as an accepted academic discipline in the American liberal arts colleges and universities since the Second World War".&lt;ref name="Band"&gt;Band, Arnold (1966). "[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1966_3_SpecialArticles.pdf Jewish Studies in American Liberal-Arts Colleges and Universities]," ''American Jewish Year Book'' 67 (1966), 1–30; here: p. 3. Retrieved 2016-07-01 from the website of the American Jewish Committee Archives. Also reprinted, with a postscript by Band, in: Band, ''Studies in Modern Jewish Literature''. Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 2003. p. 390–408. {{ISBN|9780827609723}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loveland"&gt;Loveland, Kristen (2008). "The Association for Jewish Studies: A Brief History". Association for Jewish Studies 40th Annual Conference, December 21–23, 2008. 16&amp;nbsp;p.; here: p.&amp;nbsp;1. "The first to address the postwar rise of Jewish studies, Band's article quickly set off a reaction amongst the new generation of Jewish studies professors." Available as a [http://www.ajsnet.org/ajs.pdf PDF file] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726190104/http://www.ajsnet.org/ajs.pdf |date=2016-07-26 }} on the website of the Association for Jewish Studies, "[http://www.ajsnet.org/mission.htm About Us]" page. Retrieved 2016-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article Band offered a definition of Jewish (Judaic) studies as "the discipline which deals with the historical experiences, in the intellectual, religious, and social spheres, of the Jewish people in all centuries and countries".&lt;ref&gt;Band (1966), p. 5. In the 2002 reprint, ''Studies in Modern Jewish Literature'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political situation in the [[Middle East]], especially the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], has raised the profile of Jews, Judaism, and [[Zionism]] on campuses, spurring many on to study this subject for non-degree as well as for credits in obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts]] or [[Master of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]]. A growing number of mature students are even obtaining [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]] in Jewish studies judging by the quantity of courses and programs available. Many hope to obtain employment in the field of Jewish education or in Jewish communal service agencies.

Some Christians search for an understanding of the Jewish background for [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Christianity]] and for the source of [[monotheism]] that sprang from Judaism. There are those who are seeking an understanding of the complex and volatile relationship between [[Islam]] and Judaism. Others are searching for [[spirituality]] and [[philosophy]] and therefore seek classes in [[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism) and [[Jewish philosophy]]. There are also those who have a genuine concern and attachment to modern [[Israel]] as [[Christian Zionists]] and therefore seek to learn more about the subjects related to their beliefs.

Jewish studies have been offered at universities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, Mervin F. (ed.) (1985). ''World Register of University Studies in Jewish Civilization: Inventory of Holdings'' (Vol. 1). Markus Wiener Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are only a few significant examples of places where Jewish studies are offered and flourish in an academic setting:

==Colleges that offer Jewish Studies==

===Europe===

====University College London====
[[University College London]] (UCL) houses the largest department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies in Europe. The department is the only one in the UK to offer a full degree course and research supervision in Jewish Studies at the BA Honours, MA, MPhil and PhD levels in every subject of Hebrew and Jewish Studies—philology, history, and literature—covering virtually the entire chronological and geographical span of the Hebrew and Jewish civilisation from antiquity through the Middle Ages to the modern period. As the first university in England to open its doors to Women, Roman Catholics and Dissenters, UCL was also the first to admit Jewish students. This traditional link of the College with the Anglo-Jewish community is very much alive today. Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid (1778–1859), one of the leading figures in the struggle for Jewish emancipation in England, was among the principal founders of University College and the chief promotor of its Hebrew department. At his instigation, [[Hyman Hurwitz]] was appointed as the first Professor of Hebrew in 1828. In 1967 the department was renamed the Department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies and extended to include, in addition to the established courses in Hebrew language and literature, a much wider range of courses with an emphasis on Jewish history. The department acts as host to both the Jewish Historical Society of England (JHSE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhse.org/ |title=jhse.org |publisher=jhse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Institute of Jewish Studies (IJS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/ijs/index.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416002941/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/ijs/index.htm |date=April 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which organises annual public lecture series and international conferences on all aspects of Jewish civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/home/index.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503054431/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/home/index.php |date=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oxford University====

{{Tone|date=March 2016}}
The title '''King of the Gypsies''' has been claimed or given over the centuries to many different people. It is both culturally and geographically specific. It may be inherited, acquired by acclamation or action, or simply claimed. The extent of the power associated with the title varied; it might be limited to a small group in a specific place, or many people over large areas. In some cases the claim was clearly a public relations exercise. As the term [[wikt:gypsy|Gypsy]] is also used in many different ways the ''King of the Gypsies'' may be someone with no connection with the [[Romani people]]. In the early 1970s, it was decided, at the First Annual Romani Meeting that the term Gypsy would no-longer be used to describe themselves. They voted for the term Roma to be used.

It has also been suggested that in places where they were persecuted by local authorities the "King of the Gypsies" is an individual, usually of low standing, who places himself in the risky position of an ad hoc liaison between the Romani and the gadje (non-Romani). The arrest of such a "King" limited the harm to the Romani people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/09/3roma.cfm |title=Human Rights Brief Human Rights Brief |website=Wcl.american.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John (Johnnie) Faa===
{{main|John Faa}}
Johnnie Faa of Dunbar was leader of the 'Egyptians', or Gypsies, in Scotland. Faa was granted a letter under the [[Privy Seal]] from [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV]] in February 1540, which was renewed in 1553. It was addressed to "oure louit Johnne Faw, lord and erle of Litill Egipt" establishing his authority over all Gypsies in Scotland and calling on all [[sheriffs]] in the country to assist him "in executione of justice upoun his company and folkis", who were to "conforme to the lawis of Egipt".

He is resurrected in fiction in S. R. Crockett's ''The Raiders'' and in Philip Pullman's trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]''.

===Johnne Wanne===
Son and successor of Johnnie Faa, Johnne Wanne was granted Royal authority over all "Egyptians" in Scotland in May 1540. Records showed that by 1612 the Faa family had extended as far as [[Shetland]]. However, the initial tolerance of Gypsies did not last. In 1623 eight leaders of the Gypsies were hanged on the Burgh Muir, six of whom were of the Faa line. In the 1650s they were amongst those [[Penal transportation|transported]] to [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/roma/gft/index.htm |title=Gypsy Folk Tales Index |website=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patrick Faa ===
Patrick was the first recorded Gypsy King at [[Kirk Yetholm]].  Along with seven other Gypsies he was "sentenced to be transported to the Queen's American for life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anonymous|first=|date=September 1817|title=NOTICES CONCERNING THE SCOTTISH GYPSIES |url=|journal=Edinburgh Monthly Magazine|volume=1 (September)|pages=616|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== William Faa I ===
King William I, known as 'Gleed Nickit Wull' because of a twist in the shape of his throat, was born about 1700, and died at Coldingham in 1784, aged around 84. He fathered 24 children by three wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishgypsies.co.uk/will.html|title=Will Faa, The Faa Family, Famous Gypsies|website=www.scottishgypsies.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His death at Colingham is recounted by William Smith, the Baillie at Kelso, who states that "When old Will Faa was upwards of eighty years of age, he called on me in Kelso, in his way to Edinburgh, telling me that he was going to Edinburgh to see the laird... before he died,"  and also that after successfully completing this visit "he only got the length of Colingham, when he was taken ill and died."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Waverley Anecdotes: Illustrative of the Incidents, Characters, and Scenery, Described in the Novels and Romances, of Sir Walter Scott|last=Scott|first=Walter|publisher=J.

===William Faa II===
Will Faa, "King of the Gypsies", died in [[Kirk Yetholm]] on 9 October 1847, aged 96. He was the son of William Faa I. William Faa was an innkeeper (owned "The Queen") and footballer who lived at "The Gypsy Palace" off the Green, and entertained visitors there. The ''Kelso Mail'' carried his obituary entitled "Death of a Gypsy King", which said he was "always accounted a more respectable character than any of his tribe, and could boast of never having been in gaol during his life." His house continued to be a tourist attraction, and there was reportedly an "Old Palace" on the other side of Kirk Yetholm Green. William died without issue in 1847 when the 'Crown' passed to his sister Esther's husband Charles Blythe (1775-1861). Charles was an educated man who did much to live up to his role. On his death in 1861 there was a tussle between his many children for the right to be monarch.  The role went to his daughter Esther Faa Blythe who reigned until 1883 when the gypsy culture was in serious decline. Following a gap of several years in 1898 one of her sons Charles Rutherford was persuaded to accept the office and a ceremonial Gypsy Coronation was held in 1898.  By this stage the role was largely an attempt to boost tourism.
Charles died in 1902 and the title has not been re-established. An Edinburgh housewife is now thought to be the present 'Queen'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovertheborders.co.uk/places/212.html |title=The Gypsy Palace, Kirk Yetholm, Scotland |website=Discovertheborders.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishgypsies.co.uk/ |title=The Scottish Gypsies of Scotland |website=Scottishgypsies.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘’Journal Gypsy Lore Soc.’’ 3rd ser.ii 370-1 quoted in ‘’English Genealogy’’ A.

=== Charles Faa Blythe I ===
Charles Faa Blythe was a brother-in-law to William Faa II, and when he died without issue the title of King of the Gypsies was passed to Charles, husband of his sister, Esther.  Charles was born in 1775 and died in 1861.  He was crowned King, by the local blacksmith, George Gladstone, on 25 October 1847, aged at least 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishgypsies.co.uk/charles.html|title=Charles Blyth I, The Faa Family, Famous Gypsies|website=www.scottishgypsies.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was succeeded by his daughter, Esther Faa Blythe, who was born in the early years of the 1800s and died on 12 July 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishgypsies.co.uk/esther3.html|title=Esther Faa Blythe, The Faa Family, Famous Gypsies|website=www.scottishgypsies.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charles Faa Blyth II ===
Born around 1825, Charles Rutherford (known as Charles Faa Blythe II), was a son to Esther Faa Bythe, the Gypsy Queen.  Between the death of Esther Faa Blyth in 1883 and the accession of Charles II in 1898, there was no Gypsy royalty crowned at Kirk Yetholm.  His coronation ceremony was really a pageant, with all the locals dressing up for the benefit of the photographers. Many photographs of the occasion still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishgypsies.co.uk/charles22.html|title=Charles Faa Blyth II, The Faa Family, Famous Gypsies|website=www.scottishgypsies.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florent Léglise===
Often referred as the Ecclesiast, his origins remain unknown but research indicates that he lived around the french territories of the South Gironde. Admired for his famous mystical beard, he became one of the central symbolic representations of authority for french gypsies, as many tales and legends were created and put together from diverse episodes taken from his life (e.g. Catherine's street hidden Church, the Ecclesiast and the last Gitardise, The drummer and the prince, the good, the bad and the Church, etc.). He was nominated by his predecessor, Joni Ali, in 1993 after the battle of the Golden Veal of Bazas, and was crowned after the death of its mentor on the 5th of may of the following year (Joni Ali's Day).

===Leaders identified in Martin Markall===
The short book ''Martin Markall, [[Beadle]] of the [[Bridewell]]'' was published in London in 1610. The author is given as "S.R.", who is usually identified as [[Samuel Rid]] the author of ''The Art of Jugling or Legerdemaine'', a later book of rogue literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It will be seen that in reality few had anything to do with Gypsies, but they are indicative of the context in which some of the Kings of the Gypsies were identified.

====John Mendall====
aka [[Jack Cade]], aka John Mortimer, who led a rebellion of men from Kent who camped at Blackheath outside London in 1450. After his rebellion a reward was offered for him, and he was captured and killed in Kent.

====Bluebeard and Hugh Roberts====
Both soldiers who had served in France. Bluebeard was captured and executed shortly after being made "their captain".  Roberts then gathered about 100 "rakehells and vagabonds" in Kent who were joined by 400 "masterless men". Together they joined Jack Cade and entered [[Southwark]]. After the end of Cade's rebellion Roberts took to the woods with a small group living by theft, according to set rules of their own.  After a year living like this these "Roberdsmen" dispersed throughout England, vowing to meet every three years, and joining other "commotions and rebellions". Roberts also went "roving" and "kept his court" until he was killed in 1461.

====Jenkin Cowdiddle====
Was chosen by the remaining "Roberdsmen" at "their wonted place of meeting" "by general assent". He was "a wandering rogue", "much given to swearing, drunkenness and lechery . . . stout of stomach, audacious and fierce". He claimed ''[[droit du seigneur]]'', and ordained that all beggars spent their weekly earnings in full every Saturday night. Rid says that he fought with "300 tattered knaves" in the rebellion in the South West of England against [[Edward IV]] and was killed at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] (1471). Unlike Roberts, who may have been a real character, this Cowdiddle seems to have been a complete fiction.

====Spising====
Not deterred, the remaining "Roberdsmen" "hie them to their rendezvous . . . and there, with the full consent of the whole company, they chose one Spising to be his successor". Spising is given no first name. He is credited with ordering that all begging wanderers be "stalled as a rogue" by "the Chief Commander then being", paying a fee in beer, though this was excused if his father and grandfather had been rogues. Spising joined the larger rebellion by Thomas Neville, the [[Bastard of Fauconberg]]. He led a band attacking [[Aldgate]], and was nearly successful, until parts of his group were trapped by the fall of the [[portcullis]].  Spising is reputed to have ruled 11 years before being hanged for a murder in [[Wombourn]], [[Staffordshire]], having escaped the same fate earlier by seeking [[sanctuary]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]. There is a historical record of a Spising as leader of an [[Essex]] contingent of Neville's uprising, but he was executed after it, and his head exhibited on Aldgate.

====Puff Dick====
Was the next elected, an expert at cheating with [[loaded dice]], and excelled in "all manner of vice". He repeated Cowdiddle's requirement for thieves and beggars to spend their ill-gotten gains and not save them. Rid says he ruled for 8 years before dying of "the [[French pox|[French] pox]] and Neapolitan scurf". Like Cowdiddle, Dick seems to have been wholly fictional.

====Laurence Crossbiter (aka Long Laurence)====
Laurence Crossbiter was the next elected leader, a serving man aged 50–60. His art was "crossbiting"; theft from the customers of whores. He is also reported to have died "his bowels . . . eaten out with the pox while he was yet alive". Rid described him as cowardly and slavish for failing to come to the aid of the rebel [[Perkin Warbeck]].

====Richard Skelton====
Was one of Warbeck's counsellors, "a noted knave". He was next "led to the wonted place of meeting, and there solemnly stalled a rogue and made their general". He is described as formerly having been a [[tailor]] in [[Taunton]], [[Somerset]] "of proud and haughty disposition", and have "lived in this new government" until 1501. A Skelton was recorded by [[Sir Francis Bacon]] as a counsellor to Warbeck, but he says nothing of his activities after the rebellion.

====Cock Lorel====
Was elected his successor "by the General Council". Cock Lorel was "the most notorious knave that ever lived" who ruled until 1533. He professed the trade of a tinker to cover his thefts. Rid says that his knaveries are recorded in an old manuscript kept as "Maunders’ Hall", giving the rogue community a similar structure of that of the trade [[guilds]].
Cock Lorel was the great mythical leader of Tudor rogues. His name means just that, "cock" being leader, and "lorel" or losel" meaning rascal. He first appears about 1500 in "Cock Lorel's Boat", and is mentioned in [[Robert Copland]]'s ''The Highway to the Spitalhouse'' (1535). He is credited with approving John Awdesley's ''The Fraternity of Vagabonds'', (1561), in which he is given as the creator of the Twenty Five Orders of Knaves, reproduced in [[Thomas Harman]]'s ''Warning for Common Cursitors'' and many other works of rogue literature. There is no record of any real individual on whom he was based.
Cock Lorel is credited with having held a meeting with the leader of the Egyptians, Giles Hather, at their base at [[Peak Cavern|The Devils Arse Apeak]] in [[Derbyshire]]. Rid claims that at this meeting they devised a new and secret language [[Thieves' Cant]], "to the end that their cozenings, knaveries, and villainies might not so easily be perceived and known".&lt;ref&gt;Rid, Samuel (1610). ''Martin Markall, the Beadle of Bridewell''. as quoted in {{cite book

|date=Apr 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Giles Hather====
Became head of the regiment or fellowship of Egyptians in the north about 1528. These, Rid says, travelled in groups of more than a hundred men and women, with horses, their faces blacked, and practised [[legerdemain]] and [[fortune telling]] by [[palmistry]], delighting the common people with their clothes.

====Kit Callot====
"the Queen of the Egypties" accompanied Giles Hather, according to Rid. These names were traditional; Hather is mentioned by Thomas Awdesley (1561). "Kit" and "Callot" as names can be traced back to [[Piers Plowman]]. Although Tudor government, both local and national, took a close interest in the Egyptians there is no record of the names in their records.

===Other leaders===
====Boswells====
The Boswells were for centuries one of England's largest and most important Gypsy families. The Boswell clan were a large extended family of [[Romani people|Travellers]], and in old [[Nottinghamshire dialect]] the word ''bos'll'' was used as a term for Travellers and Romani in general.

=====Haniel Boswell=====
Was the son of Francis Boswell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garenewing.co.uk/family/hodgkins.html |title=The Romani Line - Boswell, Sherriff &amp; Hodgkins or Hodgkinson |website=Garenewing.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Jacob Rewbrey=====
"Alias king of the Gypsies", from the St Margaret's [[Westminster]], was tried at the [[Old Bailey]] on 28 August 1700 for theft with violence and highway robbery. It was alleged he had robbed "one Rebecca Sellers, near the High way, . . . taking from her 3 Gold-rings, and 9 s. in Money" in January of that year. The Jury found him Guilty of theft, but not Robbery, as "It appeared that he juggled [tricked] her out of it." He was sentenced to [[Penal transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Old Bailey|defendant=Jacob Rewbrey|trialdate=28 August 1700|id=t17000828-63|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====James Boswell=====
Is buried in [[Rossington]], near [[Doncaster]] in [[Yorkshire]]. Langdale's "Topographical Dictionary of Yorkshire" (1822), says:
"In the church yard, was a stone, the two ends of which are now remaining, where was interred the body of James Bosvill the King of the Gypsies, who died January 30, 1708. For a number of years, it was a custom of Gypsies from the south, to visit his tomb annually, and there perform some of their accustomed rites; one of which was to pour a flagon of ale upon the grave."
This is similar to the ritual of "stalling the rogue" mentioned by [[Thomas Harman]] and in ''The Beggars Bush'' and by [[Bampfylde Moore Carew]].

A tradition was reported of annual visits to the grave of Charles Boswell near Doncaster for more than 100 years into the 1820s, including a rite of pouring a flagon of hot ale into the tomb. This may be same person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donny.co.uk/Doncaster/news/index.php3?ID=376 |title=Doncaster News and Features: Bizarre Doncaster: Ghosts and Hauntings, on Donny Online |website=Donny.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Vesey-Fitzgerald]] Gypsies of Britain, The Country Book Club, 1951, quoting Edward Miller History and Antiquities of Doncaster&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Wainwright, History and Antiquities of Doncaster and Consborough, Sheffield, Basil Blackwell., 1829&lt;/ref&gt; the grave is situated by the main door leading to the church, shaded by a dark oak tree. It is now covered in moss, but is still readable. The words "King Of The Gypsies" will lie there for ever more, whereas the mystery of the black cat is still unsolved. – information on the grave by A. Needham&amp;nbsp;– P. Needham, of St. Michaels church.''

=====Henry Boswell=====
"King of the Gypsies" died in 1760 at the age of 90 and was buried at [[Ickleford]] near [[Hitchin]], [[Hertfordshire]] at the church of St. Catherine, as were his wife and granddaughter.

=====Edmund Mashiter=====
aka "Old Honey", died in [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]] in 1811 aged 90. He was reported to have been "justly entitled the King of Beggars", having been on the road for 70 years. He was reported to have been the son of a schoolmaster, and well educated, but to have taken to the road by choice, and maintained a wandering life until he became bedridden.

=====Louis Boswell=====
Louis Boswell was buried at [[St. Laurence and All Saints Church, Eastwood|Eastwood church]], [[Southend-on-Sea]] in 1835.

=====Xavier Petulengro/ Smith =====
Was described as the King of the Gypsies, in an account of a Romani wedding at [[Baildon]] in [[Yorkshire]] in 1937 between his son Leon Petulengro/ Smith and Illeana Smith both of Colchester Essex. According to the caption of a photograph [[Xavier Petulengro]] cut the hands of the couple to mingle their blood during the ceremony. After their wedding the couple went north to Blackpool. During the war Leon was in the RAF and Ileana (Eileen) was a staff car driver for ICI. The marriage was dissolved in 1947 in Nottingham. Baildon was a famous fair and meeting place for Gypsies.

Louis Welch of [[Darlington]] was described by British media as the "King of the Gypsies", a title given to the best bare-knuckled boxer in the [[Romanichal]] - mainly from the UK, and France community, following an alleged attack by six knife-wielding men, possibly from a rival band of travellers, in [[Cumbria]].  He refused to give evidence against his attackers, saying it was "against the travellers' code of honour", and a retrial was ordered after the jury failed to reach a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/8552394.stm|title=Retrial over 'King of Gypsies' boxer attack in Cumbria|publisher=BBC|date=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/673657-king-of-the-gypsies-injured-in-knife-attack |title='King of the Gypsies' injured in knife attack &amp;#124; Metro News |website=Metro.co.uk |date=2009-05-27 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/5025032._Ignore_whims_of_King_of_the_Gipsies_/|title=Ignore whims of King of the Gipsies|publisher=The Northern Echo|date=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In legal terms, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII of England]] had only three wives, because three of his putative marriages were annulled. Unlike a divorce, where a married couple chooses to end their union, [[annulment|annulments]] essentially declare that a true marriage never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11358279/Henry-VIII-didnt-really-have-six-wives-why-everything-you-know-about-the-Tudors-is-wrong.html|title=Did Henry VIII really have six wives?

==Overview==
The six women who were married to Henry VIII were, in chronological order:

{| class="wikitable" 
|- 
! No. !! Name !! Married from - through !! Fate of marriage !! Fate of wife and issue 
|- 
| 1 || [[Catherine of Aragon]] || 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 || Annulled || Died 7 January 1536 while detained in [[Kimbolton Castle]].&lt;br&gt;Mother of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Carolly |title=Great Harry: A Biography of Henry the VII |date=2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-16858-6 |page=48 |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| 6 || [[Catherine Parr]] || 12 July 1543 – 28 January 1547 || Widowed || Survived Henry VIII. Later remarried to Thomas Seymour. Died 7 September 1548.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hanson |first1=Marilee |title=Katherine Parr --Facts, Information, Biography &amp; Portraits |url=https://englishhistory.net/tudor/monarchs/katharine-parr/ |website=English History |accessdate=23 September 2018 |date=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry's first marriage lasted nearly 24 years; the five that followed less than 10 years combined.

A common [[mnemonic device]] to remember the fates of Henry's consorts is "Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived". There are also two rhymes:{{cn|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}}

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;King Henry VIII,
To six wives he was wedded.
One died, one survived,
Two divorced, two beheaded.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

and

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Boleyn and Howard lost their heads,
Anne of Cleves he would not bed,
Jane Seymour gave him a son – but died before the week was done,
Aragon he did divorce,
Which just left Catherine Parr, of course!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

It is often noted that [[Catherine Parr]] "survived him." In fact, [[Anne of Cleves]] also survived the king, and was the last of his queens to die. Of the six queens, [[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]], [[Anne Boleyn]], and [[Jane Seymour]] each gave Henry one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children would eventually ascend to the throne: [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].

Catherine Howard and Anne Boleyn, the two of Henry's queens who were beheaded, were first cousins. Several of Henry's wives worked in at least one of his other wives' service, typically as [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]]: Anne Boleyn worked in Catherine of Aragon's service, Jane Seymour worked in Catherine of Aragon's and Anne Boleyn's, and Catherine Howard worked in Anne of Cleves's.

Henry and at least four of his wives (Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, and Catherine Parr) were portrayed in [[List of historical opera characters|opera]].

[[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]] (16 December 1485{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1536; {{lang-es|link=no|Catalina de Aragón}}) was Henry's first wife.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Although her name is sometimes spelled ''Catherine'', Katherine of Aragon spelled and signed her name with a "K," which was the accepted spelling in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon#Spelling_of_her_name|title=Catherine of Aragon|last=Wikipedia|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}{{circular inline|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Davies|first=C.S.L.|last2=Edwards|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=England|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|doi-access=Free|chapter=Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], her first husband and Henry's brother, a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until after he came to the throne in 1509. Prospects were looking good when Katherine became pregnant in 1510, just 4 months after their marriage, but the girl was stillborn. Katherine became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to a boy, [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. In 1513, Katherine gave birth to a stillborn boy, and gave birth to a boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally, Katherine bore him a healthy daughter in 1516, [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. It took her two years to conceive again. This pregnancy ended in a short-lived girl. It is said that Henry truly loved Katherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times in declarations, etc.

Henry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that his marriage was invalid because Katherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21) to justify his stance: "If a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.” 
Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who is said{{by whom|date=July 2016}} to have refused to become his mistress (Henry had already consummated an affair then dismissed Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], and most historians believe that Anne wanted to avoid the same treatment){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Despite the pope's refusal, Henry separated from Katherine in 1531. In the face of the Pope's continuing refusal to annul his marriage to Katherine, Henry ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court to rule on the status of his marriage to Katherine. On 23 May 1533,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer ruled the marriage to Katherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows, probably in late January 1533). This led to the break from the Roman Catholic Church and the later establishment of the [[Church of England]].
 
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] called Katherine "The Queen of Earthly Queens."

Marriage to Henry VIII: 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 (23 years, 11 months, 19 days); marriage annulled.

==Anne Boleyn==
{{Main article|Anne Boleyn}}
[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]
[[Anne Boleyn]] (c.1501/1507{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne, and her subsequent execution, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the [[English Reformation]]. The daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and his wife, [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Lady Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), Anne was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired, with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]].

Anne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her in 1526 and she refused to become his mistress, as her sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], so he could marry Anne. Evidence of intimacy between the King and Anne is found in a love letter written by the King, in which he expressed admiration for her "pretty duckies" (breasts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, the breaking of the power of the Roman Catholic Church in England began.

Henry had [[Thomas Wolsey]] dismissed from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain, [[Thomas Cranmer]], appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn"&gt;"Anne Boleyn 1507–1536." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of [[excommunication]] against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the [[Church of England]] was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn" /&gt;
Anne was crowned [[List of English consorts|Queen Consort of England]] on 1 June 1533. Later that year, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Henry's second daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. When Anne failed to quickly produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, the King grew tired of her, annulled their marriage, and a plot was hatched by [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] to execute her.

Although the evidence against her was unconvincing, Anne was beheaded on charges of [[adultery]], [[incest]], and [[high treason]] on 19 May 1536. Following her daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s coronation as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].

Marriage to Henry VIII: 28 May 1533{{spaced ndash}}17 May 1536 (2 years, 11 months, 19 days); annulled, then beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tudorhistory.org/boleyn/|title=Anne Boleyn|website=tudorhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jane Seymour==
{{Main article|Jane Seymour}}
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]
[[Jane Seymour]] (c.roughly 1508{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served [[Catherine of Aragon]] and was one of [[Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn's]] ladies-in-waiting.&lt;ref&gt;Jokinen, Anniina. "[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sixwives.htm The Six Wives of King Henry VII]" 2007. Web. 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongly believed{{who|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 10–11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Finally, a year later, Jane gave birth to a healthy, legitimate male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later, presumably because of post-natal complications. This apparently caused her husband genuine grief, as she was the only queen to receive a proper Queen's burial; when the King died in 1547, he was buried next to her.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 30 May 1536{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537 (1 year, 4 months, 24 days); death from complications of childbirth.

==Anne of Cleves==
{{Main article|Anne of Cleves}}
[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]
[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was Henry's fourth wife, for only six months in 1540, from 6 January to 9 July. Anne of Cleves was a German princess.&lt;ref&gt;"Anne of Cleves." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that Henry referred to her as "''A Flanders Mare''", which may or may not be true; nevertheless, the label has stuck with Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett "History of the Reformation of England" Print&lt;/ref&gt; Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for an annulment. Anne agreed to this, claiming that the marriage had not been consummated, and because she hadn't resisted the annulment, was given a generous settlement, including [[Hever Castle]], former home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns. She was given the name "The King's Sister", and became a friend to him and his children until his death. She outlived both the King and his last two wives, making her the last of the six wives to die.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 6 January 1540{{spaced ndash}}9 July 1540 (6 months, 3 days); annulled.

==Catherine Howard==
{{Main article|Catherine Howard}}
[[File:HowardCatherine02.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Howard]]
[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540–1542, sometimes known as "the rose without a
thorn". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine Howard." World Book Encyclopaedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage to Henry VIII: 28 July 1540{{spaced ndash}}23 November 1541 (1 year, 3 months, 26 days); beheaded.

==Catherine Parr==
{{Main article|Catherine Parr}}
[[File:Catherine Parr from NPG.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Parr]]
[[Catherine Parr]] (1512{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543–1547. She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542–46|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.

Catherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 12 July 1543{{spaced ndash}}28 January 1547 (3 years, 6 months, 16 days); his death at the age of 55.

==Ancestry==
Henry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I of England]],&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry VIII'', genealogical tables&lt;/ref&gt; through more than one ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tudorqueen6.com/2012/09/22/english-ancestry-of-the-six-wives-descent-from-edward-i/|title=English Ancestry of The Six Wives: Descent from Edward I|date=22 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noted antiquarian and heraldist [[Charles Boutell]] commented that the: "Arms of Queen Anne Boleyn are the first which exemplify the usage, introduced by Henry VIII, of granting to his Consorts "Augmentations" to their paternal arms. It is a striking illustration of the degenerate condition of [[Heraldry]] under the second [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor Sovereign]]."&lt;ref name="Boutell 242"/&gt; The dexter supporter was intended to represent the leopard of [[Guyenne]] (Aquitaine). The sinister supporter was a [[Charge_(heraldry)#Animals|heraldic creature]] from the badge of the Boleyn, as descended from Earls of Ormond (Butler).&lt;ref name="Willment 69"&gt;Willement p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The falcon badge was granted to Anne as Countess of Pembroke, this badge was also used by her daughter Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].

-----
The sinister supporter was inherited from her maternal grandfather William FitzHugh, 4th Baron FitzHugh. Her badge was granted by the King, it combined the Tudor rose badge of Henry with a previous one used by the Queen's family. The House of Parr has assumed as a badge "a maiden's head, couped below the breasts, vested in ermine and gold, her hair of the last, and her temples encircled with red and white roses." This they inherited from the badge of Ross, of Kendal.&lt;ref name="Willment 75"&gt;Willement p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has a long history and significance in many countries particularly in Asia. Places like China and Japan has especially strong cultural ties to the game. In China, the game has evolved to represent peace and friendship. Inviting someone to a game of Mahjong almost synonymous with friendship. Expensive Mahjong sets can be seen as a status symbol and are a source of pride among Chinese families.

==Hong Kong==
In [[Hong Kong]]:

*During a [[Chinese marriage|Chinese wedding banquet]], guests play Mahjong during the waiting time.  
*A count-down Mahjong before the [[Chinese New Year]] or the [[New Year]] is a typical practice for many [[Hong Kong]] families.
*While most people have a Mahjong set at home, most Chinese restaurants offer sets of Mahjong equipment for their customers.
*Officially, [[casino]]s are illegal in Hong Kong. However, there are legal [[Mahjong school]]s, where gamblers can play Mahjong.
*The elderly are encouraged to play Mahjong as brain exercise.
*To invite a person to a Mahjong game is an indication of friendliness in [[Chinese Culture]].
 
However, Mahjong games also create problems.  Addiction to Mahjong is a common type of [[problem gambling]].  Mahjong is also a favourite medium for [[bribery]] - the person giving the bribe will intentionally lose large sums of money to the person being bribed. Recent studies also suggest Mahjong can cause epilepsy &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6931119.stm http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6931119.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New7Wonders Cities''' is the third in a series of Internet-based polls operated by the New7Wonders Foundation. Founder-President, [https://about.new7wonders.com/the-project-founder-bernard-weber-a-short-history/ Bernard Weber], is a Swiss-born Canadian filmmaker, museum curator, aviator, and explorer. Based in [[San Francisco]], [[United States]], Weber’s latest campaign to find the best cities in the world aimed to showcase the "cities that best represent the achievements and aspirations of our global urban civilization".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/seven-urban-wonders-of-the-world-2014-12|title=These 7 Cities Are The New 'Urban Wonders' Of The World|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global competition began{{when|date=June 2018}} with more than 1200 nominees from 220 countries. That list was reduced to 77, since there was a limit of one city per country. Then the 77 remaining cities were narrowed down by a panel of experts headed by [[Federico Mayor Zaragoza]], former director-general of [[UNESCO]], to 28 suggestions. Following the announcement of the 28 finalists, the winning seven cities were chosen by voters from around the world.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Announced in 2011, it culminated in 2014 with the choice of the following 7 winning cities: [[Beirut]], [[Doha]], [[Durban]], [[Havana]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[La Paz]] and [[Vigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.new7wonders.com/en/cities|title=New7Wonders Cities|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109160159/https://www.new7wonders.com/en/cities|archivedate=9 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8265">'''Normcore''' is a [[unisex]] [[fashion trend]] characterized by unpretentious, normal-looking clothing. 

==History==
''Normcore'' is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''normal'' and ''hardcore''. The word first appeared in the [[webcomic]] ''[[Templar, Arizona]]'' before 2009&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Nancy (March 2\3, 2014). [http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2014/03/word-of-the-week-normcore.html "Word of the Week: normcore"], ''Fritinancy''. Retrieved January 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and was later employed by [[K-HOLE (trend forecasting group)|K-HOLE]], a [[trend forecasting]] group,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Alex (April 2, 2014). [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/fashion/normcore-fashion-movement-or-massive-in-joke.html "The New Normal"], ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved June 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Fiona (February 26, 2014). [http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/normcore-fashion-trend.html "Normcore: Fashion for Those Who Realize They’re One in 7 Billion"], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''. Retrieved June 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cochrane, Lauren (February 27, 2014). [https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/feb/27/normcore-the-next-big-fashion-movement "Normcore: The Next Big Fashion Movement?"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.

"Normcore," Sarah Palin, and the GOP's Big Red State Lie"], ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''. Retrieved June 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in an October 2013 report called "Youth Mode: A Report on Freedom".&lt;ref name="Guardian 17 December 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benson|first1=Richard|title=Normcore: how a spoof marketing term grew into a fashion phenomenon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/dec/17/normcore-spoof-marketing-term-fashion-phenomenon|accessdate=18 December 2014|date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tschorn, Adam (May 18, 2014).

Retrieved January 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

As used by K-HOLE, the word ''normcore'' referred to an attitude, not a particular code of dress. It was intended to mean "finding liberation in being nothing special."&lt;ref name=Dazed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/19118/1/everyones-got-normcore-totally-wrong-say-its-inventors |title=Everyone's getting normcore wrong, say its inventors |publisher=''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed]]'' |author=Gorton, Thomas |accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a piece in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine that began popularizing the term in February 2014&lt;ref name="Guardian 17 December 2014" /&gt; conflated it with "Acting Basic", another K-HOLE concept which involved dressing neutrally to avoid standing out. It was this sense of ''normcore'' which gained popular usage.&lt;ref name=Dazed /&gt; The characters featured on the television series ''[[Seinfeld]]'' are frequently cited as exemplifying the aesthetics and ethos of normcore fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Normcore: 'Seinfeld' look turns bland into fashion trend|date=March 5, 2014|first=Eun Kyung|last=Kim|work=Today.com|url=http://www.today.com/style/normcore-seinfeld-look-turns-bland-fashion-trend-2D79317923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/06/normcore_n_4912788.html|title=The &lt;em&gt;Real&lt;/em&gt; Meaning Of Normcore, The Fashion Trend That Went Oddly Viral|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word ''normcore'' was named runner-up for [[neologism]] of the year by the [[Oxford University Press]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="Guardian 17 December 2014" /&gt; It was added to the [[AP Stylebook]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP style changes take effect with debut of redesigned Stylebook|date=June 1, 2016|url=http://www.ap.org/Content/Press-Release/2016/AP-style-changes-take-effect-with-debut-of-redesigned-Stylebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion==
Normcore wearers are people who do not wish to distinguish themselves from others by their clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jun/22/end-of-the-hipster-flat-caps-and-beards |title=The End of the Hipster: How Flat Caps and Beards Stopped Being So Cool |work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Ferrier, Morwenna |date=June 21, 2014 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to mean that they are unfashionable people who wear whatever comes to hand, but that they consciously choose clothes that are practical and undistinguished – except perhaps for a visible [[label]] to impart prestige. The "normcore" trend has been interpreted as a reaction to fashion oversaturation resulting from ever faster-changing fashion trends.&lt;ref name="NZZ 30 May 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=van Rooijen|first=Jeroen|title=Trendthema "Normcore": Die Mittelpracht|url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/panorama/die-mittelpracht-1.18312015|accessdate=May 31, 2014|newspaper=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|date=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normcore clothes include everyday items of [[casual wear]] such as [[t-shirt]]s, [[hoodie]]s, [[Polo shirt|polos]], short-sleeved shirts, [[jeans]] and [[chino pants]], but not items such as [[necktie]]s or [[blouse]]s. These clothes are worn by men and women alike, making normcore a unisex style.&lt;ref name="NZZ 30 May 2014" /&gt;

Clothes that meet the "normcore" description are mainly sold by large fashion and retail chains such as [[Gap Inc.|The Gap]],&lt;ref name="Gap's normcore ads"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Franzen|first1=Carl|title=Watch David Fincher's normcore ads for The Gap|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/28/6079587/watch-david-finchers-normcore-ads-the-gap|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack &amp; Jones]], [[Superdry]], [[Jigsaw (clothing retailer) | Jigsaw]] and [[Esprit Holdings|Esprit]]. They are generally cheaply produced in East Asian countries. Many other retailers such as [[Marc O'Polo]], [[Woolrich]], [[Desigual]], [[Closed GmbH|Closed]] and [[Scotch and Soda (clothing)|Scotch &amp; Soda]] produce normcore-like clothes combined with individual design ideas.&lt;ref name="NZZ 30 May 2014" /&gt;

== Menocore ==
A variation on this concept for women has been called ''menocore'', after [[menopause]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.racked.com/2017/10/18/16453412/menocore-wealth-age-eileen-fisher|title=Dressing Older Is About Wealth|last=Bernstein|first=Sara Tatyana|date=18 October 2017|work=Racked|access-date=2017-10-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Vox Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designer brands associated with this style of dressing since the 1980s include [[Eileen Fisher]] and [[Donna Karan]].  It is loose, comfortable clothing, usually in light or neutral colors, that fits a variety of informal social situations, from [[Teacher|teaching]] to waitressing to eating lunch in a restaurant.  The style suggests that the wearer is mature and [[Self-confidence|self-confident]], that she is not seeking attention from men, and that she has [[leisure time]] and wealth.  Because of these associations, it has [[Social class|class connotations]] and can be stereotyped as a dressing style a thin woman who is middle-aged or older and already wealthy enough that she does not need the kind of lucrative employment that would require wearing either a more formal style of clothing or a [[work uniform]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The style may be adopted by women outside the stereotype as an aspirational style, to suggest that they wish to eventually attain the financial security, leisure, and other lifestyle elements available to older, wealthier women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''paranymph''' is a ceremonial assistant or [[coaching|coach]] in a ceremony. In ancient Greek weddings, the bride and bridegroom were attended by paranymphs and, from this use, it has been generalized to refer to attendants of doctoral students, best men and bridesmaids in [[wedding]]s and the like. It can refer specifically to the friend of a bridegroom tasked with accompanying him in a chariot to fetch the bride home.

An obscure use of the word is as a spokesman for the bride or bridegroom, such as [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]] towards Roxanne.

The word may also refer to a thought that is revealed only by a slip of the tongue, such as a [[Freudian slip]], or a condition where such slippage is endemic.

==The Netherlands==
In the Netherlands, paranymphs (''paranimfen'') can be present at the doctoral thesis defence. This ritual originates from the ancient concept where obtaining a doctorate was seen as a de facto marriage to the university. Furthermore the paranymphs would also act as a backup for the doctoral candidate to ask for advice when answering questions {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}. Today their role is symbolic and seen as a position of honour similar to a best man or woman at a wedding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8307">'''Philosophy of culture''' is a branch of [[philosophy]] that examines the essence and meaning of [[culture]].

==Early modern discourses==

=== German Romanticism ===
[[File:Johann gottfried herder.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johann Herder]] called attention to national cultures.]]

The German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) has formulated an individualist definition of "enlightenment" similar to the concept of ''[[bildung]]'': "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity."&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant 1784 "Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?" (German: "Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?") ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'', December (Berlin Monthly)&lt;/ref&gt;  He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: ''Sapere aude'', "Dare to be wise!"  In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality.  Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of ''bildung'': "For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Eldridge, "The German Bildung Tradition" [http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/USC/pbt1.html UNC Charlotte]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adolf Bastian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adolf Bastian]] developed a universal model of culture.]]

In 1795, the great linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests.  During the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], scholars in [[Germany]], especially those concerned with [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements—such as the nationalist struggle to create a "Germany" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]—developed a more inclusive notion of culture as "[[world view|worldview]]"(''Weltanschauung''). According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between "civilized" and "primitive" or "tribal" cultures.

In 1860, [[Adolf Bastian]] (1826–1905) argued for "the psychic unity of mankind". He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of "elementary ideas" (''Elementargedanken''); different cultures, or different "folk ideas" (''Völkergedanken''), are local modifications of the elementary ideas.&lt;ref&gt;"Adolf Bastian", ''Today in Science History''; "Adolf Bastian", ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.  [[Franz Boas]] (1858–1942) was trained in this tradition, and he brought it with him when he left Germany for the United States.

=== English Romanticism ===
[[File:Matthew Arnold - Project Gutenberg eText 16745.jpg|thumb|left|upright|British poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] viewed "culture" as the cultivation of the humanist ideal.]]

In the 19th century, humanists such as [[English people|English]] poet and essayist [[Matthew Arnold]] (1822–1888) used the word "culture" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of "the best that has been thought and said in the world."&lt;ref name=anarchy&gt;Arnold, Matthew. 1869. [http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_all.html ''Culture and Anarchy.'']&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of culture is comparable to the [[German people|German]] concept of ''bildung'': "...culture being a pursuit of our total [[perfection]] by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world."&lt;ref name=anarchy /&gt;

In practice, ''culture'' referred to an [[elite|élite]] ideal and was associated with such activities as [[art]], [[European classical music|classical music]], and [[haute cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1983), p.90. Cited in Shuker, Roy (1994). ''Understanding Popular Music'', p.5. {{ISBN|0-415-10723-7}}. argues that contemporary definitions of culture fall into three possibilities or mixture of the following three:
* "a general process of intellectual, spiritual, and aesthetic development"
* "a particular way of life, whether of a people, period, or a group"
* "the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity".&lt;/ref&gt;  As these forms were associated with urban life, "culture" was identified with "civilization" (from lat. ''civitas'', city).  Another facet of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement was an interest in [[folklore]], which led to identifying a "culture" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between [[high culture]], namely that of the [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]], and [[low culture]]. In other words, the idea of "culture" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1981, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|upright|British anthropologist [[Edward Tylor]] was one of the first English-speaking scholars to use the term culture in an inclusive and universal sense.]]

Matthew Arnold contrasted "culture" with [[anarchy]]; other Europeans, following [[philosophy|philosophers]] [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], contrasted "culture" with "the state of nature". According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between "civilized" and "uncivilized." According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to [[Herbert Spencer]]'s theory of [[Social Darwinism]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s theory of [[cultural evolution]].  Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is really an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, some critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is really an expression of the conflict between European [[colonialism|colonial powers]] and their colonial subjects.

Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and [[sophistication]] of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature.&lt;!-- i.e. American Transcendentalism?? --&gt; These critics considered [[folk music]] (as produced by "the folk", i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed [[indigenous peoples]] as "[[noble savage]]s" living [[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified [[capitalism|capitalist]] systems of [[Western culture|the West]].

In 1870 the anthropologist [[Edward Tylor]] (1832–1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the [[evolution of religion]]. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms.&lt;ref&gt;McClenon, pp.528-529&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies.  This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.

== Malaysian/Indonesian origin ==
Amok originated from the Malaysian/Indonesian word ''meng-âmuk'', which when roughly defined means "to make a furious and desperate charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hempel A. A., Levine R. D., Meloy J. D., Westermeyer J. D. | year = 2000 | title = Cross-cultural review of sudden mass assault by a single individual in the oriental and occidental cultures | url = | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 582–588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Malaysian and Indonesian cultures, amok was rooted in a deep spiritual belief.&lt;ref&gt;Van Loon, F. H. G. (1927). "Amok and Latah". Retrieved March 30, 2013 from PsychINFO. [http://huie.hsu.edu:2308/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=a71ca420-96ff-40e4-be67-3ac88801c158%40sessionmgr12&amp;hid=3&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2006-01643-010]&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that amok was caused by the ''hantu belian'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu: hantu belian|url=http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Search.aspx?k=hantu+belian|publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka|accessdate=6 November 2011|location=Malaysia|language=Malay, English|quote=hantu belian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an evil tiger spirit that entered one’s body and caused the heinous act. As a result of the belief, those in Indonesian culture tolerated amok and dealt with the after-effects with no ill will towards the assailant.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Saint Martin | first = Michael | year = 1999 | title = Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | issn = 0160-6689| pmc = 181064 | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pmid = 15014687 | pages = 66–70 | doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commonly used in a colloquial and less-violent sense, the phrase is particularly associated with a specific sociopathic [[culture-bound syndrome]] in the cultures of [[Culture of Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[Culture of Brunei|Brunei]]. In a typical case of ''running amok'', an individual (often male), having shown no previous sign of anger or any inclination to violence, will acquire a weapon (traditionally a sword or dagger, but presently any of a variety of weapons) and in a sudden frenzy, will attempt to kill or seriously injure anyone he encounters and himself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=181064|year=1999|author1=Saint Martin|first1=M. L.|title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome|journal=Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=1|issue=3|pages=66–70|pmid=15014687|doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amok typically takes place in a well populated or crowded area. Amok episodes of this kind normally end with the attacker being killed by bystanders or committing [[suicide]], eliciting theories that amok may be a form of intentional suicide in cultures where suicide is heavily stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23464 |title=Definition of Amok |publisher=Medterms.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do not commit suicide and are not killed typically lose consciousness, and upon regaining consciousness, claim amnesia.

An early Western description of the practice appears in the journals of [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]], a British explorer, who encountered amok firsthand in 1770 during a voyage around the world. Cook writes of individuals behaving in a reckless, violent manner, without cause and "indiscriminately killing and maiming villagers and animals in a frenzied attack."&lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, Y. (Ed.).(2006). Encyclopedia of multicultural psychology. University of Kansas: Sage Publications)&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely accepted explanation links amok with male [[honor]] (amok by women and children is virtually unknown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexanra Ringe|first=Carrie McLaren|title=Curious Mental Illnesses Around the World|url=http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html|publisher=stayfreemagazone.org|accessdate=March 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218053501/http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html#|archive-date=2012-12-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Running amok would thus be both a way of escaping the world (since perpetrators were normally killed or committed suicide) and re-establishing one's reputation as a man to be feared and respected.

== Contemporary syndrome ==
"Running amok" is used to refer to the behavior of someone who, in the grip of strong emotion, obtains a weapon and begins attacking people indiscriminately, often with multiple fatalities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; An episode of amok may be triggered by a period of depression or highly aggressive behavior. The slang terms ''[[going postal]]'' or ''going ballistic'' are similar in scope.
Police describe such an event as a [[spree killer|killing spree]]. If the individual is seeking death an alternate method is often "[[suicide by cop]]".

Amok is often described as a culture-bound (or culture-specific) syndrome,&lt;ref name="pmid15014687"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saint Martin ML |title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome |journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=66–70 |date=June 1999 |pmid=15014687 |pmc=181064 |doi= 10.4088/pcc.v01n0302|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1427677"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gaw AC, Bernstein RL |title=Classification of amok in DSM-IV |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=789–93 |date=August 1992 |pmid=1427677 |doi= |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1427677 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological condition whose manifestation is strongly shaped by cultural factors. Other reported culture-bound syndromes are [[latah]] and [[Penis panic|koro]]. Amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of [[dissociative disorders]] (cross-cultural variant).

== Officially classified as a psychiatric condition ==
In 1849, amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition based on numerous reports and case studies that showed the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; The modern [[DSM-IV]] method of [[classification of mental disorders]] contains two official types of amok disorder; beramok and amok. Beramok is considered to be the more common of the two and is associated with the depression and sadness resulting from a loss and the subsequent brooding process. Loss includes, but is not limited to, the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce, loss of a job, money, power, etc. Beramok is associated with mental issues of severe depression or other mood disorders. Amok, the rarer form, is believed to stem from rage, insult, or a vendetta against a person, society, or object for a wide variety of reasons. Amok has been more closely associated with psychosis, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and delusions.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

== Historical and cross-cultural comparisons ==
Early travelers in Asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers apparently facing inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death.

An example would be during the [[Battle of Bukit Chandu]] in Singapore during WWII when 41 outnumbered soldiers of the Malay Regiment, led by [[Adnan Saidi]], charged and went all out against a 13 000 strong invading Japanese Army. They continued the fight armed with just knives and bayonets for three days before they were finally defeated.

This form of amok appears to resemble the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ''[[Berserker]]'', the ''cafard'' or ''cathard'' (Polynesia), ''mal de pelea'' (Puerto Rico), and ''iich'aa'' (Navaho).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/ant100/pdf/MedicalAnthropology.pdf |title=Medical Anthropology: Culture-bound syndromes |accessdate=2009-04-29 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary [[Indonesia]], the term ''amok'' (''amuk'') generally refers not to individual violence, but to frenzied violence by mobs. Indonesians now commonly use the term 'gelap mata' (literally 'darkened eyes') to refer to individual amok. [[Laurens van der Post]] experienced the phenomenon in the East Indies and wrote in 1955:

{{quote|'Gelap mata', the Dark Eye, is an expression used in Sumatra and Java to describe a curious and disturbing social phenomenon. Socially speaking, the Malays, Sumatrans and Javanese are the best behaved people I have ever encountered. On the surface they are an extremely gentle, refined, submissive people. In fact the word 'Malay' comes from 'malu', 'gentle', and gentleness is a quality prized above all others among the Malays and their neighbours. In their family life, in their submission to traditional and parental authority, in their communal duties, they are among the most obedient people on earth. But every now and then something very disturbing happens. A man who has behaved in this obliging manner all his life and who has always done his duty by the outside world to perfection, suddenly finds it impossible to keep doing so. Overnight he revolts against goodness and dutifulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurens van der Post|van der Post, Laurens]], ''The Dark Eye in Africa'' (London, 1955), p.51-52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[Philippines]], ''amok'' also means unreasoning murderous rage by an individual. In 1876, the Spanish governor-general of the Philippines [[José Malcampo]] coined the term ''[[juramentado]]'' for the behavior (from ''juramentar'' - "to take an oath"), surviving into modern [[Philippine languages]] as ''huramentado''.&lt;ref name=Hurley14&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurley |first1=Vic |title=Swish of the Kris; The Story of the Moros |url=http://www.nikhef.nl/~tonvr/keris/keris2/swish/index.html |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |edition= |series= |volume= |issue= |date= |year=1936 |month= |origyear= |publisher=E.P.

Norse [[Berserker]]s and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] battle trance are two other examples of the tendency of certain groups to work themselves up into a killing frenzy.

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], some notable cases have occurred among the [[Rajputs]]. In 1634, the eldest son of the [[raja]] of [[Jodhpur]] ran amok at the court of [[Shah Jahan]], failing in his attack on the emperor, but killing five of his officials. During the 18th century, again, at [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] (Sind), two envoys, sent by the Jodhpur chief in regard to a quarrel between the two states, stabbed the prince and twenty-six of his suite before they themselves fell.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amuck, Running|volume=1|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schleberoda''' is a village and a former municipality in the [[Burgenlandkreis]] district, in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. Since 1 July 2009, it is part of the town [[Freyburg, Germany|Freyburg]].

It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called [[Landesausbau]] and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Schleberoda is located north of the [[Unstrut]]. It was founded as a result of intensive land development by clearance in the [[High Middle Ages]] such as other villages with ″root″ (Roda) in the name (e.g. Albersroda, Baumersorda, Schnellroda, Ebersroda and Schleberoda).    
The closely bordering local nobles in the area separated their territories using stone landmarks, as is still visible at the historic edges of the nearby woods, authentic landmarks which have been unchanged since the High Middle Ages: The clearance work and founding of new villages ran southwards from the original parish of Mücheln and ended at the Neue Göhle forest, which belonged to the territory of the [[Landgrave of Thuringia|Landgraves of Thuringia]] and could therefore not be cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linien und Säume, Zonen und Räume an der Ostgrenze des Reiches im frühen und hohen Mittelalter.|trans-title=Lines and frontiers, zones and spaces at the Eastern border of the empire of the Early and High Medieval Ages|pages=39–56|author=Hardt, Matthias|publisher=Wien|date=2000|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The forest Neue Göhle (Old Sorbian name gola = heath forest) has survived as a continuous, large forest complex. It was used for the production of pole wood in the context of [[winegrowing]] at a very early point in time, which is why it had been afforested in the form of coppice-with-standards.  Stone landmarks, ditches, banks and paths are still visible at the historic edges of this woods separated the territories of the closely bordering local nobles in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1913|language=German|trans-title=On the history of the so-called ″circular villages" in the region of Naumburg.

== Today ==
Schleberoda has retained the structures and authentic form dating from the time of its foundation. It is an examples of the land development in the contact area between [[Germans]] and [[Slavs]] in the [[High Middle Ages]]. It has been able to retain its original ground plan as a radial round village dating from the High Middle Ages.  Around the original village [[pond]], serving for fire-fighting, and the bake house, replaced at the end of the [[18th century]], forward-gabled and side-gabled buildings are grouped, some made with packed loam, with high-quality portals dating from the [[16th century|16th]] to [[19th century]]. 
The position of the former gate to the compact village settlement is still identifiable today. Including the outer boundary of the official village area is not only identifiable by a circumferential path and has survived in its original form to the north-west in the shape of an impenetrable hedge. The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] choir tower of the village church with coupled abat sons has survived.

{{essay|date=March 2012}}

A person’s '''second language''' or '''L2''' is a language that is not the [[native language]]/[[first language]]/L1 of the speaker, but is learned by the speaker after his/her native language (usually a [[foreign language]], see below). Additionally, a person’s second language can be explained as the second language in the country the speaker lives in and they may be both used in daily life. For example, [[Languages of Canada|Canada]] has two official languages (English and French) and some citizens speak and use both of them.&lt;br&gt;
A person’s dominant language, which is the language the speaker uses most or is most comfortable with, is not necessarily to be his/her first language. The second language can also be the dominant one. For example, the Canadian census defines first language for its purposes as "the first language learned in childhood and still spoken", recognizing that for some, the earliest language may be lost, a process known as [[language attrition]]. This can happen when young children move, with or without their family (because of [[immigration]] or [[international adoption]]), to a new language environment.&lt;br&gt;

==Second-language acquisition==
{{main|Second-language acquisition}}
{{Further|Theories of second-language acquisition}}
[[File:Spanish orthography.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|[[Blackboard]] used in [[Class (education)|class]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] shows [[student]]s' efforts at placing the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] and [[acute accent]] [[diacritic]]s used in the [[Spanish orthography]].]]
The distinction between '''acquiring''' and '''learning''' was made by [[Stephen Krashen]] (1982) as part of his [[Monitor Theory]]. According to Krashen, the ''acquisition'' of a language is a '''natural''' process; whereas ''learning'' a language is a '''conscious''' one. In the former, the student needs to partake in natural communicative situations. In the latter, error correction is present, as is the study of grammatical rules isolated from natural language. Not all educators in second language agree to this distinction; however, the study of how a second language is ''learned/acquired'' is referred to as ''second-language acquisition'' (SLA).

Research in SLA "...focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language... [and] a knowledge of second-language acquisition may help educational policy makers set more realistic goals for programmes for both foreign language courses and the learning of the majority language by minority language children and adults." (Spada &amp; Lightbown, p.&amp;nbsp;115).

SLA has been influenced by both linguistic and [[psychology|psychological]] theories. One of the dominant linguistic theories hypothesizes that a ''device'' or ''module'' of sorts in the brain contains innate knowledge. Many psychological theories, on the other hand, hypothesize that [[Cognition#Cognition as social process|cognitive mechanisms]], responsible for much of human learning, process language.

Other dominant theories and points of research include 2nd language acquisition studies (which examine if L1 findings can be transferred to L2 learning), verbal behaviour (the view that constructed linguistic stimuli can create a desired speech response), morpheme studies, behaviourism, error analysis, stages and order of acquisition, structuralism (approach that looks at how the basic units of language relate to each other according to their common characteristics), 1st language acquisition studies, contrastive analysis (approach where languages were examined in terms of differences and similarities) and inter-language (which describes L2 learners’ language as a rule-governed, dynamic system) (Mitchell, Myles, 2004).  
  
These theories have all influenced second-language teaching and pedagogy. There are many different methods of second-language teaching, many of which stem directly from a particular theory. Common methods are the [[grammar-translation method]], the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], the [[audio-lingual method]] (clearly influenced by audio-lingual research and the behaviourist approach), the [[Silent Way]], [[Suggestopedia]], [[community language learning]], the [[Total Physical Response method]], and the [[communicative approach]] (highly influenced by Krashen’s theories) (Doggett, 1994). Some of these approaches are more popular than others, and are viewed to be more effective. Most language teachers do not use one singular style, but will use a mix in their teaching. This provides a more balanced approach to teaching and helps students of a variety of learning styles succeed.

===Effect of age===
The defining difference between a first language (L1) and a second language (L2) is the age the person learned the language. For example, [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Eric Lenneberg]] used ''second language'' to mean [[language acquisition|a language consciously acquired]] or used by its speaker after puberty. In most cases, people never achieve the same level of fluency and comprehension in their second languages as in their first language. These views are closely associated with the [[critical period hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Mary|title=Arts of the Contact Zone|journal=Profession|year=1991|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beerten|first=Roeland |author2=Billiet, Jaak |author3=Bart Maddens|title=National Identity and Attitude Toward Foreigners in a Multinational State: A Replication|journal=International Society of Political Psychology|year=2003|volume=24|series=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Brian|title=Defining Culture in a Multicultural Environment: An Ethnography of Heritage High School|journal=American Journal of Education|date=Aug 1995|volume=103|series=4|pages=339–376|doi=10.1086/444107|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scarcella|first=Robin |author2=Krashen, Stephen D. |author3=Michael A. Long |title=Age, Rate and Eventual Attainment in Second Language Acquisition|journal=TESOL Quarterly|date=Dec 1979|volume=13|issue=4|pages=573–582|doi=10.2307/3586451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In acquiring an L2, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of six or seven seemed to be a cut-off point for [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]] to achieve native-like proficiency. After that age, L2 learners could get ''near-native-like-ness'' but their language would, while consisting of few actual errors, have enough errors to set them apart from the L1 group. The inability of some subjects to achieve native-like proficiency must be seen in relation to the ''age of onset'' (AO). Later, Hyltenstam &amp; Abrahamsson (2003) modified their age cut-offs to argue that after childhood, in general, it becomes more and more difficult to acquire native-like-ness, but that there is no cut-off point in particular.&lt;br&gt;

As we are learning more and more about the brain, there is a hypothesis that when a child is going through puberty, that is the time that accents ''start''. Before a child goes through puberty, the chemical processes in the brain are more geared towards language and social communication. Whereas after puberty, the ability for learning a language without an accent has been rerouted to function in another area of the brain—most likely in the frontal lobe area promoting cognitive functions, or in the neural system of hormone allocated for reproduction and sexual organ growth.

As far as the relationship between age and eventual attainment in SLA is concerned, Krashen, Long, and Scarcella, say that people who encounter foreign language in early age, begin natural exposure to second languages and obtain better proficiency than those who learn the second language as an adult. However, when it comes to the relationship between age and rate [[Second-language acquisition|SLA]], “Adults proceed through early stages of syntactic and morphological development faster than children (where time and exposure are held constant)” ([[Stephen Krashen|Krashen]], Long, Scarcella 573). Also, “older children acquire faster than younger children do (again, in early stages of morphological and syntactic development where time and exposure are held constant)” (573). In other words, adults and older children are fast learners when it comes to the initial stage of foreign language education.

Gauthier and Genesee (2011) have done a research which mainly focuses on the second language acquisition of internationally adopted children and results show that early experiences of one language of children can affect their ability to acquire a second language, and usually children learn their second language slower and weaker even during the critical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gauthier |first1=Karine |last2=Genesee |first2=Fred |title=Language Development in Internationally Adopted Children: A Special Case of Early Second Language Learning |journal=Child Development |date=March 2011 |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=887-901 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01578.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As for the fluency, it is better to do foreign language education at an early age, but being exposed to a foreign language since an early age causes a “weak identification” (Billiet, Maddens and Beerten 241). Such issue leads to a "double sense of national belonging," that makes one not sure of where he or she belongs to because according to Brian A. Jacob, multicultural education affects students' "relations, attitudes, and behaviors" (Jacob 364). And as children learn more and more foreign languages, children start to adapt, and get absorbed into the foreign culture that they “undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made” (Pratt 35). Due to such factors, learning foreign languages at an early age may incur one’s perspective of his or her native country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Mary|title=Arts of the Contact Zone|journal=Profession|year=1991|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Similarities and differences between learned and native proficiency===
====Speed====
Acquiring a second language can be a lifelong learning process for many. Despite persistent efforts, most learners of a second language will never become fully ''native-like'' in it, although with practice considerable fluency can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lang1234.info/2/category/accent/1.html|title=Good Accents|publisher=globe1234.com |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children by around the age of 5 have more or less mastered their first language with the exception of [[vocabulary]] and a few [[Grammar|grammatical]] structures, and the process is relatively very fast because language is a very complex skill. Moreover, if children start to learn a second language when they are 7 years old or younger, they will also be fully fluent with their second language in a faster speed comparing to the speed of learning by adults who start to learn a second language later in their life. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Newport |first2=Elissa |title=Critical period effects in second language learning: The influence of maturational state on the acquisition of English as a second language |journal=Cognitive Psychology |date=January 1989 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=60-99 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028589900030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

====Correction====
In the first language, children do not respond to systematic correction. Furthermore, children who have limited input still acquire the first language, which is a significant difference between input and output. Children are exposed to a language environment of errors and lack of correction but they end up having the capacity to figure out the grammatical rules. Error correction does not seem to have a direct influence on learning a second language. Instruction may affect the rate of learning, but the stages remain the same. Adolescents and adults who know the rule are faster than those who do not. &lt;br&gt;

In the learning of a second language the correction of errors remains a controversial topic with many differing schools of thought. Throughout the last century much advancement has been made in research on the correction of students’ errors. In the 1950s and 60s the viewpoint of the day was that all errors must be corrected at all costs. Little thought went to students’ feelings or self-esteem in regards to this constant correction (Russell, 2009).

In the 1970s Dulay and Burt’s studies showed that learners acquire grammar forms and structures in a pre-determined, inalterable order, and that teaching or correcting styles would not change this (Russell, 2009).

In this same decade Terrell (1977) did studies that showed that there were more factors to be considered in the classroom than the cognitive processing of the students (Russell, 2009). He contested that the affective side of students and their self-esteem were equally important to the teaching process (Russell, 2009).

A few years later in the 1980s, the strict grammar and corrective approach of the 1950s became obsolete. Researchers asserted that correction was often unnecessary and that instead of furthering students’ learning it was hindering them (Russell, 2009). The main concern at this time was relieving student stress and creating a warm environment for them. Stephen Krashen was a big proponent in this hands-off approach to error correction (Russell, 2009).

The 1990s brought back the familiar idea that explicit grammar instruction and error correction was indeed useful for the SLA process. At this time, more research started to be undertaken to determine exactly which kinds of corrections are the most useful for students. In 1998, Lyster concluded that “recasts” (when the teacher repeats a student’s incorrect utterance with the correct version) are not always the most useful because students do not notice the correction (Russell, 2009). His studies in 2002 showed that students learn better when teachers help students recognize and correct their own errors (Russell, 2009). Mackey, Gas and McDonough had similar findings in 2000 and attributed the success of this method to the student’s active participation in the corrective processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Victoria|title=Corrective feedback, over a decade of research since Lyster and Ranta (1997): Where do we stand today?|journal=Electronic Journal of Foreign Language Teaching|date=2009|volume=6|issue=1|pages=21–31|url=https://varussellblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/russell_eflt_2009.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Depth of knowledge====
According to [[Noam Chomsky]], children will bridge the gap between input and output by their innate grammar because the input (utterances they hear) is so poor but all children end up having complete knowledge of grammar. Chomsky calls it the [[Poverty of the stimulus|Poverty of Stimulus]]. And second language learners can do this by applying the rules they learn to the sentence-construction, for example. So learners in both their native and second language have knowledge that goes beyond what they have received, so that people can make correct utterances (phrases, sentences, questions, etc) that they have never learned or heard before.&lt;br&gt;

====Emotionality====
[[Bilingualism]] has been an advantage to today's world and being bilingual gives the opportunity to understand and communicate with people with different cultural backgrounds. However, a study done by Optiz and Degner in 2012 shows that sequential bilinguals (i.e. learn their L2 after L1) often relate themselves to the emotions more when they perceive these emotions by their first language/native language/L1, but feel less emotional when by their second language even though they know the meaning of words clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Opitz |first1=Bertram |last2=Degner |first2=Juliane |title=Emotionality in a second language: It's a matter of time |journal=Neuropsychologia |date=July 2012 |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=1961-1967 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393212001844}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional distinction between L1 and L2 indicates that the "effective valence" of words is processed less immediate in L2 because of the delayed vocabulary/lexical access to these two languages.&lt;br&gt;

====Success====
Success in language learning can be measured in two ways: likelihood and quality. First language learners ''will'' be successful in both measurements. It is inevitable that all people will learn a first language and with few exceptions, they will be fully successful. For second language learners, success is not guaranteed. For one, learners may become fossilized or ''stuck'' as it were with ungrammatical items. ([[Fossilization (linguistics)|Fossilization]] occurs when language errors become a permanent feature. See Canale &amp; Swain (1980), Johnson (1992), Selinker (1972), and Selinker and Lamendella (1978).) The difference between learners may be significant. As noted elsewhere, L2 learners rarely achieve complete ''native-like'' control of the second language. &lt;br&gt;
For L2 pronounciation, there are two principles that haven been put forth by Levis (2005). The first is nativeness which means the speakers' ability to approximately reach the speaking pattern of the second language of speakers; and the second, understanding, refers to the speaker's ability to make themselves understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levis |first1=John |title=Changing Contexts and Shifting Paradigms in Pronunciation Teaching |journal=TESOL Quarterly |date=Autumn 2005 |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=369-377 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/3588485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being successful in learning a second language can seem like a daunting task. Research has been done to look into why some students are more successful than others. Stern (1975), Rubin (1975) and Reiss (1985) are just a few of the researchers who have dedicated time to this subject. They have worked to determine what qualities make a "good language learner" (Mollica, Neussel, 1997). Some of their common findings are that a good language learner uses positive learning strategies, is an active learner who is constantly searching for meaning. Also a good language learner demonstrates a willingness to practice and use the language in real communication. He also monitors himself and his learning, has a strong drive to communicate, and has a good ear and good listening skills (Mollica, Neussel, 1997).&lt;br&gt;

Özgür and Griffiths have designed an experiment in 2013 about the relationship between different motivations and second language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Özgür |first1=Burcu |last2=Griffiths |first2=Carol |title=Second Language Motivation |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |date=25 January 2013 |volume=70 |pages=1109-1114 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813001663}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have looked at four types of motivations—intrinsic (inner feelings of learner), extrinsic (reward from outside), integrative (attitude towards learning), and instrumental (practical needs). According to the test results, the intrinsic part has been the main  motivation for these student who learn English as their second language. However, students report themselves being strongly instrumentally motivated. In conclusion, learning a second language and being successful depend on every individual.&lt;br&gt;

==Foreign language==
[[File:Ldl-wortschatz.jpg|thumb|A German student learning French. [[English language|English]] (1.5 billion learners), [[French language|French]] (82 million learners) and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (30 million learners) are the three most commonly studied foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Noack and Lazaro Gamio, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/04/23/the-worlds-languages-in-7-maps-and-charts "The world’s languages, in 7 maps and charts"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 23 April 2015 (page visited on 9 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|[[High school]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] taught as a second [[language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an [[United States|American]] [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]

In [[pedagogy]] and [[sociolinguistics]], a distinction is made between second language and foreign language, the latter is being learned for use in an area where that language is originally from another country and not spoken in the native country of the speakers. And in other words, foreign language is used from the perspective of countries; the second language is used from the perspective of individuals.

For example, arguably, [[English language|English]] in countries such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[the Philippines]], the [[Nordic countries]] and the [[Netherlands]] can be considered a second language for many of its speakers, because they learn it young and use it regularly; indeed in [[southern Asia]] it is the [[official language]] of the courts, government and business. The same can be said for [[French language|French]] in [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]], although French is nominally not an official language in any of these [[Arabic-speaking countries]]. In practice, French is widely used in a variety of contexts in these countries, and public signs are normally printed in both Arabic and French. A similar phenomenon exists in [[post-Soviet states]] such as the [[Ukraine]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]], where [[Russian language|Russian]] can be considered a second language, and there are large [[Russophone]] communities there.

However, in [[China]] (with the exception perhaps of Hong Kong), English must be considered a foreign language due to the lack of opportunities for use, such as historical links, media, conversation between people, and similar vocabulary. Likewise, French would be considered a foreign language in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]. This is despite Romanian and French being [[Romance languages]] (unlike Chinese and English, which come from two different [[language families]]: [[Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]). This is also despite Romania and Moldova being the only two countries in the world where Romanian is an official language at the national level, Romania's historical links to France, and both Romanian-speaking countries' membership in the [[Francophonie]].
== Benefits of Bilingualism ==
Psychological studies have found that speaking two or more languages is good for people's cognitive process and the differences between brains of bilinguals and single language speakers usually provides some mental benefits, according to an article on [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Merritt |first1=Anne |title=Why learn a foreign language? Benefits of bilingualism |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10126883/Why-learn-a-foreign-language-Benefits-of-bilingualism.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=19 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including but not limited to these: &lt;br&gt;
'''Becoming smarter'''&lt;br&gt;
Speaking a second language improves the functions of the brain by thinking and using the different language systems.&lt;br&gt;
'''Building multitasking skills'''&lt;br&gt;
According to a study from the Pennsylvania State University, "juggling language can make better brains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Juggling languages can build better brains |url=https://news.psu.edu/story/160653/2011/02/18/juggling-languages-can-build-better-brains |website=PennState |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because multilingual people are usually good at switching between different language systems, they can be good multitaskers as well. &lt;br&gt;
'''Improving memory'''&lt;br&gt;
The vocabulary capacity for a high school graduate student is about 45000 words, according to Nagy and Anderson (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nagy |first1=William |last2=Anderson |first2=Richard |title=How Many Words are There in Printed School English? |journal=Reading Research Quarterly |date=Spring 1984 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=304-330 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/747823.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and being a bilingual will double this number because learning a language involves memorizing rules and vocabulary.&lt;br&gt;

== Data for Further Information ==
==== Weber's Report ====
George H. J. Weber, a Swiss businessman and independent scholar, founder of the Andaman Association and creator of the encyclopedic andaman.org Web site, made a report in December 1997 about the number of secondary speakers of the world's leading languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.ignatius.edu/turner/languages.htm The World's Most Widely Spoken Languages] (reference for entire table)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm The World's 10 most influential Languages] (reference for entire table)&lt;/ref&gt; Weber used the [[Fischer Weltalmanach]] of 1986 as his only source&lt;ref&gt;Fig 6. [number of secondary speakers] is based on a table given in the Fischer Weltalamanach {{sic}} 1986, p. 910.

[[File:Sons of Norway Logo.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Sons of Norway Logo]]

'''Sons of Norway''' (''Sønner av Norge''), founded in 1895 as the '''Independent Order of the Sons of Norway''', is a [[fraternal organization]] principally representing people of [[Norwegian-American|Norwegian heritage]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The organization includes in its mission the promotion and preservation of the heritage and culture of [[Norway]] and other [[Nordic countries]] and to provide [[life insurance]] and other financial products to its members. The organization is classified as a non-profit 501(c)(8) fraternal beneficiary society.

Currently, the Sons of Norway has nearly 400 lodges in the United States, Canada and Norway. With over 57,000 members, the Sons of Norway is the largest Norwegian organization outside of Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonjax.com ''About us'' (Sons of Norway)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Establishment===
[[File:Sons-of-Norway-pins.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Vintage Sons of Norway lapel pins worn by members.]]

The Sons of Norway was founded as the Independent Order of the Sons of Norway.&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;Alvin J. Schmidt, ''Fraternal Organizations'' Westport, CT; Greenwood Press, 1980; pg. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization was founded by 18 members on January 16, 1895, in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], to insure each other when they were unable to secure life insurance on their own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl G. O. Hansen]], ''History of Sons of Norway, an American Fraternal Organization of Men and Women of Norwegian Birth or Extraction.'' Minneapolis, MN: Sons of Norway Supreme Lodge, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership was originally open to males of Norwegian descent between the ages of 20 and 50 who were capable of giving proof of being morally upright, in good health, and capable of supporting a family.

A second lodge was established in South Minneapolis in 1899 and a third was founded in the northeastern section of the city in 1900.&lt;ref name=Chrislock19&gt;Carl H. Chrislock, ''Ethnically Challenged: The Upper Midwest Norwegian-American Experience in World War I.'' Northfield, MN: Norwegian-American Historical Association, 1981; pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minneapolis model quickly spread and by the end of 1900 some 12 lodges of the organization had been established in cities and towns with substantial [[Norwegian-American]] populations across the American [[Upper Midwest]].

From its origins in Minnesota, the organization spread to both coasts.&lt;ref name=Chrislock19 /&gt; A lodge of the order was established as far away as the then American territory of [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=Chrislock19 /&gt;

In 1903 a group in [[Seattle]] asked the Midwestern group for a charter, however, they did not wish to have [[compulsory insurance]] for the members, which was [[anathema]] to the parent order. The Seattle group organized as Leif Erikson Lodge No. 1 in spite of the Midwest lodges and with other West Coast lodges set up the Grand Lodge of the Sons of Norway of the Pacific Coast. The two orders quarreled until they held a convention in [[Superior, Wisconsin]] in June 1909, merging the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Hildegarde M. Strom, [http://www.sofn.com/about_us/showPage.jsp?document=History.html "A Brief History of Sons of Norway,"] Sons of Norway, www.sofn.com/ Note that other sources indicate the two groups merged in 1912. See: Schmidt, ''Fraternal Organizations,'' pg. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the Sons of Norway claimed a membership of about 12,000.&lt;ref name=Chrislock19 /&gt;

===Development===

Originally established as a secret order, most of the ritualistic aspects of the order were removed in the early part of the twentieth century at the request of the Rev. [[Hans Gerhard Stub]], president of the [[Synod of the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Norwegian Lutheran Synod]].&lt;ref&gt;B.E. Bergson, "Sons of Norway," ''Christian Cynosure,'' vol. 47, no. 2, pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization published an official monthly magazine, ''Sønner av Norge'' (Sons of Norway), which kept members abreast of activities of the group.&lt;ref name=Chrislock19 /&gt; Other activities included regular lectures on historical, cultural, and literary topics; essay and speech contests for students; and organized festivities for various national Norwegian holidays.&lt;ref name=Chrislock19 /&gt; The Sons of Norway also worked to expand the instruction of the Norwegian language in public schools.&lt;ref name=Chrislock19 /&gt; As of the 2000s, the magazine is named "Viking".

===1938 merger===

In December 1938, the Sons of Norway absorbed the American auxiliary of The Knights of the White Cross Order (''Riddere av Det Hvite Kors'') which had been founded in [[Chicago]] in 1863.&lt;ref name="Axelrod p.231"&gt;Axelrod p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Daughters of Norway ===

Women were admitted to local groups as early as 1916, in areas where the [[female auxiliary]] was unorganized. ''Daughters of Norway'' lodges in the Midwest were merged with the Sons of Norway in 1950 and a system of junior lodges was created in 1956. The Grand Lodge of the Daughters of Norway, which dates to 1908, 
continues as a separate association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daughtersofnorway.org/about/ ''Our Organization's History,''] Grand Lodge, Daughters of Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization today ==
[[Image:SonsofNorwayMPLS.JPG|thumb|right|250 px|Sons of Norway Building in Minneapolis, Minnesota]]

The organization slowly expanded across the United States and includes lodges in Canada and Norway.  In the 2000s, Sons of Norway continues to make an effort to build on the traditions of the past while at the same time focusing on modern Norwegian-American lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofn.com/about_us/showPage.jsp?document=History.html ''A brief history of Sons of Norway'' (Sons of Norway)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Membership ===

Membership is open to everyone with an interest in Norwegian or Norwegian-American culture. Currently, the Sons of Norway has nearly 400 lodges in the United States, Canada and Norway.&lt;ref name=Schmidt /&gt; There were 90,000 members in 1995, and 64,186 members in 2010.&lt;ref name="Axelrod p.231"/&gt;

=== Insurance benefits ===

The benefits offered by the Sons of Norway have fluctuated over the years. They originally offered life, sickness and accident insurance but in 1934 restricted coverage to life insurance only. Gradually other benefits were restored.&lt;ref name="Axelrod p.231"/&gt;

==Statistics==
As of December 31, 2013:
* Total Members: 58,178 
* Members in the United States: 54,435
* Members in Canada: 2,499 
* Members in Norway: 1,244
* Lodges: 380
* Life Insurance In Force: $675,520,000
* Number Insurance Certificates in Force: 16,913
In 2013, Sons of Norway lodges and members gave more than 500,000 hours of volunteerism and $1 million to their communities. The Sons of Norway also maintains a large library of Nordic works and retirement home called ''Norse Home'' located in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref name="Axelrod p.231"/&gt;

[[File:Comic balloons 4 types 1x4.svg|thumb|The four most common speech balloons, top to bottom: speech, whisper, thought, scream.]]

'''Speech balloons''' (also '''speech bubbles''', '''dialogue balloons''' or '''word balloons''') are a graphic convention used most commonly in [[comic book]]s, [[comic]]s and [[cartoon]]s to allow words (and much less often, pictures) to be understood as representing the speech or thoughts of a given character in the comic. There is often a formal distinction between the balloon that indicates thoughts and the one that indicates words spoken aloud: the balloon that conveys thoughts is often referred to as a '''thought bubble'''.

==History==
[[Image:Strigel 1506-detail.jpg|thumb|Before the 20th century,{{specify}} speech was depicted using bands, flags, scrolls, or sheets of paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugpowder.com/andy/e.speechballoons.evolution.html Evolution of speech balloons].

[[Image:Ograbme.jpg|thumb|In this 1807 political cartoon opposing [[Embargo Act of 1807|Jefferson's Embargo]], the form and function of speech balloons is already similar to their modern use.]]
One of the earliest antecedents to the modern speech bubble were the "[[speech scroll]]s", wispy lines that connected first person speech to the mouths of the speakers in [[Mesoamerican]] art between 600 and 900 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper| author=Hull, Kerry Michael| title=Verbal Art and Performance in Ch’orti’ and Maya Hieroglyphic Writing| year=2003| url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/hullkm039/hullkm039.pdf| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012021647/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/hullkm039/hullkm039.pdf| archivedate=2006-10-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western graphic art, labels that reveal what a pictured figure is saying have appeared since at least the 13th century. These were in common European use by the early 16th century. Word balloons (also known as "banderoles") began appearing in 18th-century printed broadsides, and political cartoons from the [[American Revolution]] (including some published by [[Benjamin Franklin]]) often used them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/eighteen/ekeyinfo/erelrev.htm|title=Religion and the American Revolution, Divining America, TeacherServe®, National Humanities Center|work=rtp.nc.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA04/wood/ykid/illustrated.htm The Yellow Kid on paper and stage, Contemporary illustrations]''. Retrieved October 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They later fell out of fashion, but by 1904 had regained their popularity, although they were still considered novel enough to require explanation.&lt;ref name=ArtOfCaricature&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofcaricature00wrig#page/134/mode/2up/ The Art of Caricature], p. 134, by Grant Wright; published September 1904, by Baker &amp; Taylor Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of the [[comics]] industry in the 20th century, the appearance of speech balloons has become increasingly standardized, though the formal conventions that have evolved in different cultures (USA as opposed to Japan, for example), can be quite distinct.

[[Richard F. Outcault]]'s [[Yellow Kid]] is generally credited as the first American comic strip character. His words initially appeared on his yellow shirt, but word balloons very much like those in use today were added almost immediately, as early as 1896. By the start of the 20th century, word balloons were ubiquitous, and since that time only a very few American comic strips and comic books have relied on captions, notably [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' and the early [[Tarzan (comics)|''Tarzan'' comic strip]] in the 1930s. In Europe, where [[text comics]] were more common, speech balloons slowly caught on with well known examples like [[Alain Saint-Ogan]]'s ''[[Zig et Puce]]'' (1925), [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (1929)  and [[Rob-Vel]]'s ''[[Spirou (comics)|Spirou]]'' (1938).

==Popular forms==

===Speech bubbles===
The most common is the speech bubble. It comes in two forms for two circumstances: an in-panel character and an off-panel character. An in-panel character (one who is fully or mostly visible in the panel of the strip of comic that the reader is viewing) uses a bubble with a pointer, called a tail, directed towards the speaker.

When one character has multiple balloons within a panel, often only the balloon nearest to the speaker's head has a tail, and the others are connected to it in sequence by narrow bands. This style is often used in [[Mad Magazine]], due to its "[[call-and-response]]" dialogue-based humor.

An off-panel character (the comic book equivalent of being "off screen") has several options, some of them rather unconventional. The first is a standard speech bubble with a tail pointing toward the speaker's position. The second option, which originated in [[manga]], has the tail pointing ''into'' the bubble, instead of out. (This tail is still pointing towards the speaker.) The third option replaces the tail with a sort of bottleneck that connects with the side of the panel. It can be seen in the works of [[Marjane Satrapi]] (author of ''[[Persepolis (graphic novel)|Persepolis]]'').

In American &lt;!--- Is the description American necessary? Isn't this technique also used in manga, etc? ---&gt; comics, a bubble without a tail means that the speaker is not merely outside the reader's field of view but invisible to the [[point of view (literature)|viewpoint character]], often as an unspecified member of a crowd.

Characters distant (in space or time) from the scene of the panel can still speak, in squared bubbles without a tail; this usage, equivalent to [[voice-over]] in film, is not uncommon in American comics for dramatic contrast.  In contrast to captions, the corners of such balloons never coincide with those of the panel; for further distinction they often have a double outline, a different background color, or [[quotation mark]]s.

===Thought bubbles===
Thought bubbles come in two forms: the chain thought bubble and the "fuzzy" bubble.

The chain thought bubble is the almost universal symbol for thinking in cartoons. It consists of a large, [[cloud]]-like bubble containing the text of the thought, with a chain of increasingly smaller circular bubbles leading to the character. Some artists use an elliptical bubble instead of a cloud-shaped one.

Often animal characters like [[Snoopy]] and [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] "talk" using thought bubbles.  Thought bubbles may also be used in circumstances when a character is gagged or otherwise unable to speak.

Another, less conventional thought bubble has emerged: the "fuzzy" thought bubble. Used in manga (by such artists as [[Ken Akamatsu]]), the fuzzy bubble is roughly circular in shape (generally), but the edge of the bubble is not a line but a collection of spikes close to each other, creating the impression of fuzziness. Fuzzy thought bubbles do not use tails, and are placed near the character who is thinking. This has the advantage of reflecting the TV equivalent effect: something said with an echo.

Writers and artists can refuse to use thought bubbles, expressing the action through spoken dialogue and drawing; they are sometimes seen as an inefficient method of expressing thought because they are attached directly to the head of the thinker, unlike methods such as caption boxes, which can be used both as an expression of thought and narration while existing in an entirely different panel from the character thinking. However, they are restricted to the current viewpoint character. An example is [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', wherein during one chapter, a monologue expressed in captions serves not only to express the thoughts of a character but also the mood, status and actions of three others.

===Other forms===
The shape of a speech balloon can be used to convey further information. Common ones include the following:
*''Scream bubbles'' indicate a character is screaming or shouting, usually with a jagged outline or a thicker line which can be colored.  Their lettering is usually larger or bolder than normal.
*''Broadcast bubbles'' (also known as ''radio bubbles'') may have a jagged tail like the conventional drawing of a lightning flash and either a squared-off or jagged outline. Letters are sometimes italicised without also being bold. Broadcast bubbles indicate that the speaker is communicating through an electronic device, such as a radio or television, or is robotic.
*''Whisper bubbles'' are usually drawn with a dashed (dotted) outline, smaller font or gray lettering to indicate the tone is softer, as most speech is printed in black. &lt;BR&gt;Another form, sometimes encountered in manga, looks like an occidental thought bubble.
*''Icicle bubbles'' have jagged "icicles" on the lower edge, representing "cold" hostility.  
*''Monster bubbles'' have blood or slime dripping from them.
*''Colored bubbles'' can be used to convey the emotion that goes with the speech, such as red for anger or green for envy. This style is seldom used in modern comics. Alternatively (especially in online-published comics), colours can be used to provide an additional cue about who is speaking. Main characters often have individual thematic colours, and their speech bubbles are frequently tinted with their colour; especially in situations when there are no characters visible for speech bubbles to point to.

==Captions==
Captions are generally used for [[narration]] purposes, such as showing location and time, or conveying editorial commentary. They are generally rectangular and positioned near the edge of the panel. Often they are also colored to indicate the difference between themselves and the word balloons used by the characters, which are almost always white. Increasingly in modern comics, captions are frequently used to convey an internal monologue or typical speech.&lt;ref name=Piekos&gt;Piekos, Nate.

==Artist-specific variations==
[[Image:YellowKid.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Yellow Kid]]'s words appear on his shirt]]

Some characters and strips use highly unconventional methods of communication. Perhaps the most notable is the [[Yellow Kid]], an early [[United States|American]] [[comic strip]]. His (but not the other characters') words would appear on his large, smock-like shirt. A short-run [[Shirt Tales#TV series|American animated TV series of the early 1980s]] used this same concept, but with changing phrases on the "T-shirts" worn by the animal-based characters, depending on the characters' thoughts. 

Also noteworthy are the many variations on the form created by [[Dave Sim]] for his comic ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark]]''. Depending on the shape, size, and position of the bubble, as well as the texture and shape of the letters within it, Sim could convey large amounts of information about the speaker. This included separate bubbles for different states of mind (drunkenness, etc.), for echoes, and a special class of bubbles for one single floating apparition.

An early pioneer in experimenting with many different types of speech balloons and lettering for different types of speech was [[Walt Kelly]], in his ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' strip. Deacon Mushrat speaks in [[blackletter]], P.T. Bridgeport speaks in circus posters, Sarcophagus MacAbre speaks in condolence cards, "Mr. Pig" (a take on [[Nikita Khrushchev]]) speaks in [[faux Cyrillic]], etc.

In the famous French comic series ''[[Asterix]]'', [[René Goscinny|Goscinny]] and [[Albert Uderzo|Uderzo]] use bubbles without tails to indicate a distant or unseen speaker. They have also experimented with using different types of lettering for characters of different nationalities to indicate they speak a different language that Asterix may not understand; Goths speak in [[blackletter]], Greeks in angular lettering (though always understood by the Gaulish main characters, so it is more of an accent than a language), Norse with "Nørdic åccents", Egyptians in faux [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] (depictive illustrations and rebuses), etc. Another experiment with speech bubbles was exclusive to one book, ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''. The agent in question is a vile manipulator who creates discord in a group of people with a single innocent-sounding comment. His victims start quarreling and ultimately fighting each other while speaking in green-colored speech bubbles.

Font variation is a common tactic in comics. ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' series, written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Letterer|lettered]] by [[Todd Klein]], features many characters whose speech bubbles are written with a font that is exclusive to them. For examples, the main character, the gloomy [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]], speaks in wavy-edged bubbles, completely black, with similarly wavy white lettering. His sister, the scatterbrained and whimsical [[Delirium (DC Comics)|Delirium]] speaks in bubbles in a many-colored explosive background with uneven lettering, and the irreverent raven [[Characters of The Sandman#Matthew|Matthew]] speaks in a shaky angular kind of bubble with scratchy lettering. Other characters, such as John Dee, have special shapes of bubbles for their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/07/comics-you-should-own-sandman/|title= Comics You Should Own – ''Sandman''|first= Greg|last= Burgas|date= January 7, 2013|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140410022316/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/07/comics-you-should-own-sandman/|archivedate= April 10, 2014|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'''s recurring ''[[Monroe (comic strip)|Monroe]]'' comic strip, certain words are written larger or in unusual fonts for emphasis.

In [[manga]], there is a tendency to include the speech necessary for the storyline in balloons, while small scribbles outside the balloons add side comments, often used for irony or to show that they're said in a much smaller voice.  [[Characters of Negima (16-31)#Satsuki Yotsuba|Satsuki Yotsuba]] in the manga series [[Negima]] is notable because she speaks almost ''entirely'' in side scribble.

==Graphic symbols==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Speech bubbles are used not only to include a character's words, but also emotions, voice inflections and unspecified language.

===Punctuation marks===
One of the universal emblems of the art of comics is the use of a single punctuation mark to depict a character's emotions, much more efficiently than any possible sentence. A speech bubble with a single big [[question mark]] (?) (often drawn by hand, not counted as part of the lettering) denotes confusion or ignorance. An [[exclamation mark]] (!) indicates surprise or terror. This device is broadly used in the European comic tradition, the Belgian artist [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series being a good example. Sometimes, the punctuation marks stand alone above the character's head, with no bubble needed.

In [[manga]], the [[ellipsis]] (i.e. three dots) is also used to express silence in a much more significant way than the mere absence of bubbles. This is specially seen when a character is supposed to say something, to indicate a stunned silence or when a sarcastic comment is expected by the reader. The ellipsis, along with the big drop of sweat on the character's temple—usually depicting shame, confusion, or embarrassment caused by other people's actions—is one of the [[Japan]]ese graphic symbols that have taken root in comics all around the world, although they are still rare in Western tradition.  Japanese even has a sound effect for "deafening silence", {{nihongo|''shiin''|シーン|}}.

===Foreign languages===
In many comic books, words that would be foreign to the narration but are displayed in translation for the reader are surrounded by [[Brackets|angle brackets]] or chevrons {{angbr|like this}}.

[[Gilbert Hernandez]]'s series about [[Love and Rockets (comics)|Palomar]] is written in English, but supposed to take place mainly in a [[Hispanic]] country. Thus, what's supposed to be representations of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speech is written without brackets, but occasional actual English speech is written within brackets, to indicate that it is unintelligible to the main [[Hispanophone]] characters in the series.

Some comics will have the actual foreign language in the speech balloon, with the translation as a footnote; this is done with Latin aphorisms in ''Asterix''.

Another convention is to put the foreign speech in a distinctive lettering style; for example, [[Asterix and the Goths|''Asterix''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Goths]] speak in [[blackletter]].

Since the Japanese language uses [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|two writing directionalities]] (vertical, which is the traditional direction; and horizontal, as most other languages), manga has a convention of representing translated foreign speech as horizontal text.

===The big Z===
It is a convention in [[United States|American]] comics that the sound of a snore is represented as a series of Z's, dating back at least to [[Rudolph Dirks]]' early 20th-century strip ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Cecil. [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/42997/why-does-z-stand-for-snoring-and-how-do-other/ "The Straight Dope: Why Does Z Stand for Snoring? And how do other languages represent the sound?,"] ''Washington City Paper'' (July 27, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has even been reduced to a single letter Z, so that a speech bubble with this letter standing all alone (again, drawn by hand rather than a font type) means the character is sleeping in most humorous comics. This can be seen, for instance, in [[Charles Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strips.

Originally, the resemblance between the 'z' sound and that of a snore seemed exclusive to the [[English language]], but the spread of American comics has made it a frequent feature in other countries.  An exception to this is in Japanese manga, where the usual symbol for sleep is a large bubble coming out of the character's nose.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Megan. [https://www.wired.com/2015/05/using-emoji-wrong/ "WE’RE ALL USING THESE EMOJI WRONG,"] ''Wired'' (05.21.15).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawings within the speech bubble===
Singing characters usually have [[musical note]]s drawn into their word balloons. [[Archie Comics]]' [[Melody Valentine]], a character in their ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' comic, has musical notes drawn into her word balloons at all times, to convey that she speaks in a sing-song voice.

The above-mentioned Albert Uderzo in the ''Asterix'' series decorates speech bubbles with beautiful flowers depicting an extremely soft, sweet voice (usually  preceding a violent outburst by the same character).

A stormy cloud with a rough lightning sticking out of it, either in a bubble or just floating above the character's head as a modified 'cloudy' thought bubble, depicts anger, not always verbally expressed.

[[Light bulbs]] are sometimes used when the character comes up with an idea or solution to a problem.

In the Western world, it is common to replace profanity with a string of nonsense symbols (&amp;%$@*$#), sometimes called [[The Lexicon of Comicana|grawlixes]]. In comics that are usually addressed to children or teenagers, bad language is [[censorship|censored]] by replacing it with more or less elaborate drawings and expressionistic symbols. For example, instead of calling someone a swine, a pig is drawn in the speech bubble.

One example is the [[Spain|Spanish]] ''[[Mortadelo]]'' series, created by [[Francisco Ibáñez Talavera|Francisco Ibáñez]]. Although not specifically addressed to children, ''Mortadelo'' was born during [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[dictatorship]], when censorship was the order of the day and the slightest attempt of rough language was prohibited. When Ibáñez's characters are angry, donkey heads, lightning, lavatories, billy goats and even faux Japanese characters are often seen in their bubbles.

When ''Mortadelo'' was portrayed on film by Spanish director [[Javier Fesser]] in 2003, one of the critiques made to his otherwise successful adaptation was the character's use of words that never appeared in the comics. Fesser claimed: "When you see a bubble speech containing a lightning falling on a pig, what do you imagine the character's saying?"

==Order==
In order for comic strip and graphic novel dialogue to make sense, it has to be read in order. Thus, conventions have evolved in the order in which the communication bubbles are read. The individual bubbles are read in the order of the language. For example, in [[English language|English]], the bubbles are read from left to right in a panel, while in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], it is the other way around. Sometimes the bubbles are "stacked", with two characters having multiple bubbles, one above the other. Such stacks are read from the top down. Poor use of speech balloons can unintentionally make the proper reading order ambiguous, confusing the reader.

==Lettering==
Traditionally, a cartoonist or occupational [[letterer]] would draw in all the individual letters in the balloons and sound effects by hand.  A modern alternative, used by most comics today and universal in English-translated manga, is to letter with computer programs.  The [[font]]s used usually emulate the style of hand-lettering.

Traditionally, most mainstream comic books are lettered entirely in [[upper-case]], with a few exceptions:
* Name particles such as ''de'' and ''von'', and the "c" in a [[surname]] of Scottish or Irish origin starting with ''Mc''
* To indicate a frightened or quiet manner of speech
* An interjection such as "er", "um", etc.

When hand-lettering, upper-case lettering saves time and effort because it requires drawing only three guidelines, while mixed-case lettering requires five.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, Drew. [http://multiversitycomics.com/columns/looking-at-lettering-caps-vs-mixed-case/ "Looking at Lettering: CAPS vs Mixed Case,"] ''Multiversity Comics'' (April 22, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few comics, uppercase and lowercase are used as in ordinary writing.  Since the mid-1980s, [[mixed case]] lettering has gradually become more widely used in mainstream books. Some comics, such as ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comics)|Pearls Before Swine]]'', also use lowercase speech to mark a distinctive accent (in this case, the male crocodiles’ accented speech, opposed to all other characters who use standard uppercase speech).

From 2002–2004, [[Marvel Comics]] experimented with mixed-case lettering in all its books.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt; Most mainstream titles have since returned to traditional all upper-case lettering.

In many comics, although the lettering is entirely in capital letters, [[serif]] versions of "I" are used exclusively where a capital I would appear in normal print text, and a [[sanserif]] (i.e., a simple vertical line) is used in all other places. This reduces confusion with the number one, and also serves to indicate when the personal pronoun "I" is meant. This lettering convention can be seen in computer fonts such as [[Blambot]]'s "DigitalStrip.ttf" and "AnimeAce.ttf" fonts, which make no other distinction between lower- and uppercase letters.

==Substance of balloons==
In several occasions, comics artists have used balloons (or similar narrative devices) as if they have true substance, usually for humorous [[meta-]]like purposes. In ''[[Peanuts]]'', for example, the notes played by [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] occasionally take substance and are used in various ways, including Christmas decorations or perches for birds. Sometimes balloons can be influenced by the strip's environment: in the Italian strip ''[[Sturmtruppen]]'' they freeze and crack when the temperature is very low, or an [[Archie (comics)|Archie]] comic strip where two men from Alaska remarked on how cold it was, by saying the speech balloons froze as they said them, and the words had to be thawed out to be heard.

In the Flemish ''[[Suske en Wiske]]'' series, on one occasion a thought bubble full of mathematical formulas is cut open with scissors and its contents emptied in a bag, to be saved for later (in a manner not unlike the [[pensieve]] in the [[Harry Potter]] series). In the same series, speech balloons are occasionally even held and blown up to function as actual balloons or the words of the speech bubble are occasionally shown coming out the side of the speech bubble, to signify that the speaker is moving so fast that their words can't keep up with them, i.e. at [[supersonic]] speed.

In the novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'', the last words of a murdered Toon (cartoon character) are found under his body in the form of a speech balloon.

==Computer-generated speech balloons==
Many digital artists generate speech balloons with [[List of vector graphics editors|general-purpose illustration software]].  Products like [[Comic Book Creator]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Comic Life]] for [[Mac OS X]] and Windows target the non-professional end of the market.

{{Taoism}}
The '''Three Treasures''' or '''Three Jewels''' ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:三|三]][[Wikt:寶|寶]]|p=''sānbǎo''| w=''san-pao''}}) are basic [[virtues]] in [[Taoism]]. Although the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' originally used ''sanbao'' to mean "[[compassion]]", "[[frugality]]", and "[[humility]]", the term was later used to translate the [[Three Jewels]] ([[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]) in [[Chinese Buddhism]], and to mean the [[Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)|Three Treasures]] ([[Jing (Chinese medicine)|jing]], [[qi]], and [[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]) in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]].

==Tao Te Ching==
''Sanbao'' "three treasures" first occurs in ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' chapter 67, which [[Lin Yutang]] (1948:292) says contains [[Laozi]]'s "most beautiful teachings":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
天下皆謂我道大，似不肖。夫唯大，故似不肖。若肖久矣。其細也夫！我有三寶，持而保之。一曰慈，二曰儉，三曰不敢為天下先。慈故能勇；儉故能廣；不敢為天下先，故能成器長。今舍慈且勇；舍儉且廣；舍後且先；死矣！夫慈以戰則勝，以守則固。天將救之，以慈衛之。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Every one under heaven says that our Way is greatly like folly. But it is just because it is great, that it seems like folly. As for things that do not seem like folly — well, there can be no question about ''their'' smallness!&lt;br&gt;
Here are my three treasures. Guard and keep them! The first is pity; the second, frugality; the third, refusal to be 'foremost of all things under heaven'. &lt;br&gt;
For only he that pities is truly able to be brave; &lt;br&gt;
Only he that is frugal is able to be profuse. &lt;br&gt;
Only he that refuses to be foremost of all things &lt;br&gt;
Is truly able to become chief of all Ministers. &lt;br&gt;
At present your bravery is not based on pity, nor your profusion on frugality, nor your vanguard on your rear; and this is death. But pity cannot fight without conquering or guard without saving. Heaven arms with pity those whom it would not see destroyed. (tr. Waley 1958:225)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Arthur Waley]] describes these Three Treasures as, "The three rules that formed the practical, political side of the author's teaching (1) abstention from aggressive war and capital punishment, (2) absolute simplicity of living, (3) refusal to assert active authority."

===Chinese terminology===
The first of the Three Treasures is ''ci'' ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:慈|慈]]| p=''cí''|w=''tz'u''|l=compassion, tenderness, love, mercy, kindness, gentleness, benevolence}}), which is also a [[Classical Chinese]] term for "mother" (with "tender love, nurturing " semantic associations). ''Tao Te Ching'' chapters 18 and 19 parallel ''ci'' ("parental love") with ''xiao'' (孝 "filial love; filial piety"). [[Wing-tsit Chan]] (1963:219) believes "the first is the most important" of the Three Treasures, and compares ''ci'' with [[Confucianist]] ''ren'' (仁 "humaneness; benevolence"), which the ''Tao Te Ching'' (e.g., chapters 5 and 38) mocks.

The second is ''jian'' ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:儉|儉]]|p=''jiǎn''|w=''chien''|l=frugality, moderation, economy, restraint, be sparing}}), a practice that the ''Tao Te Ching'' (e.g., chapter 59) praises. Ellen M. Chen (1989:209) believes ''jian'' is "organically connected" with the Taoist metaphor ''[[Pu (Daoism)|pu]]'' (樸 "uncarved wood; simplicity"), and "stands for the economy of nature that does not waste anything. When applied to the moral life it stands for the simplicity of desire."

The third treasure is a six-character phrase instead of a single word: ''Bugan wei tianxia xian'' 不敢為天下先 "not dare to be first/ahead in the world". 
Chen notes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The third treasure, daring not be at the world's front, is the Taoist way to avoid premature death. To be at the world's front is to expose oneself, to render oneself vulnerable to the world's destructive forces, while to remain behind and to be humble is to allow oneself time to fully ripen and bear fruit. This is a treasure whose secret spring is the fear of losing one's life before one's time. This fear of death, out of a love for life, is indeed the key to Taoist wisdom. (1989:209) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]] version of the ''Tao Te Ching'', this traditional "Three Treasures" chapter 67 is chapter 32, following the traditional last chapter (81, 31). Based upon this early silk manuscript, Robert G. Henricks (1989:160) concludes that "Chapters 67, 68, and 69 should be read together as a unit." Besides some graphic variants and [[phonetic loan character]]s, like ''ci'' (兹 "mat, this") for ''ci'' (慈 "compassion, love", clarified with the "heart radical" 心), the most significant difference with the received text is the addition of ''heng'' (恆, "constantly, always") with "I constantly have three …" (我恆有三) instead of "I have three …" (我有三).

===English translations===
The language of the ''Tao Te Ching'' is notoriously difficult to translate, as illustrated by the diverse English renditions of "Three Treasures" below.

A consensus translation of the Three Treasures could be: [[compassion]] or [[love]], [[frugality]] or [[simplicity]], and [[humility]] or [[modesty]].

==Other meanings==
In addition to these Taoist "Three Treasures", Chinese ''sanbao'' can also refer to the [[Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)|Three Treasures]] in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] or the [[Three Jewels]] in [[Buddhism]]. [[Victor H. Mair]] (1990:110) notes that Chinese Buddhists chose the Taoist term ''sanbao'' to translate [[Sanskrit]] ''[[triratna]]'' or ''ratnatraya'' ("three jewels"), and "It is not at all strange that the Taoists would take over this widespread ancient Indian expression and use it for their own purposes."

[[Erik Zürcher]], who studied influences of Buddhist doctrinal terms in Daoism, noted (1980:115) two later meanings of ''sanbao'': ''Dao'' 道 "the Way", ''jing'' 經 "the Scriptures", and ''shi'' 師 "the Master" seems to be patterned after Buddhist usage; ''Tianbao jun'' 天寶君 "Lord of Celestial Treasure", ''Lingbao jun'' 靈寶君 "Lord of Numinous Treasure", and ''Shenbao jun'' 神寶君 "Lord of Divine Treasure" are the ''Sanyuan'' 三元 "Three Primes" of the [[Lingbao School]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3121">'''Transformative arts''' is the use of artistic activities, such as [[Storytelling|story-telling]], [[painting]], and [[Musical composition|music-making]], to precipitate constructive individual and social change.

The individual changes effected through transformative arts are commonly [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[Emotion|emotional]]. This results from the way participation in a [[Creativity|creative process]] and pursuit of an artistic practice can promote a critical re-evaluation of previously held [[Belief|beliefs]], accompanied by unfamiliar [[Feeling|feelings]], which alters [[Social perception|perception]] of the world, oneself, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Preminger, S., 2012. Transformative art: art as means for long-term neurocognitive change. Frontiers in human neuroscience, 6, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social changes effected through transformative arts occurs when this altered perception manifests in new ways of interacting with others.&lt;ref&gt;Vail, J. and Hollands, R., 2013. Creative democracy and the arts: The participatory democracy of the Amber Collective. Cultural Sociology, 7(3), pp.352-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although engagement in artistic activities has been integral to the means by which individuals and communities have sought [[Comfort|personal comfort]], [[Self-reflection|self-reflection]], and [[Group cohesiveness|group cohesion]] for thousands of years, the origin of transformative arts as a modern formal concept is commonly attributed to the work of [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldblatt, P., 2006. How John Dewey's theories underpin art and art education. Education and culture, pp.17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey espoused four main ideas around which transformative arts pivot. Firstly, art is not an object but an experience, in which one or more persons participate. Secondly, every individual is potentially an artist by way of his or her capacity to participate in this experience, through any artistic activity. Thirdly, such participation inevitably precipitates some kind of transformative change to how the participants think, feel, and [[behave]]. Fourthly, art is therefore both psychological and social, transforming not only individual intrapersonal processes, but also interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;John, D., 1934. Art as experience. New York: Minton, Balch, and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, transformative arts are facilitated by artists with the psychological purpose of promoting individual [[introspection]],&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, S.L. and Myers, C.E. eds., 2015. Therapists Creating a Cultural Tapestry: Using the Creative Therapies Across Cultures. Charles C Thomas Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; and with the social purpose of promoting [[Social_exclusion#Social_inclusion|inclusion]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], and [[social justice|justice]].&lt;ref&gt;LeBaron, M. and Sarra, J. eds., 2018. Changing Our Worlds: Arts as Transformative Practice (Vol. 12). AFRICAN SUN MeDIA.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''uncertain plural''' occurs when a writer does not know in advance whether a word should be written in the [[Grammatical number|singular]] or [[plural]].  For [[English language|English]] nouns, this may be demonstrated by enclosing the trailing ''s'' in parentheses, such as "book(s)".

In the case of articles, "they" or "their" may be used to include a single individual, when uncertain.

In [[ethics]], '''value''' denotes the degree of importance of some thing or action, with the aim of determining what actions are best to do or what way is best to live ([[normative ethics]]), or to describe the significance of different actions. Value systems are proscriptive and prescriptive beliefs, they affect ethical behavior of a person or are the basis of their intentional activities. Often primary values are strong and secondary values are suitable for changes, What makes an action valuable may in turn depend on the ethic values of the objects it increases, decreases or alters. An object with "ethic value" may be termed an "ethic or philosophic good" ([[noun]] sense).{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Values can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of actions or outcomes. As such, values reflect a person's sense of right and wrong or what "ought" to be. "Equal rights for all", "Excellence deserves admiration",  and "People should be treated with respect and [[dignity]]" are representatives of values. Values tend to influence attitudes and behavior and these types include [[ethics|ethical]]/[[morality|moral]] values, [[doctrine|doctrinal]]/[[ideology|ideological]] (religious, political) values, [[norm (sociology)|social]] values, and [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] values. It is debated whether some values that are not clearly physiologically determined, such as [[altruism]], are [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic]], and whether some, such as acquisitiveness, should be classified as [[vice]]s or [[virtue]]s.

==Types of study==
Ethical value may be regarded as a study under [[ethics]], which, in turn, may be grouped as [[philosophy]]. Similarly, ''ethical value'' may be regarded as a subgroup of a broader field of [[Values (Western philosophy)|philosophic value]] sometimes referred to as [[axiology]]. Ethical value denotes something's degree of [[importance]], with the aim of determining what action or life is best to do, or at least attempt to describe the value of different actions. 

The study of ethical value is also included in [[value theory]]. In addition, values have been studied in various disciplines: [[anthropology]], [[behavioral economics]], [[business ethics]], [[corporate governance]], [[moral philosophy]], [[political sciences]], [[social psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[theology]].

=== Similar concepts===
''Ethical value'' is sometimes used synonymously with [[Good and evil|goodness]]. However, goodness has many other meanings and may be regarded as more ambiguous.

==Personal versus cultural perspectives==
Personal values exist in relation to cultural values, either in agreement with or divergence from prevailing norms.  A culture is a social system that shares a set of common values, in which such values permit social expectations and collective understandings of the good, beautiful and constructive.  Without normative personal values, there would be no cultural reference against which to measure the virtue of individual values and so cultural identity would disintegrate.

===Personal values===

Personal values provide an internal reference for what is good, beneficial, important, useful, beautiful, desirable and constructive. Values are one of the factors that generate behaviour{{Dubious |reason=It appears to be a bold statement. It is well documented in human behavior theories (Bandura's social cognitive theory, TRA, health belief model, etc.) numerous factors may contribute to a given behavior: peer pressure, norms, access to proper infrastructure, beliefs, etc. I don't know Rokeach work, but either this statement misinterpret Rokeach work, either Rokeach is attributing too much weight on value. This bold statement should then be nuanced and provided with more theories/empirical studies. |date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Rokeach |first=Milton |authorlink=Milton Rokeach |year=1973 |title=The Nature of Human Values |location=New York |publisher=The Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influence the choices made by an individual.

Values may help  common human problems for survival by comparative rankings of value, the results of which provide answers to questions of why people do what they do and in what order they choose to do them.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} Moral, religious, and personal values, when held rigidly, may also give rise to [[conflict (process)|conflicts]] that result from a clash between differing [[world view]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Maiese, Michelle. "[http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/underlying-causes Causes of Disputes and Conflicts]." ''Beyond Intractability''. Ed. Guy Burgess and Heidi Burgess. Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado. October 2003. Downloaded 13 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time the public expression of personal values that groups of people find important in their day-to-day lives, lay the foundations of law, custom and tradition. Recent research has thereby stressed the ''implicit nature of value communication''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2368340 Common values? Fifty-Two Cases of Value Semantics Copying on Corporate Websites] by Steffen Roth. Human Systems Management 32(4) (2013): 249–65. {{doi|10.3233/HSM-130801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer behavior research proposes there are six internal values and three external values. They are known as List of Values (LOV) in management studies. They are self respect, warm relationships, sense of accomplishment, self-fulfillment, fun and enjoyment, excitement, sense of belonging, being well respected, and security. From a functional aspect these values are categorized into three and they are interpersonal relationship area, personal factors, and non-personal factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wayne D. Hoyer|author2=Deborah J. MacInnis|author3=Rik Pieters|title=Consumer Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mVuCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA395|year=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-285-40286-4|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an ethnocentric perspective, it could be assumed that a same set of values will not reflect equally between two groups of people from two countries. Though the core values are related, the processing of values can differ based on the cultural identity of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marieke de Mooij|title=Consumer Behavior and Culture: Consequences for Global Marketing and Advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMOmwgs-EQMC&amp;pg=PT40|year=2004|publisher=SAGE Publishers|isbn=978-0-7619-2669-6|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural values ===
[[File:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world]], constructed by sociopolitical scientists [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]] based on the [[World Values Survey]].]]

Individual [[culture]]s emphasize values which their members broadly share. Values of a [[society]] can often be identified by examining the level of [[honour|honor]] and respect received by various groups and ideas.  In the [[United States of America]], for example, top-level professional athletes receive more respect (measured in terms of monetary payment) than university professors. Another example is that certain voters (taken from surveys){{Citation needed|reason=No surveys have been cited in this statement|date=March 2018}} in the United States would not willingly elect an atheist as president, suggesting that believing in a God is a generally shared value.

'''Values clarification''' differs from '''cognitive [[moral education]]''':

* Value clarification consists of "helping people clarify what their [[personal life|lives]] are for and what is worth working for. It encourages students to define their own values and to understand others' values."&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;
Santrock, J.W. (2007). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development''. New York, NY: [[McGraw-Hill]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cognitive moral education builds on the belief that students should learn to value things like [[democracy]] and [[justice]] as their moral reasoning develops.&lt;ref name= "Santrock"/&gt; 
 
Values relate to the [[Norm (social)|norms of a culture]], but they are more global and intellectual than norms.  Norms provide rules for behavior in specific situations, while values identify what should be judged as [[Good and evil|good or evil]]. While norms are standards, patterns, rules and guides of expected behavior, values are abstract concepts of what is important and worthwhile. Flying the national flag on a holiday is a norm, but it reflects the value of [[patriotism]].  Wearing dark clothing and appearing solemn are normative behaviors to manifest [[respect]] at a funeral. Different cultures represent values differently and to different levels of emphasis. "Over the last three decades, traditional-age college students have shown an increased interest in personal well-being and a decreased interest in the welfare of others."&lt;ref name= "Santrock"/&gt; Values seemed to have changed, affecting the beliefs, and attitudes of the students.

Members take part in a culture even if each member's personal values do not entirely agree with some of the normative values sanctioned in that culture. This reflects an individual's ability to synthesize and extract aspects valuable to them from the multiple [[subculture]]s they belong to.

If a group member expresses a value that seriously conflicts with the group's norms, the group's authority may carry out various ways of encouraging [[conformity]] or [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]] the [[Deviance (sociology)|non-conforming behavior]] of that member. For example, imprisonment can result from conflict with social norms that the state has established as law.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}

Furthermore, institutions in the [[global economy]] can genuinely respect values which are of three kinds based on a "triangle of coherence".&lt;ref&gt;Lamy, Pascal, WTO Director-General, Speech to the European University Institute in Florence on 19 February 2011 (http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl187_e.htm)&lt;/ref&gt; In the first instance, a value may come to expression within the World Trade Organization ([[World Trade Organization|WTO]]), as well as (in the second instance) within the United Nations – particularly in the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) – providing a framework for global legitimacy through accountability. In the third instance, the expertise of member-driven international organizations and civil society depends on the incorporation of flexibility in the rules, to preserve the expression of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] in a [[globalization|globalized world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Pierre Valette-Florence|title=Marketplace Lifestyles in an Age of Social Media|year=2012|location=New York|publisher=M.E. Sharpe, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7656-2561-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}

Nonetheless, in warlike economic competition, differing views may contradict each other, particularly in the field of culture. Thus audiences in Europe may regard a movie as an artistic creation and grant it benefits from special treatment, while audiences in the United States may see it as mere entertainment, whatever its artistic merits. [[European Union|EU]] policies based on the notion of "cultural exception" can become juxtaposed with the policy of "cultural specificity" on the liberal Anglo-Saxon side. Indeed, [[international law]] traditionally treats films as property and the content of television programs as a service.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Consequently, cultural interventionist policies can find themselves opposed to the Anglo-Saxon liberal position, causing failures in international negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and transmission==
Values are generally received through cultural means, especially [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] and [[Dual inheritance theory|transmission]] or [[socialization]] from parents to children.  Parents in different cultures have different values.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; For example, parents in a [[hunter–gatherer]] society or surviving through [[subsistence agriculture]] value practical survival skills from a young age. Many such cultures begin teaching babies to use sharp tools, including knives, before their first birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_babies_work/2013/04/09/bad_parenting_ideas_that_are_actually_good_for_some_babies.html|title=Give Your Baby a Machete|last=Day|first=Nicholas|date=9 April 2013|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian parents value social and emotional abilities and having an even temperament.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; Spanish parents want their children to be sociable.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; Swedish parents value security and happiness.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; Dutch parents value independence, long attention spans, and predictable schedules.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; American parents are unusual for strongly valuing intellectual ability, especially in a narrow "book learning" sense.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; The [[Kipsigis people]] of Kenya value children who are not only smart, but who employ that intelligence in a responsible and helpful way, which they call ''ng'om''. Luos of Kenya value education and pride which they call "nyadhi".&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_babies_work/2013/04/10/parental_ethnotheories_and_how_parents_in_america_differ_from_parents_everywhere.html |title=Parental ethnotheories and how parents in America differ from parents everywhere else. |last=Day|first=Nicholas |date=10 April 2013 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors that influence the development of cultural values are summarized below.

The [[Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world]] is a two-dimensional [[Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world|cultural map]] showing the cultural values of the countries of the world along two dimensions: The ''traditional versus secular-rational values'' reflect the transition from a religious understanding of the world to a dominance of science and bureaucracy. The second dimension named ''survival values versus self-expression values'' represents the transition from industrial society to post-industrial society.&lt;ref name=wvs-old&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |title=The WVS Cultural Map of the World |publisher=WVS |author1=Ronald Inglehart |author2=Chris Welzel |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019112321/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures can be distinguished as tight and loose in relation to how much they adhere to social norms and tolerates deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pelto |first1=Pertii J. |title=The Differences between ‘Tight’ and ‘Loose’ Societies |journal=Trans-Action |date=1968 |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=37–40 |doi=10.1007/bf03180447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uz |first1=Irem |title=The Index of Cultural Tightness and Looseness Among 68 Countries |journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |date=2015 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=319–35 |doi=10.1177/0022022114563611}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tight cultures are more restrictive, with stricter disciplinary measures for norm violations while loose cultures have weaker social norms and a higher tolerance for deviant behavior. A history of threats, such as natural disasters, high population density, or vulnerability to infectious diseases, is associated with greater tightness. It has been suggested that tightness allows cultures to coordinate more effectively to survive threats.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelfand|first=Michele J.|last2=Raver|first2=Jana L.|last3=Nishii|first3=Lisa|last4=Leslie|first4=Lisa M.|last5=Lun|first5=Janetta|last6=Lim|first6=Beng Chong|display-authors=etal|date=2011-05-27|title=Differences Between Tight and Loose Cultures: A 33-Nation Study|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6033/1100|journal=Science|language=en|volume=332|issue=6033|pages=1100–1104|doi=10.1126/science.1197754|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21617077|bibcode=2011Sci...332.1100G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrington|first=Jesse R.|last2=Gelfand|first2=Michele J.|date=2014|title=Tightness–looseness across the 50 united states|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/22/7990.full.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|doi=10.1073/pnas.1317937111|pmid=|access-date=|volume=111|pages=7990–7995|pmc=4050535}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Studies in [[evolutionary psychology]] have led to similar findings. The so-called regality theory finds that war and other perceived collective dangers have a profound influence on both the psychology of individuals and on the social structure and cultural values. A dangerous environment leads to a hierarchical, authoritarian, and warlike culture, while a safe and peaceful environment fosters an egalitarian and tolerant culture.&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and forms==

===Relative or absolute===
[[Relativism|Relative]] values differ between people, and on a larger scale, between people of different cultures. On the other hand, there are theories of the existence of ''absolute values'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie/Vol%2015/Wittgenstein.pdf On Wittgenstein's Claim That Ethical Value Judgments Are Nonsense] by Arto Tukiainen. Minerva – An Internet Journal of Philosophy 15 (2011): 102–11. {{ISSN|1393-614X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can also be termed ''[[noumenal]] values'' (and not to be confused with mathematical [[absolute value]]). An absolute value can be described as [[Absolute (philosophy)|philosophically absolute]] and independent of individual and cultural views, as well as independent of whether it is known or apprehended or not. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was pessimistic towards the idea that an elucidation would ever happen regarding the absolute values of actions or objects; ''"we can speak as much as we want about "life" and "[[meaning of life|its meaning]]," and believe that what we say is important. But these are no more than expressions and can never be facts, resulting from a tendency of the mind and not the heart or the will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein's Ethical Thought|author=Yaniv Iczkovits|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2012|isbn=9781137026354|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=WCIwY41bB1kC&amp;pg=PA46  46]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intrinsic or extrinsic===
Philosophic value may be split into ''[[instrumental value]]'' and ''[[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]s''. An instrumental value is worth having as a means towards getting something else that is good (e.g., a radio is instrumentally good in order to hear music). An intrinsically valuable thing is worth for itself, not as a means to something else. It is giving value [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic and extrinsic properties]].

An ''ethic good'' with ''instrumental value'' may be termed an [[ethic mean]], and an ''ethic good'' with ''intrinsic value'' may be termed an [[end-in-itself]]. An object may be both a mean and end-in-itself.

====Summation====
Intrinsic and instrumental goods are not mutually exclusive categories.&lt;ref name=riukas&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Valu/ValuRiuk.htm Inherent and Instrumental Values in Ethics] by Stanley Riukas&lt;/ref&gt; Some objects are both good in themselves, and also good for getting other objects that are good. "Understanding science" may be such a good, being both worthwhile in and of itself, and as a means of achieving other goods. In these cases, the [[Summation|sum]] of instrumental (specifically the [[all instrumental value]]) and intrinsic value of an object may be used when putting that object in [[value system]]s, which is a set of consistent values and measures.

===Intensity===
The ''intensity'' of philosophic value is the degree it is generated or carried out, and may be regarded as the prevalence of the good, the object having the value.&lt;ref name=riukas/&gt;

It should not be confused with the amount of value per object, although the latter may vary too, e.g. because of [[instrumental value conditionality]]. For example, taking a fictional life-stance of accepting waffle-eating as being the end-in-itself, the intensity may be the speed that waffles are eaten, and is zero when no waffles are eaten, e.g. if no waffles are present. Still, each waffle that had been present would still have value, no matter if it was being eaten or not, independent on intensity.

''Instrumental value conditionality'' in this case could be exampled by every waffle not present, making them less valued by being far away rather than easily accessible.

In many [[life stances]] it is the product of value and intensity that is ultimately desirable, i.e. not only to generate value, but to generate it in large degree. [[maximization (ethics)|Maximizing]] lifestances have the highest possible intensity as an imperative.

===Positive and negative value===
There may be a distinction between positive and negative philosophic or ethic value. While positive ethic value generally correlates with something that is pursued or maximized,  negative ethic value correlates with something that is avoided or minimized.

Negative value may be both [[intrinsic negative value]] and/or [[instrumental negative value]].

===Protected value===
A ''protected value'' (also [[sacred]] value) is one that an individual is unwilling to trade off no matter what the benefits of doing so may be. For example, some people may be unwilling to kill another person, even if it means saving many others individuals. Protected values tend to be "intrinsically good", and most people can in fact imagine a scenario when trading off their most precious values would be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritov, and  Baron|first=Ilana, and Jonathan|title=Protected Values and Omission Bias|location=University of Jerusalem, University of Pennsilvanya|pages=89, 90|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers/pvom.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such trade-offs happen between two competing protected values such as killing a person and defending your family they are called ''tragic trade-offs.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tetlock|first=Philip E.|title=Thinking the unthinkable: sacred values and taboo cognitions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00135-9|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=7|pages=320–24|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00135-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protected values have been found to be play a role in protracted conflicts (e.g., the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]) because they can hinder businesslike (&lt;nowiki&gt;''utilitarian''&lt;/nowiki&gt;) negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atran|first=Scott|last2=Ginges|first2=Jeremy|date=2012-05-18|title=Religious and Sacred Imperatives in Human Conflict|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6083/855|journal=Science|language=en|volume=336|issue=6083|pages=855–57|doi=10.1126/science.1216902|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22605762}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of experimental studies directed by [[Scott Atran]] and Ángel Gómez among combatants on the [[ISIS]] frontline in Iraq and with ordinary  citizens in Western Europe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3 |title=The devoted actor’s will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |year=2017 |volume=1 |doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0193-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that commitment to sacred values motivate the most "devoted actors" to make the costliest sacrifices, including willingness to fight and die, as well as a readiness to forsake close kin and comrades for those values if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutson |first=Mathew |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-do-people-die-fighting-cause |title=Why do people die fighting for a cause? |work=Science  |date=September 5, 2017 |accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of [[utilitarianism]], protected values are [[bias]]es when they prevent utility from being maximized across individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baron, Jonathan|first=Ilana, Ritov|title=Protected Values and omissions Bias as Deontological Judgements|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Inc.|pages=134–35|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers/plm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jonathan Baron]] and Mark Spranca,&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Jonathan and Spranca, Mark (1997). "Protected values". ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes''. '''70'''(1), 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; protected values arise from [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s as described in theories of [[deontological ethics]] (the latter often being referred to in context with [[Immanuel Kant]]). The protectedness implies that people are concerned with their participation in transactions rather than just the consequences of it.

==Value system==
A ''value system'' is a set of [[consistent]] values used for the purpose of [[ethical]] or [[ideological]] [[integrity]].

===Consistency===
As a member of a society, group or community, an individual can hold both a personal value system and a communal value system at the same time. In this case, the two value systems (one personal and one communal) are '''externally [[Consistency|consistent]]''' provided they bear no contradictions or situational exceptions between them.

A value system in its own right is '''internally consistent''' when
* its values ''do not contradict'' each other and
* its exceptions are or could be
** ''abstract'' enough to be used in all situations and
** ''consistently'' applied.

Conversely, a value system by itself is '''internally inconsistent''' if:
* its values ''contradict'' each other and
* its exceptions are
** highly ''situational'' and
** ''inconsistently'' applied.

===Value exceptions===
'''Abstract''' exceptions serve to reinforce the ranking of values. Their definitions are generalized enough to be relevant to any and all situations. '''Situational''' exceptions, on the other hand, are ad hoc and pertain only to specific situations. The presence of a type of exception determines one of two more kinds of value systems:
* An '''idealized''' value system is a listing of values that lacks exceptions. It is, therefore, absolute and can be codified as a strict set of proscriptions on behavior. Those who hold to their idealized value system and claim no exceptions (other than the default) are called ''absolutists''.
* A '''realized''' value system contains exceptions to resolve contradictions between values in practical circumstances. This type is what people tend to use in daily life.

The difference between these two types of systems can be seen when people state that they hold one value system yet in practice deviate from it, thus holding a different value system. For example, a [[religion]] lists an absolute set of values while the practice of that religion may include exceptions.

Implicit exceptions bring about a third type of value system called a '''formal''' value system. Whether idealized or realized, this type contains an implicit exception associated with each value: "as long as no higher-priority value is violated". For instance, a person might feel that lying is wrong. Since preserving a life is probably more highly valued than adhering to the principle that lying is wrong, lying to save someone’s life is acceptable. Perhaps too simplistic in practice, such a hierarchical structure may warrant explicit exceptions.

===Conflict===
Although sharing a set of common values, like hockey is better than baseball or ice cream is better than fruit, two different parties might not rank those values equally. Also, two parties might disagree as to certain actions are [[Right (ethics)|right]] or [[wrongdoing|wrong]], both in theory and in practice, and find themselves in an [[ideological]] or physical conflict. [[Ethonomics]], the discipline of rigorously examining and comparing value systems{{Citation needed|reason=No citation for this as the true definition|date=June 2017}}, enables us to understand [[politics]] and motivations more fully in order to resolve conflicts.

An example conflict would be a value system based on [[individualism]] pitted against a value system based on [[collectivism]]. A rational value system organized to resolve the conflict between two such value systems might take the form below. Note that added exceptions can become [[recursion|recursive]] and often convoluted.
* ''Individuals may act freely unless their actions harm others or interfere with others' freedom or with functions of society that individuals need, provided those functions do not themselves interfere with these proscribed individual rights and were agreed to by a majority of the individuals.''
* ''A society (or more specifically the system of order that enables the workings of a society) exists for the purpose of benefiting the lives of the individuals who are members of that society. The functions of a society in providing such benefits would be those agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society.''
* ''A society may require contributions from its members in order for them to benefit from the services provided by the society. The failure of individuals to make such required contributions could be considered a reason to deny those benefits to them, although a society could elect to consider hardship situations in determining how much should be contributed.''
* ''A society may restrict behavior of individuals who are members of the society only for the purpose of performing its designated functions agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society, only insofar as they violate the aforementioned values. This means that a society may abrogate the rights of any of its members who fails to uphold the aforementioned values.''

==Economic and philosophic value==
{{Further|Value (economics)}}
Philosophical value is distinguished from [[economic value]], since it is independent on some other desired condition or commodity. The economic value of an object may rise when the exchangeable desired condition or commodity, e.g. money, become high in supply, and vice versa when supply of money becomes low.

Nevertheless, economic value may be regarded as a result of philosophical value. In the [[subjective theory of value]], the [[personal philosophic value]] a person puts in possessing something is reflected in what economic value this person puts on it. The limit where a person considers to purchase something may be regarded as the point where the ''personal philosophic value'' of possessing something exceeds the personal philosophic value of what is given up in exchange for it, e.g. money. In this light, everything can be said to have a "personal economic value" in contrast to its "societal economic value."

'''Vernacular orientation''' refers to the status that a language is afforded by one of its [[mother-tongue]] speakers (Tiessen, 2003).  This status is exhibited through the [[sociolinguistic]] behaviours of a mother-tongue speaker.  A speaker who exhibits positive [[vernacular]] orientation is one who exhibits a preferred status for their mother tongue in such things as patterns of language use, language attitudes, [[social network]]s and even levels of [[language proficiency]].  Likewise, a speaker who exhibits negative vernacular orientation is one who exhibits a preferred status for a language other than their mother tongue in these areas of sociolinguistic behaviour.

An example of research into vernacular orientation as expressed in a community can be found at [http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/linguistics/theses/2003Tiessen.PDF].  This is a study on vernacular orientation in the [[Talysh people|Talysh]] community of the city of [[Sumgayit]] in the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] for the purpose of gaining a greater understanding of its causes.  Vernacular orientation is described in three areas of sociolinguistic behaviour: patterns of vernacular language use, vernacular language proficiency and frequency of vernacular-speaking individuals in social networks. Data was collected through personal interviews. The questionnaires for these interviews were developed using a qualitative-relational research approach. The description of vernacular orientation takes the form of a criteria-based typology of which an analysis of influential factors is ultimately made. This analysis of influential factors demonstrates the interaction between vernacular orientation as described in the typology and the contextual elements of the family, socio-economic dynamics and individual attitudes.

World-Information Institute (WII) is an independent cultural institution located in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] linking research and public discourse in the realms of innovation, digital culture technologies, and society. Its vast documentation and processing of digital media technologies sheds light on the future perspectives of global developments and involves complex and heterogeneous information resources.

World-Information Institute forms part of an international network of partner institutions and experts in the fields of information and communication technologies and their social implications.

WII’s main fields of research are a politics of the commons (and, from this perspective: problems of intellectual property regimes), new forms of cultural production, politics of search and organization of knowledge, surveillance technologies, big data and visualization, cultural and media policies. A recent example of an activity to further develop cultural and media policies is “Netzpolitischer Konvent” (Convention of the Austrian civil society on net politics),&lt;ref&gt;https://npk.servus.at/ (in German), retrieved: 16-09-2013&lt;/ref&gt; in which a catalogue of demands was drafted and subsequently presented to the public.

WII's main projects include:

=== World-Information.Org series of projects - launched Brussels 2000 ===
World-Information.Org was launched as the main media project of the [[European Capital of Culture]] 2000 in Brussels. The social, cultural and political dimensions of the new information and communication technologies were discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerin.at/dyn/heft.php?id=10&amp;pos=3&amp;textid=110&amp;lang=de Springerin – Hefte für Gegenwartskunst, Heft 3/00] (in German, retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The World-Information exhibition presented objects and research results on topics such as the history of modern communication technologies, the "big players" in the IT industry, financial networks or human rights. The program was completed by the "World-InfoCon" conference. Most resources are available on the world-information.org page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://world-information.org/wio/program/brussels2000/events/1032966488/993056460/objects/993056638/993056659 World Infostructure Exhibition] (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;
The first presentation was followed by a series of conferences and exhibitions in Vienna ([[Technisches Museum Wien]], 2000 &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/program/vienna (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;), Amsterdam (Oude Kerk and [[De Balie]] Centre for Culture and Politics, 2002 &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/program/amsterdam (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;), Novi Sad / Belgrade ([[Museum of Vojvodina]], [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade]], 2003 &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/program/serbia (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;), Bangalore (2005 &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/program/bangalore (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;) and Paris (as part of the festival "Futur en Seine", 2009 &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/program/paris/events/1242060832/1242061298 (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Deep Search (I) - Vienna 2008 ===

The "Deep Search" conference critically dealt with "the social and political dimensions of how we navigate the deep seas of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/wii/deep_search/en/book/deepsearch-book_en/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Critically analyzing a situation in which [[Google_Search|Google]] assumes a monopoly-like position in the field of search in many countries around the world, the conference asked questions as: „How is computer readable significance produced, how is meaning involved in machine communication? Where is the emancipatory potential of having access to such vast amounts of information? What are the dangers of our reliance on search engines? And are there any approaches that do not follow the currently dominating paradigm of [[Google_Search|Google]]?“ &lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical Strategies in Art and Media - New York 2009 ===

This conference on the future of cultural freedom and cultural intelligence in digital theory and practice &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/wii/critical_strategies/en (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; took place at the [[Austrian Cultural Forum New York]]. It followed attempts to go beyound the obsolete models of the artist/author as genius and searched for collective and collaborative practices that could invent new terrains and flows. New kinds of 'virtual' spaces and their role for critical cultural practices were discussed. The conference also aimed at developing strategies that could elude being instrumentalized by the creative industries in their „seemingly infinite appetite for things radical“. &lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deep Search (II) - Vienna 2010 ===

The debate on the policies of searching continued 2010 with the conference "Deep Search II": "The automatic classification of data, its indexing, and its evaluation are at the heart of new communication environments. What lies beneath is not just a drive to organize the world's information, but also to classify human relations: from the management of the modern workplace and consumers in mass societies, to the bio-political management of the network society."&lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/wii/deep_search2/en/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shared Digital Futures - Vienna 2013 ===

The conference "Shared Digital Futures" &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.net/sdf/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; dealt with the impact of digital networking technologies to the production of culture and examined about the new role of the artwork as the same end product and raw material for further production of culture, models for sustainable funding of Commons, new forms of collective authorship and the opportunities opened by the blurring of boundaries between artists and audiences.

=== Information as a reality - Linz, 2014 ===

The conference and exhibition "Information as a reality" &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.net/iar/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; in cooperation with the magazine [[:de:Springerin|Springerin]] and with [[Ars Electronica]] at the [[Lentos Art Museum]] in Linz dealt with critical cultural practices in digital networks and the increasing change of social reality by digital models and virtual information regimes. Cultural workers have played an important pioneering role in the colonization of digital worlds. What role can they assume now, 20 years after the emergence of the Internet?

=== Digital Clouds and Urban Spaces - Vienna 2014 ===

The conference "Digital Clouds and Urban Spaces" &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.net/digital-clouds/ (retrieved: 08-10-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Architekturzentrum Wien]] focused on [[Smart Cities]] and the city as an information system where urbanity is increasingly shaped by networks of informational technologies. The conference took account to the fact, that this does not only apply to phenomena as traffic control systems or planning models, but that the world of work, social spaces and cultural processes are also subject to substantial transformations related to these developments. Before this backdrop, the conference questioned the simplistic promises made by global corporations and their technologies to render cities more efficient, safer and cleaner.

=== Critical Net Practice – Vienna 2015 ===

In a cooperation with the magazine [[:de:Springerin|Springerin]] World-Information Institute revisited 20 years of net culture. The resulting texts formed the main part of issue XXI/1 (winter 2015) of the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springerin.at/dyn/heft.php?id=87&amp;pos=0&amp;textid=0&amp;lang=en (retrieved: 21-09-2016). The English version of Mission interconnectedness. A roundtable on 20 years of Net culture with Konrad Becker, Josephine Berry Slater, Felix Stalder, Pauline van Mourik Broekman, is also available at http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2015-03-17-becker-en.html (retrieved: 21-09-2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Issue Presentation (MAK – [[Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna]]): Critical Net Practice: Information as a reality? &lt;ref&gt;http://mak.at/jart/prj3/mak-resp/main.jart?reserve-mode=active&amp;rel=de&amp;content-id=1343388632770&amp;article_id=1419146574316 (in German, retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Jumper / Band XXI, No. 1, Winter 2015.

=== Algorithmic Regimes - Vienna 2015/2016 ===

The international conference and event series "Algorithmic Regimes" &lt;ref&gt;A brief description of all project parts with links to documentation videos can be found at http://world-information.net/algorithmic-regimes-and-generative-strategies/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016).&lt;/ref&gt; examined the growing influence of digital control systems and their cascading effects of powerful effect on cultural and social realities. In addition to the conference, the event „Algorithms are no Angels“ with [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]] und Graham Harwood, a Videointerview with Stefano Harney, and an audiovisual evening about the power of algorithms were conducted, that presented an annotated remix of film clips and documentaries,&lt;ref&gt;The playlist can be found at http://world-information.net/screening-the-algorithmic/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016).&lt;/ref&gt; relating to automated control systems.

=== Wahlkabine.at ===
Wahlkabine.at was founded in 2002 by the Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0 and was presented for the first time during the National Council elections in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;"WWWahlspielchen", Falter 45/02 (November 2002), p. 21. The article is not available in the newspaper's online archive, which goes back only to the year 2005, download scan: http://wahlkabine.at/presse/falter2002/filedownload (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; The online polling-booth sees itself as an instrument of political education, which encourages the users to deal with political content in a playful way and provides factual information and feedback opportunities.

Given the fact that increasing personalization nowadays replaces more and more the political content, Wahlkabine.at considers the publication of all party-programs and their scientific contextualization as a fundamental tool for political participation as well as a revealing resource collection for personal reflection on the voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "Why wahlkabine.at?" at: http://wahlkabine.at/ueber/Infofolder_wahlkabine_ENGL.pdf/attachment_download/file (retrieved 08-10-2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Wahlkabine.at focuses on elections on Austrian national and regional levels and on EU-level (European Parliament), but also includes elections of the Austrian National Student Union and a few individual cases (e.g. Austrian Economic Chambers / Sector Information and Consulting 2010).&lt;ref&gt;For a list of all elections covered, cf. http://wahlkabine.at/archiv (in German), retrieved: 16-09-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of regional elections in Vienna in autumn 2015 (with an electorate of approximately 1.14 million eligible voters) 160,000 users visited the online polling booth.&lt;ref&gt;http://wahlkabine.at/ltw2015wien/schlussauswertungltw2015wien/ (in German, retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future Non Stop ===
Future Non Stop – started as a project in 2010, online since 2012 – is an extensive archive and an experiment in logics of navigating information: “Based on an extensive archive going back to 1994 the site collects materials that serve as important reference documents in the field of new media, politics, and art and makes them accessible to a wider public. Instead of a hierarchically structured archive an experimental navigation interface opens up new ways to explore large information nodes. Documents are associated by a range of tag that allow to filter relevance according to topics and issue relations. ASCR, short for Advanced Semantic Content Repository, is the open source information architecture and "editing back end" of Future Non Stop.” &lt;ref&gt;http://future-nonstop.org/ (retrieved: 22-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initiatives / Sub-organizations and their Projects ==

===Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0===
[[File:Wio-savethedigitale-cology.jpg|thumb|left|Save the Digital Ecology/ Vienna 2000]]
The '''Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0''' was established in 1993 as an arts and culture related international competence platform for the critical use of information and communication technologies. Over the years it has pursued a broad range of transdisciplinary activities. From producing and hosting infrastructure to organizing conferences, festivals and exhibitions, local interventions and skill transfer, as well as international research and publishing. [[Konrad Becker]] and Francisco de Sousa Webber, who founded the institute, currently form the board of directors together with [[:de:Felix Stalder|Felix Stalder]].

When the founders of the Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0 set up a web server (in an unofficially tolerated act of ‘misuse’ of the underemployed Internet server of Vienna’s general hospital AKH) in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Francisco de Sousa Webber: "Building a Netbase from Scratch", in: Branka Ćurčić / Zoran Pantelić / New Media Center_kuda.org (Eds.): ‘’Public Netbase: Non Stop Future - New Practices in Art and Media’’, Frankfurt a. M. (Revolver), 2008, online: http://nonstop-future.org/txt?tid=195606bfd5f57eb46cbc3100ef62ff0c, retrieved: 18-07-2013&lt;/ref&gt; they created one of the first arts and culture-related sites on the emerging World Wide Web.

The institute has been conceptualised as a platform from which independent initiatives and organizations could emerge. The first of these initiatives was [[Public Netbase]] – now an ‘historical example’ of an early new media organization in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Clemens Apprich / Felix Stalder (Hrsg.): ''Vergessene Zukunft. Radikale Netzkulturen in Europa.'' transcript, Bielefeld 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-8376-1906-5}} (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1994, it was located in Messepalast, the predecessor of Vienna’s [[Museumsquartier]]. It combined various functions and activities: It was a non-profit Internet service provider that facilitated internet access mainly for the independent arts and cultural sector. This was accompanied by a program of workshops and courses to develop media competence. Public Netbase became a social space for this emerging scene of artists, techheads, activists etc., and ran an almost daily evening program of discussions, presentations, screenings and music events. In addition to these grassroots activities international exhibitions and conferences were conducted.&lt;ref&gt;For the period 1995-1999 press coverage - mainly in Austria, but also in international newspapers and magazines, e.g. [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], Kunstforum International, [[The Daily Telegraph]], [[Mute (magazine)|Mute]], [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[Telepolis]], [[The New York Times]] and Artbyte.The Magazine of Digital Arts - has been documented by t0: http://www.t0.or.at/1995.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1996.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1997.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1998.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1999.htm, retrieved: 04-12-2013, mostly in German&lt;/ref&gt; Public Netbase used to be t0’s main initiative until it had to be discontinued due to lack of funding (which was a result of repression by the Austrian right-wing government &lt;ref&gt;Subsidies by the federal government had made up a main part of Public Netbase’s funds before, cf. Robert Harauer / MEDIACULT (ed.): ''Digital Culture in Europe. A selective inventory of centres of innovation in the arts and new technologies'', Strasbourg (Council of Europe), 1999, pp. 14-17 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=FHkk5HfkcD4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cyberculture+en+Europe&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Waw2UqHAA-Hh4QSW7oCgAQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Cyberculture%20en%20Europe&amp;f=false in Google books]))&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006.

But already in 1999 the next initiative had been founded: World-Information.Org (WIO). It was presented – under the patronage of [[UNESCO]] &lt;ref&gt;Cf. "The Exhibition 'World-Information.Org', Public Netbase t0", new media center_kuda.org, 28.07.2013, online: http://www.kuda.org/en/exhibition-world-informationorg-public-netbase-t0, retrieved: 16-09-2013, and F.E.Rakuschan, “Weltinformationsordnung 2.0”, [[Telepolis]] 28.11.2000 (in German), http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/4/4350/1.html, retrieved 16-09-2013)&lt;/ref&gt; – as the lead project of the New-Media-program of the Brussels 2000 [[European Capital of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tacticalmediafiles.net/events/4724/World_Information-Brussels (retrieved: 08-10-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; WIO resembles an intelligence agency, that collects and analyses information, but not in the interest of a state or as a think tank for corporate businesses, but for the independent cultural sector. Starting from the Brussels project, a series of international exhibitions and conferences has been developed.
World-Information Institute (WII) is WIO’s research department. In addition to conducting research, it continues the program of international conferences and the activities to further develop culture and media policies. In addition, on the Austrian national level, wahlkabine.at was founded in 2002 and became Austria’s most prominent online “polling booth”.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. coverage by Austrian media documented at http://wahlkabine.at/presse, retrieved: 16-09-2013, Cf. e.g. „Wenig Übereinstimmung zwischen SPÖ und ÖVP“ ([[Der Standard|derStandard.at]], 19.08.2013, http://derstandard.at/1376533958426/wahlkabineat-Wenig-Uebereinstimmung-zwischen-SPOe-und-OeVP, retrieved: 04-12-2013, in German), „Wahlkabine.at bietet Entscheidungshilfe“ (ORF Zeit im Bild 1, 17.08.2013; ZiB1 is the main evening TV-newscast of the Austrian public broadcasting corporation [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]].

Since 2010, Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0 has developed the ‘living archive’ Future Non Stop,&lt;ref&gt;http://future-nonstop.org/, retrieved: 04-12-2013&lt;/ref&gt; in which all its activities are documented, which makes it a valuable resource covering twenty years of activities in new media art, net culture and participatory use and critical analyses of new technologies, digital networks and the World Wide Web.

Across all these activities, t0 has closely collaborated with groups and organizations such as [[Critical Art Ensemble]], [[RTMark]], [[The Yes Men]], [[De Balie]], Kuda.org, De Waag, [[Adbusters]], [[Institute for Applied Autonomy]], [[The Sarai Programme at CSDS|Sarai (Media Lab)]], [[Federal Agency for Civic Education|Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung]], [[V2 Institute for the Unstable Media]], [[0100101110101101.ORG]] and [[Nettime]].

=== Public Netbase ===
[[Image:Netbase 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Netbase, media~space]]
[[Public Netbase]] was initiated by the Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0 in the Vienna [[Museumsquartier]] in 1994 as a non-profit internet provider and a platform for the participatory use of information and communication technology. With its WWW-server as well as with its workshops, instruction courses, and educational events for the broad public, Public Netbase contributed continually to the evolution of a lively internet scene and a heightened consciousness for the implications of the new communication and information technologies.

As a focal point of European and international art, culture, and media networks, the Viennese net culture institute attempted to develop an understanding for the manifold opportunities and the potential of new communication media, but also to look critically at a society that is increasingly determined by technology.

In addition to the series of workshops and discussions the activities of Public Netbase included, among other, projects that combined exhibitions, conferences and workshops (e.g. Synworld playwork:hyperspace&lt;ref&gt;http://synworld.t0.or.at/, retrieved: 16-09-2013&lt;/ref&gt; (1999) and Free Bitflows &lt;ref&gt;http://freebitflows.t0.or.at/, retrieved: 16-09-2013, http://v2.nl/events/free-bitflows/, retrieved: 16-09-2013&lt;/ref&gt; (2004)), projects in public space (nikeground&lt;ref&gt;http://www.t0.or.at/nikeground, retrieved: 16-09-2013; cf.

Public Netbase was very active in the resistance movements against the Austrian right-wing government, that came into power beginning of 2000 and included Jörg Haider’s Freedom Party (FPÖ). An own strand of activities derived from this (e.g. government-austria.at &lt;ref&gt;http://government-austria.at/, retrieved: 11-07-2013&lt;/ref&gt; (2000/2001)) and elements of political activism became stronger across all strands of activities.
