      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8835">[[File:Everyone has Influenza - The Round of Doctors and Druggists.jpg|thumb|300px|The January 12, 1890, edition of the Paris satirical magazine ''[[Le Grelot]]'' depicted an unfortunate influenza sufferer bowled along by a parade of doctors, druggists, skeleton musicians and dancing girls representing [[quinine]] and [[antipyrine]]]] 
The '''1889–1890 flu pandemic''' (October 1889 – December 1890, with recurrences March – June 1891, November 1891 – June 1892, winter 1893–1894 and early 1895) was a deadly [[influenza pandemic]] that killed about 1 million people worldwide. The outbreak was dubbed "Asiatic flu" or "Russian flu" (not to be confused with the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1#Russian flu|1977–1978 epidemic]] caused by Influenza A/USSR/90/77 [[H1N1]], which was also called Russian flu). For some time the virus strain responsible was conjectured (but not proven) to be [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2]].{{sfn|Hilleman|2002|p=3068}}{{sfn|Madrigal|2010}} More recently, the strain was asserted to be [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N8]].{{sfn|Valleron|Cori|Valtat|Meurisse|2010|}}

==Outbreak and spread==
Modern transport infrastructure assisted the spread of the 1889 influenza. The 19 largest European countries, including the [[Russian Empire]], had 202,887&amp;nbsp;km of railroads and transatlantic travel by boat took less than six days (not significantly different than current travel time by air, given the time scale of the global spread of a pandemic).{{sfn|Valleron|Cori|Valtat|Meurisse|2010|}}

The pandemic was first recorded in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia in December 1889. In four months it had spread throughout the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Deaths peaked in Saint Petersburg on December 1, 1889, and in the United States during the week of January 12, 1890. The median time between the first reported case and peak mortality was five weeks.{{sfn|Valleron|Cori|Valtat|Meurisse|2010|}}

==Identification of virus subtype responsible==
Researchers have tried for many years to identify the subtypes of [[Influenza A]] responsible for the 1889–1890, 1898–1900 and [[1918 flu pandemic|1918]] epidemics. Initially, this work was primarily based on "seroarcheology"—the detection of antibodies to influenza infection in the sera of elderly people—and it was thought that the 1889–1890 pandemic was caused by Influenza A subtype H2, the 1898–1900 epidemic by subtype H3, and the 1918 pandemic by subtype H1.{{sfn|Dowdle|1999|page=820}} With the confirmation of [[H1N1]] as the cause of the [[1918 flu pandemic]] following identification of H1N1 antibodies in exhumed corpses,{{sfn|Dowdle|1999|page=821}} reanalysis of seroarcheological data has indicated that Influenza A subtype H3 (possibly the [[H3N8]] subtype), is the most likely cause for the 1889–1890 pandemic.{{sfn|Valleron|Cori|Valtat|Meurisse|2010|}}{{sfn|Dowdle|1999|page=825}}

'''Africa''' is the world's second largest and second most-populous [[continent]] (behind [[Asia]] in both categories). At about 30.3 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (11.7 million square&amp;nbsp;miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of [[Earth|Earth's]] total surface area and 20% of its land area.&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;Sayre, April Pulley (1999), ''Africa'', Twenty-First Century Books. {{ISBN|0-7613-1367-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With
{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Africa}}|R}}/1e9 round 1}} billion people{{UN_Population|ref}} as of {{UN_Population|Year}}, it accounts for about 16% of the world's [[human population]]. The continent is surrounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the north, the [[Isthmus of Suez]] and the [[Red Sea]] to the northeast, the [[Indian Ocean]] to the southeast and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. The continent includes [[Madagascar]] and various [[archipelagos]]. It contains 54 [[diplomatic recognition|fully recognised]] [[sovereign states]] ([[country|countries]]), nine [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]] and two ''[[de facto]]'' independent [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited or no recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa]].&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the continent and its countries are in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], with a substantial portion and number of countries in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

Africa hosts a large diversity of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|ethnicities]], cultures and [[Languages of Africa|languages]]. In the [[New Imperialism|late 19th century]], European countries [[Scramble for Africa|colonised almost all of Africa]]; most present states in Africa originated from a process of [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonisation]] in the 20th century. African nations cooperate through the establishment of the [[African Union]], which is headquartered in [[Addis Ababa]].

Under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, [[Carthage]] became the capital of the province it then named ''[[Africa Proconsularis]]'', following its defeat of the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] in the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC, which also included the coastal part of modern [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultsos.com/pandora/africa.htm|title=Consultos.com etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin suffix ''[[wikt:-ica#Latin|-ica]]'' can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in ''[[Gallia Celtica|Celtica]]'' from ''[[Celts|Celtae]]'', as used by [[Julius Caesar]]). The later Muslim region of [[Ifriqiya]], following its conquest of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine (Eastern Roman)]] Empire's ''[[Exarchate of Africa|Exarchatus Africae]]'', also preserved a form of the name.

According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while "Asia" was used to refer to [[Anatolia]] and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer [[Ptolemy]] (85–165 AD), indicating [[Alexandria]] along the [[Prime Meridian]] and making the isthmus of Suez and the [[Red Sea]] the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of "Africa" expanded with their knowledge.

Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name "Africa":
* The 1st-century Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (''Ant. 1.15'') asserted that it was named for [[Epher]], grandson of [[Abraham]] according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.
* [[Isidore of Seville]] in his 7th-century ''[[Etymologiae]]'' XIV.5.2. suggests "Africa comes from the [[Latin]] ''aprica'', meaning "sunny".
* Massey, in 1881, stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian ''af-rui-ka'', meaning "to turn toward the opening of the Ka." The [[Egyptian soul#Ka|Ka]] is the energetic double of every person and the "opening of the Ka" refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, "the birthplace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gerald-massey.org.uk/massey/cmc_nile_genesis.htm|title=Nile Genesis: the opus of Gerald Massey|publisher=Gerald-massey.org.uk|date=29 October 1907|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michèle Fruyt in 1976 proposed&lt;ref&gt;in ''Revue de Philologie'' 50, 1976: pp. 221–38.&lt;/ref&gt; linking the Latin word with ''africus'' "south wind", which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally "rainy wind".
* Robert R. Stieglitz of [[Rutgers University]] in 1984 proposed: "The name Africa, derived from the Latin *Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew [[Ophir]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Long-Distance Seafaring in the Ancient Near East." Robert R. Stieglitz. ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', Vol. 47, No. 3 (September 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ibn Khallikan]] and some other historians claim that the name of Africa came from a [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarite]] king called Afrikin ibn Kais ibn Saifi also called "Afrikus son of Abrahah" who subdued Ifriqiya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3cdLAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA35|title=Kitab Wafayat Ala'yan.

Africa is considered by most [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] to be the [[cradle of Humankind|oldest inhabited territory]] on [[Earth]], with the [[Human|human species]] originating from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1058484.stm Genetic study roots humans in Africa], BBC News, SCI/TECH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070828155004.htm Migration of Early Humans From Africa Aided By Wet Weather], sciencedaily.com&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] discovered many [[fossil]]s and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (BP=before present). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have [[Evolution|evolved]] into modern man, such as ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' ([[Radiometric dating|radiometrically dated]] to approximately 3.9–3.0&amp;nbsp;million years BP,&lt;ref&gt;Kimbel, William H. and Yoel Rak and Donald C.

Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in [[Southern Africa]], [[Southeast Africa]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Candice Goucher|author2=Linda Walton|title=World History: Journeys from Past to Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gY7cAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-72354-6|pages=2–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.ht "Sahara's Abrupt Desertification Started by Changes in Earth's Orbit, Accelerated by Atmospheric and Vegetation Feedbacks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060153/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.ht |date=2014-03-07 }}, ''Science Daily''&lt;/ref&gt; The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the [[Cataracts of the Nile|Second Cataract]] where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and [[East Africa|Eastern Africa]]. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in [[Ethiopia]].

The domestication of [[cattle]] in Africa preceded [[agriculture]] and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. (1999) "Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York: Norton, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the [[donkey]] and a small screw-horned goat which was common from [[Algeria]] to [[Nubia]].

Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;O'Brien, Patrick K. (General Editor). ''Oxford Atlas of World History''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing [[desertification]]. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;

By the first millennium BC, [[Ferrous metallurgy|ironworking]] had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/history1.htm#Irontechnology Martin and O'Meara, "Africa, 3rd Ed."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011083356/http://princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/history1.htm |date=2007-10-11 }} Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. [[Copper]] objects from [[Egypt]], North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that [[Trans-Saharan trade]] networks had been established by this date.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;

Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the [[Roman Empire]], the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. [[Africa Province|Roman settlement]] occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first [[Roman emperor]] native to North Africa was [[Septimius Severus]], born in [[Leptis Magna]] in present-day Libya—his mother was Italian Roman and his father was [[Punics|Punic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New exhibition about Roman Emperor Septimius Severus at the Yorkshire Museum|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/features/features/8826893.New_exhibition_about_Roman_Emperor_Septimius_Severus_at_the_Yorkshire_Museum/|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=The Press|date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic [[Caliphate]] expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to [[Qayrawan]] in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.&lt;ref name =Ayoub&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud M.|authorlink=Mahmoud M.

These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the [[San people]] of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Bantu peoples|peoples]] of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the [[Horn of Africa]]; the large [[Sahelian kingdoms]]; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the [[Akan people|Akan]]; [[Benin Empire|Edo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo people]] in [[West Africa]]; and the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coastal trading towns of [[Southeast Africa]].

By the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Gao]], and the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]].  Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the [[Mali Empire]] which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.

In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the [[Islam|Muslim]] north. The [[Kingdom of Nri]] was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day [[Nigeria]] and was ruled by the [[Eze Nri]].

The [[Ife|Kingdom of Ife]], historically the first of these Yoruba city-states or kingdoms, established government under a priestly [[oba (ruler)|oba]] ('king' or 'ruler' in the [[Yoruba language]]), called the ''Ooni of Ife''. Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture.

Following the breakup of Mali, a local leader named [[Sonni Ali]] (1464–1492) founded the [[Songhai Empire]] in the region of middle [[Niger]] and the western [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[Djenné|Jenne]] in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor [[Askia Mohammad I]] (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Ira M.

In [[West Africa]], the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the [[New World]], increasing [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] legislation in Europe and America, and the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy's]] increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British [[West Africa Squadron]] seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml Jo Loosemore, Sailing against slavery].

[[File:The inspection and sale of a slave.jpg|thumb|left|Slave being inspected, from ''Captain Canot; or, Twenty Years of an African Slaver'']]
Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of [[Lagos]]", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS|title=The West African Squadron and slave trade|publisher=Pdavis.nl|accessdate=18 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610030306/http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm|archivedate=10 June 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest powers of West Africa (the [[Asante Confederacy]], the [[Dahomey|Kingdom of Dahomey]], and the [[Oyo Empire]]) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of "legitimate commerce" in the form of [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[timber]] and [[gold]], forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Julian L. (1995) ''State of Humanity'', Blackwell Publishing. p. 175. {{ISBN|1-55786-585-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, the European [[Imperialism|imperial]] powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many [[colony|colonial]] territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: [[Ethiopia]] (known to Europeans as "Abyssinia"), and [[Liberia]]. [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt &lt;!-- the fate of Sudan and its administrative status under British rule differed from those of Egypt --&gt;was effectively under British administration [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|until 1922]].

===Berlin Conference===
The [[Berlin Conference]] held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]], and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. The Berlin Conference sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.

===Independence struggles===
Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of [[World War II]], when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. [[African independence movements|Independence movements in Africa]] gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, [[Libya]], a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]] won their independence from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucien Bély|title=The History of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ltzav890zpIC&amp;pg=PA118|year=2001|publisher=Editions Jean-paul Gisserot|isbn=978-2-87747-563-1|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghana]] followed suit the next year (March 1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ernest Aryeetey|author2=Jane Harrigan|author3=Machiko Nissanke|title=Economic Reforms in Ghana: The Miracle and the Mirage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87V55ZHppSYC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2000|publisher=Africa World Press|isbn=978-0-86543-844-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.

Portugal's overseas presence in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (most notably in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], Cape Verde, [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea-Bissau]] and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime was overthrown in [[Carnation Revolution|a military coup in Lisbon]]. [[Rhodesia]] [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1965, under the [[White minority rule|white minority]] government of [[Ian Smith]], but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as [[Zimbabwe]]) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a [[Rhodesian Bush War|bitter guerrilla war]]. Although [[South Africa]] was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] until 1994.

===Post-colonial Africa===
[[File:Mobutu Sese Seko 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], [[Zaire]]'s longtime dictator, [[Embezzlement|embezzled]] over $5 billion from his country.]]
Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and [[authoritarianism]]. The vast majority of African states are [[republic]]s that operate under some form of the [[presidential system]] of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain [[Democracy|democratic]] governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of [[Coup d'état|coups]], producing [[military dictatorship]]s.

Great instability was mainly the result of [[Ethnic nepotism|marginalization of ethnic groups]], and [[Political corruption|graft under these leaders]]. For [[Divide and rule|political gain]], many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the [[Armed forces|military]] was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential [[assassination]]s. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.
[[File:SADF-Operations 4.jpg|thumb|South African paratroops on a raid in Angola during the [[South African Border War]]]]
[[Cold War]] conflicts between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], as well as the policies of the [[International Monetary Fund]],{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two [[superpower]]s. Many countries in [[Northern Africa]] received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In [[Rhodesia]], Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|Zimbabwe Patriotic Front]] waged a brutal [[Rhodesian Bush War|guerrilla war]] against the country's white government. There was a [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia|major famine in Ethiopia]], when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/703958.stm|title=BBC: 1984 famine in Ethiopia|date=6 April 2000|accessdate=1 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert G.

Another notable tragic event is the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS in post-colonial Africa]] has also been a prevalent issue.

In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the [[Angolan Civil War|civil war in Angola]] came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from [[China]],&lt;ref name=Africa/&gt; which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing {{as of|2016|lc=y}}. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as [[Africa Rising]], can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Aker, Isaac Mbiti, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1693963 "Mobile Phones and Economic Development in Africa"] SSRN&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human migration|Migration]] from African nations has increased dramatically in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=At Least a Million Sub-Saharan Africans Moved to Europe Since 2010 |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/03/22/at-least-a-million-sub-saharan-africans-moved-to-europe-since-2010/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the Earth.

The coastline is {{convert|26,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is illustrated by the fact that Europe, which covers only {{convert|10,400,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} – about a third of the surface of Africa – has a coastline of {{convert|32,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; From the most northerly point, [[Ras ben Sakka]] in [[Tunisia]] (37°21' N), to the most southerly point, [[Cape Agulhas]] in South Africa (34°51'15" S), is a distance of approximately {{convert|8,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, Evans.

The African Plate is a major [[tectonic plate]] straddling the [[equator]] as well as the [[prime meridian]].

Geologically, Africa includes the [[Arabian Peninsula]]; the [[Zagros Mountains]] of Iran and the [[Anatolian Plateau]] of Turkey mark where the [[African Plate]] collided with Eurasia. The [[Afrotropic ecozone]] and the [[Saharo-Arabian Region|Saharo-Arabian desert]] to its north unite the region biogeographically, and the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]] unites the north linguistically.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Africa}}
[[File:Africa map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Africa map of Köppen climate classification]]
The climate of Africa ranges from [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subarctic]] on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily [[desert]], or [[arid]], while its central and southern areas contain both [[savanna]] plains and dense [[jungle]] ([[rainforest]]) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as [[sahel]] and [[steppe]] dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.&lt;ref name="environmentalatlas"&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus061708.html "Africa: Environmental Atlas, 06/17/08."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105193432/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus061708.html |date=2012-01-05 }} [http://www.africa.upenn.edu African Studies Center], University of Pennsylvania.

===Fauna===
{{Main|Fauna of Africa}}
[[File:Zebras, Serengeti savana plains, Tanzania.jpg|left|thumb|Savanna at [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], [[Tanzania]]]]
Africa boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and "range of freedom" of [[wild animal]] populations and diversity, with wild populations of large [[carnivore]]s (such as [[lion]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[cheetah]]s) and [[herbivore]]s (such as [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[elephant]]s, [[camel]]s, and [[giraffe]]s) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of "jungle" animals including [[snake]]s and [[primate]]s and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic life]] such as [[crocodile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. In addition, Africa has the largest number of [[megafauna]] species, as it was least affected by the [[Quaternary extinction event#The Pleistocene or Ice Age extinction event|extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna]].

===Ecology and biodiversity===
[[File:Mauritius beach.png|thumb|Tropical beach in [[Trou-aux-Biches]], [[Mauritius]]]]
Africa has over 3,000 [[protected area]]s, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity and [[arable land]]. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.&lt;ref name="environmentalatlas"/&gt;

[[Deforestation]] is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/18831 Deforestation reaches worrying level – UN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206051452/http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/18831 |date=December 6, 2008 }}.

==Politics==
{{See also|List of political parties in Africa by country}}
There are clear signs of increased networking among African organizations and states. For example, in the civil war in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (former [[Zaire]]), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, neighbouring African countries became involved (see also [[Second Congo War]]). Since the conflict began in 1998, the estimated death toll has reached 5 million.

=== The African Union ===
[[File:Map of the African Union with Suspended States.svg|thumb|upright|Member states of the African Union&lt;!--no suspended states--&gt;]]

{{Main|African Union}}

The [[African Union]] (AU) is a 55-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states. The union was formed, with [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002&lt;ref name="African Union 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_&amp;_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union,%209%20July%202002.htm |title=Launch of the African Union, 9 July 2002: Address by the chairperson of the AU, President Thabo Mbeki |author=Thabo Mbeki |date=9 July 2002 |publisher=africa-union.org |location=ABSA Stadium, Durban, South Africa |accessdate=8 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503210549/http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_%26_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union%2C%209%20July%202002.htm |archivedate= 3 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a successor to the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's [[Pan-African Parliament]] (PAP) was relocated to [[Midrand]], in South Africa, but the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.

The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the [[Constitutive Act of the African Union]], which aims to transform the [[African Economic Community]], a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the [[Assembly of the African Union|African Union Government]], consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the [[Pan-African Parliament]]. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the [[Pan-African Parliament|Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament]], as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the [[Organisation of African Unity|OAU]] Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.

Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]].

Although it has abundant [[natural resource]]s, Africa remains the world's poorest and most [[Human Development Index|underdeveloped]] continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include [[Corruption Perceptions Index|corrupt governments]] that have often committed serious [[human rights violations]], failed [[central planning]], high levels of [[illiteracy]], lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from [[guerrilla warfare]] to [[genocide]]).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sandbrook, ''The Politics of Africa's Economic Stagnation'', Cambridge University Press, 1985 passim&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations]]' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/|title=Human Development Reports – United Nations Development Programme|website=hdr.undp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poverty in Africa|Poverty]], illiteracy, [[malnutrition]] and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent. In August 2008, the [[World Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:21882162~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469382,00.html |title=World Bank Updates Poverty Estimates for the Developing World |publisher=World Bank |date=26 August 2008 |accessdate=18 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519204804/http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A21882162~pagePK%3A64165401~piPK%3A64165026~theSitePK%3A469382%2C00.html |archivedate=19 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). 81% of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 86% for India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&amp;piPK=64165421&amp;theSitePK=469372&amp;menuPK=64166093&amp;entityID=000158349_20080826113239|title=The developing world is poorer than we thought, but no less successful in the fight against poverty|publisher=World Bank|access-date=2009-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323214139/http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&amp;piPK=64165421&amp;theSitePK=469372&amp;menuPK=64166093&amp;entityID=000158349_20080826113239|archive-date=2009-03-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of [[Poverty in Africa|the population living in poverty]] in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people).

Africa is now at risk of being in debt once again, particularly in Sub-Saharan African countries.  The last debt crisis in 2005 was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries scheme (HIPC).  The HIPC resulted in some positive and negative effects on the economy in Africa.  About ten years after the 2005 debt crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa was resolved, Zambia fell back into dept.  A small reason was due to the fall in copper prices in 2011, but the bigger reason was that a large amount of the money Zambia borrowed was wasted or pocketed by the elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/15/zambias-looming-debt-crisis-is-a-warning-for-the-rest-of-africa|title=Zambia’s looming debt crisis is a warning for the rest of Africa|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably [[Angola]], [[Sudan]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]], all of which had recently begun extracting their [[petroleum]] reserves or had expanded their [[oil extraction]] capacity.

In a recently published analysis based on [[World Values Survey]] data, the Austrian political scientist [[Arno Tausch]] maintained that several African countries, most notably [[Ghana]], perform quite well on scales of mass support for [[democracy]] and the [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3214715 |ssrn=3214715|title=Africa on the Maps of Global Values: Comparative Analyses, Based on Recent World Values Survey Data|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=2018-07-16|last1=Tausch|first1=Arno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tausch's global value comparison based on the [[World Values Survey]] derived the following factor analytical scales: 1. The non-violent and law-abiding society 2. Democracy movement 3. Climate of personal non-violence 4. Trust in institutions 5. Happiness, good health 6. No redistributive religious fundamentalism 7. Accepting the market 8. Feminism 9. Involvement in politics 10. Optimism and engagement 11. No welfare mentality, acceptancy of the Calvinist work ethics. The spread in the performance of African countries with complete data, Tausch concluded “is really amazing”. While one should be especially hopeful about the development of future democracy and the market economy in [[Ghana]], the article suggests pessimistic tendencies for [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]], and especially for Africa's leading economy, [[South Africa]]. High [[Human Inequality]], as measured by the [[UNDP]]’s [[Human Development Report]]’s [[Index of Human Inequality]], further impairs the development of [[Human Security]]. Tausch also maintains that the certain recent optimism, corresponding to economic and [[human rights]] data, emerging from Africa, is reflected in the development of a [[civil society]].

In recent years, the [[People's Republic of China]] has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id=690 Malia Politzer, "China and Africa: Stronger Economic Ties Mean More Migration"], ''Migration Information Source''.

A Harvard University study led by professor [[Calestous Juma]] showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. "African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101202124337.htm "Africa Can Feed Itself in a Generation, Experts Say"], ''[[Science Daily]]'', 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a [[United States dollar|US$]]7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new programme named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The three reasons why the US is so interested in Africa right now|url=http://qz.com/100315/the-three-reasons-why-the-us-is-so-interested-in-africa-right-now/|work=Quartz|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=4 July 2013|author=Olga Khazan|date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young.

Speakers of [[Bantu languages]] (part of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] family) are the majority in southern, central and [[southeast Africa]]. The Bantu-speaking peoples from [[the Sahel]] progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Luc-Normand Tellier (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective]''. PUQ. p. 204. {{ISBN|2-7605-1588-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there are also several [[Nilotic]] groups in [[South Sudan]] and East Africa, the mixed [[Swahili people]] on the [[Swahili Coast]], and a few remaining [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] Khoisan ("[[Bushmen|San"]] or "Bushmen") and [[Pygmy peoples]] in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also "San", closely related to, but distinct from "[[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article402970.ece Pygmies struggle to survive in war zone where abuse is routine]. ''Times'' Online. 16 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The peoples of West Africa primarily speak [[Niger–Congo languages]], belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some [[Nilo-Saharan]] and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Fulani]], [[Akan language|Akan]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] or [[Mande languages|Mande]] groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the [[Hausa language|Hausa]], are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] and [[Zarma people|Zarma]], are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering [[Central Africa]].

The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The [[Arab]]s who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the [[Arabic language]] and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic [[Phoenicia]]ns (who founded [[Carthage]]) and [[Hyksos]], the Indo-Iranian [[Alans]], the Indo- European [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Vandals]] settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: The Berbers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3509799.stm|accessdate=30 December 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berber-speaking [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and other often-[[nomad]]ic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[File:Bedscha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Beja people|Beja]] [[bedouin]]s from Northeast Africa]]
In the [[Horn of Africa]], some Ethiopian and [[Eritrea]]n groups (like the [[Amhara people|Amhara]] and [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrayans]], collectively known as [[Habesha people|Habesha]]) speak languages from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family, while the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and [[Somali people|Somali]] speak languages from the [[Cushitic]] branch of Afro-Asiatic.

Prior to the [[decolonization]] movements of the post-[[World War II]] era, [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] were represented in every part of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901759-3,00.html "We Want Our Country" (3 of 10)].

European colonization also brought sizable groups of [[Asian people|Asians]], particularly from the [[Indian subcontinent]], to British colonies. Large [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian communities]] are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large [[Indians in Uganda|Indian community in Uganda]] was [[expulsion of Asians from Uganda|expelled]] by the dictator [[Idi Amin]] in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] are an [[Austronesian people]], but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as [[Cape Coloureds]] (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of [[Demographics of Lebanon#The Lebanese Diaspora|Lebanese]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]]&lt;ref name="Africa"/&gt; have also developed in the larger coastal cities of [[West Africa|West]] and [[East Africa]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-07-10-voa46.html Naomi Schwarz, "Lebanese Immigrants Boost West African Commerce"], VOANews.com, 10 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By most estimates, well over a thousand [[language]]s ([[UNESCO]] has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=8048&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Africa |date=2005 |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=1 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602050234/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D8048%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archivedate= 2 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major [[language family|language families]] indigenous to Africa:
* The [[Afroasiatic languages|''Afroasiatic'']] languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the [[Horn of Africa]], [[North Africa]], the [[Sahel]], and [[Southwest Asia]].
* The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|''Nilo-Saharan'']] language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Uganda]], and northern [[Tanzania]].
* The [[Niger–Congo languages|''Niger-Congo'']] language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of number of languages, it is the largest language family in Africa and perhaps the largest in the world.
* The [[Khoisan languages|''Khoisan'']] languages number about fifty and are spoken in [[Southern Africa]] by approximately 400,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khoisan Languages|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Khoisan.html|website=The Language Gulper|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Khoisan languages are [[endangered language|endangered]]. The [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]] peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.

Following the end of [[colonialism]], nearly all African countries adopted [[official language]]s that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]]). In numerous countries, English and French (''see [[African French]]'') are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Afrikaans]] and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former [[Italian Colonial Empire|Italian colonies]] in Africa. German is spoken in [[Namibia]], as it was a former German protectorate.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Africa}}
[[File:Bet Giyorgis church Lalibela 01.jpg|thumb|The rock-hewn [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Church of Saint George]] in [[Lalibela]], [[Ethiopia]] is a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]]
Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered.com"&gt;[http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205208606.pdf Pearsonhighered.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501070358/http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205208606.pdf |date=2015-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold II of Belgium attempted to "civilize" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered.com"/&gt;

Obidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gefame/4761563.0002.103/--crisis-of-appropriating-identity-for-african-art-and-artists?rgn=main;view=fulltext|title=The Crisis of Appropriating Identity for African Art and Artists: The Abayomi Barber School Responsorial Paradigm|journal=Gefame|year=2005|last1=Freeborn|first1=Odiboh}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, "The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art." &lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSIxOcgE378C&amp;pg=PA95|title=African Art and Leadership|first1=Douglas|last1=Fraser|first2=Herbert M.|last2=Cole|year=2004|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-05824-1|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects "lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that "the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojPJBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT63|title=Postcolonial Modernism: Art and Decolonization in Twentieth-Century Nigeria|first=Chika|last=Okeke-Agulu|year=2015|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-7630-9|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Soweto, the West Rand Administrative Board established a Cultural Section to collect, read, and review scripts before performances could occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhNsJrkz1soC&amp;pg=PA123|title=South African Drama and Theatre from Pre-colonial Times to the 1990s: An Alternative Reading: An Alternative Reading|first=Mzo|last=Sirayi|year=2017|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4771-2082-8|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the "traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe." &lt;ref&gt;[http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/histories/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139054638&amp;cid=CBO9781139054638A024 Universitypublishingonline.org]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)asset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3y9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=colonialism+suppressed+african+music#v=onepage&amp;q=colonialism+suppressed+african+music|title=African Music, Power, and Being in Colonial Zimbabwe|first=Mhoze|last=Chikowero|year=2015|publisher=Indiana University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780253018090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the [[African Renaissance]], led by [[Thabo Mbeki]], [[Afrocentrism]], led by a group of scholars, including [[Molefi Asante]], as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] and other forms of spirituality.

===Visual art and architecture===
[[African art]] and [[architecture of Africa|architecture]] reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known [[bead]]s were made from ''[[Nassarius]]'' shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of African Archaeology'' (2013, {{ISBN|0191626147}}), p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[Egypt]] was the [[world's tallest structure]] for 4,000 years, until the completion of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] around the year 1300. The stone ruins of [[Great Zimbabwe]] are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the [[monolithic church]]es at [[Lalibela]], Ethiopia, such as the [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Church of Saint George]].

===Music and dance===
{{Main|Music of Africa}}
[[File:Ke-Nako Music-Performance Vienna2008c.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A musician from [[South Africa]]]]
Egypt has long been a cultural focus of [[Arab world|the Arab world]], while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the [[Atlantic slave trade]] to modern [[samba]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[rock music|rock]]. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of [[Afrobeat]] and [[Highlife]] music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of [[soukous]], dominated by the [[music of the Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of [[North Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]]. [[Arab]] influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, [[Western culture#Widespread influence|Western influences]] are apparent due to [[colonization]].

===Sports===
[[File:Namibia Rugby Team.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia rugby team]]]]
Fifty-four African countries have [[Association football|football (soccer)]] teams in the [[Confederation of African Football]]. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent [[FIFA World Cup]]s. [[South Africa]] hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup tournament]], becoming the first African country to do so.

[[Cricket]] is popular in some African nations. [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] have [[Test cricket|Test]] status, while [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] is the leading non-test team and previously had [[One Day International|One-Day International cricket]] (ODI) status (from [[President's Cup 1997-98|10 October 1997]], until [[2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier#Super Six|30 January 2014]]). The three countries jointly hosted the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]] is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. [[Morocco]] in northern Africa has also hosted the [[2002 Morocco Cup]], but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. [[Rugby union|Rugby]] is a popular sport in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Africa}} {{See also||African divination}}
Africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs, and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive topic for governments with mixed religious populations.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.stanford.edu/africa/religion.html|title=African Religion on the Internet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902182749/http://library.stanford.edu/africa/religion.html |archive-date=2006-09-02 |deadurl=yes |publisher=[[Stanford University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/01/world/rising-muslim-power-in-africa-causes-unrest-in-nigeria-and-elsewhere-963950.html|date=1 November 2001|title=Rising Muslim Power in Africa Causing Unrest in Nigeria and Elsewhere|first=Normitsu|last=Onishi|work=The New York Times|accessdate=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Book Encyclopedia]], [[Islam in Africa|Islam]] is the largest religion in Africa, followed by [[Christianity in Africa|Christianity]]. According to [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 45% of the population are [[Christian]]s, 40% are [[Muslim]]s, and 10% follow [[Tradition African religion|traditional religions]]. A small number of Africans are [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], [[Confucianist]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'i]], or [[Judaism in Africa|Jewish]]. There is also a minority of people in Africa who are [[Irreligion in Africa|irreligious]].

The '''boundaries between the continents''' of [[Earth]] are generally a matter of [[geography|geographical]] convention.  Several slightly different conventions are in use.  The number of [[continent]]s is most commonly considered seven but may range as low as four when the [[Americas]] and [[Afro-Eurasia]] are each considered a single continent.  According to the definition of a continent in the strict sense, an [[island]] cannot be part of any continent, but by convention and in practice most major islands are associated with a continent.

There are three overland boundaries subject to definition:

* between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] (dividing [[Eurasia]]): along the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Urals]] (historically also north of the Caucasus, along the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] or along the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]])
* between Asia and [[Africa]] (dividing Afro-Eurasia into Africa and [[Eurasia]]): at the [[Isthmus of Suez]]
* between [[North America]] and [[South America]] (dividing the [[Americas]]): the [[Isthmus of Panama]]
While the isthmus between Asia and Africa and that between North and South America are today navigable, via the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal|Panama]] canals, respectively, diversions and canals of human origin generally are not accepted on their own accord as continent-defining boundaries; the  Suez Canal happens to traverse the [[isthmus]] between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Red Sea]], dividing Asia and Africa. The remaining boundaries concern the association of islands and archipelagos with specific continents, notably:

* the delineation of [[Southeast Asia]] from [[Australasia]] (part of [[Oceania]]) in the [[Ceram Sea]], [[Arafura Sea]], [[Timor Sea]], [[Halmahera Sea]], and [[Malay Archipelago]]
* the delineation between Africa, Europe and Asia in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]
* the delineation between Asia and Europe in the [[Arctic Ocean]]
* the delineation between Europe and North America in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]
* the delineation between North and South America in the [[Caribbean Sea]]
* the delineation of Asia from North America in the [[North Pacific Ocean]]

==Europe and Africa==
[[File:Mediterranean Relief.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|The Mediterranean sea, between Africa &amp; Europe]]
[[File:Makaronesia.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The Atlantic Ocean around the boundary]]
The [[Europea]]n and [[Africa]]n mainlands are non-contiguous, and the delineation between these continents is thus merely a question of which islands are to be associated with which continent. At its nearest point, [[Morocco]] and the European portion of [[Spain]] are separated by only {{convert|8.1|mi|0|abbr=off|order=flip}}.

The Portuguese Atlantic island possession of the [[Azores]] is {{convert|1368|km|abbr=on}} from Europe and {{convert|1507|km|abbr=on}} from Africa, and is usually grouped with Europe if grouped with any continent. By contrast, the [[Canary Islands|Canary]] and [[Madeira]] islands off the Atlantic coast of [[Morocco]] are much closer to, and usually grouped with, Africa (the Canary Islands are only {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast at their closest point, while Madeira is {{convert|520|km|abbr=on}} from Africa and {{convert|1,000|km|abbr=on}} from Europe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spainforvisitors.com/sections/canaryislands.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225123213/http://spainforvisitors.com/sections/canaryislands.htm |archivedate=25 December 2012 }}; {{cite web|url=http://listofafricancountries.com |title=Countries of Africa |accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mediterranean island nation of [[Malta]] is approximately {{convert|81|km|abbr=on}} from the coast of Sicily in Europe - much closer than the {{convert|288|km|abbr=on}} distance to the closest African coast.  The nearby Italian island of [[Lampedusa]] is {{convert|207|km|abbr=on}} from Sicily while just {{convert|127|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast;  similarly, [[Pantelleria]] is {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from Sicily and just {{convert|71|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast.  All of these Mediterranean islands are actually located on the [[African Plate|African plate]], and may be considered part of the continent of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africa-arabia-plate.weebly.com/|title=African/Arabian Tectonic Plates|website=African/Arabian Tectonic Plates|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/GeolColBk/AfricanPlate.HTM|title=African Plate|website=www.uwgb.edu|access-date=2016-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006145431/https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/GeolColBk/AfricanPlate.HTM#|archive-date=6 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for political and historical reasons, maps generally display them as part of Europe.

==Europe and Asia==
The boundary between Europe and Asia is unusual among continental boundaries because of its largely mountain-and-river-based characteristics north and east of the Black Sea. The reason is historical, the division of Europe and Asia going back to the early [[Greek geographers]].
In the modern sense of the term "continent", [[Eurasia]] is more readily identifiable as a "continent", and Europe has occasionally been described as a [[subcontinent]] of Eurasia.&lt;ref name="europe"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hans Slomp |title=Europe: A Political Profile |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;pg=PA634&amp;lpg=PA634&amp;dq=%22european+subcontinent%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SYCYoz-m3V&amp;sig=zCy9OfV_frpcoJH0acUWF8JGX3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GWUNVKlrx9qgBPmZgbAM&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22european%20subcontinent%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[File:Historical Europe-Asia boundaries 1700 to 1900.png|thumb|upright|Conventions used for the boundary between Europe and Asia during the 18th and 19th centuries. The red line shows the most common modern convention, in use since {{circa|1850}} (see [[#Modern definition|below]]).
{{legend|#fcf9ea|Europe}}
{{legend|#d2d0c5|Asia}}
{{legend|#edfb9d|historically placed in either continent}}]]
The threefold division of the [[Old World]] into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BC, due to [[Greek geographers]] such as [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]]. 

Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the [[Phasis River]] (the modern Rioni) in the Caucasus (from its mouth by [[Poti]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, through the [[Surami Pass]] and along the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 4.38. C.f. James Rennell, ''The Geographical System of Herodotus Examined and Explained'', Volume 1, Rivington 1830, [https://books.google.com/books?id=enQ-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=Herodotus+Phasis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g8qiTbXZNtCVOuPjjDU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Herodotus%20Phasis&amp;f=false p. 244]&lt;/ref&gt;
As geographic knowledge of the Greeks increased during the [[Hellenistic period]],&lt;ref&gt;according to Strabo (''[[Geographica]]'' 11.7.4) even at the time of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], "it was agreed by all that the Tanais river separated Asia from Europe" ({{lang|grc|ὡμολόγητο ἐκ πάντων ὅτι διείργει τὴν Ἀσίαν ἀπὸ
τῆς Εὐρώπης ὁ Τάναϊς ποταμός}}; c.f. Duane W. Roller, ''Eratosthenes' Geography'', Princeton University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-691-14267-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8peKyWK_SWsC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Eratosthenes+Tanais&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vdGiTeTEEY7rObCruTU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Eratosthenes%20Tanais&amp;f=false p. 57])
&lt;/ref&gt; this archaic convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as [[Posidonius]],&lt;ref&gt;
W. Theiler, ''Posidonios. Die Fragmente'', vol. 1. Berlin: De Gruyter, 1982, fragm. 47a.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;

Kidd (ed.), ''Posidonius: The commentary'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-521-60443-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_iXs1aCr1ckC&amp;pg=PA738&amp;dq=Posidonius+Tanais&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E8-iTdzLH8aZOuXPuTQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tanais&amp;f=false p. 738].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;
''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' 7.5.6 (ed. Nobbe 1845, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHMCAAAAQAAJ vol. 2], p. 178)) {{lang|grc|Καὶ τῇ Εὐρώπῃ δὲ συνάπτει διὰ τοῦ μεταξὺ αὐχένος τῆς τε Μαιώτιδος λίμνης καὶ τοῦ Σαρματικοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς διαβάσεως τοῦ Τανάϊδος ποταμοῦ. }}
"And [Asia] is connected to Europe by the land-strait between Lake Maiotis and the Sarmatian Ocean where the river Tanais crosses through."&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of [[Eurasia]] into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]],  the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (known in antiquity as the Tanais). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at [[Kalach-na-Donu]] (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the [[Volga–Don Canal]]), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.

[[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the [[Volga River|Volga]], following the Volga north until the [[Samara Bend]], along [[Obshchy Syrt]] (the [[drainage divide]] between Volga and [[Ural River|Ural]]) and then north along [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Nord-und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia|author=Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg|year=1730|language=German|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |title=Boundary of Europe and Asia along Urals |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130417143618/http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |archivedate=17 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The [[:commons:Category:Atlas of Russian Empire. 1745 year|1745 atlas]] published by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as [[Serafimovich (town)|Serafimovich]] before cutting north towards [[Arkhangelsk]], while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as [[John Cary]] followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, [[Peter Simon Pallas]], as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simon Pallas, ''Journey through various provinces of the Russian Empire'', vol. 3 (1773)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.

By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the [[Volga–Don Canal]] and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the [[Greater Caucasus watershed]] to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a controversy in geographical literature of the 1860s, with [[Douglas Freshfield]] advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the best possible, citing support from various modern geographers.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W. Freshfield, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ips8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=%22watershed+of+the+Caucasus%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4bCdTeaeEpDsOeK6iOgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22watershed%20of%20the%20Caucasus%22&amp;f=false Journey in the Caucasus]", ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society'', Volumes 13-14, 1869.

In [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.rsl.ru/view.php?path=/rsl01004000000/rsl01004103000/rsl01004103489/rsl01004103489.pdf#?page=163 "Europe"]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from [[Baydaratskaya Bay]], on the [[Kara Sea]], along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the [[Ural River]] until the [[Mugodzhar Hills]], and then the [[Emba River]]; and Kuma–Manych Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velikijporog.narod.ru/st_evraz_gran.htm|title=Do we live in Europe or in Asia?|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |title=Physical Geography |year=1998 |author=Orlenok V. |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016212930/http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Moores, R. W. Fairbridge, ''Encyclopedia of European and Asian regional geology'', Springer, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-412-74040-4}}, p. 34: "most Soviet geographers took the watershed of the Main Range of the Greater Caucasus as the boundary between Europe and Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; and this became the standard convention in the latter 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.

]]
The modern border between Asia and Europe remains a historical and cultural construct, defined only by convention. The modern border follows the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Dardanelles]]-[[Sea of Marmara]]-[[Bosphorus]] (together known as the [[Turkish Straits]]), the [[Black Sea]], along the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of the [[Greater Caucasus]], the northwestern portion of the [[Caspian Sea]] and along the [[Ural River]] and [[Ural Mountains]] to the [[Kara Sea]], as mapped and listed in most atlases including that of the [[National Geographic Society]] and as described in the [[World Factbook]].&lt;ref name="NatlGeoAtlas"&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=9th|year=2011|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-1-4262-0634-4}} "Europe" (plate 59); "Asia" (plate 74): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe ... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Factbook"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html |location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] both have most of their territory in Asia, although each has small parts of their northern borderlands north of the Greater Caucasus watershed and thus in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}} Azerbaijan: Geography and Georgia: Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most geographic sources assign the area south of the Caucasus Mountain crest to [[Southwest Asia|Southwest or West Asia]],&lt;ref name="Asia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100270/Caucasus |title=Caucasus |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; no definition is entirely satisfactory, with it often becoming a matter of self-identification. Cultural influences in the area originate from both Asia and Europe. While geographers rarely define continents primarily politically, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and to a lesser extent [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] are increasingly in the 21st century politically oriented towards Europe, but Armenia has a great cultural diaspora to the south, and Azerbaijan shares a cultural affinity with [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]] as well as with the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] countries of [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="De Waal"&gt;Thomas De Waal.

The Turkish city [[Istanbul]] lies in on both sides of the Bosporus (one of the Turkish Straits), making it a transcontinental city. [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]] are transcontinental countries with territory in both Europe and Asia by any definition except that of Eurasia as a single continent. While Russia is historically a European country with a history of [[Russian Empire|imperial conquests]] in Asia, the situation for Turkey is inverse, as that of an Asian country with [[Ottoman Empire|imperial conquests]] in Europe. [[Kazakhstan]] is also a transcontinental country by this definition, its [[West Kazakhstan Province|West Kazakhstan]] and [[Atyrau Province|Atyrau]] provinces extending on either side of the Ural River.&lt;ref name="Factbook-Ural"&gt;{{Cite book | title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kz.html |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}} Kazakhstan: Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] (more precisely, the [[Manych River]], the [[Kuma–Manych Canal]] and the [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma River]]) remains cited less commonly as one possible natural boundary in contemporary sources.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'' (2011) s.v. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324715/Kuma-Manych-Depression "Kuma-Manych Depression"]: "It is often regarded as the natural boundary between Europe and Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; This definition peaked in prominence in the 19th century, however it has declined in usage since then, as it places traditionally European areas of Russia such as  [[Stavropol]], [[Krasnodar]], and even areas just south of [[Rostov-on-Don]] in Asia.

A lesser known definition for country grouping, is the definition used for statistical purposes by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm| title=Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions, geographical sub-regions, and selected economic and other groupings| publisher=United Nations Statistics Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* listed as part of [[Central Asia]]: [[Kazakhstan]]
* listed as part of [[Western Asia]]: [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Cyprus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Turkey]]
 
According to UNSD, the aforementioned "assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm |title=Standard country or area codes and geographical regions for statistical use |publisher=Unstats.un.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the UNSD classification often differs from those of other [[United Nations]] organizations. For instance, while UNSD includes Georgia and Cyprus in Western Asia, the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]  and [[UNESCO]] include both countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FAKMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=west+asia+iran+2015&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cWGRVanpKqOy7Qb1tqP4Bw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20asia%20iran%202015&amp;f=false United Nations Industrial Organisation] p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/worldwide/unesco-regions/europe-and-north-america/ Europe and North America], Retrieved: 10 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islands===
[[Cyprus]] is an island of the Mediterranean located close to [[Asia Minor]], so that it is usually associated with Asia and/or the [[Middle East]], as in the [[World Factbook]] and the [[United Nations geoscheme]], but the [[Republic of Cyprus]] was nevertheless admitted to the Council of Europe in 1961 and joined the EU in 2004.  The northern part of the island functions as the unrecognized (except by Turkey) [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]].

The Greek [[Aegean Islands|North Aegean Islands]] and the [[Dodecanese]] lie on the coast of the Asian part of Turkey (on the Asian continental shelf).

|[[early world maps|Map of the world]] according to [[Anaximander]] (6th century BC). Only the parts of Europe, Asia and Africa directly adjacent to the Mediterranean and the Black Sea are known. The [[Phasis River]] of the Caucasus is imagined as separating Europe from Asia, while the [[Nile]] separates Asia from Africa (Libya).

==Europe and North America==
Europe and North America are separated by the [[North Atlantic]].
In terms of associating islands with either continent, the boundary is usually drawn between [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]]. The Norwegian islands of [[Jan Mayen]] and [[Svalbard]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]] are usually associated with Europe. Iceland and the [[Azores]] are protrusions of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] and are associated with and peopled from Europe, even though they have areas on the [[North American Plate]].  (Definitions of "continents" are a physical and [[cultural construct]] dating back centuries, long before the advent or even knowledge of [[plate tectonics]]; thus, defining a "continent" falls into the realm of physical and cultural geography, while continental plate definitions fall under plate tectonics in the realm of [[geologists|geology]].)

===Islands===
The geographical notion of a [[continent]] stands in opposition to islands and archipelagos.&lt;ref&gt;
See [[:continent#Noun|continent]] on [[Wiktionary]]. "from Latin ''continent-, continens'' 'continuous mass of land, mainland'" (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/continent?show=1&amp;t=1301917145 merriam-webster.com])&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, there are some islands that are considered part of Europe in a political sense.
This most notably includes the [[British Isles]] (part of the European continental shelf and during the Ice Age of the continent itself), besides the islands of the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean]] which are part of the territory of a country situated on the European mainland, and usually also the [[island state]]s of [[Iceland]] and [[Malta]].

Russia's [[Vaygach Island]] and [[Novaya Zemlya]] extend northward from the northern end of the [[Ural Mountains]] and are a continuation of that chain into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. While Novaya Zemlya was variously grouped with Europe or with Asia in 19th-century maps it is now usually grouped with Europe, the continental boundary considered to join the Arctic Ocean along the southern shore of the [[Kara Sea]]. The Russian Arctic [[archipelago]] of [[Franz Josef Land]] farther north is also associated with Europe.

Europe ends in the west at the [[Atlantic Ocean]], although Iceland and the [[Azores]] archipelago (in the Atlantic, between Europe and North America) are usually considered European, as is the Norwegian [[Svalbard]] archipelago in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. [[Greenland]] is geographically part of North America, but politically associated with Europe as it is part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], although it has extensive home rule and EU law no longer applies there.

==Africa and Asia==
[[File:TransAfrica.PNG|thumb|
{{legend|#FF0000|African part of Egypt}}
{{legend|#FFA500|Asian part of Egypt}}
{{legend|#FFFF00|Rest of Asia}}
{{legend|#C0C0C0|Rest of Africa}}]]

Historically in [[Greco-Roman geography]], "Africa" meant [[Ancient Libya]], and its eastern extent was taken to be around [[Marmarica]], at the ''[[Catabathmus Magnus]]'', placing [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in Asia entirely.
The idea of Egypt being an "African" country seems to develop in around the mid-19th century;{{CN|date=August 2016}} the term  ''Africa'' was classically reserved for what is now known as the [[Maghreb]], to the explicit exclusion of Egypt, but with the [[exploration of Africa]] the shape of the African landmass (and Egypt's "natural" inclusion in that landmass) became apparent.  In 1806, [[William George Browne]] still titled his travelogue ''Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria''. Similarly, [[James Bruce]] in 1835 published ''Travels through part of Africa, Syria, Egypt, and Arabia''. On the other hand,
as early as 1670  [[John Ogilby]] under the title ''Africa'' published ''"an accurate Description of the Regions of Egypt, Barbary, Libya, and Billedulgerid, the Land of Negroes, Guinea, Æthiopia, and the Abyssines, with all the adjacent Islands, either in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Southern, or Oriental Seas, belonging thereunto"''.

The usual line taken to divide Africa from Asia today is at the [[Isthmus of Suez]], the narrowest gap between the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Gulf of Suez]], the route today followed by the [[Suez Canal]]. This makes the [[Sinai Peninsula]] geographically Asian, and [[Egypt]] a transcontinental country. Less than 2% of Egyptian population live in the Sinai, and hence Egypt, even though technically transcontinental, is usually considered an [[African country]] entirely and not partly Asian.

But when discussing the geopolitical region of the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]], Egypt is usually grouped with the Western Asian countries as part of the [[Middle East]], while Egypt's western neighbor [[Libya]] is grouped with the remaining North African countries as the [[Maghreb]]. However, they are both members of the [[Arab League]] as well as the [[African Union]].

The [[Seychelles]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Comoros]] are island nations in the [[Indian Ocean]] associated with Africa. The island of [[Socotra]] may be considered African as it lies on this continent's shelf, but is part of [[Yemen]], an Asian country.

==North and South America==
[[File:Countries-Panama-provinces-2005-10-18-en.png|thumb|225px|right|Panama with the Panama Canal.]]
{{Further|Americas|Central America}}

===Mainland===
The border between North America and South America is at some point on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. The most common demarcation in atlases and other sources follows the [[Serranía del Darién|Darién Mountains]] watershed divide along the [[Colombia]]-Panama [[Colombia–Panama border|border]] where the isthmus meets the South American continent.  Virtually all atlases list Panama as a state falling entirely within [[North America]] and/or [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/mapping/outline-map/?map=Panama |title=National Geographic Education |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=2011-05-12 }}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas (list)|publisher=National Geographic Society|year=2010|page=4}}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite book|title=Webster's New Geographical Dictionary (list and map)|publisher=Merriam-Webster Inc.|year=1984|pages=856, 859}}&lt;br&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#americas "Americas"] ''Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49)'', United Nations Statistics Division&lt;br&gt;[http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/north_america/referencemap_image_view "North America"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303000000/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/north_america/referencemap_image_view |date=3 March 2008 }} ''Atlas of Canada''&lt;br&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=nameri&amp;Rootmap=&amp;Mode=d&amp;SubMode=w North America Atlas] National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islands===
Often most of the [[Caribbean islands]] are considered part of North America, but [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] lie on the [[continental shelf]] of South America. On the other hand, the Venezuelan [[Isla Aves]] and the Colombian [[San Andrés and Providencia]] lie on the North American shelf.

==Asia and North America==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
The [[Bering Strait]] and [[Bering Sea]] separate the landmasses of Asia and North America, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States. This national and continental boundary separates the [[Diomede Islands]] in the Bering Strait, with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the US. The [[Aleutian Islands]] are an island chain extending westward from the [[Alaska Peninsula]] toward Russia's [[Komandorski Islands]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. Most of them are always associated with North America, except for the westernmost [[Near Islands]] group, which is on Asia's continental shelf beyond the [[North Aleutians Basin]] and on rare occasions could be associated with Asia, which could then allow the U.S. state of [[Alaska]] to be considered a transcontinental state.

[[St. Lawrence Island]] in the northern Bering Sea belongs to Alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America, as with the [[Rat Islands]] in the Aleutian chain. At their nearest points, [[Alaska]] and [[Russia]] are separated by only {{convert|2.5|mi|0|order=flip|abbr=off}}.

==The Americas and Oceania==
The [[Galápagos Islands]] and [[Malpelo Island]] in the eastern Pacific Ocean are possessions of [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]], respectively, and associated with South America. The uninhabited French possession of [[Clipperton Island]] {{convert|600|mi|sigfig=1|order=flip|abbr=off}} off the Mexican coast is associated with North America.

[[Easter Island]], a territory of [[Chile]], is considered to be in Oceania, though politically it is associated with South America.

The United States of America controls numerous territories in Oceania, including the state of [[Hawaii]] and the territories of [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] and [[American Samoa]].

==Asia and Oceania==
[[File:Map of Sunda and Sahul.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Wallace Line|Wallace]], [[Lydekker line|Lydekker]] and [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber]] Lines, the principals on [[Wallacea]] ]]
The [[Malay Archipelago]] is usually divided between Asia and [[Australasia]], most commonly along the anthropologic Melanesian line or [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber's Line]]. Indonesia controls the western half of [[New Guinea]], geographically part of Australasia. The eastern half of the island is part of [[Papua New Guinea]] which is considered to be part of Oceania. Indonesia is  commonly referred to as one of the [[Asia#SouthEast Asia|Southeast Asian]] countries. [[East Timor]], an independent state that was formerly a territory of Indonesia, which is geographically part of Asia, is classified by the [[United Nations]] as part of the "South-Eastern Asia" block. It is [[ASEAN Summit#East Timor|expected to join]] the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/east-timor-asean-bid/2006/07/22/1153166635002.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=East Timor ASEAN bid | date=23 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been involved as an ASEAN Regional Forum member since independence, and has participated in the [[Southeast Asian Games]] since [[2003 Southeast Asian Games|2003]]. Occasionally, all of the [[Malay Archipelago]] is included in Oceania, although this is extremely rare, especially as most of the archipelago lies on the Asian continental shelf.

The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] includes [[List of islands of Australia#External Territories|island possessions in Oceania]] and islands closer to Indonesia than the Australian mainland.

==Antarctica==
Antarctica along with its outlying islands have no permanent population. All land claims south of 60°S latitude are held in abeyance by the [[Antarctic Treaty System]].

The [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] are closer to Antarctica than to any other continent. However, they are politically associated with the inhabited [[Falkland Islands]] which are closer to South America. Furthermore, Argentina, a South American country, maintains its [[irredentism|irredentist]] claims on the islands. The continental shelf boundary separates the two island groups.

The [[Prince Edward Islands]] are located between Africa and Antarctica, and are the territory of South Africa, an African country.  The Australian [[Macquarie Island]] and the New Zealand [[Antipodes Islands]], [[Auckland Islands]], and [[Campbell Island group|Campbell Islands]], are all located between the [[Oceania]]n countries of Australia and New Zealand and Antarctica.&lt;!-- see [[Talk:Transcontinental country#New Zealand|discussion]] --&gt;

Australia's [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] and the French [[Kerguelen Islands]] are located on the [[Kerguelen Plateau]], on the Antarctic continental plate. The French [[Crozet Islands]], [[Île Amsterdam]], [[Île Saint-Paul]], and the Norwegian [[Bouvet Island]] are also located on the Antarctic continental plate, and are not often associated with other continents.

The effort lasted from 1982 to the 1990s, and generally coincides with [[James P. Grant]]'s tenure as executive director of UNICEF (1980–1995). The child survival revolution included various programs and conferences, including the [[World Summit for Children]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=gautam/&gt;

Rather than treating child mortality as a measurement of development, the effort sought to directly reduce child mortality as a way toward development.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/1980s.htm |title=The 1980s: Campaign for child survival |publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations, including the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[UNDP]], the [[World Bank]], and [[WHO]] joined; thus the revolution is sometimes called "a grand alliance for children".&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt; The revolution was analogized with the [[Green Revolution]] by James Grant.&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|42}}

|}

==Results and reception==
The initial reaction to Grant's announcement of the child survival revolution was overwhelmingly negative due to several reasons, including practical reasons, e.g., the money and infrastructure to support Grant's plans not existing.&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|24}}

It is estimated that the child vaccination increased worldwide from 20% in 1982(?) to 80% in 1990 because of the child survival revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Black, Children First: The Story of UNICEF, Past and Present (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 33; see also UNICEF, The State of the World’s Children 1986 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1990, [[Donald Henderson|D. A. Henderson]] noted that although "dramatic progress" had been made because of the child survival revolution, the results were still "little-appreciated".&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

The child survival revolution is estimated to have saved the lives of 25 million children.&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|59}}

==Focus areas==
The genesis of the Child Survival Revolution can be traced to 1973 when [[James P. Grant]], gave his annual lecture at Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health. In reviewing research findings of Prof [[Carl E. Taylor]] Grant grasped how the collective package from Taylor's Narangwal research (childhood pneumonia, oral rehydration therapy, neonatal tetanus, family planning) served as a parallel to The Green Revolution, saying "we can now start to talk about a Child Survival Revolution!" &lt;ref&gt; Daniel C. Taylor and Carl E. Taylor (2016), Just and Lasting Change: When Communities Own Their Futures 2nd Edition (New York: Johns Hopkins University Press, p176-177)&lt;/ref&gt;  Grant had earlier been Deputy Director of USAID, and in that role had been an early and strong backer of [[The Green Revolution]], a global effort that dramatically raised global food supply through a package of agricultural innovations (new seed types, fertilizer, irrigation, pesticides, and mechanization). Grant grasped that it was the synergy that came through a package of interventions that would allow children to survive,

For much of the child survival revolution, James Grant and UNICEF adopted a strategy known as [[GOBI-FFF]], a form of selective primary healthcare:&lt;ref&gt;David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=G for growth monitoring to detect undernutrition in small children, O for [[oral rehydration therapy]] [ORT] to treat childhood diarrhea, B to encourage breastfeeding (which had declined precipitously due to working mothers and the marketing of infant formula), and I for immunization against the six basic childhood diseases: tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles. (They added two Fs: food supplements and family planning; and, later, a third: female education.)}}

Of these, "immunization and ORT were seen as the 'twin-engines' of the child survival revolution".&lt;ref name=gautam/&gt;&lt;ref name="jim_grant_book"&gt;{{cite book |title=Jim Grant: UNICEF Visionary |author1=Peter Adamson |author2=Carol Bellamy |author3=Kul Gautam |author4=Richard Jolly |author5=Nyi Nyi |author6=Mary Racelis |author7=Richard Reid |author8=Jon Rohde |year=2001 |url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_4402.html |publisher=UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}

After 1986, when studies by [[Alfred Sommer]] and others were published, [[vitamin A]] administration also became a focus.&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

==Organizations involved==
Although the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations were involved.

* [[Rockefeller Foundation]]&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt;
* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP)
* [[World Bank]]
* [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)
* [[Rotary International]] pledged to raise $120 million.&lt;ref name="henderson"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Child Survival Revolution |author=[[D. A. Henderson]] |year=1990 |journal=Pediatric Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of mass media==
UNICEF took advantage of the growing levels of basic education and access to television and radio to generate support for the child survival revolution through persuasion.&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt;

James Grant also "persuaded many heads of state to get personally involved in their national programmes for children, for example in their immunization by being photographed giving polio drops to a baby". Several figures from film and sports, like [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Liv Ullmann]], and [[Peter Ustinov]] also participated in the [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador program]].&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|62}}

[[File:1-12 Political Color Map World.png|thumb|upright=1.8|2011 map showing countries with full recognition and one [[List of states with limited recognition|UN non-member state]]; some [[List of territorial disputes|disputed territories]] are not shown]]

A '''country''' is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in [[political geography]]. A country may be an independent [[sovereign state]] or part of a larger state,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J. (1964). ''What Makes a Country? Human Events'', '''24'''(31), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; as a non-[[sovereignty|sovereign]] or formerly sovereign [[political division]], or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated [[nation|people]] with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the [[League of Nations]] in 1937 and reaffirmed by the [[United Nations]] in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise{{clarify|date=April 2017}} of legal jurisdiction.{{CN|date=March 2018}}

''Countries'' can refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|912|1997|litigants=Tjhe Kwet Koe v Minister for Immigration &amp;amp; Ethnic Affairs |date=8 September 1997 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while other times it can refer only to [[State (polity)|states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/cs/politicalgeog/a/statenation.htm| title=Geography: Country, State, and Nation |accessdate=2008-11-12 |last=Rosenberg |first=Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'' uses the word in its "Country name" field to refer to "a wide variety of dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, [[uninhabited islands]], and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#T |title=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA|accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup id=Note_1&gt;[[#Notes|[Note 1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
&lt;!-- ''Basically a country has a particular boundary on the surface of the earth through which one country can be separated from the other.'' Removed this addition: "Do not seek narrowly to define the word country without first considering the range of dictionary definitions such as OED and Chambers (British); Macquarie (Australian); Webster (American)." --&gt;

The word ''country'' comes from [[Old French]] ''contrée'', which derives from [[Vulgar Latin]] (''terra'') ''contrata'' ("(land) lying opposite"; "(land) spread before"), derived from ''contra'' ("against, opposite"). It most likely entered the English language after the [[Norman invasion of England|Franco-Norman invasion]] during the 11th century.

In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the [[indefinite article]] – "a country" – through misuse and subsequent conflation is now a [[synonym]] for state, or a former [[sovereign state]], in the sense of sovereign territory or "district, native land".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], Country&lt;/ref&gt; Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the [[West Country]] in England, the [[Black Country]] (a heavily industrialized part of England), "[[Constable Country]]" (a part of [[East Anglia]] painted by [[John Constable]]), the "big country" (used in various contexts of the [[American West]]), "coal country" (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| editor = John Simpson, Edmund Weiner | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = 1971 compact | publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 978-0198611868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent terms in French and other [[Romance language]]s (''[[Pays (France)|pays]]'' and variants) have not carried the process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the English "country", instead derived from, [[pagus]], which designated the territory controlled by a medieval [[count]], a title originally granted by the Roman Church. In many European countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the [[States of Germany|German Bundesländer]], as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state. France has very many "pays" that are officially recognised at some level, and are either [[natural region]]s, like the [[Pays de Bray]], or reflect old political or economic entities, like the [[Pays de la Loire]].

A version of "country" can be found in the modern [[French language]] as ''contrée'', based on the word ''cuntrée'' in [[Old French]],&lt;ref name="oed" /&gt; that is used similarly to the word "pays" to define non-state regions, but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases. The modern Italian ''contrada'' is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.

==Sovereignty status==
{{See also|List of sovereign states}}

The term "country" can refer to a [[sovereign state]]. There is no universal agreement on the number of "countries" in the world since a number of states have [[List of states with limited recognition|disputed sovereignty status]]. There are [[List of sovereign states|206 sovereign states]], of which 193 states are members of the [[United Nations]], two states have observer status at the U.N. (the [[Holy See]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]), and 11 other states are neither a member or observer at the U.N. All are defined as states by [[declarative theory of statehood]] and [[constitutive theory of statehood]]. The latest proclaimed state is [[South Sudan]] in 2011.

Although not sovereign states, [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are [[Countries of the United Kingdom|countries]] (depending on context), which collectively form the [[United Kingdom]]—a sovereign state that is commonly, but erroneously referred to as a country. The United Kingdom is a Union of four separate countries brought about by a series of International treaties and legislated for by several Acts of Union, the first of which being the [[Acts of Union 1707]] in both the English and Scottish parliaments. While a political Union was created, Scotland and England retained a distinct church, legal system and education system, as a result, the issue of Sovereignty is different in the two countries, in Scotland Sovereignty lies with the people, whereas in England Sovereignty lies with Parliament and the Monarch. [[Lord President of the Court of Session|Lord President]] ([[Thomas Cooper, 1st Baron Cooper of Culross|Lord Cooper]] stated that "the principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish Constitutional Law", and that legislation contrary to the Act of Union would not necessarily be regarded as constitutionally valid. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loveland|first1=Ian|title=Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, and Human Rights: A Critical Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=2015|isbn=978-0198709039|pages=43–47|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y7S6BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doherty|first1=Michael|title=Public Law|date=2016|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=978-1317206651|pages=198–201|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=065TDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Hilaire|title=Constitutional &amp; Administrative Law|date=2014|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=978-1317446224|pages=119–123|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tzScBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lib of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/uk.php|title=Legal Research Guide: United Kingdom|publisher=[[Law Library of Congress]]|date=2009-07-23|accessdate=2013-03-29|quote=The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the collective name of four countries, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

The [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], a sovereign state, comprises four separate countries: Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten.

The degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries varies widely. Some are possessions of sovereign states, as several states have overseas territories (such as [[French Polynesia]] or the [[British Virgin Islands]]), with citizenry at times identical and at times distinct from their own. Such territories, with the exception of distinct [[dependent territories]], are usually listed together with sovereign states on lists of countries, but may nonetheless be treated as a separate "[[country of origin]]" in international trade, as [[Hong Kong]] is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thuytiencrampton.com/2010/07/07/made-in-the-british-crown-colony/|title=Made In The British Crown Colony|work=Thuy-Tien Crampton|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075644/http://thuytiencrampton.com/2010/07/07/made-in-the-british-crown-colony/|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,41342017,var,MATCHBOX-LABEL-MADE-IN-HONG-KONG,language,E.html#.Uzrl3vmSwZg|title = Matchbox label, made in Hong Kong|work = delcampe.net|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.today/20140401162502/http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,41342017,var,MATCHBOX-LABEL-MADE-IN-HONG-KONG,language,E.html%23.UzroWH3LfK5#.Uzrl3vmSwZg|archive-date = 1 April 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contractortalk.com/f40/carrhart-made-hong-kong-27324/|title=Carrhart Made In Hong Kong?|work=ContractorTalk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dependency theory''' is the notion that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and [[Developing country|underdeveloped states]] to a "core" of [[Developed country|wealthy states]], enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[world system]]".

The theory arose as a reaction to [[modernization theory]], an earlier [[development theory|theory of development]] which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of [[poverty]] is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as [[investment]], [[technology transfer]]s, and closer integration into the [[World economy|world market]]. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Newschool, [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm "Economic Development"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714063027/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm|date=14 July 2009}}, retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency theory no longer has many proponents as an overall theory, though some writers have argued for its continuing relevance as a conceptual orientation to the global division of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1997|last1=James|first1=Paul|authorlink2=Paul James (academic)|title=Post-Dependency: The Third World in an Era of Globalism and Late Capitalism|url=https://www.academia.edu/7311042/Post-Dependency_The_Third_World_in_an_Era_of_Globalism_and_Late_Capitalism|journal=Alternatives: Social Transformation and Human Governance|volume=22|issue=2|pages=205–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dependency theory originates with two papers published in 1949 – one by [[Hans Singer]], one by [[Raúl Prebisch]] – in which the authors observe that the [[terms of trade]] for underdeveloped countries relative to the developed countries had deteriorated over time: the underdeveloped countries were able to purchase fewer and fewer [[Final good|manufactured goods]] from the developed countries in exchange for a given quantity of their raw materials exports. This idea is known as the [[Prebisch–Singer hypothesis|Prebisch–Singer thesis]]. Prebisch, an Argentine economist at the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|United Nations Commission for Latin America]] (UNCLA), went on to conclude that the underdeveloped nations must employ some degree of [[protectionism]] in trade if they were to enter a self-sustaining development path. He argued that [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substitution industrialisation]] (ISI), not a [[Export-oriented industrialization|trade-and-export orientation]], was the best strategy for underdeveloped countries.&lt;ref&gt;Short [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/prebisch.htm Prebisch biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812085123/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/prebisch.htm |date=2009-08-12 }} at Newschool; retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was developed from a [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] perspective by [[Paul A. Baran]] in 1957 with the publication of his ''The Political Economy of Growth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matias Vernengo|url=http://www.econ.utah.edu/activities/papers/2004_06.pdf|title=Technology, Finance and Dependency: Latin American Radical Political Economy in Retospect|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317085658/http://www.econ.utah.edu/activities/papers/2004_06.pdf|archivedate=17 March 2012|year=2004|page=5}}Working Paper No. 2004-06, University of Utah Dept. of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency theory shares many points with earlier, Marxist, theories of [[imperialism]] by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]], and has attracted continued interest from Marxists. Some authors identify two main streams in dependency theory: the Latin American Structuralist, typified by the work of Prebisch, [[Celso Furtado]], and [[Aníbal Pinto Santa Cruz|Aníbal Pinto]] at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC, or, in Spanish, CEPAL); and the American Marxist, developed by [[Paul A. Baran]], [[Paul Sweezy]], and [[Andre Gunder Frank]].

Using the Latin American dependency model, the Guyanese Marxist historian [[Walter Rodney]], in his book ''How Europe Underdeveloped Africa'', described in 1972 an Africa that had been consciously exploited by European imperialists, leading directly to the modern underdevelopment of most of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney, W. (1972). How Europe underdeveloped Africa. Beyond borders: Thinking critically about global issues, 107-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was popular in the 1960s and 1970s as a criticism of modernization theory, which was falling increasingly out of favor because of continued widespread poverty in much of the world. It was used to explain the causes of [[overurbanization]], a theory that urbanization rates outpaced industrial growth in several developing countries.&lt;ref name=Shandra&gt;Shandra, John M., Bruce London, and John B. Williamson. "Environmental Degradation, Environmental Sustainability, and Overurbanization in the Developing World: A Quantitative, Cross-National Analysis." Sociological Perspectives 46, no. 3 (1 September 2003): 309–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin American Structuralist and the American Marxist schools had significant differences but agreed on some basic points:{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;blockquote&gt;[B]oth groups would agree that at the core of the dependency relation between center and periphery lays [lies] the inability of the periphery to develop an autonomous and dynamic process of technological innovation. Technology &lt;span role="presentation"&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; the Promethean force unleashed by the [[Industrial Revolution]] &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; is at the center of stage. The Center countries controlled the technology and the systems for generating technology. Foreign [[Capital (economics)|capital]] could not solve the problem, since it only led to limited transmission of technology, but not the process of innovation itself. Baran and others frequently spoke of the [[international division of labour]] – skilled workers in the center; unskilled in the periphery – when discussing key features of dependency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Baran placed surplus extraction and [[capital accumulation]] at the center of his analysis. Development depends on a population's producing more than it needs for bare subsistence (a surplus). Further, some of that surplus must be used for capital accumulation – the purchase of new [[means of production]] – if development is to occur; spending the surplus on things like luxury consumption does not produce development. Baran noted two predominant kinds of economic activity in poor countries. In the older of the two, plantation agriculture, which originated in [[Colonialism|colonial times]], most of the surplus goes to the landowners, who use it to emulate the consumption patterns of wealthy people in the developed world; much of it thus goes to purchase foreign-produced luxury items –automobiles, clothes, etc. – and little is accumulated for investing in development. The more recent kind of economic activity in the periphery is industry—but of a particular kind. It is usually carried out by foreigners, although often in conjunction with local interests. It is often under special [[tariff]] protection or other government concessions. The surplus from this production mostly goes to two places: part of it is sent back to the foreign [[shareholder]]s as [[Profit (economics)|profit]]; the other part is spent on conspicuous consumption in a similar fashion to that of the plantation aristocracy. Again, little is used for development. Baran thought that political revolution was necessary to break this pattern.

In the 1960s, members of the Latin American Structuralist school argued that there is more latitude in the system than the Marxists believed. They argued that it allows for partial development or "dependent development"&amp;ndash;development, but still under the control of outside decision makers. They cited the partly successful attempts at [[industrialisation]] in Latin America around that time (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico) as evidence for this hypothesis. They were led to the position that dependency is not a relation between commodity exporters and industrialised countries, but between countries with different degrees of industrialisation. In their approach, there is a distinction made between the economic and political spheres: economically, one may be developed or underdeveloped; but even if (somewhat) economically developed, one may be politically autonomous or dependent.&lt;ref&gt;So, Alvin Y. 1990. Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory. Newbury Park, London and New Delhi: Sage Publications
&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Guillermo O'Donnell]] has argued that constraints placed on development by [[neoliberalism]] were lifted by the military coups in Latin America that came to promote development in authoritarian guise (O'Donnell, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;G O'Donnell, ''El Estado Burocrático Autoritario: Triunfos, Derrotas y Crisis'', Buenos Aires, Universidad de Belgrano, written 1982, published 1996, cited in Vernengo, ''Technology, Finance and Dependency'', p 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of [[multinational corporation]]s and state promotion of technology were emphasised by the Latin American Structuralists.

Fajnzybler has made a distinction between systemic or authentic competitiveness, which is the ability to compete based on higher productivity, and spurious competitiveness, which is based on low wages.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Vernengo, p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Debt of developing countries|third-world debt]] crisis of the 1980s and continued stagnation in Africa and Latin America in the 1990s caused some doubt as to the feasibility or desirability of "dependent development".&lt;ref&gt;Vernengo, p 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sine qua non'' of the dependency relationship is not the difference in technological sophistication, as traditional dependency theorists believe, but rather the difference in financial strength between core and peripheral countries&amp;ndash;particularly the inability of peripheral countries to borrow in their own currency. He believes that the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] position of the United States is very strong because of the importance of its financial markets and because it controls the international [[reserve currency]] &amp;ndash; the [[United States dollar|US dollar]]. He believes that the end of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international financial agreements]] in the early 1970s considerably strengthened the United States' position because it removed some constraints on their financial actions.

"Standard" dependency theory differs from Marxism, in arguing against [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and any hope of progress in less developed nations towards industrialization and a liberating revolution. Theotonio dos Santos described a "new dependency", which focused on both the internal and external relations of less-developed countries of the periphery, derived from a Marxian analysis. Former Brazilian President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] (in office 1995&amp;ndash;2002) wrote extensively on dependency theory while in political exile during the 1960s, arguing that it was an approach to studying the economic disparities between the centre and periphery. Cardoso summarized his version of dependency theory as follows:
*there is a financial and technological penetration by the developed capitalist centers of the countries of the periphery and semi-periphery;
*this produces an unbalanced economic structure both within the peripheral societies and between them and the centers;
*this leads to limitations on self-sustained growth in the periphery;
*this favors the appearance of specific patterns of [[Social class|class]] relations;
*these require modifications in the role of the state to guarantee both the functioning of the economy and the political articulation of a society, which contains, within itself, foci of inarticulateness and structural imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Cardoso &amp; Faletto, 1979, cited in Tausch, ''Sustainable Development and Turkey's Accession'', about 1/6 of way through.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of development patterns in the 1990s and beyond is complicated by the fact that capitalism develops not smoothly, but with very strong and self-repeating ups and downs, called cycles. Relevant results are given in studies by Joshua Goldstein, Volker Bornschier, and Luigi Scandella.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With the economic growth of India and some East Asian economies, dependency theory has lost some of its former influence. It still influences some [[NGO]] campaigns, such as [[Make Poverty History]] and the [[fair trade]] movement.

==Other theorists and related theories==
Two other early writers relevant to dependency theory were [[François Perroux]] and [[Kurt W. Rothschild|Kurt Rothschild]]. Other leading dependency theorists include Herb Addo, [[Walden Bello]], Ruy Mauro Marini, Enzo Faletto, Armando Cordova, Ernest Feder, Pablo González Casanova, [[Keith Griffin (economist)|Keith Griffin]], [[Kunibert Raffer]], Paul Israel Singer, and Osvaldo Sunkel. Many of these authors focused their attention on Latin America; the leading dependency theorist in the Islamic world is the Egyptian economist [[Samir Amin]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tausch|first=Arno|date=2003|title=Social Cohesion, Sustainable Development and Turkey's Accession to the European Union: Implications from a Global Model|url=http://alternativesjournal.net/article/view/5000159492/5000143927|journal=[[Alternatives: Turkish Journal of International Relations]]|volume=2|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|via=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827004744/http://alternativesjournal.net/article/view/5000159492/5000143927|archivedate=27 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tausch,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; based on works of Amin from 1973 to 1997, lists the following main characteristics of periphery capitalism:
#Regression in both agriculture and small scale industry characterizes the period after the onslaught of foreign domination and colonialism
#Unequal international specialization of the periphery leads to the concentration of activities in export-oriented agriculture and or mining. Some industrialization of the periphery is possible under the condition of low wages, which, together with rising productivity, determine that unequal exchange sets in (double factorial terms of trade &lt; 1.0; see Raffer, 1987)
#These structures determine in the long run a rapidly growing tertiary sector with hidden unemployment and the rising importance of rent in the overall social and economic system
#Chronic current account balance deficits, re-exported profits of foreign investments, and deficient business cycles at the periphery that provide important markets for the centers during world economic upswings
#Structural imbalances in the political and social relationships, inter alia a strong '[[wikt:comprador|compradore]]' element and the rising importance of state capitalism and an indebted state class&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The American sociologist [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] refined the Marxist aspect of the theory and expanded on it, to form [[world-systems theory]]. This postulates a third category of countries, the ''semi-periphery'', intermediate between the core and periphery. Wallerstein believed in a tri-modal rather than a bi-modal system because he viewed the world-systems as more complicated than a simplistic classification as either core or periphery nations. To Wallerstein, many nations do not fit into one of these two categories, so he proposed the idea of a semi-periphery as an in between state within his model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory|last=So|first=Alvin|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|year=1990|isbn=|location=Newbury Park, London|pages=169-199|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the semi-periphery is industrialized, but with less sophistication of technology than in the core; and it does not control finances. The rise of one group of semi-peripheries tends to be at the cost of another group, but the unequal structure of the world economy based on unequal exchange tends to remain stable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tausch&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; traces the beginnings of world-systems theory to the writings of the Austro-Hungarian socialist [[Karl Polanyi]] after the [[World War I|First World War]], but its present form is usually associated with the work of Wallerstein.

Dependency theory has also been associated with [[Johan Galtung]]'s structural theory of imperialism.

Dependency theorists hold that short-term spurts of growth notwithstanding, long-term growth in the periphery will be imbalanced and unequal, and will tend towards high negative [[current account]] balances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cyclical fluctuations also have a profound effect on cross-national comparisons of economic growth and societal development in the medium and long run. What seemed like spectacular long-run growth may in the end turn out to be just a short run cyclical spurt after a long recession. Cycle time plays an important role. [[Giovanni Arrighi]] believed that the logic of accumulation on a world scale shifts over time, and that the 1980s and beyond once more showed a deregulated phase of world capitalism with a logic, characterized - in contrast to earlier regulatory cycles - by the dominance of financial capital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is argued that, at this stage, the role of [[unequal exchange]] in the entire relationship of dependency cannot be underestimated.{{Clarify|date=August 2016}} Unequal exchange is given if double factorial terms of trade of the respective country are &lt; 1.0 (Raffer, 1987, Amin, 1975).

The former ideological head of the [[Blekingegade Gang]] and political activist [[Torkil Lauesen]] argues in his book ''The Global Perspective'' that political theory and practice stemming from dependency theory are more relevant than ever.&lt;ref&gt;Lauesen, Torkil. ''The Global Perspective: Reflections on Imperialism and Resistance''. Montreal: Kersplebedeb, 2018. p. 321ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He postulates that the conflict between countries in the core and countries in the periphery has been ever-intensifying and that the world is at the onset of a resolution of the core-periphery contradiction – that humanity is "in for an economic and political rollercoaster ride".&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Economic policies based on dependency theory has been criticized by [[Free market|free-market]] economists such as [[Peter Thomas Bauer|Peter Bauer]] and [[Martin Wolf]] and others:&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Zinkina J. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=361&amp;Itemid=1 On the structure of the present-day convergence. ''Campus-Wide Information Systems''. Vol. 31 No. 2/3, 2014, pp. 139–152]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Lack of competition: by subsidizing in-country industries and preventing outside imports, these companies may have less incentive to improve their products, to try to become more efficient in their processes, to please customers, or to research new innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Michelle|title=The End of the Developmental State?|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415854822|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sustainability: industries reliant on government support may not be sustainable for very long, particularly in poorer countries and countries which largely depend on foreign aid from more developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
*Domestic opportunity costs: subsidies on domestic industries come out of state coffers and therefore represent money not spent in other ways, like development of domestic infrastructure, seed capital or need-based social welfare programs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} At the same time, the higher prices caused by tariffs and restrictions on imports require the people either to forgo these goods altogether or buy them at higher prices, forgoing other goods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Market economists cite a number of examples in their arguments against dependency theory. The improvement of [[India]]'s economy after it moved from state-controlled business to open trade is one of the most often cited (''see also'' [[economy of India]], ''[[The Commanding Heights]]''). India's example seems to contradict dependency theorists' claims concerning comparative advantage and mobility, as much as its economic growth originated from movements such as [[outsourcing]] – one of the most mobile forms of capital transfer. [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]] provide another example of trade-based development vs. autocratic self-sufficiency. Following the Korean War, North Korea pursued a policy of [[import substitution industrialization]] as suggested by dependency theory, while South Korea pursued a policy of [[export-oriented industrialization]] as suggested by comparative advantage theory. In 2013, South Korea's per capita GDP was 18 times that of North Korea. In Africa, states which have emphasized import-substitution development, such as [[Zimbabwe]], have typically been among the worst performers, while the continent's most successful non-oil based economies, such as [[Egypt]], [[South Africa]], and [[Tunisia]], have pursued trade-based development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/economic_studies/whats_driving_africas_growth&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economic historian Robert C. Allen, dependency theory's claims are "debatable", and that the protectionism that was implemented in Latin America as a solution ended up failing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780199596652.html|title=Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction {{!}} Robert C.

The '''European Gendarmerie Force''' ('''EUROGENDFOR''' or '''EGF''') is a European intervention force with militarised police functions and specialisation in crisis management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiep.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/E-reader-FIEP-Seminarbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a&gt;Giovanni Arcudi &amp; Michael E. Smith (2013), [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09662839.2012.747511 The European Gendarmerie Force: a solution in search of problems?], ''European Security'', 22:1, 1-20, DOI: [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09662839.2012.747511 10.1080/09662839.2012.747511]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EGF was launched by an agreement in 2006 between five [[Member State of the European Union|member states]] of the [[European Union]] (EU): [[France]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], and [[Spain]]. [[Romania]] joined in 2009; [[Poland]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=poland&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zw.wp.mil.pl/en/253.html|title=European Gendarmerie Force|accessdate=2013-12-31|publisher=[[Żandarmeria Wojskowa]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its status is enshrined in the '''Treaty of Velsen''' of 18 October 2007.&lt;ref name=treatytext&gt;Eurogendfor.org, [http://www.eurogendfor.org/eurogendfor-library/download-area/official-texts/establishing-the-eurogendfor-treaty Treaty establishing the European Gendarmerie Force], accessed on January 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters are located in [[Vicenza]], Italy.

The EGF is presently not established at the EU level (referred to as the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]], CSDP); it is for instance not a [[Permanent Structured Cooperation#Projects|project]] of the [[Permanent Structured Cooperation]] (PESCO) of the CSDP. The EGF may however contribute in the implementation of the CSDP, when made available as a ''multinational force'' in accordance with article 42.3 of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU).

==History==
The [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Defence Minister]] [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]] first proposed the force in September 2003. Alliot-Marie and the [[Italian Minister of Defence|Italian Defense Minister]] [[Antonio Martino]] presented the idea at the Meeting of [[European Union]] Defense Ministers in October 2003. The implementation agreement was finally signed by defence ministers of the five participating countries on 17 September 2004 in [[Noordwijk]], Netherlands. On 23 January 2006, the EGF was officially inaugurated during a military ceremony in the Gen. Chinotto barracks in Vicenza.

The EGF was declared fully operational on 20 July 2006, following the High Level Interministerial meeting in Madrid, Spain, and its second successful Command Post exercise (CPX), which took place between 19–28 April 2006. The first CPX was held at the National Gendarmerie Training Center in Saint Astier, France in June 2005.

After [[Romania]]'s accession to the European Union, the [[Jandarmeria Română|Romanian Gendarmerie]] sought permanent observer status with the European Gendarmerie Force, as a first step towards full membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.jandarmeriaromana.ro/pagini/ci_polEuro3.html ''Politica europeană - Forţa de Jandarmerie Europeană'' (European Policy - European Gendarmerie Force)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830220141/http://www.jandarmeriaromana.ro/pagini/ci_polEuro3.html |date=2007-08-30 }}, Romanian Gendarmerie website, accessed on January 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On March 3, 2009, the Romanian Gendarmerie became a full member of the European Gendarmerie Force.&lt;ref&gt;Eurogendfor.eu, [http://www.eurogendfor.eu/ EGF News], accessed on March 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poland|Polish]] [[Military Gendarmerie]] was originally a partner force and, on 10 October 2006, Poland indicated it would like to join the EGF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200610/10/eng20061010_310452.html|title=People's Daily Online  -- Poland expresses readiness to join European Gendarmerie Force|first=|last=english@peopledaily.com.cn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, Poland applied for full membership in EGF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zw.wp.mil.pl/pl/53.html|title=..:: Żandarmeria Wojskowa - Komenda Główna ŻW :: EGF ::..|first=made by Marcin Kuhiwczak &amp; Piotr Makuracki|last=Rydzyk|date=2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was granted in 2011.&lt;ref name=poland/&gt;

==Missions==
*Since December 2009, the EGF has taken part in the NATO [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) training operation of the [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]]. As of June 2010, 276 members of the EGF (among which 124 French gendarmes), from France, Spain, Netherlands, Poland and Portugal are training the [[Afghan National Civil Order Police]] (ANCOP) officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s, while the initial mission was planned to be around 400 to 500 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.nordeclair.fr/France-Monde/Monde/2009/06/12/des-gendarmes-picards-bientot-en-afghani.shtml Des gendarmes picards bientôt en Afghanistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727112807/http://www.nordeclair.fr/France-Monde/Monde/2009/06/12/des-gendarmes-picards-bientot-en-afghani.shtml |date=2011-07-27 }}, Nord Éclair, 12 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They are training them in ANCOP training centers but are also accompanying, advising and helping them during their missions in P-[[OMLT]] (Police Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/cr-cafe/09-10/c0910077.asp (French) report from the commission on Foreign matters of the French Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_la_une/toute_l_actualite/affaires-europeennes/gendarmes-en-afghanistan/view (French), "Gendarmes in Afghanistan", French Internals affairs Ministry website&lt;/ref&gt; where their military experience (even if the mission is strictly speaking civilian since it is "formation") will be useful. As of May 2010, it had trained 50 officers and 250 non-commissioned officers of the ANCOP, and the then French Minister of Defense Brice Hortefeux announced that 40 more French gendarmes would be sent to help this mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_la_une/toute_l_actualite/affaires-europeennes/deplacement-afghanistan/view (French)  "Brice Hortefeux honours the contribution of French policemen and gendarmes to the Afghan police training", French Internals affairs Ministry website&lt;/ref&gt;

*In early 2010, the EGF was deployed to [[Haiti]] to help with post-relief security efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = European gendarmes to beef up Haiti security | url = http://www.euronews.net/2010/01/25/earthquate-in-haiti-european-gendarmes-to-beef-up-haiti-security | publisher = euronews  | date =  | accessdate = 3 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Eurogendfor members.svg|thumb|right|EGF members.]]
The EGF is based in [[Vicenza]], in northeastern Italy, and has a core of 800 to 900 members ready to deploy within 30 days.

An additional 2,300 reinforcements are available on standby.

==Members==
The treaty allows for any [[EU member state]] to become a European Gendarmerie Force member state, subject to the approval of existing European Gendarmerie Force members.&lt;ref name=treatytext/&gt;  The member forces are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogendfor.org/organization/participating-forces/members |title=Members |accessdate=2013-12-31 |publisher=European Gendarmerie Force |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101074418/http://www.eurogendfor.org/organization/participating-forces/members |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://verdragenbank.overheid.nl/en/Treaty/Details/011496.html|title=Treaty between the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Portuguese Republic, establishing the European Gendarmerie Force EUROGENDFOR|accessdate=2018-05-23|publisher=Government of the Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany does not take part, as its constitution does not permit the use of military forces for police services. In 2004, Peter Struck, Minister of Defense at the time, clarified that the legal foundation for militarised police forces is different from the expectations underlying the EGF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lalibre.be/actu/international/article/184304/des-gendarmes-europeens-en-renfort.html "Des gendarmes européens en renfort"], 17/09/2004&lt;/ref&gt; The paramilitary [[Bereitschaftspolizei]] units of the Länder states have no standing patrol order like the [[German Federal Police]]. Germany did not sign the Treaty of Velsen on the EGF or any subsequent accord.&lt;ref&gt;DerStandard.at, [http://derstandard.at/1389857860322/Welche-Befugnisse-hat-die-Europaeische-Gendarmerietruppe-EGF Welche Befugnisse hat die Europäische Gendarmerietruppe?], accessed on February 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, there is a tight integration of police forces based on the [[Prüm Treaty]]. Originally the Prüm Treaty regulated access to police databases of neighboring countries but it was used multiple times as the legal foundation to exchange [[riot police]] equipment and personnel with the participating countries (Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium). In 2008 the Prüm Treaty was naturalised as EU law, allowing countries access to police forces regulated under EU law (based on the [[Schengen Agreement]]). The European Police Forces Training of 2009 (EUPFT 2009) was run in Vicenza (home of EGF headquarters) and the EUPFT 2010 on anti-riot tactics was run in Lehnin in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundespolizei.de/DE/Home/06__Presse/BUNDESPOLIZEI-kompakt/Bundespolizei__kompakt-Ausgabe__2010-02,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/Bundespolizei_kompakt-Ausgabe_2010-02.pdf "Von Vicenza nach Lehnin"], Bundespolizei kompakt (German federal police journal), February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/blogs/8/147676|title=Bundespolizei lädt zum Häuserkampf|first=Matthias|last=Monroy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with EU defence policy==
The EGF is presently not established at the EU level (referred to as the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]], CSDP); it is for instance not a [[Permanent Structured Cooperation#Projects|project]] of the [[Permanent Structured Cooperation]] (PESCO) of the CSDP. The EGF may however contribute in the implementation of the CSDP, when made available as a ''multinational force'' in accordance with article 42.3 of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35859">The '''FIVB World Ranking''' is a ranking system for men's and women's national teams in [[volleyball]]. The teams of the member nations of [[FIVB]], volleyball's world governing body, are ranked based on their competitions results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. A point system is used, with points being awarded based on the importance of each FIVB International competitions and Continental competitions also. Under the existing system, rankings are based on a team's performance, with more recent results and more significant competitions being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team. {{as of|2017|August}} the top 3 teams in men's category are, world's no.1 [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], no.2 [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], no.3 [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] and in women's category are as follows, world's no.1 [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], no.2 [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]], no.3 [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]].

The ranking system was most recently revamped after the 2006 [[FIVB World League|World League]] (for men) and 2006 [[FIVB World Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] (for women).

The rankings are used in international competitions to define the seeded teams and arrange them in pools. Specific procedures for seeding and pooling are established by the FIVB in each competition's formula, but the method usually employed is the [[serpentine system]].

'''Forced displacement''' or '''forced immigration''' is the coerced movement of a person or people away from their [[home]] or home [[region]] and it often connotes violent coercion. Someone who has experienced forced displacement is a '''"forced immigrant"''', a '''"displaced person" (DP)''', rarely also a '''"displacee"''', or if it is within the same country, an [[internally displaced person]] (IDP). In some cases the forced immigrant can also become a [[refugee]], as that term has a specific legal definition. A specific form of forced displacement is [[population transfer]], which is a coherent policy to move unwanted groups, for example, as an attempt at [[ethnic cleansing]]. Another form is [[deportation]].

Forced displacement has accompanied persecution, as well as war, throughout human history but has only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention is the result of greater ease of travel, allowing displaced people to flee to nations far removed from their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and the realizations that the destabilizing effects of forced immigration, especially in parts of [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], south and central [[Asia]], ripple out well beyond the immediate region.

== Definition ==
The concept of forced displacement envelopes demographic movements like flight, evacuation, displacement, and resettlement. The [[International Organization for Migration]] defines a forced migrant as any person who migrates to "escape persecution, conflict, repression, natural and human-made disasters, ecological degradation, or other situations that endanger their lives, freedom or livelihood".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/publication/wcms_160632.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821023804/http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp |archivedate=2011-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Association for the Study of Forced Migration]] (IASFM) defines it as "the movements of refugees and internally displaced people (those displaced by conflicts) as well as people displaced by natural or environmental disasters, chemical or nuclear disasters, famine, or development projects."&lt;ref name="forcedmigration.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcedmigration.org/about/whatisfm/what-is-forced-migration|title=What is forced migration? — Forced Migration Online|website=www.forcedmigration.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alden Speare, "in the strictest sense migration can be considered to be involuntary only when a person is physically transported from a country and has no opportunity to escape from those transporting him." Movement under threat, even the immediate threat to life, contains a voluntary element, as long as there is an option to escape to another part of the country, go into hiding or to remain and hope to avoid persecution."&lt;ref name=conflict/&gt; However this thought has been questioned, especially by Marxians, who argue that in most cases migrants have little or no choice.&lt;ref name=conflict&gt;{{cite web |title=FORCED MIGRATION IN INDONESIA : HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES |url=http://www.conflictrecovery.org/bin/Graeme_Hugo-Forced_Migration_in_Indonesia-Historical_Perspectives.doc |work=graeme hugo |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Causes for forced displacement can include:
* [[Natural disaster]]: Occurrence of a disaster – such as floods, tsunamis, landslides, earthquakes or volcanoes – leads to temporary or permanent displacement of population from that area. In such a scenario, migration becomes more of a survival strategy, as natural disasters often cause the loss of money, homes, and jobs. For example, [[Hurricane Katrina]] resulted in displacement of almost the entire population of New Orleans, leaving the community and government with several economic and social challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://understandingkatrina.ssrc.org/Oliver-Smith/ |title=Disasters and Forced Migration in the 21st Century |work=ssrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Environmental problems]]: The term [[environmental refugee]] has been in use recently representing people who are forced to leave their traditional habitat because of environmental factors which negatively impact his or her livelihood, or even environmental disruption i.e. biological, physical or chemical change in ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil. Environmentally-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges, University de Liege, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Migration can also occur as a result of slow-onset [[climate change]], such as [[desertification]] or [[sea-level rise]], of deforestation or [[land degradation]]. Man-made disasters can also cause forced migration: examples are industrial accidents and especially accidents that involve radioactivity, such as in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] or [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]]. An elaboration of such migrants is given by Essam El-Hinnawi:
# Migrants who are able to return to their original habitat once the disruption is over, as in the case of the [[Bhopal disaster]].
# Migrants  who remain permanently displaced.
# Migrants  who seek better living conditions due to deterioration of environmental conditions in their present habitat, such as soil fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/show_metadata.jsp?pid=fmo:1158 |title=Environment and forced migration : a review   Paper for 4th IRAP conference 5–9 January 1994, Oxford |author=Forced Migration Online, Refugee Studies Centre, Oxford Department of International Development, University of Oxford |work=forcedmigration.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 19th century, for example, Ireland experienced a famine never before seen in the country’s history.
* [[War]], [[civil war]], [[political repression]] or [[Religious intolerance|religious conflict]]s: Some migrants are impelled to cross national borders by war or persecution, due to political, social, ethnic, religious reasons. These immigrants may be considered [[refugees]] if they apply for [[asylum seekers|asylum]] in the receiving country.&lt;ref&gt;Conventions No. 29, 105, 138 and 182; Convention No. 97 (Art. 3, Annex I; Art. 8 and Annex II, Art. 13); Convention No. 143, Part I; 1990 International Convention (Art. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Development-induced displacement]]: Such displacement or [[population transfer]] is the forcing of communities and individuals out of their homes, often also their homelands, for the purposes of [[economic development]]. It has been historically associated with the construction of dams for [[hydroelectric power]] and [[irrigation]] purposes but also appears due to many other activities, such as [[mining]] and transport (roads, ports, airports). The best-known recent example of such development-induced displacement may be that resulting from the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in [[China]]. This type of forced migration disproportionately affects low income earners and ethnic minorities. According to estimates, between 90 and 100 million people were forced to leave their homes due to development projects in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="forcedmigration.org"/&gt;
* [[Human trafficking]] and [[human smuggling]]: Migrants displaced through deception or coercion with purpose of their exploitation fall under this category. The data on such forced migration are limited since the activities involved are clandestine in nature. While migration of this nature is well covered for male migrants (working in agriculture, construction etc.), same cannot be said for their female counterparts as the market situation for them might be unscrupulous (sex work or domestic service). The [[International Labour Organization]] considers trafficking an offence against labor protection and denies them the opportunity of utilizing their resources for their country. ILO’s Multilateral Framework includes principle no. 11 that recommends, "Governments should formulate and implement, in consultation with the social partners, measures to prevent abusive practices, migrant smuggling and people trafficking; they should also work towards preventing irregular labor migration.
* [[Slavery]]: History's greatest forced migration was the [[Middle Passage]] of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] during the 15th through the 19th centuries.  Of the 20 million Africans captured for the trade, half died in their forced march to the African coast, and another ten to twenty percent died on slave ships carrying them from Africa to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p277.html |author=PBS-WGBH |title=The Middle Passage |work=Africans in America |date=1999 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ethnic cleansing]]: The systematic forced removal of ethnic or religious groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous.

==Conditions==

In the majority of cases forced migration across borders takes place without the required documentation. It may even involve human smugglers and traffickers. Displaced people often place their lives at risk, are obliged to travel in inhumane conditions and may be exposed to exploitation and abuse. And on top of that the states where they seek protection may regard them as a threat to their security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf | page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and distinctions between the terms==
{{see|Refugee law|Refugee}}
* The term 'Refugee Studies' denotes an academic discipline or field of study which covers the study of refugees, often their experiences in seeking refuge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Bobby Thomas|date=2014|title=Reflections on Refugee Studies and the Study of Refugees: Implications for Policy Analysts|url=https://bobbycameron.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/final_bobby-thomas-cameron_refugee-studies.pdf|journal=Journal of Management &amp; Public Policy|volume=6|pages=4–13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several categories of individuals who are included in this study, with labels that include: 'Refugee’; ‘expellees’; ‘exile’; ‘displaced person’; ‘internally displaced person (IDP)’; ‘economic refugees’; ‘humanitarian refugee’; ‘stateless person’; ‘tsunami refugee’; ‘development refugee’; ‘environmental refugee’; ‘government assisted refugee (GAR)’ etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The term displaced person (DP) was first widely used during [[World War II]] and the resulting refugee outflows from [[Eastern Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wyman: ''Dps: Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945–1951''. Cornell University Press 1998 (reprint). {{ISBN|0-8014-8542-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when it was used to specifically refer to one removed from his or her native country as a [[refugee]], [[prison]]er or a [[unfree labour|slave laborer]]. Most of the victims of war, political refugees and DPs of the immediate post-Second World War period were Ukrainians, Poles, other Slavs, as well as citizens of the Baltic states – Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians, who refused to return to Soviet-dominated eastern Europe. A.J. Jaffe claimed that the term was originally coined by [[Eugene M. Kulischer]].&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Jaffe: Notes on the Population Theory of Eugene M. Kulischer. In: ''The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly'', Vol. 40, No. 2. (April 1962). Pp. 187–206.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3348648 (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning has significantly broadened in the past half-century.

* If the displaced person has crossed an international border and falls under one of the [[Refugee Law|relevant international legal instruments]], they may become a [[refugee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm U.N. Convention relating to status of Refugees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309151637/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm |date=March 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "refugee" is also commonly used as a synonym for displaced person, causing confusion between the general descriptive class of anyone who has left their home and the subgroup of legally defined [[refugee]]s who enjoy specified international legal protection. However, forced migrants may not apply for asylum in the country they fled to, so they may not be classed as [[asylum seeker]]s or – if application would be successful – [[refugee]]s. The terms refugee and asylum seeker always have a legal framework or system as context. If forced migrants do not access this legal system or it does not exist in the country they have fled to, they cannot be categorised as such.

* Forced migrants are always either IDPs or displaced people, as both of these terms do not require a legal framework and the fact that they left their homes is sufficient. The distinction between the terms displaced person and forced migrant is minor, however, the term displaced person has an important historic context (e.g. [[World War II]]).

* A displaced person who crosses an international border without permission from the country they are entering, and without applying for asylum, may be considered an [[illegal immigrant]].

* A displaced person who left his or her home because of political persecution or violence, but did not cross an international border, is commonly considered to be the less well-defined category of [[internally displaced person]] (IDP), and is subject to more tenuous international protection. Bogumil Terminski distinguishes two general categories of internal displacement: displacement of risk (mostly conflict-induced displacement, deportations and disaster-induced displacement) and displacement of adaptation (associated with voluntary resettlement, development-induced displacement and environmentally-induced displacement).

* If the displaced person was forced out their home because of economically driven projects like that of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China and various [[India]]n dams, it is called [[development-induced displacement]]. People are also often displaced due to [[natural disaster|natural]] or man-made disasters. Displacement can also occur as a result of slow-onset [[climate change]], such as [[desertification]] or [[sea-level rise]]. A person who is displaced due to environmental factors which negatively impact his or her livelihood is generally known as an [[environmental migrant]]. Such displacement can be cross-border in nature but is frequently internal. No specific international legal instrument applies to such individuals. Foreign nations often offer disaster relief to mitigate the effects of such disaster displacement.

* Displaced person generally refers to one who is forced to migrate for reasons other than economic conditions, such as war or persecution. A migrant who fled because of economic hardship is an [[economic migrant]].

==Criminal prosecution==
Forced displacement has been subjected to several trials before local and international courts. One of the requirements that need to be met for an offence as a [[war crime]] is that the victim is a "protected person" under [[international humanitarian law]]. The expression "protected person" originally referred only to the categories of individuals explicitly protected under one of the four [[Geneva Conventions of 1949]], but was later accepted as defining a [[civilian]] or police force who do not participate directly in a conflict.&lt;ref name=UNHCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4e0344b344.pdf | title=Legal and Protection Policy Research Series: Forced Displacement and International Crimes |publisher=UNHCR| author=Guido Acquaviva |date=June 2011|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of [[World War II]], the [[Krupp trial]] was held with a specific charge to the forced displacement of civilian populations for the purpose of forced labour. The US Military Tribunal concluded that "
[t]here is no international law that permits the deportation or the use of civilians against their will for other than on reasonable requisitions for the need of the army, either within the area of the army or after deportation to rear areas or to the homeland of the occupying power".&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt; At the [[Nuremberg trials]], [[Hans Frank]], chief jurist in [[occupied Poland]], was found guilty, among others for forced displacement of the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nuremberg-trial-judgements-hans-frank|title=Nuremberg Trial Judgements: Hans Frank|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Article 49, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], adopted on 12 August 1949, specifically forbids forced displacement:

{{quote3|Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected people from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/380-600056 |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] |title=Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949 – DEPORTATIONS, TRANSFERS, EVACUATIONS |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] defines forced displacement as a crime within the jurisdiction of the court:
{{quote3|"Deportation or forcible transfer of population" means forced displacement of the people concerned by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf |publisher=International Criminal Court |title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |year=2011 |p=7|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several people were tried and convicted by the [[ICTY]] for connection to forced displacement during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in the 1990s. On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber sentenced [[Vojislav Šešelj]] 10 years in prison under Counts 1, 10, and 11 of the indictment for instigating [[deportation]], [[persecution]] (forcible displacement), and other inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as [[crimes against humanity]] due to his speech in Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992, in which he called for the [[expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmict.org/en/news/appeals-chamber-reverses-%C5%A1e%C5%A1elj%E2%80%99s-acquittal-part-and-convicts-him-crimes-against-humanity|title=APPEALS CHAMBER REVERSES ŠEŠELJ’S ACQUITTAL, IN PART, AND CONVICTS HIM OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY| date=11 April 2018| publisher=United Nations Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/europe/un-court-sentences-ultranationalist-serb-leader-to-10-years-16638|title=UN court sentences ultranationalist Serb leader to 10 years |publisher=[[TRT World]] |accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/04/serbia-conviction-of-war-criminal-delivers-long-overdue-justice-to-victims/|title=Serbia: Conviction of war criminal delivers long overdue justice to victims| publisher=Amnesty International| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other convictions for forced displacement included ex-Bosnian Serb politician [[Momčilo Krajišnik]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal transfers former Bosnian Serb leader to UK prison |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2009/09/311692-un-tribunal-transfers-former-bosnian-serb-leader-uk-prison| date=8 September 2009|publisher=UN News |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ex-Croatian Serb leader [[Milan Martić]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal upholds 35-year jail term for leader of breakaway Croatian Serb state|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/10/277112-un-tribunal-upholds-35-year-jail-term-leader-breakaway-croatian-serb-state|date=8 October 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; former Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander [[Mladen Naletilić]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bosnian Croat commander convicted by UN tribunal to serve jail term in Italy |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/04/257282-bosnian-croat-commander-convicted-un-tribunal-serve-jail-term-italy| date=25 April 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bosnian Serb politician [[Radoslav Brđanin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bosnian Serb politician convicted by UN tribunal to serve jail term in Denmark |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/03/251232-bosnian-serb-politician-convicted-un-tribunal-serve-jail-term-denmark |date=4 March 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Gascony Show''''' is an English-language radio [[chat show]] aired in the southwest of France and a flagship Sunday evening programme broadcast on [[Radio Coteaux]]&lt;ref name=radiocoteaux1774922&gt;[http://www.radiocoteaux.com/emissionsthematiques.php "Emissions thématiques sur le site officiel de radio coteaux, frequences 104.4 et 97.7 FM"] By Patrick Martinez, Radio Coteaux&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Gascony]] region. The show is presented by Irishman John Slattery.

==The show==
[[File:John Slattery Gascony Show.jpg|thumb|left|alt=John Slattery, the Gascony Show host in the radio studio.|''The Gascony Show'' host, John Slattery, in the studio in Saint Blancard]]
John Slattery takes over the airwaves at 5pm and finishes at 7pm with a handover to Patrick Martinez. The ''Gascony Show'' is a music-based programme that includes light-hearted banter and whimsical jokes by the host. Listeners' views and comments are discussed and there are rotating segments such as "Song of The Week" and "Life in the South-West". To keep listeners on their toes, random topics are picked from a big "Bag O Topics."

Podcasts of all previous shows&lt;ref name=gasconyshow5436793&gt;[http://www.gasconyshow.com/podcasts/GasconyShowPodcasts.xml "The Gascony Show Podcasts"] Recordings of all previous shows.&lt;/ref&gt; are available on the show's website so that previous shows can be listened to again. Previous shows can also be found on iTunes.&lt;ref name=gasconyshow5434434&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/fr/podcast/the-gascony-show/id455503319 "The Gascony Show on iTunes"] Recordings of all previous shows.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invited guests==

The show runs interviews with regular and/or rotating guests,&lt;ref name=gasconyshow2334923&gt;[http://www.gasconyshow.com/archives.html "The Gascony Show Archives"] Recorded shows with guests.&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with subjects of both local interest and of general interest to the [[expatriate]] community. The first person to be interviewed on the show was the illustrious English painter, interior designer and writer, Stella Wulf.&lt;ref name=gasconyshow2345213&gt;[http://web.me.com/claire.jefferson/StellaWulf/StopPress.html "Stella Wulf, News &amp; Events"] Interview, Sunday, 10 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Stella is the author of "The Lonesome Froom and other Strange Tales," "Rum Rhymes and Vagabond" and "The Song of the Froom." She recounted humorous stories of her years in France and her efforts to get her books published.

Subsequent interviews included music industry notaries such as Joy Askew and her brother Roger Askew.&lt;ref name=pkmediapromotions6456442&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/PKMediaPromotions "The Gascony Show Channel"] Produced by PK Media Promotions.&lt;/ref&gt; These two truly multi-dimensional singers sang some of their favourite songs on air. Joy, who worked closely with the likes of [[Peter Gabriel]] and Joe Jackson, and fronted the all-girl rock band called Bitch, told her story of life as a song-writer and touring musician. The interview proved enormously popular with both English and French speaking listeners in France and it served to create a pattern of story telling and musical treats that would become an underlying trait of later interviews.

A highly commended interview was that with Leaf Fielding,&lt;ref name=leaffielding5437658&gt;[http://www.leaffielding.com/news.html "Leaf Fielding on the Gascony Show"] Interview, Sunday, 11 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the drug-dealers jailed as a result of the famous 1977 drug cartel bust in the UK called [[Operation Julie]]. The interview revolved around Leaf's life, his descent into drug dealing, his imprisonment, and his new life in France. Also discussed was Leaf’s book ''To Live Outside The Law'',&lt;ref name=leaffielding1116349&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/07/leaf-fielding-outside-law-drugs "To Live Outside The Law"] By The Guardian, Thursday, 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; that tells the story from his early days and his first experience with LSD, to his amazing falling from grace.

==Regular contributors==

The show relies heavily on e-mailed material sent in by listeners that is then read out on air, and most of the regular contributors are local [[expatriates]] living in the Gascony region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50029">'''Global citizenship''' is the idea that all [[person|people]] have [[rights]] and [[civic duties|civic responsibilities]] that come with being a member of the [[world]], with whole-world philosophy and sensibilities, rather than as a citizen of a particular [[nation]] or place. The idea is that one’s identity transcends geography or political borders and that responsibilities or rights are derived from membership in a broader class: "humanity". This does not mean that such a person denounces or waives their nationality or other, more local identities, but such identities are given "second place" to their membership in a global community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-global-citizen  Israel, Ronald C. (Spring|Summer 2012). "What Does it Mean to be a Global Citizen?" ''Kosmos.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Extended, the idea leads to questions about the state of global society in the age of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/hafa3/global.htm | title=Global Society and International Relations: Sociological and Political Perspectives | publisher=Polity Press | author=Shaw, Martin | year=2000 | location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, the term may have much the same meaning as "[[#World citizen|world citizen]]" or [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]], but it also has additional, specialized meanings in differing contexts. Various organizations, such as the [[World Service Authority]], have advocated global citizenship.

==Usage==

===Education===

In education, the term is most often used to describe a [[worldview]] or a set of [[values]] toward which education is oriented (see, for example, the priorities of the ''Global Education First Initiative'' led by the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaleducationfirst.org/220.htm "Priority #3: Foster Global Citizenship." ''Global Education First Initiative,'' Secretary-General of the United Nations.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "global society" is sometimes used to indicate a [[global studies]] set of learning objectives for students to prepare them for global citizenship (see, for example, the Global Studies Center at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/global/node/483| title=Global Studies Center | publisher=University of Pittsburgh| accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global citizenship education ====
{{Main|Global Citizenship Education}}

Within the educational system, the concept of global citizenship education (GCED) is beginning to supersede or overarch movements such as [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] education, [[peace education]], [[human rights education]], [[Education for Sustainable Development]] and [[international education]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government (2008). ''Global Perspectives: A framework for global education in Australian schools''. Carlton South Victoria, Australia: Curriculum Corporation. {{ISBN|978 1 74200 075 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, GCED rapidly incorporates references to the aforementioned movements. The concept of global citizenship has been linked with awards offered for helping humanity.&lt;ref name="twsJun16gb"&gt;{{cite news

New York: Economic Policy Institute and Teachers College. {{ISBN|978-0807748817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audrey Osler, director of the ''Centre for Citizenship and Human Rights Education'', the [[University of Leeds]], affirms that "Education for living together in an interdependent world is not an optional extra, but an essential foundation".&lt;ref&gt;Osler, Audrey and Hugh Starkey  (2010). ''Teachers and Human Rights Education.''  London:Trentham Books. {{ISBN|978-1858563848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With GCED gaining attention, scholars are investigating the field and developing perspectives. The following are a few of the more common perspectives:
* ''Critical and transformative perspective''. Citizenship is defined by being a member with rights and responsibilities. Therefore, GCED must encourage active involvement. GCED can be taught from a [[Critical thinking|critical]] and [[Transformative learning|transformative]] perspective, whereby students are thinking, feeling, and doing. In this approach, GCED requires students to be politically critical and personally transformative. Teachers provide [[social issues]] in a neutral and grade-appropriate way for students to understand, grapple with, and do something about.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, M. (2008). "You can’t criticize what you don’t understand: Teachers as social change agents in neo liberal times."  Pp. 113-126 in O’Sullivan, Michael &amp; K. Pashby (eds.) ''Citizenship in the era of globalization: Canadian perspectives''. Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Sense Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Worldmindedness''. Graham Pike and David Selby view GCED as having two strands. Worldmindedness, the first strand, refers to understanding the world as one unified system and a responsibility to view the interests of individual nations with the overall needs of the planet in mind. The second strand, [[Student-centered learning|Child-centeredness]], is a pedagogical approach that encourages students to explore and discover on their own and addresses each learner as an individual with inimitable beliefs, experiences, and talents.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, G. &amp; D. Selby (2000). ''In the Global Classroom 2''. Toronto: Pippin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Holistic Understanding''. The Holistic Understanding perspective was founded by Merry Merryfield, focusing on understanding the self in relation to a global community. This perspective follows a curriculum that attends to human values and beliefs, global systems, issues, history, [[cross-cultural]] understandings, and the development of [[Analysis|analytical]] and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] skills.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Philosophy===

Global citizenship, in some contexts, may refer to a brand of [[ethics]] or political philosophy in which it is proposed that the core [[social]], [[political]], [[economic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] realities of the world today should be addressed at all levels—by individuals, civil society organizations, communities and nation states—through a global lens.  It refers to a broad, culturally- and environmentally-inclusive worldview that accepts the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Political, geographic borders become irrelevant and solutions to today's challenges are seen to be beyond the narrow vision of national interests. Proponents of this philosophy often point to [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.) as an example, given his reported declaration that "I am a citizen of the world (κοσμοπολίτης, ''cosmopolites'')" in response to a question about his place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Book VI, Chapter 2, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sanskrit]] term, ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]]'', has the meaning of "the world is one family".&lt;ref name="malhotra"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7TlAgAAQBAJ | title=Indra's Net | publisher=Harper Collins, India. | author=Malhotra, Rajiv.| isbn=9789351362487 | date=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest reference to this phrase is found in the Hitopadesha, a collection of parables. In the [[Mahopanishad]] VI.71-73, ślokas describe how one finds the Brahman (the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the phenomenal universe). The statement is not just about peace and harmony among the societies in the world, but also about a truth that somehow the whole world has to live together like a family.&lt;ref name="malhotra" /&gt;

===Psychological studies===
{{Missing|statistics reported by polls|date=October 2018}}
Global pollsters and psychologists have studied individual differences in the sense of global citizenship. Beginning in 2005, the [[World Values Survey]], administered across almost 100 countries, included the statement, “I see myself as a world citizen.”  For smaller studies, several multi-item scales have been developed, including Sam McFarland and colleagues’ Identification with All Humanity scale (e.g., “How much do you identify with (that is, feel a part of, feel love toward, have concern for) . . . all humans everywhere?”),&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; Anna Malsch and Alan Omoto’s Psychological Sense of Global Community (e.g., “I feel a sense of connection to people all over the world, even if I don’t know them personally”),&lt;ref&gt;Malsch, A. M., &amp; Omoto, A. M. (2007). Prosocial behavior beyond borders: Understanding a psychological sense of global community. Claremont, CA: Unpublished manuscript, Department of Psychology, Claremont Graduate University.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerhard Reese and colleagues’ Global Social Identity scale (e.g. “I feel strongly connected to the world community as a whole.”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reese | first1 = G. | last2 = Proch | first2 = J. | last3 = Cohrs | first3 = J.C. | year = 2014 | title = Individual differences in responses to global inequality | doi = 10.1080/00224545.2014.992850 | journal = Analyses of Social issues and Public Policy | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 217–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Reysen and Katzarska-Miller's global citizenship identification scale (e.g., “I strongly identify with global citizens.”).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reysen | first1 = S. | last2 = Katzarska-Miller | first2 = I. | year = 2013 | title = A model of global citizenship: Antecedents and outcomes | doi = 10.1080/00207594.2012.701749 | journal = International Journal of Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 858–870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are strongly related to one another, but they are not fully identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. | last2 = Hornsby | first2 = W. | year = 2015 | title = An analysis of five measures of global human identification | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2161 | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 806–817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the psychological roots of global citizenship have found that persons high in global citizenship are also high on the personality traits of openness to experience and agreeableness from the [[Big Five personality traits]] and high in empathy and caring. Oppositely, the [[authoritarian personality]], the [[social dominance orientation]] and [[psychopathy]] are all associated with less global human identification. Some of these traits are influenced by heredity as well as by early experiences, which, in turn, likely influence individuals' receptiveness to global human identification.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. Webb | last2 = Brown | first2 = D. | year = 2012 | title = All humanity is my ingroup: A measure and studies of Identification with All Humanity | doi = 10.1037/a0028724 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 830–853 | pmid=22708625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that those who are high in global human identification are less prejudiced toward many groups, care more about international human rights, worldwide inequality, global poverty and human suffering. They attend more actively to global concerns, value the lives of all human beings more equally, and give more in time and money to international humanitarian causes. They tend to be more politically liberal on both domestic and international issues.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; They want their countries to do more to alleviate global suffering.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;

Following a [[social identity approach]], Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org" /&gt; Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural environment in which one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected to others in the world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of [[prosocial behavior]]s and values, including: intergroup [[empathy]], valuing diversity, [[social justice]], environmental [[sustainability]], intergroup [[Helping behavior|helping]], and a felt responsibility to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Student Learning: Improving Practice |last=Reysen |first=Stephen |publisher=Nova |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-62618-938-6 |location=New York |pages=121–137 |last2=Katzarska-Miller |first2=Iva |editor-last=Boyle |editor-first=Christopher |chapter=Student pathways to global citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has examined variables that influence the model such as: participation in a college course with global components,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ioep/ijdegl/2012/00000004/00000003/art00003 |title=College course curriculum and global citizenship |last=Reysen |first=Stephen |journal=International Journal of Development Education and Global Learning |doi= 10.18546/ijdegl.04.3.03|pmid= |access-date= |last2=Larey |first2=Loretta |year=2012 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=27–40 |last3=Katzarska-Miller |first3=Iva |issn=1756-526X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

===Geography, sovereignty, and citizenship===

At the same time that [[globalization]] is reducing the importance of [[nation-states]],&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of global citizenship may require a redefinition of ties between civic engagement and geography.  Face-to-face [[town hall meeting]]s seem increasingly supplanted by electronic "town halls" not limited by space and time.{{fact|date=October 2018}} [[Absentee ballot]]s opened the way for [[expatriate]]s to vote while living in another country; the Internet may carry this several steps further. Another interpretation given by several scholars of the changing configurations of citizenship due to globalization is the possibility that citizenship becomes a changed institution; even if situated within territorial boundaries that are national, if the meaning of the national itself has changed, then the meaning of being a citizen of that nation changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sassen|first=Saskia|title=Towards post-national and denationalized citizenship|year=2003|publisher=Sage|location=New York|pages=286|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sjs2/PDFs/Towards_Post-National_and_Denationalized_Citizenship.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
The lack of a universally recognized world body can put the initiative upon global citizens themselves to create rights and obligations. Rights and obligations as they arose at the formation of nation-states (e.g. the right to vote and obligation to serve in time of war) are being expanded. Thus, new concepts that accord certain "human rights" which arose in the 20th century are increasingly being universalized across nations and governments. This is the result of many factors, including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by the United Nations in 1948, the aftermath of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] and growing sentiments towards legitimizing marginalized peoples (e.g., pre-industrialized peoples found in the jungles of Brazil and Borneo). Couple this with growing awareness of our impact on the environment, and there is the rising feeling that citizen rights may extend to include the right to dignity and [[self-determination]]. If national citizenship does not foster these new rights, then global citizenship may seem more accessible.

Global citizenship advocates may confer specific rights and obligations of human beings trapped in conflicts, those incarcerated as part of [[ethnic cleansing]], and pre-industrialized tribes newly discovered by scientists living in the depths of dense jungle

====UN General Assembly====
On 10 December 1948, the UN General Assembly Adopted Resolution 217A (III), also known as "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/history.shtml "History of the Document." U.N.: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 1 states that "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 1|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 2 states that "Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 2|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 13(2) states that "Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 13(2)|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As evidence in today's modern world, events such as the [[Trial of Saddam Hussein]] have proven what British jurist  [[A. V. Dicey]]  said in 1885, when he popularized the phrase "rule of law" in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, Albert. (1885). ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution''.&lt;/ref&gt; Dicey emphasized three aspects of the rule of law :&lt;ref&gt;Palekar, S.A. (2008).

# No one can be punished or made to suffer except for a breach of law proved in an ordinary court.
# No one is above the law and everyone is equal before the law regardless of social, economic, or political status.
# The rule of law includes the results of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons.

====US Declaration of Independence====
The opening of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776, states as follows:
{{quote|We hold these truths to be [[self-evident]], that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their [[Creator deity|Creator]] with certain [[Inalienable rights|unalienable Rights]], that among these are [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness]]. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]];&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Global citizenship in the United States" was a term used by former [[United States|U.S.]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 in a speech in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="twsJun16ga"&gt;{{cite news

==Social movements==

===World citizen===
{{original research|date=November 2017}}
[[File:World Citizen Flag.svg|thumb| World Citizen flag by Garry Davis]]
[[File:World citizen badge.svg|thumb|World Citizen badge]]
In general, a world citizen is a person who places global citizenship above any nationalistic or local identities and relationships. An early expression of this value is found in [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.; mentioned above), the founding father of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic movement]] in Ancient Greece.  Of Diogenes it is said: "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Chapter VI, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a ground-breaking concept because the broadest basis of social identity in Greece at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet Kaniyan Poongundran wrote in ''[[Purananuru]]'', "To us all towns are one, all men our kin." In later years, political philosopher [[Thomas Paine]] would declare, "my country is the world, and my religion is to do good."&lt;ref name="Paine1792"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Paine|title=The Rights of Man|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rights_of_Man|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=1792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the increase in worldwide globalization has led to the formation of a "world citizen" [[social movement]] under a proposed [[world government]].&lt;ref name="worldservice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldservice.org/ | title=World Government of World Citizens | accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a non-political definition, it has been suggested that a world citizen may provide value to society by using knowledge acquired across cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="number"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/index.php/2007/03/22/the-utmost-global-citizen/  | title = the utmost global citizen| publisher = Global Culture}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also consider themselves world citizens, as they feel at home wherever they may go.

[[Albert Einstein]] described himself as a world citizen and supported the idea throughout his life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php Einstein - World Citizen, Erasing National Boundaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704235850/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php |date=4 July 2012 }}, [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;/ref&gt; famously saying "Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, George Sylvester (26 October 1929), "What Life Means to Einstein: An Interview by George Sylvester Viereck", The Saturday Evening Post: 117, http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/what_life_means_to_einstein.pdf retrieved on 7 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; World citizenship has been promoted by distinguished people including [[Garry Davis]], who lived for 60 years as a citizen of no nation, only the world.  Davis founded the [[World Service Authority]] in Washington, DC, which sells [[World Passport]]s, a [[Camouflage passport|fantasy passport]] to world citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MyCountryIsTheWorld.net My Country Is the World] By Garry Davis&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 [[Hugh J. Schonfield]] founded the [[Commonwealth of World Citizens]], later known by its [[Esperanto]] name "Mondcivitana Respubliko", which also issued a world passport; it declined after the 1980s.

The [[Bahá'í faith]] promotes the concept through its founder's proclamation (in the late 19th century) that "The Earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh |origyear = 1873-92 |year = 1994 |title = Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-174-4 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/ | page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term defined by the Bahá'í International Community in a concept paper shared at the 1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, New York, U.S.A. on 14–25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="bic"&gt;{{cite conference | title = World Citizenship: A Global Ethic for Sustainable Development | date = 1993-06-14 | location = New York, NY | author = Bahá'í International Community | booktitle =  1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; "World citizenship begins with an acceptance of the oneness of the human family and the interconnectedness of the nations of 'the earth, our home.' While it encourages a sane and legitimate patriotism, it also insists upon a wider loyalty, a love of humanity as a whole. It does not, however, imply abandonment of legitimate loyalties, the suppression of cultural diversity, the abolition of national autonomy, nor the imposition of uniformity. Its hallmark is 'unity in diversity.' World citizenship encompasses the principles of social and economic justice, both within and between nations; non-adversarial decision making at all levels of society; equality of the sexes; racial, ethnic, national and religious harmony; and the willingness to sacrifice for the common good. Other facets of world citizenship—including the promotion of human honour and dignity, understanding, amity, co-operation, trustworthiness, compassion and the desire to serve—can be deduced from those already mentioned."&lt;ref name="bic"/&gt;

===Mundialization===
Philosophically, mundialization (French, ''mondialisation'') is seen as a response to globalization’s "dehumanisation through [despatialised] planetarisation" (Teilhard de Chardin quoted in Capdepuy 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cybergeo.revues.org/24903 | title=Au prisme des mots | author=Capdepuy, Vincent | journal=Cybergeo: European Journal of Geography. | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early use of ''mondialisation'' was to refer to the act of a city or a local authority declaring itself a "world citizen" city, by voting a charter stating its awareness of global problems and its sense of shared responsibility. The concept was promoted by the self-declared World Citizen [[Garry Davis]] in 1949, as a logical extension of the idea of individuals declaring themselves world citizens, and promoted by Robert Sarrazac, a former leader of the [[French Resistance]] who created the Human Front of World Citizens in 1945.   The first city to be officially mundialised was the small French city of [[Cahors]] (only 20,000 in 2006), the capital city of the Département of [[Lot (department)|Lot]] in central [[France]], on 20 July 1949. Hundreds of cities mundialised themselves over a few years, most of them in France, and then it spread internationally, including to many German cities and to [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. In less than a year, 10 General Councils (the elected councils of the French "Départements"), and hundreds of cities in France covering 3.4 million inhabitants voted mundialisation charters. One of the goals was to elect one delegate per million inhabitants to a People's World Constitutional Convention given the already then historical failure of the [[United Nations]] in creating a global institution able to negotiate a final [[world peace]].  To date, more than 1000 cities and towns have declared themselves [[World cities]], including [[Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Minneapolis]], [[St. Louis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Toronto]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Tokyo]], [[Nivelles]], and [[Königswinter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldservice.org/mundcity.html|title=LIST OF MUNDIALIZED COMMUNITIES AND TOWNS|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a social movement, mundialization expresses the solidarity of populations of the globe and aims to establish institutions and [[supranational]] [[law]]s of a [[federation|federative]] structure common to them, while respecting the diversity of cultures and peoples. The movement advocates for a new political organization governing [[all humanity]], involving the transfer of certain parts of national [[sovereignty]] to a [[Federal World Authority]], [[Federal World Government]] and [[Federal World Court]]. Basing its authority on the will of the people, supporters hope it could develop new systems to draw on the highest and best wisdom of all humanity, and solve major planetary problems like [[hunger]], access to [[water]], [[war]], [[peace-keeping]], [[pollution]] and energy.  The mundialization movement includes the declaration of specified territory - a city, town, or state, for example - as world territory, with responsibilities and rights on a world scale. Currently the nation-state system and the United Nations offer no way for the people of the world to vote for world officials or participate in governing our world.  International [[treaties]] or agreements lack the [[force of law]]. Mundialization seeks to address this lack by presenting a way to build, one city at a time, such a system of true World Law based upon the sovereignty of the whole.

===Earth Anthem===
Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire [[planetary consciousness]] and global citizenship among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Not all interpretations of global citizenship are positive. For example, [[Bhikhu Parekh|Parekh]] advocates what he calls globally oriented citizenship, and states, "If global citizenship means being a citizen of the world, it is neither practicable nor desirable."&lt;ref name="Parekh1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parekh | first1 = B | year = 2003 | title = Cosmopolitanism and Global Citizenship | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 3–17 | doi=10.1017/s0260210503000019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community.&lt;ref name="Parekh1"/&gt; He also notes that such a world state would inevitably be "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh presents his alternative option with the statement: "Since the conditions of life of our fellow human beings in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become what I might call a globally oriented citizen."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt;

Michael Byers, a professor in Political Science at the [[University of British Columbia]], questions the assumption that there is one definition of global citizenship, and unpacks aspects of potential definitions. In the introduction to his public lecture, the UBC Internalization website states, "'Global citizenship' remains undefined. What, if anything, does it really mean? Is global citizenship just the latest buzzword?"&lt;ref name="Byers1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byers|first=Michael|title=The Meanings of Global Citizenship|year=2005|publisher=UBC Global Citizenship Speaker Series|url=http://www.internationalization.ubc.ca/gcss.htm#Meanings|accessdate=2009-10-28|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;inconsistent citations&amp;#125;&amp;#125;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415002147/http://www.internationalization.ubc.ca/gcss.htm#Meanings|archivedate=15 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byers notes the existence of [[stateless persons]], whom he remarks ought to be the primary candidates for global citizenship, yet continue to live without access to basic freedoms and citizenship rights.&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; Byers does not oppose the concept of global citizenship, however he criticizes potential implications of the term depending on one's definition of it, such as ones that provide support for the "ruthlessly capitalist economic system that now dominates the planet."&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; Byers states that global citizenship is a "powerful term"&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; because "people that invoke it do so to provoke and justify action,"&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; and encourages the attendees of his lecture to re-appropriate it in order for its meaning to have a positive purpose, based on idealistic values.&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt;

Neither criticism of global citizenship is anything new.  [[Gouverneur Morris]], a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)]], criticized "citizens of the world" while he was on the floor of the convention; August 9, 1787.  "As to those philosophical gentlemen, those Citizens of the World as they call themselves, He owned he did not wish to see any of them in our public Councils. He would not trust them. The men who can shake off their attachments to their own Country can never love any other. These attachments are the wholesome prejudices which uphold all Governments, Admit a Frenchman into your Senate, and he will study to increase the commerce of France: an Englishman, and he will feel an equal biass in favor of that of England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_809.asp | title= Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention | publisher=[[Yale University]] Avalon Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28518">'''Global citizenship education''' ('''GCE''') is a form of [[civics|civic learning]] that involves students' active participation in projects that address [[global issue|global]] [[global issue|issue]]s of a social, political, economic, or environmental nature. The two main elements of GCE are '[[global consciousness]]';  the moral or ethical aspect of global issues, and 'global competencies', or skills meant to enable learners to participate in changing and developing the world. The promotion of GCE was a response by governments and NGOs to the emergence of [[supranational institution]], [[trade bloc|regional economic blocs]], and the development of [[information and communications technology|information and]] [[information and communications technology|communications technologies]]. These have allresulted in the emergence of a more globally oriented and collaborative approach to education. GCE addresses themes such as peace and human rights, intercultural understanding, citizenship education, respect for diversity and tolerance, and inclusiveness.Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for students

== Definition and origins ==
[[Global citizenship]] consists of voluntary practices oriented to human rights, social justice, and environmentalism at the local, regional, and global level. Unlike national citizenship, global citizenship does not denote any legal status  or allegiance to an actual form of government.  The emergence of regional economic blocs, supra-national political institutions such as the [[European Union|European]] [[European Union|Union]], and the advancement of ICTs, has caused governments to try to prepare national populations to be competitive in the global jobs market. This has led to the introduction of global citizenship education  programs at primary, secondary, and tertiary level, but also at independent [[NGO]]s, [[grass roots]] organizations, and other large scale educational organizations, such as the [[International Baccalaureate Organization]] and [[UNESCO]].

The most important features of global citizenship education are voluntary action that can extend from local to international collectives; the practice of cultural empathy; and a focus on active participation in social and political life at the local and global level. In the late 1990s, [[OXFAM]] UK designed a curriculum for global citizenship education
which stressed "the 'active' role of global citizens".In this approach, individuals and groups both inside and outside the educational sector might take action that addresses human rights, trade, poverty, health, and environmental issues, for example. This is sometimes called the 'global consciousness' aspect of GCE. However, organizations such as UNESCO have also begun to emphasize 'global competencies', including science and technology into their GCE [[curricula]], to "strengthen linkages between education and economic development".

== Emergence and development ==
In the present era of [[globalization]], the recognition of global interdependence on the part of the general public has led to a higher degree of interest in global citizenship in education. No Though modern schooling may have been oriented to education suitable for the nation-state throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, in the 21st century, citizenship is understood in global terms, so that schooling might improve individual nations' global competitiveness. Many universities worldwide have responded to the need for a globally oriented education by sending their students to study abroad in increasing numbers, and some have announced that this will soon become a mandatory degree requirement.

Many governments also now promote GCE for the cohesion of society. The large numbers of people migrating across national borders means that the  diversity of ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups, "has raised [...] complex and difficult questions about citizenship, human rights, democracy, and education".   In addition, global issues related to [[sustainability]], such as the world's future energy arrangements, have also been incorporated into the domain of global citizenship education.

== Competences ==
While GCE can take different forms, it has some common elements, which include fostering in learners the following competences:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2014. ''Global Citizenship Education. Preparing Learners for the Challenges of the 21st Century''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An attitude supported by an understanding of multiple levels of identity, and the potential for a collective identity that transcends individual cultural, religious, ethnic or other differences (such as a sense of belongingness to common humanity, and respect for diversity);
* A deep knowledge of global issues and universal values such as justice, equality, dignity and respect (such as understanding of the process of globalization, interdependence/ interconnectedness, the global challenges which cannot be adequately or uniquely addressed by nation states, sustainability as the main concept of the future);
* Cognitive skills to think critically, systemically and creatively, including adopting a multi-perspective approach that recognizes different dimensions, perspectives and angles of issues (such as reasoning and problem-solving skills supported by a multi-perspective approach);
* Non-cognitive skills, including social skills such as empathy and con ict resolution, and communication skills and aptitudes for networking and interacting with people of different backgrounds, origins, cultures and perspectives (such as global empathy, sense of solidarity); and
* Behavioural capacities to act collaboratively and responsibly to find global solutions to global challenges, and to strive for the collective good.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Pedagogy ==

Most educators agree that "global citizenship is a learned and nurtured behavior",&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, 2010:442&lt;/ref&gt; and the most widely used classroom strategy for developing global skills is project-based learning. This pedagogical technique can be utilized in the case of almost any school subject, "[and] is the primary pedagogical strategy in the discourse of global competencies. Educators see it as an important method for developing the tools- technical and emotional- for success in the global society".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:14&lt;/ref&gt; With the aim of nurturing students' potential to be both learners and citizens, the project-based approach has been used successfully in community-based learning, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Melaville &amp; Berg et al, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important pedagogical feature of GCE is learning through communicative practices outside the classroom that "harness […] the educational force of the wider culture".&lt;ref name="Catalano, 2013:3"&gt;Catalano, 2013:3&lt;/ref&gt; If students are encouraged "to see themselves as political agents",&lt;ref name="Catalano, 2013:3"/&gt; educators assume they are more likely to acquire the knowledge, skills and abilities that enable them to  become agents of change.&lt;ref&gt;Catalano, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another important element of the student-centered participatory nature of GCED, is that students, through their engagement with others via [[Social network services|Social Network Services]], create their own forms of global citizenship through dialogue, learning, and action.&lt;ref&gt;Bourn, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This is  an important element, for example, in the activities of grassroots organizations like 'GIN' ([[Global Issues Network]]), which involves students and teachers in projects that address global issues such as human rights, trade rules, and deforestation.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"&gt;Dill, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Such student-driven, student-led projects combine both the 'global consciousness' and 'global competence' aspects of GCED.

;'Global consciousness' and 'global competence'

Organizations implementing GCE programs, such as UNESCO, now emphasize the importance of expanding both students' 'global consciousness' and 'global competence'.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"/&gt; 'Global consciousness' represents the ethical or moral dimension of global citizenship, whereas 'global competence' "features a blend of the technical-rational and the dispositional or attitudinal".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:11&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some view global consciousness and global competence as being closely related.&lt;ref&gt;Grudinski Hall, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The OECD, for instance, focuses on global competencies called 'psychosocial resources', of which there are three main types: "using tools interactively (technology and language skills), interacting in heterogeneous groups (cooperation, empathy), and acting autonomously (realizing one's identity, conducting life plans, defending and asserting rights".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013: 12&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key learner attributes ==
GCE identifies three learner attributes, which refer to the traits and qualities that global citizenship education aims to develop in learners and correspond to the key learning outcomes mentioned earlier. These are: informed and critically literate; socially connected and respectful of diversity; ethically responsible and engaged. The three learner attributes draw on a review of the literature and of citizenship education conceptual frameworks, a review of approaches and curricula, as well as technical consultations and recent work by UNESCO on global citizenship education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf|title=Global Citizenship Education: topics and learning objectives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100102-4|location=|pages=20–21, 44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informed and critically literate ===
Learners develop their understanding of the world, global themes, governance structures and systems, including politics, history and economics; understand the rights and responsibilities of individuals and groups (for example, women’s and children’s rights, indigenous rights, corporate social responsibility); and, recognise the interconnectedness of local, national and global issues, structures and processes. Learners develop the skills of critical inquiry (for example, where to find information and how to analyse and use evidence), [[media literacy]] and an understanding of how information is mediated and communicated. They develop their ability to inquire into global themes and issues (for example, globalisation, interdependence, migration, peace and conflict, sustainable development) by planning investigations, analysing data and communicating their findings. A key issue is the way in which language is used and, more specifically, how critical literacy is affected by the dominance of the English language and how this influences non-English speakers’ access to information.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Socially connected and respectful of diversity ===
Learners learn about their identities and how they are situated within multiple relationships (for example, family, friends, school, local community, country), as a basis for understanding the global dimension of citizenship. They develop an understanding of difference and diversity (for example, culture, language, gender, sexuality, religion), of how beliefs and values influence people’s views about those who are different, and of the reasons for, and impact of, inequality and discrimination. Learners also consider common factors that transcend difference, and develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes required for respecting difference and living with others.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Ethically responsible and engaged ===
Learners explore their own beliefs and values and those of others. They understand how beliefs and values inform social and political decision-making at local, national, regional and global levels, and the challenges for governance of contrasting and conflicting beliefs and values. Learners also develop their understanding of social justice issues in local, national, regional and global contexts and how these are interconnected. Ethical issues (for example, relating to [[climate change]], [[consumerism]], [[Economic globalization|economic globalisation]], [[fair trade]], migration, poverty and wealth, sustainable development, [[terrorism]], war) are also addressed. Learners are expected to reflect on ethical conflicts related to social and political responsibilities and the wider impact of their choices and decisions. Learners also develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to care for others and the environment and to engage in civic action. These include compassion, empathy, collaboration, dialogue, social entrepreneurship and active participation. They learn about opportunities for engagement as citizens at local, national and global levels, and examples of individual and collective action taken by others to address global issues and social injustice.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== High Resolves, Australia ===
[https://highresolves.org/ High Resolves] is a secondary school educational initiative (implemented by the FYA, the only national, independent non-profit organisation for young people in Australia) consisting of a Global Citizenship Programme for Year 8 students and a Global Leadership Programme for Year 9 and 10 students. It aims to enable students to consider their personal role in developing their society as a global community through workshops, simulations, leadership skills training and hands-on action projects.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== ''Developing the global dimension in the school curriculum,'' England ===
In England, the Department for Education and Skills produced ''Developing the global dimension in the school curriculum'', a publication for head teachers, teachers, senior managers and those with responsibility for curriculum development. It aims to show how the global dimension can be integrated in the curriculum and across the school. It provides examples of how to integrate the global dimension from age 3 to age 16, outlining eight key concepts – global citizenship, conflict resolution, diversity, human rights, interdependence, sustainable development, values and perceptions, and social justice. For example, it gives guidance for the promotion of personal, social and emotional development of the youngest learners through discussion of photographs of children from around the world, activities, stories, and discussion of different places children have visited.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Activate, South Africa ===
'''Activate''' is a network of young leaders in South Africa which aims to bring about change though creative solutions to problems in society. Youth from all backgrounds and provinces in the country participate in a two-year programme. In the first year, there are three residential training programmes, working on a particular task. In the second year, participants form action groups on specific tasks, taking their work into the public domain. In one example, an Activator describes how he works in his local community to discourage young people away from joining gangs and engaging in substance abuse. He draws on his own negative experiences with gangs and drugs, having served seven years in jail. On being interviewed, he states: “My vision for South Africa is to see young people standing up and becoming role models... Be yourself, be real and pursue your dreams”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.activateleadership.co.za/blog/5-mins-with-fernando#sthash.dRCXMqPx.dpuf|title=Activate Change Drivers|last=|first=|date=|website=Activate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Council for Global Citizenship Education, India (and global) ===
[https://www.globalcitizenshipfoundation.org/council-for-gced Council for Global Citizenship Education] — part of the [https://www.globalcitizenshipfoundation.org/ Global Citizenship Foundation], a non-profit organisation based in India — is an initiative for schools to adopt a participatory whole-school approach to global citizenship education. The initiative fosters continuous professional development (CPD) of educators; teacher led contextualization, design, and development of GCED curriculum; engagement of children through the '[https://www.globalcitizenshipfoundation.org/hundred-acts 100 Acts of Global Citizenship]' School Challenge; and community through a Global Citizenship Festival at '100 Acts of Global Citizenship' participating schools. It has also been implemented in 10 States of India.

=== Peace First, United States and Colombia ===
Peace First, a non-profit organisation based in the United States, has a programme in which youth volunteers work with children to design and implement community projects in a participatory way. The rationale is that children are natural creative thinkers and problem solvers. The programme focuses on developing social and emotional skills of self- awareness, empathy, inclusivity and relationships. It has also been implemented in rural areas of Colombia through a partnership between local governments and Colombian NGOs. Peace First has additionally developed a curriculum that can be used in schools. It addresses themes such as friendship, fairness, cooperation, con ict resolution and consequences of actions through experiential activities and cooperative games. For example, 1st graders learn about communicating their feelings, 3rd graders develop skills and awareness around communication and cooperation, 4th graders practice courage and taking a stand and 5th graders explore how to resolve and de-escalate conflicts.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) ===
'''Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation''' is an education-services organization that provides capstone education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement—but not to replace—coursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, and students are not paid money for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.

== Connection to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) ==
{{Main|Education for sustainable development}}

GCE and ESD pursue the same vision: It is all about empowering learners of all ages to become proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive and sustainable world. Both GCED and ESD:
* focus not only on the content and outcome of what is learned, but also on the process of how it is learned and in what type of environment it is learned.
* emphasize action, change and transformation.
* place importance on acquiring values and attitudes relevant to addressing global challenges.
* foster skills for collaboration, communication and critical thinking.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002463/246352e.pdf|title=Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for students|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100179-6|location=|pages=10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections ==

Some fundamentalist critics believe GCE might undermine religious education and promote secular values.&lt;ref name="Schattle, 2008"&gt;Schattle, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Others are concerned that the pedagogical approach of most global citizenship education curricula are too often produced in particular Northern, Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Andreotti and de Souza, 2012:18&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics claim that GCE curricula promote values that are too individualistic.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"/&gt; Dill,&lt;ref&gt;2013&lt;/ref&gt; for example, claims that "the majority of the world experiences social and communal life not in terms of isolated individuals, but as collective identities and traditions. For many of these groups, the dominant forms of global citizenship education and its moral order will be experienced as coercive and unjust',&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:33&lt;/ref&gt; so 'global' citizenship curriculum should be seen as a local practice, "which diverse cultures will conceptualize and construct differently".&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 2006:13&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global silver trade''' between the Americas and [[Europe]] from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries was a spillover of the [[Columbian Exchange]] which had a profound effect on the world economy. In fact, many scholars consider the [[silver]] trade to mark the beginning of a genuinely [[global economy]], with one historian noting that silver "went round the world and made the world go round."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age|last=Frank|first=Andre G.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although global, much of that silver ended up in the hands of the Chinese, as they accepted it as a form of currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Glahn|first=Richard|date=1996|title=Myth and Reality of China’s Seventeenth Century Monetary Crisis|url=|journal=Journal of Economic History|volume=2|pages=132|quote=... silver wanders throughout all the world... before flocking to China, where it remains as if at its natural center.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the global economic changes the silver trade engendered, it also put into motion a wide array of political transformations in the early modern era. "New World mines," concluded several prominent historians "supported the Spanish empire," acting as a linchpin of the Spanish economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995|title=Born with a 'Silver Spoon'|url=|journal=Journal of World History|volume=2|pages=210|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaniards at the time of the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]] discovered vast amounts of silver, much of which was from the [[Potosí]] silver mines, to fuel their trade economy. Potosí's deposits were rich and Spanish American silver mines were the world's cheapest sources of it. The Spanish acquired the silver, minting it into the peso de ocho (a currency) to then use it as a means of purchase; that currency was so widespread that even the United States accepted it as valid until the [[Coinage Act of 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=011/llsl011.db&amp;recNum=184|title=A Century of Lawmaking|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Spanish need for silver increased, new innovations for more efficient extraction of silver were developed, such as the amalgamation method of using [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to extract silver from ore.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the two centuries that followed the discovery of Potosí, the Spanish silver mines in the Americas produced 40,000 tons of silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silver, Trade, and War: Spain and America in the Making of Early Modern Europe|last=Stein|first=Stanley J.|last2=Stein|first2=Barbara H.|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, more than 150,000 tons of silver were shipped from Potosí by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/potosi-silver-mines|title=Potosí Silver Mines|website=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1500 to 1800, Mexico and Peru produced about 80%&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|date=1995|title=Born with a "Silver Spoon": The Origin of World Trade in 1571|url=http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/journals/jwh/jwh062p201.pdf|journal=Journal of World History|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the world's silver with 30% of it eventually ending up in China (largely because of British merchants who used it to purchase exotic Chinese commodities).  In the late 16th and early 17th century, Japan was also exporting heavily into China and the foreign trade at large.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As has been demonstrated, China dominated silver imports. The market value of silver in the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] territory was double its value elsewhere, which provided great arbitrage profit for the Europeans and Japanese.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The abundance of silver in China made it easy for the country to mint it into coinage. That process was so widespread that local Chinese government officials would demand taxes to be paid in silver to the point that silver eventually backed all of [[China's economy]].

==First paper money==
The world's first [[paper money]] ("[[flying money]]") was invented by the Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Weksel: Bill of Exchange and Promissory Note|last=Moshenskyi|first=Sergii|publisher=Xlibris|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they needed some commodity to back it. Traditional coins were useful, but the amount of coins needed for large purchases could be bulky and dangerous to transport. That problem was solved when the Chinese created small pieces of paper with pictures of the coin printed on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Money|last=Weatherford|first=Jack|publisher=Crown Business|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=125–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the nature of their geography, China had no real amount of precious metals of their own to back the paper money they invented. Because the Spaniards didn't find gold but did find copious amounts of silver, the Spaniards and the rest of Europe used this silver to purchase the commodities of choice from China, solving both of their problems.&lt;ref name="columbia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/chinawh/web/s5/s5_4.html |title=China and Europe, 1500–2000 and Beyond: What is Modern? |publisher=Afe.easia.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silver in the Americas ==
[[File:Philip V Coin silver, 8 Reales Mexico.jpg|thumb|Silver Peso of Philip V]]
A result of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] was the discovery, production, and trade of precious metals. The Spanish, along with other European nations, had a great desire for Chinese goods such as [[silk industry in China|silk]] and [[porcelain]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giráldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995|title=Born with a "Silver Spoon": The Origin of World Trade in 1571|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078638|journal=Journal of World History|volume=6|issue=2|pages=201–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Europeans did not have any goods or commodities which China desired, so they traded silver to make up for their trade deficit.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reorient|last=Frank|first=Andre|publisher=|year=July 1998|isbn=9780520214743|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most important mining colonies of the [[Spanish Empire]] were Peru and Mexico, who were estimated to have provided one-hundred thousand tons of silver from the mid 16th Century to the end of the colonial period.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garner|first=Richard L.|date=1988|title=Long-Term Silver Mining Trends in Spanish America: A Comparative Analysis of Peru and Mexico|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1863529|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=93|issue=4|pages=898–935|doi=10.2307/1863529}}&lt;/ref&gt; The richest, and most productive mine in the Americas was that of [[Potosí]] in what is modern day Bolivia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The richest camp in Mexico was in the city of Zacatecas, however the production of this mine was far less than that of Potosi.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Mining Processes in the Americas ===
More simplistic native mining techniques dominated American mining for the early part of the 16th Century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brading|first=D. A.|last2=Cross|first2=Harry E.|date=1972|title=Colonial Silver Mining: Mexico and Peru|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2512781|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=52|issue=4|pages=545–579|doi=10.2307/2512781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mining in the Americas became formally industrialized when the process of mercury amalgamation became popularized. Mercury amalgamation was invented by a Spaniard in central Mexico in the 1550s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Historians dispute what individual was the first to invent the process, however most agree that it was a Spaniard. Mercury was the one of the highest costs of production for the Americas, since much of it had to be shipped.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The ratio of Mercury to silver produced was about two to one.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, German miners introduced the [[stamp mill]] and [[lead smelting]] in the 1530s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Gunpowder was often used to blast of large holes to create the mine shafts, although there were not many deep shafts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Potosí had the most amount of ore, however it was lower quality than that of Mexico.

Mining production in the Americas largely depended on native labor in both Mexico and Peru.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In Mexico, many of the natives worked as wage laborers by the middle of the 17th Century.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48249030|title=Mexico : from the beginning to the Spanish Conquest|last=1946-|first=Knight, Alan,|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=052181474X|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=48249030}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the labor system known as the [[repartimiento]] still existed in some places.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Silver production in Mexico was relatively cheap when compared to that of Peru, and the general trend of Mexican labor systems was that towards waged labor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In Peru mines, the [[Mit'a|mit'a system]] was a dominant form of native labor subjection, although waged laborers worked on the mines as well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Natives under the mit'a system were paid much less, and this was necessary for the production of silver to continue in Peru where costs were relatively high.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Global Flow of Silver ==
The ultimate destination for the mass amounts of silver produced in the Americas and Japan was China.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giráldez|first2=Arturo|date=2002|title=Cycles of Silver: Global Economic Unity through the Mid-Eighteenth Century|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078977|journal=Journal of World History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=391–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver from the Americas flowed mostly across the Atlantic and made its way to the far east.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A popular route was around the Cape of Good Hope into the east, and sometimes it came over land.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Major outposts for the silver trade were located in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1996|title=Silk for Silver: Manila-Macao Trade in the 17th Century|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42634185|journal=Philippine Studies|volume=44|issue=1|pages=52–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Manilla served as a primary outpost of the exchange of goods between the Americas, Japan, and China.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However, there is a large amount of silver that crossed across the Pacific Ocean directly from the Americas as well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There are not many records of the amount of silver which crossed the Pacific due to it being discouraged by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]], so estimates highly vary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Silver also found its way across other parts of the world as well. India and Europe both received a fair amount of silver.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This silver was often locally traded for other commodities, such as gold or crops. In India, silver flowed from the south to the north, and gold flowed the opposite way.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Often silver and gold were manufactured into jewelry or hoarded as treasure.

=== China and the Demand for Silver ===
China was the ultimate destination in which silver would flow towards. In exchange, the Chinese traded their popular goods such as [[silk]] and [[porcelain]]. China had a high demand for silver due to its shift from paper money to coins in the early period of the Ming Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Glahn|first=Richard|date=1996|title=Myth and Reality of China's Seventeenth-Century Monetary Crisis|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123972|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=56|issue=2|pages=429–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ming paper currency eventually failed due to self-imposed inflation along with an inability to stop the production of counterfeit bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Shikuan|date=|title=The Sung and Ming Paper Monies: Currency Competition and Currency Bubbles|url=|journal=National Taiwan University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ming attempted to produce copper coins as a new form of currency, but production was inconsistent.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Hence silver became of high value because it was a valid currency that could be processed abroad. The bimetallic ratio of silver to gold was about two to one, which meant that European and Japanese merchants made a large amount of profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atwell|first=William S.|date=2005|title=Another Look at Silver Imports into China, ca. 1635-1644|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20079347|journal=Journal of World History|volume=16|issue=4|pages=467–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1640s, the bimetallic ratios in China converged with the rest of the world, before experiencing another population boom.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The new population boom was a product of the introduction of New World crops into China, mainly sweet potatoes, which could be more easily grown.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; By this time, the silver mines in Japan were largely depleted and the New World became China's primary source for silver.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Initially, Japan served as China's primary source for silver in the 16th Century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In exchange for silver, China would provide Japan with silk and gold.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Japan and China did not directly trade with each other, due to political tensions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This meant that European entities and countries, such as the Dutch and Portuguese served as a middle man between the two countries.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== China's Silver Dominance ===
In the famed ''[[The Wealth of Nations]],'' [[Adam Smith]] noted the sheer force and great reach of the global silver trade. He was impressed by its market value but more intrigued with the way this single item of commerce brought together new and old worlds i.e. the Americas and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53006965|title=The wealth of nations|last=1723-1790.|first=Smith, Adam,|date=2003|publisher=Bantam Classic|others=Cannan, Edwin, 1861-1935.|isbn=0553585975|edition=Bantam classic|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=53006965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although China acted as the cog running the wheel of global trade, Japan's huge contribution of silver exports to China were critical to the world economy and China's liquidity and success with the commodity. Historians posit Europeans would have been left out of world trade, and China may have fallen prey to conquest by settlers of the Americas if not for Japanese silver mining. Silver was paramount to East Asia's introduction into the global trade market.&lt;ref name="Flynn 2002 391–427"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis Owen|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=2002|title=Cycles of Silver: Global Economic Unity through the Mid-Eighteenth Century|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2002.0035|journal=Journal of World History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=391–427|doi=10.1353/jwh.2002.0035|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] empires, China hoarded silver to boost its economy and increase its trading power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southeast Asia in the Early Modern Era Trade, Power, and Belief.|last=Reid|first=Anthony J.S.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historians argue that silver was responsible for the birth of global economics and trade. According to this view, global trade commenced in 1571 when [[Manila]] was founded and became the first trading post linking America and Asia due to the expansive and profitable silver trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995-01-01|title=Arbitrage, China, and World Trade in the Early Modern Period|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568520952600308|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient|volume=38|issue=4|pages=429–448|doi=10.1163/1568520952600308|issn=0022-4995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, research shows the amount of silver traveling from Manila to China was approximately three million [[peso]]s or 94,000 kilograms in the early 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atwell, wen-t'i|first=William S., Ch'ing-shih|date=December 1977|title=Notes on Silver, Foreign Trade, and the Late Ming Economy|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/398568|journal=3|volume=|pages=1–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rarity of silver production was seen as an opportunity for China to control the currency's value and support its own national currency. Silver was one of the only accepted trade items from Europeans and its value in China was astronomical compared to rest of the world. In fact, its value was twice that of [[Spain]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Flynn 2002 391–427"/&gt; Between 1600 and 1800 China received 100 tons of silver on average per year. A large populace near the [[Yangtze River Delta|Lower Yangzte]] averaged a hundreds of [[tael]]s of silver per household in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Huang|first=Ray|title=Financial management|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511735400.011|work=Taxation and Governmental Finance in Sixteenth-Century Ming China|pages=266–305|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511735400|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver even played a large role when defending [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s attemptive take over of Ming ruled [[Joseon|Joseon Korea]]. The Ming Ministiry of War sent approximately 140,000 liang of silver to its soldiers and required provinces to provide silver as tax for the war effort as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/843883049|title=A dragon's head and a serpent's tail : Ming China and the first great East Asian war, 1592-1598|last=Kenneth.|first=Swope,|date=2009|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806185026|location=Norman|oclc=843883049}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixteenth century, the [[Daimyō|daimyos]] of Southwest Japan hoped for unhinged global trade but were stopped due to Ming China trade policies. Still, Japan became a player in the global economy via frequent Ming merchant ships arriving to extract Japan's abundance of silver and exchange goods. Japan increased its wealth through successful trilateral trade with [[Portugal]] and China as Japan now had Chinese goods to offer the Portuguese who had silver mines of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobata|first=A.|date=1965|title=The Production and Uses of Gold and Silver in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Japan|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2592093|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=245|doi=10.2307/2592093|issn=0013-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Founder of the Ming China dynasty, [[Hongwu Emperor|Hongwu,]] actually sought to eliminate silver from the market due to his fear of inflation which he previously experienced in the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasty. His attempt involved imposing harsh limits on silver mining to stop its flow into the market and subsequently replaced it with baochao or paper money. However, the currency never popularized and silver proved its mainstay as a global currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Joseph P.|last2=Brook|first2=Timothy|date=1999|title=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2672136|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=72|issue=2|pages=267|doi=10.2307/2672136|issn=0030-851X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opium Wars==
{{Main|Opium Wars}}
Despite some restrictions, silver continued to drive trade through its popularity in Europe. This, combined with a high British demand for [[Chinese tea]], created chronic trade deficits for European governments, which were forced to risk silver deficits to supply merchants in Asia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Immobile Empire—The first great collision of East and West—the astonishing history of Britain's grand, ill-fated expedition to open China to Western Trade, 1792–94|last=Peyrefitte|first=Alain|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As supplies of silver decreased in Europe, Europeans had less ability to purchase highly coveted Chinese goods. Merchants were no longer able to sustain the China trade through profits made by selling Chinese goods in the West and were forced to take bullion out of circulation in Europe to buy goods in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rebellions and Revolutions: China from the 1800s to 2000|last=Gray|first=Jack|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=22–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, American merchants began to introduce opium to Chinese markets. The demand for opium rose rapidly and was so profitable that Chinese opium dealers began to seek out more suppliers of the drug, thus inaugurating the opium trade; one merchant declared that Opium "is like gold. It can sell any time."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From 1804 to 1820, a period when the Qing Dynasty needed to finance the suppression of the [[White Lotus Rebellion]], Chinese merchants were soon exporting silver to pay for opium rather than Europeans paying for Chinese goods with the precious metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Voyage of the 'Frolic': New England Merchants and the Opium Trade|last=Layton|first=Thomas N.|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing imperial court debated whether and how to end the opium trade, eventually settling on regulations on consumption. That measure, however, resulted in an increase in drug smuggling by Europeans and Chinese traders. In 1810, the Daoguang Emperor issued an edict concerning the matter, declaring, "Opium has a harm. Opium is a poison, undermining our good customs and morality. Its use is prohibited by law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Documentary Chronicle of Sino-Western relations|last=Fu|first=Lo-shu|publisher=|year=1966|isbn=|volume=1|location=|pages=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a debate at court in 1836 on whether to legalize the drug or crack down on its use, the emperor decided on the latter. An upright official, Commissioner Lin Zexu led the campaign against opium as a kind of "drug czar." The British, offended by the seizure of their property in opium, sent a large naval expedition to China to end the restrictive conditions under which they had long traded with that country. Thus began the first Opium War, in which Britain's industrialized military might was proven in China's rout. The [[Treaty of Nanking]], which ended the war in 1842 largely on British terms, imposed numerous restrictions on Chinese sovereignty and opened five ports to European traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Taking of Hong Kong: Charles and Clara Elliot in China Waters|last=Hoe|first=Susanna|last2=Roebuck|first2=Derek|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global studies''' is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of [[political]], [[economic]], [[legal]], [[ecological]] and [[cultural]] interconnectedness. Predominant subjects are [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[law]] on an international level. Global studies is oriented around the study of [[globalization]] as it relates to intercontinental politics, the global economy, international law, market relations, the movement of people and resources, global communications, the effect of human activity on the environment, and many more topics. Global studies is often used to map global change and is both [[Microeconomics|micro]] and [[Macroeconomics|macro]] in scope. The Cambridge English Dictionary defines global studies as ''"the study of political, economic, and social situations in the world"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge English Dictionary: Global Studies|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/global-studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global studies tackles the aforementioned topics by examining global power structures influenced by perspectives such as [[Orientalism]] and [[Eurocentrism]]. Global studies is distinguished from international studies by its broader focus – [[international studies]] is only one aspect of global studies. In cases such as international studies or [[international relations]], the concept of 'national' confines the meaning of those fields of study. By comparison, global studies has a broader reach, from the global to the local.

== History and context ==
{{See also|Globalization}}
The development of global studies in secondary and tertiary education is arguably a product of globalization, and its consequent results on the international community. In the late 20th century, an unprecedented rise in communications technologies and computerization occurred around the world, again enhancing the processes of globalization: “it is a shift in our very life circumstances ... the speed of change is closely allied to the growth of communication, and development in information and communication technologies have been exponential ... globalization is a fact of life from which we cannot retreat.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The consequences of modernity|last=Giddens|first=Anthony|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this constantly changing global community, education providers began to see a need for the introduction of global studies into secondary school curricula (i.e. introduction of  [[global issues]]  through already existing subjects), and to create global studies degrees for tertiary students (i.e. sole degrees with a global focus).

According to Jan Nederveen Pieterse, Mellichamp Professor of Global Studies and Sociology at The University of California, Santa Barbara:&lt;blockquote&gt;The first Global Studies conference took place at the University of Illinois Chicago in 2008; the 2009 conference was held in Dubai on the theme Views from Dubai: The Gulf and Globalization. The 2010 conference was in Busan, South Korea under the heading Global Rebalancing: East Asia and Globalization; the 2011 conference took place in Rio de Janeiro on Emerging societies and Emancipation; the 2012 conference was at Moscow University on the theme of Eurasia and  Globalization: Complexity  and Global studies; and the 2013 conference took place in New Delhi on the theme of Social Development in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onglobalization.com/assets/downloads/global/E14FinalProgram.pdf|title=Seventh Global Studies Conference Program|last=|first=|date=|website=onglobalization.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Global Studies Journal was founded in 2008 and is "devoted to mapping and interpreting new trends and patterns in globalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onglobalization.com/journal|title=Journal – Global Studies Research Network|website=onglobalization.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions of global studies ==

=== Global vs. international studies ===
There can be much confusion about the use of the terms, "global studies" and "international studies."

They are at times used interchangeably and differences in meaning are not evident, however, both disciplines are concerned with political, social and cultural issues, with the main focus of study being placed on international community interaction. However, subtle distinctions can be made between the two phrases. International studies generally looks at exchanges between states, multilateral or bilateral agreements, diplomacy and how issues are handled between two or more states. Global studies, in contrast, focuses on globally shared issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalstudies.unc.edu/masters/|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that there are [[left wing]] and [[right wing]] connotations to each phrase, international studies being preferred by the right wing (i.e. relations between states) and global studies preferred by the left (i.e. issues affecting all global citizens).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moravcsik|first1=Andrew|title=Liberal Theories of International Relations: A Primer|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/publications.html|website=princeton.edu|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms have also been described as such:

&lt;blockquote&gt;International studies might be called the grandfather of global education. It often includes the study of countries, world religions, languages and international relations ... (global studies) is centred on the concept of connectedness – recognizing local/ global connections, the commonalities all humans share, and how understanding how national borders have become practically irrelevant for many global actors.&lt;ref&gt;Merryfield, M 2004 ‘The importance of a global education,’ ''Outreach World'', viewed 5/10/10 at: http://www.outreachworld.org/article.asp?articleid=77 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207103229/http://outreachworld.org/article.asp?articleid=77 |date=2011-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Characteristics ===
Five defining characteristics of global studies were identified by scholars at the first annual meeting of the [[Global Studies Consortium]] in Tokyo in 2008:&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Juergensmeyer]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXhfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR14&amp;lpg=PR14&amp;dq=%22Global+Studies+Consortium%22+Conference+2008+Tokyo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kAnRbWAD4e&amp;sig=3h2899QfrUezZ9coblAqlLLTUfs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-5Izjj_HKAhVF7yYKHchxBpcQ6AEISDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Global%20Studies%20Consortium%22%20Conference%202008%20Tokyo&amp;f=false ''Thinking Globally: A Global Studies Reader'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[wikt:transnational|Transnational]]
* [[Interdisciplinary]]: global studies scholarship can involve politics, economics, history, geography, anthropology, sociology, religion, technology, philosophy, health as well as the study of the environment, gender, and race.
* [[Contemporary]] and [[historical]] examples range from the transnational activity of the Greek and Roman Empires to modern European colonialism.
* [[Postcolonialism|Postcolonial]] and [[Critical theory|Critical]]: global studies often emphasizes a postcolonial perspective, and attempts to analyze global phenomena through a critical, multicultural lens.

== Subjects of interest ==
The field of global studies revolves around the impacts of globalization and the growing interdependence of states, economies, societies, cultures, and people. This necessitates that students are well versed and capable of critical analysis when it comes to global issues.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Education Policies and Practices," Peace Corps. {{cite web |url=http://peacecorpsconnect.org/global-education-policies-and-practices |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612210639/http://peacecorpsconnect.org/global-education-policies-and-practices |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}, accessed September 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the most pressing issues in global studies are [[national security]] and [[diplomacy]], effective [[citizenship]] in a [[participatory democracy]], global [[competitiveness]] in a world market and the desire to enter the aid and development sector.

=== National security ===
The first major funding for international education was the 1966 International Education Act in the US.  It provided funding to institutions of higher education to create and strengthen international studies programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Digest for Education Statistics, 2004 – Chapter 4: Federal Programs for Education and Related Activities." National Center for Education Statistics (2004), http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d04/ch_4.asp, accessed September 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Created at the time of the [[Cold War]], this act stressed the need for all citizens (with a focus on USA citizens) to understand global issues in order to build skills for diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;International Education Act: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Education of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, United States Senate, Eighty-Ninth Congress, Second Session on S. 2874 and H.R. 14643. Publication date: 1966, Accessed through ERIC, http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED093756&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED093756.&lt;/ref&gt;”The importance of diplomacy as a driving force for political development is well known and understood. It is of great importance as a long term instrument for conflict prevention.”&lt;ref&gt;Skylakakis, T 2010, ‘The importance of economic diplomacy,’ The Bridge Magazine, viewed 24/9/10 at:  http://www.bridgemag.com/magazine/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=81&amp;Itemid=38&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of issues and crisis on a global scale such as international terrorism, climate change and environmental degradation, pandemics (such as ebola), and the [[Great Recession]] have convinced policymakers of the importance of global studies and international education to national security and diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Korry, Elaine. "Bush Expected to Hike Funding for Language Training," National Public Radio Broadcast, January 5, 2006, Accessed online https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127944&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global economy ===

A second motivation for global studies is facilitating a better understanding of the [[global marketplace]].  Many international companies have identified the need for a workforce that has the skills to work cross-culturally and identify and serve the needs of a global market.&lt;ref&gt;Groennings, Sven. "Economic Competitiveness and International Knowledge.  A Regional Project on the Global Economy and Higher Education in New England.  Staff Paper II."  New England Board of Higher Education. October 28, 1987. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Some international companies, such as Microsoft, have taken the lead in convening policymakers and key stakeholders to demand additional investment in education.&lt;ref&gt;"ECS, ISTE and [[Microsoft]] to Sponsor Global Education Competitiveness Summit." http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/jun09/06-23gecs2009nrpr.mspx, Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The US state and federal governments have also placed global studies as a key priority for preparing a competitive workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Putting the World into World Class Education.  West Virginia Department of Education. http://wvconnections.k12.wv.us/documents/GlobalAwarenessPresentation062408_001.ppt, Accessed September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2002 the Australian federal government (through its development body AusAID) used some of its funding to introduce a ‘Global Education Program.’ This program aims to increase understanding of development and international issues among Australian students. It provides teachers with professional development opportunities with NGOs and thorough curriculum support. The program “informs and encourages teachers to introduce students to global issues in a classroom setting.”&lt;ref&gt;Gallus, C 2002 ‘Global Studies Statement Launch,” AusAID, viewed 2/10/10 at:  {{cite web |url=http://www.ausaid.gov.au/media/release.cfm?BC=Speech&amp;ID=9768_9422_1276_9667_8426 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923153626/http://ausaid.gov.au/media/release.cfm?BC=Speech&amp;ID=9768_9422_1276_9667_8426 |archivedate=2010-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education institutions have closely followed with integrating international studies across disciplines.  It is rare to find a leading business school without an international focus.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School. http://www.hbs.edu/global/, Accessed September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yale Business School. http://mba.yale.edu/MBA/curriculum/core/international.shtml {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925054608/http://mba.yale.edu/MBA/curriculum/core/international.shtml |date=2009-09-25 }}, Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global citizenship and rights ===
A third motivation for global studies is the creation of an effective citizenry.  In the US, the National Council of Social Studies states that the purpose of social studies is to “teach students the content knowledge, intellectual skills, and civic values necessary for fulfilling the duties of citizenship in a participatory democracy.”  A key goal of the NCSS is “global education”.&lt;ref&gt;"About National Council for the Social Studies." The National Council for Social Studies, http://www.socialstudies.org/about, Accessed September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  As globalization causes the lines between national and international to become blurred, it becomes increasingly important for citizens to understand global relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Lapayese, Yvette. "Review:Toward a Critical Global Studies Education" Comparative Education Review, Vol. 47, No. 4 (Nov., 2003), pp. 493–501&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of effective [[Global citizenship]] results in people who are willing to, and have the capacity to become involved in local and global issues. In the UK, local government research conducted in the surrounding areas of London has found that citizens must have the opportunity to become involved and then possess the skill, knowledge and confidence to take part. The outcomes are often very positive, leading to an improvement in services, better quality of democratic participation and community education.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Cowell, Downe, Martin 2006 ‘Promoting effective citizenship and community empowerment,’ Office of the Deputy PM, London, viewed at: {{cite web |url=http://www.cdhn.org/documentbank/uploads/PromotingEffectiveCitizenship.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725151250/http://www.cdhn.org/documentbank/uploads/PromotingEffectiveCitizenship.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;    
To achieve effective citizenship, students must be educated in ways that engage and place emphasis on the importance of global issues. By studying a subject such as global studies, students can gain the knowledge required to become effective citizens.

Some critical scholars note that beyond content, students must be taught "global cognition" in order to truly understand global perspectives.  These scholars believe that in order to fully understand world issues, students must recognize that their perspective is not necessarily shared by others and understand the social forces that influence their views.&lt;ref&gt;Hanvey, Robert. "An Attainable Global Perspective." Theory into Practice, Vol. 21, No. 3, Global Education (Summer, 1982), pp. 162–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Charlotte. "Global Education in the Classroom." Theory into Practice, Vol. 21, No. 3, Global Education (Summer, 1982), pp. 168–76&lt;/ref&gt; These perspectives encourage engagement with new promises and threats for the promotion of human rights, social justice, and political participation.

=== International Institutions ===
By 2006, the international development sector had expanded exponentially, with the “NGO sector now being the 8th largest economy in the world ... employing nearly 19 million paid workers."&lt;ref&gt;Hall-Jones, P 2006, ‘The rise and rise of NGOs,’ Public Services International, viewed 23/9/10 at: http://www.world-psi.org/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=11738&amp;TEMPLATE=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727122306/http://www.world-psi.org/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=11738&amp;TEMPLATE=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm |date=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financing health projects used to be the biggest issue in global aid, but private and public organizations like the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] have helped overcome such problems. The issue now is making sure that the money is used in a proper manner to help those in need of the primary essentials of life.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Laurie. 2007. "The Challenge of Global Health," ''Foreign Affairs'' '''86''' (1):14-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Studying global studies may lead to involvement in the aid and [[International development|development]] sector in multiple ways. These can include working in post-conflict or natural disaster zones, improving public services in developing communities (health, education, infrastructure, agriculture) or aiding private sector growth through business and market models.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey International Development, 2010 ‘Work that makes a difference,’ Coffey, viewed 24/9/10 at: http://www.coffey.com/our-businesses/coffey-international-development/our-expertise/sectors/overview{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through studying global studies, students can be equipped with cross cultural knowledge, field experience and an awareness of global issues. Many students are now studying global studies in order to enter this sector.

== Learning outcomes and job prospects ==
Learning outcomes for global studies vary depending on the institutes curriculum and students individual focuses. Although, introductory courses are designed to cover a wide range of topics in a single semester, students are expected to delve into a specific phenomenon or area of study for their academic career.   there are some generic outcomes that students are expected to develop over the duration of study. These include, but are not limited to:
*Cultural awareness
*Ability to analyze the interconnectedness of the global and local
*Skills in ethical research and analysis with specific policy implications
*Awareness of current affairs
*Ability to communicate effectively in a range of situations
*Increase in cross cultural competence
*potentially improve proficiency in a foreign language

Global studies scholars are eligible for a myriad of professions, tackling political, social, and economic issues on an international scale that work to improve the human condition.
*International relations
*Foreign affairs
*NGOs
*Local, national, and international government 
*Environmental research
*Historical Analysis

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">'''Health systems strengthening''' (also '''health system strengthening''', abbreviated '''HSS''') is a term used in [[global health]] that roughly means to improve the health care system of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/hss_glossary/en/index5.html |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |title=Health Systems Strengthening Glossary |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this general definition, it can mean increasing funding for health infrastructure, improving health policy, trying to achieve [[universal healthcare]],&lt;ref name="glassman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Amanda%20Glassman%208-27-13.pdf |title=Conversation with Amanda Glassman on August 27, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |last=Glassman |first=Amanda |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any number of other health measures.

There has been some effort to use a [[systems thinking]] approach to health systems strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hfgproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-Perspectives-in-Health-Systems-Strengthening-Executive-Summary.pdf |publisher=USAID |title=New Perspectives in Health Systems Strengthening}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="systems-thinking-book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44204/1/9789241563895_eng.pdf |title=Systems Thinking for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that use health systems strengthening==

Various health organizations have claimed to use health systems strengthening (while not necessarily agreeing on the definition). Some of these are:

* [[World Health Organization]]
* [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID, uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report);&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt; USAID states that HSS has been "at the core of [its] mission in health for the last 20 years", and defines HSS as "initiating activities in the six internationally accepted core HSS functions – human resources for health; health finance; health governance; health information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; and service delivery".&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/HSS-Vision.pdf |title=USAID's Vision for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=USAID |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GAVI Alliance]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* The [[Global Fund]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[PEPFAR]] (though less developed)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Stop TB Partnership]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Roll Back Malaria]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;

==Reception==

Both the idea of health systems strengthening and the term itself have received attention.

Even advocates of health systems strengthening admit that it can often seem like a "distant, even abstract aim".&lt;ref name=systems-thinking-book/&gt;

Marchal et al., writing in 2009, called the term "vague" and argued that "most current HSS strategies are selective (i.e., they target a specific disease), and their effects may undermine progress towards the long-term goal of effective, high-quality, and inclusive health systems."&lt;ref name="marchal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000059#s2 |title=Global Health Actors Claim To Support Health System Strengthening—Is This Reality or Rhetoric? |authors=Marchal B, Cavalli A, Kegels G |date=April 28, 2009 |publisher=''[[PLOS Medicine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://karengrepin.com/2009/04/are-health-system-strengthening-efforts.html |title=Are health system strengthening efforts just hype? |date=April 29, 2009 |author=Karen Grepin |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Berman]], who was the lead health economist at the [[World Bank]], has pointed out that "Almost any support to health interventions can be considered HSS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTHSD/Resources/376278-1114111154043/1011834-1246449110524/062509BermanUnpackingHealthSystemStrengthening.pdf |author=Peter Berman |date=June 2009 |publisher=World Bank |title=Unpacking Health System Strengthening |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johnrobles.jpg|thumb|John Robles]]
'''John Anthony Robles II''' (born 10 April 1966) is a journalist and presenter on the [[Voice of Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voiceofrussia.com/by_author/62493347/ |title=John Robles column at Voice of Russia |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.ruvr.ru/radio_broadcast/persons/62493347 |title=John Robles page at Voice of Russia |accessdate=2012-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604070830/http://english.ruvr.ru/radio_broadcast/persons/62493347/ |archivedate=2012-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Russian government's international radio broadcasting service. He is the presenter of the English Language program ''Moscow Mailbag'' which answers questions from listeners all over the world on all aspects of the [[USSR]] and [[Russia]].

He was born a [[US Citizen]] in [[Rio Piedras]], [[Puerto Rico]], Puerto Rico being a US territory and is of Taino Indian extraction. 

John and his two American born children were granted full political asylum in the Russian Federation in 2007 after the US Embassy in Moscow revoked his US passport. 

John was the first US citizen to receive asylum in the Russian Federation. Although there are reports which state that both he and [[Edward Snowden]] have been granted [[political asylum]] in Russia, Edward Snowden was in fact only granted temporary asylum and then residency&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/edward-snowden-permission-stay-in-russia-three-years&lt;/ref&gt; and does not have political asylum in the Russian Federation. John has since renounced his US citizenship and applied for Russian citizenship in 2010 along with his son John Anthony Robles III and daughter Kayla Marie Robles. 

==Education and employment==
Robles attended the [[Pennsylvania State University]] where he took an undergraduate course in [[Soviet Studies]], majoring in the Russian Language. He taught at the BKC-Ih School for Foreign Languages in Moscow, Russia, for thirteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bkcih-moscow.com/teachers/list.html |title=BKC-ih past teachers list |accessdate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114190822/http://www.bkcih-moscow.com/teachers/list.html |archivedate=2009-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revocation of US passport==
Living in Moscow in March 2007 John Robles applied to have his US passport renewed at the US Embassy. His passport was revoked however and the embassy refused to issue him with a new one. An accusation was made that Robles owed child support in [[Yolo County]] California. Robles disputed this as he had full custody of his 2 children and had raised them on his own. He claimed neither he nor his children had been in the US since 1995. He had been issued a new passport previously in 1998 after it had been stolen. It was after his passport was revoked that he was granted [[political asylum]] in Russia. Robles had been running a political website critical of the actions of President [[George W. Bush]] and hosted in Russia since July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jar2.com |title=John Robles JAR2 website |accessdate=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Journal of World-Systems Research''''' ('''''JWSR''''') is a biannual, [[open access]], [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] in the field of [[World-systems theory|world-systems analysis]], established in 1995 by founding editor [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]] at the Institute for World-System Research at the University of California at Riverside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://irows.ucr.edu/|title=Welcome to IROWS|website=irows.ucr.edu|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, it is published by the Political Economy of the World-System (PEWS) Section of the [[American Sociological Association]] and  by the [[D-Scribe Digital Publishing|University Library System, University of Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Jackie|last2=Bair|first2=Jennifer|last3=Byrd|first3=Scott|date=2015-08-31|title=Editors' Introduction|url=http://jwsr.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/jwsr/article/view/28|journal=Journal of World-Systems Research|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=238–240|doi=10.5195/jwsr.2015.28|issn=1076-156X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's current [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Jackie Smith (sociologist)|Jackie Smith]] ([[University of Pittsburgh]]).

The journal was one of the first online, [[peer-review]]ed academic journals, published originally as an online archive of scholarly papers accessed using the [[Gopher (protocol)]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The journal describes its purpose as being: {{cquote|to produce a high quality publication of world-systems research articles; to publish quantitative and comparative research on world-systems; to publish works of theory construction and codification of causal propositions; to publish data sets in connection with articles; to publish reviews of books relevant to world-systems studies; and to encourage authors to use the hypermedia advantages of electronic publication to present their research results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jwsr.org/editorial-policy "Editorial Policy,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513044532/http://www.jwsr.org/editorial-policy |date=2013-05-13 }} JWSR website.

[[Euclid]] [[Euclid's theorem|proved that]] there is no largest [[prime number]], and many mathematicians and hobbyists continue to search for large prime numbers.

Many of the largest known primes are [[Mersenne prime]]s. {{As of|2018|July}}, the seven largest known primes are Mersenne primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://primes.utm.edu/primes/search.php?Number=100 |title=The largest known primes - Database Search Output |first1=Chris |last1=Caldwell |date= |publisher=Prime Pages |access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last sixteen record primes were Mersenne primes.&lt;ref name="computerhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html |title=The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History |first1=Chris |last1=Caldwell |date= |publisher=Prime Pages |access-date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The last non-Mersenne to be the largest known prime, was [http://primes.utm.edu/primes/page.php?id=390 391,581 ⋅ 2&lt;sup&gt;216,193&lt;/sup&gt; − 1]; see also [http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History] by Caldwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fast Fourier transform]] implementation of the [[Lucas–Lehmer primality test]] for [[Mersenne number]]s is fast compared to other known primality tests for other kinds of numbers.

==Prizes==
The [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] (GIMPS) currently offers a US$3000 research discovery award for participants who download and run their free software and whose computer discovers a new Mersenne prime having fewer than 100 million digits.

There are several prizes offered by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] for record primes.&lt;ref name="prizes"/&gt; GIMPS is also coordinating its long-range search efforts for primes of 100 million digits and larger and will split the Electronic Frontier Foundation's US$150,000 prize with a winning participant.

The record passed one million digits in 1999, earning a US$50,000 prize.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation, [https://www.eff.org/press/releases/big-prime-nets-big-prize Big Prime Nets Big Prize].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the record passed ten million digits, earning a US$100,000 prize and a [[Cooperative Computing Award]] from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref name="prizes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2009/10/14-0 |title=Record 12-Million-Digit Prime Number Nets $100,000 Prize |date=October 14, 2009 |work=Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=November 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called it the 29th-top invention of 2008.&lt;ref name="invention"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854195_1854157,00.html |title=Best Inventions of 2008 - 29.

Additional prizes are being offered for the first prime number found with at least one hundred million digits and the first with at least one billion digits.&lt;ref name="prizes"/&gt;

==History==
The following table lists the progression of the largest known prime number in ascending order.&lt;ref name="computerhistory"/&gt; Here M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is the [[Mersenne number]] with exponent ''n''. The longest record-holder known was M&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; = 524,287, which was the largest known prime for 144 years. No records are known before 1456.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="107065">[[File:Schooner Wyoming, 1917.JPG|thumb|The American six-masted [[schooner]] {{ship||Wyoming|ship|2}}, the longest confirmed wooden ship in history.]]
This is a list of the world's '''longest wooden ships'''. The vessels are sorted by ship length including [[bowsprit]], if known.

Finding the world's longest wooden ship is not straightforward since there are several contenders, depending on which definitions are used. For example, some of these ships benefited from substantial iron or even steel components since the flexing of wood members can lead to significant leaking as the wood members become longer. Some of these ships were not very seaworthy, and a few sank either immediately after launch or soon thereafter. Some of the more recent large ships were never able or intended to leave their berths, and function as floating museums. Finally, not all of the claims to the title of the world's longest wooden ship are credible or verifiable.

A further problem is that especially wooden ships have more than one "length". The most used measure in length for registering a ship is the "length of the topmost deck" – the "length on deck" (LOD) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post on deck level' or the "length between perpendiculars" (LPP, LBP) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post in the construction waterline (CWL)'. In this method of measuring bowsprit including [[jibboom]] and out-board part of spanker boom if any have both no effect on the ship's length. The longest length for comparing ships, the total "[[Length overall|overall]]" length (LOA) based on sparred length, should be given if known.

The longest wooden ship ever built, the six-masted New England gaff schooner ''Wyoming'', had a "total length" of {{convert|137|m|ft}} (measured from tip of jib boom (30 metres) to tip of spanker boom (27 metres) and a "length on deck" of {{convert|107|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}-difference is due to her extremely long jib boom of {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} her out-board length being {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

A '''non-communicable disease''' ('''NCD''') is a [[disease]] that is not [[transmission (medicine)|transmissible]] directly from one person to another. NCDs include [[parkinson's disease]] [[autoimmune disease]]s, [[stroke]]s, most [[heart disease]]s, most [[cancer]]s, [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[chronic kidney disease]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[osteoporosis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cataract]]s, and others. NCDs may be [[chronic condition|chronic]] or [[acute (medicine)|acute]]. Most are non-[[infection|infectious]], although there are some non-communicable infectious diseases, such as [[parasitic disease]]s in which the parasite's [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] does not include direct host-to-host transmission. 

NCDs are the leading cause of death globally. In 2012, they caused 68% of all deaths (38 million) up from 60% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The top 10 causes of death|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index2.html |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half were under age 70 and half were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noncommunicable diseases |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/topics/noncommunicable_diseases/en/ |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Risk factor]]s such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment increase the likelihood of certain NCDs. Every year, at least 5 million people die because of tobacco use and about 2.8 million die from being overweight. High cholesterol accounts for roughly 2.6 million deaths and 7.5 million die because of [[high blood pressure]].

== Risk factors ==
[[Risk factor]]s such as a person's background; lifestyle and environment are known to increase the likelihood of certain non-communicable diseases. They include age, [[gender]], [[genetics]], exposure to [[air pollution]], and behaviors such as [[smoking]], [[Healthy diet|unhealthy diet]] and [[Sedentary lifestyle|physical inactivity]] which can lead to [[hypertension]] and [[obesity]], in turn leading to increased risk of many NCDs. Most NCDs are considered preventable because they are caused by modifiable risk factors.

The WHO's [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2002'']] identified five important risk factors for non-communicable disease in the top ten leading risks to health. These are raised blood pressure, raised [[cholesterol]], tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and overweight. The other factors associated with higher risk of NCDs include a person's economic and social conditions, also known as the "[social determinants of health]."

It has been estimated that if the primary risk factors were eliminated, 80% of the cases of heart disease, stroke and [[type 2 diabetes]] and 40% of cancers could be prevented. Interventions targeting the main risk factors could have a significant impact on reducing the burden of disease worldwide. Efforts focused on better diet and increased physical activity have been shown to control the prevalence of NCDs .

==Environmental diseases==
NCDs include many environmental diseases covering a broad category of avoidable and unavoidable [[health|human health]] conditions caused by external factors, such as sunlight, nutrition, pollution, and lifestyle choices.  The [[diseases of affluence]] are non-infectious diseases with environmental causes.  Examples include:
* Many types of [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD)
* [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) caused by smoking tobacco
* [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]
* [[Lower back pain]] caused by too little exercise
* [[Malnutrition]] caused by too little food, or eating the wrong kinds of food (e.g. [[scurvy]] from lack of [[Vitamin C]])
* [[Skin cancer]] caused by radiation from the sun
* [[Obesity]]

=== Inherited diseases ===
{{See also|List of genetic disorders}}
[[Genetic disorders]] are caused by errors in genetic information that produce diseases in the affected people.
The origin of these genetic errors can be:
* Spontaneous errors or mutations to the [[genome]]:
:* A change in chromosome [[Chromosomal condition|numbers]], such as [[Down syndrome]].
:* A defect in a gene caused by [[mutation]], such as [[Cystic fibrosis]].
:* An increase in the [[Mosaic (genetics)|amount]] of genetic information, such as [[Chimera (genetics)|Chimerism]] or [[Heterochromia iridum|Heterochromia]].

Cystic fibrosis is an example of an inherited disease that is caused by a mutation on a gene. The faulty gene impairs the normal movement of sodium chloride in and out of cells, which causes the mucus-secreting organs to produce abnormally thick mucus. The gene is recessive, meaning that a person must have two copies of the faulty gene for them to develop the disease. Cystic fibrosis affects the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as the sweat glands. The mucus secreted is very thick and blocks passageways in the lungs and digestive tracts. This mucus causes problems with breathing and with the digestion and absorption of nutrients.
* Inherited genetic errors from [[Kinship#Descent and the family|parents]]:
:* [[Dominance (genetics)|Dominant]] genetic diseases, such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntingtons]], require the inheritance of [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|one]] erroneous gene to be expressed.
:* [[Recessive]] genetic diseases require the inheritance of erroneous genes to be expressed and this is one reason they work together.

== Global health ==
[[File:Noncommunicable diseases world map-Deaths per million persons-WHO2012.svg|upright=1.4|thumb|Deaths from noncommunicable diseases per million persons in 2012 {{refbegin|3}}{{legend|#ffff20|688-2,635}}{{legend|#ffe820|2,636-2,923}}{{legend|#ffd820|2,924-3,224}}{{legend|#ffc020|3,225-3,476}}{{legend|#ffa020|3,477-4,034}}{{legend|#ff9a20|4,035-4,919}}{{legend|#f08015|4,920-5,772}}{{legend|#e06815|5,773-7,729}}{{legend|#d85010|7,730-8,879}}{{legend|#d02010|8,880-13,667}}{{refend}}]]
Referred to as a "lifestyle" disease, because the majority of these diseases are preventable illnesses, the most common causes for non-communicable diseases (NCD) include tobacco use (smoking), alcohol abuse, poor diets (high consumption of sugar, salt, saturated fats, and trans fatty acids) and physical inactivity. Currently, NCD kills 36 million people a year, a number that by some estimates is expected to rise by 17–24% within the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Non-Communicable Diseases Deemed Development Challenge of ‘Epidemic Proportions’ in Political Declaration Adopted During Landmark General Assembly Summit |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/ga11138.doc.htm |date=19 September 2011 |website=United Nations |publisher=Department of Public Information |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, many NCDs were associated with economic development and were so-called a "[[diseases of affluence|diseases of the rich]]". The burden of non-communicable diseases in developing countries has increased however, with an estimated 80% of the four main types of NCDs — cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes — now occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Action Plan for the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of non-communicable Diseases and with two-thirds of people who are affected by diabetes now residing in developing nations, NCD can no longer be considered just a problem affecting affluent estimation of the economic impact of chronic non-communicable diseases in selected countries. New WHO report: deaths from non-communicable diseases are on the rise, with developing world hit hardest. As previously stated, in 2008 alone, NCD's were the cause of  63% of deaths worldwide; a number that is expected to rise considerably in the near future if measures are not taken.

If present growth trends are maintained, by 2020, NCDs will attribute to 7 out of every 10 deaths in developing countries, killing 52 million people annually worldwide by 2030. With statistics such as these, it comes as no surprise that international entities such as the World Health Organization &amp; World Bank Human Development Network have identified the prevention and control of NCDs as an increasingly important discussion item on the [[global health]] agenda.

Thus, should policy makers and communities mobilize "and make prevention and targeted treatment of such diseases a priority," sustainable measures can be implemented to stagnate (and eventually even reverse) this emerging global health threat.  Potential measures currently being discussed by the(World Health Organization)-Food and Agriculture Organization includes reducing the levels of salt in foods, limiting inappropriate marketing of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children, imposing controls on harmful alcohol use, raising taxes on tobacco, and curbing legislation to curb smoking in public places.

=== United Nations ===
The [[World Health Organization]] is the specialized agency of the [[United Nations]] (UN) that acts as coordinating authority on international [[public health]] issues, including NCDs. In May 2008, the 193 Member States of the WHO approved a six-year plan to address non-communicable diseases, especially the rapidly increasing burden in low- and middle-income countries. The plan calls for raising the priority given to NCDs in [[international development]] work'.

During the 64th session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2010, a resolution was passed to call for a high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and treatment NCDs with the participation of heads of state and government. The resolution also encouraged UN Member States to address the issue of non-communicable diseases at the 2010 Review Summit for the [[Millennium Development Goals]].

=== Global Non-communicable Disease Network ===
In order to better coordinate efforts around the globe, in 2009 the WHO announced the launch of the ''Global Non-communicable Disease Network'' (NCDnet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New network to combat noncommunicable diseases |date=8 July 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/noncommunicable_diseases_20090708/en/index.html |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCDnet will consist of leading health organizations and experts from around the world in order to fight against diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Ala Alwan, assistant director-general for Non-communicable Diseases and Mental Health at the WHO, said: "integrating the prevention of non-communicable diseases and injuries into the national and global development agendas is not only achievable but also a priority for developing countries."&lt;ref name="Business"&gt;{{cite news |title=Who's action against non-communicable diseases|author=Alexander Chiejina|newspaper=Business Day Weekend |date=16 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NCD Alliance ===
The NCD Alliance is a global partnership founded in May 2009 by four international federations representing [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[cancer]], and chronic [[respiratory disease]]. The NCD Alliance brings together roughly 900 national member associations to fight non-communicable disease. Long term aims of the Alliance include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdalliance.org/aboutus |title=About Us |author=The NCD Alliance |publisher=The NCD Alliance |accessdate=4 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504050001/http://ncdalliance.org/aboutus |archivedate=4 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# NCD/disease [[health policy|national plans]] for all
# A tobacco free world
# Improved lifestyles
# Strengthened [[health system]]s
# Global access to affordable and good quality medicines and technologies
# [[Human rights]] for people with NCDs.

=== United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases (UNIATF) ===
The [[United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs|United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases]] (UNIATF) was established by the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] in 2013 in order to provide scaled up action across the UN system to support governments, in particular in low- and middle-income countries, to tackle [[non-communicable diseases]] (NCDs).

=== Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network ===
The Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network, or commonly referred to as YP-CDN, is a global network of roughly 5000 young professionals across 157 countries. The organization aims to mobilize these young people "to take action against social injustice driven by NCDs.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdaction.org/history|title=History |author=YP-CDN |publisher=YP-CDN |accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==
Previously, chronic NCDs were considered a problem limited mostly to [[high income economy|high income countries]], while [[infectious diseases]] seemed to affect [[low income countries]]. The burden of disease attributed to NCDs has been estimated at 85% in industrialized nations, 70% in middle income nations, and nearly 50% in countries with the lowest national incomes.&lt;ref name="WHO2005"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Preventing Chronic Diseases a Vital Investment |journal=Cataloguing-in-Publication Data |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, chronic NCDs accounted for more than 60% (over 35 million) of the 57 million deaths worldwide. Given the global population distribution, almost 80% of deaths due to chronic NCDs worldwide now occur in low and middle income countries, while only 20% occur in higher income countries.

National economies are reportedly suffering significant losses because of premature deaths or inability to work resulting from heart disease, stroke and diabetes. For instance, China is expected to lose roughly $558 billion in national income between 2005 and 2015 due to early deaths. In 2005, heart disease, stroke and diabetes caused an estimated loss in [[international dollar]]s of national income of 9 billion in India and 3 billion in Brazil.&lt;ref name="WHO2005"/&gt;

=== Absenteeism and presenteeism ===
{{main | Absenteeism | Presenteeism}}

The burden of chronic NCDs including [[mental health]] conditions is felt in workplaces around the world, notably due to elevated levels of [[absenteeism]], or absence from work because of illness, and [[presenteeism]], or productivity lost from staff coming to work and performing below normal standards due to poor [[health]]. For example, the United Kingdom experienced a loss of about 175 million days in 2006 to absence from illness among a working population of 37.7 million people. The estimated cost of absences due to illness was over 20 billion pounds in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper C, Dewe P |title=Well-being—absenteeism, presenteeism, costs and challenges |journal=Occup Med (Lond) |volume=58 |issue=8 |pages=522–4 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19054749 |doi=10.1093/occmed/kqn124|last2=Dewe }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost due to presenteeism is likely even larger, although methods of analyzing the economic impacts of presenteeism are still being developed. Methods for analyzing the distinct workplace impacts of NCDs versus other types of health conditions are also still being developed.

== Key diseases ==

=== Cancer ===
{{main | Cancer}}

For the vast majority of cancers, risk factors are environmental or lifestyle-related, thus cancers are mostly preventable NCD.&lt;ref name=Danaei&gt;{{cite journal |author= Danaei G, Vander Hoorn S, Lopez AD, Murray CJ, Ezzati M |title= Causes of cancer in the world: comparative risk assessment of nine behavioural and environmental risk factors |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9499 |pages=1784–93 |year=2005 |pmid=16298215 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67725-2|last2= Vander Hoorn |last3= Lopez |last4= Murray |last5= Ezzati |author6= Comparative Risk Assessment collaborating group (Cancers) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater than 30% of cancer is preventable via avoiding risk factors including: [[tobacco]], being [[overweight]] or [[obesity]], low fruit and vegetable intake, [[physical inactivity]], [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, and [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/ |title=Cancer |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infectious agents are responsible for some cancers, for instance almost all [[cervical cancer]]s are caused by [[human papillomavirus]] infection.

=== Cardiovascular disease ===
{{main | Cardiovascular disease}}

The first studies on cardiovascular health were performed in 1949 by [[Jerry Morris]] using occupational health data and were published in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris JN, Crawford MD |title=Coronary heart disease and physical activity of work; evidence of a national necropsy survey |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |issue=5111 |pages=1485–96 |date=December 1958 |pmid=13608027 |pmc=2027542 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5111.1485|last2=Crawford }}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes, prevention, and/or treatment of all forms of cardiovascular disease remain active fields of [[biomedical research]], with hundreds of scientific studies being published on a weekly basis. A trend has emerged, particularly in the early 2000s, in which numerous studies have revealed a link between fast food and an increase in heart disease. These studies include those conducted by the Ryan Mackey Memorial Research Institute, Harvard University and the Sydney Center for Cardiovascular Health. Many major fast food chains, particularly McDonald's, have protested the methods used in these studies and have responded with healthier menu options.

A fairly recent emphasis is on the link between low-grade [[inflammation]] that hallmarks atherosclerosis and its possible interventions. [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) is a common inflammatory marker that has been found to be present in increased levels in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20024640|year=2009|last1=Karakas|first1=M|last2=Koenig|first2=W|title=CRP in cardiovascular disease|volume=34|issue=8|pages=607–13|doi=10.1007/s00059-009-3305-7|journal=Herz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also [[osteoprotegerin]] which involved with regulation of a key inflammatory transcription factor called [[NF-κB]] has been found to be a risk factor of cardiovascular disease and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20448212|year=2010|last1=Lieb|first1=W|last2=Gona|first2=P|last3=Larson|first3=MG|last4=Massaro|first4=JM|last5=Lipinska|first5=I|last6=Keaney Jr|first6=JF|last7=Rong|first7=J|last8=Corey|first8=D|last9=Hoffmann|first9=U|last10=Fox|first10=C.

=== Diabetes ===
{{main | Diabetes}}

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition which is largely preventable and manageable but difficult to cure.  Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal ("euglycemia") as possible without presenting undue [[patient]] danger.  This can usually be with close dietary management, exercise, and use of appropriate medications (insulin only in the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus.  Oral medications may be used in the case of type 2 diabetes, as well as insulin).

Patient education, understanding, and participation is vital since the complications of diabetes are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Intensive diabetes treatment and cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 diabetes |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=353 |issue=25 |pages=2643–53 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16371630 |pmc=2637991 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052187 |last1=Nathan |first1=DM |last2=Cleary |first2=PA |last3=Backlund |first3=JY |last4=Genuth |first4=SM |last5=Lachin|first5=JM|last6=Orchard|first6=TJ|last7=Raskin|first7=P|last8=Zinman|first8=B|author9=Diabetes Control Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions Complications (DCCT/EDIC) Study Research Group  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The effect of intensive diabetes therapy on the development and progression of neuropathy.

Wider health problems may accelerate the deleterious effects of diabetes. These include [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[hypercholesterolemia|elevated cholesterol]] levels, [[obesity]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], and lack of regular [[exercise]].

=== Chronic kidney disease ===
{{main|Chronic kidney disease}}

Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not currently identified as one of WHO's main targets for global NCD control, there is compelling evidence that CKD is not only common, harmful and treatable but also a major contributing factor to the incidence and outcomes of at least three of the diseases targeted by WHO (diabetes, hypertension and CVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang |first=Q.L. |last2=Rothenbacher |first2=D. |title=Prevalence of chronic kidney disease in population-based studies: systematic review|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-8-117 |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=8 |pages=117 |year=2008 |pmid=18405348 |pmc=2377260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CKD strongly predisposes to hypertension and CVD; diabetes, hypertension and CVD are all major causes of CKD; and major risk factors for diabetes, hypertension and CVD (such as obesity and smoking) also cause or exacerbate CKD. In addition, among people with diabetes, hypertension, or CVD, the subset who also have CKD are at highest risk of adverse outcomes and high health care costs. Thus, CKD, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are closely associated conditions that often coexist; share common risk factors and treatments; and would benefit from a coordinated global approach to prevention and control.

=== Chronic respiratory disease ===
''Main Article: [[Respiratory disease#Chronic respiratory disease|Chronic respiratory disease]]''

Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRDs) are diseases of the lungs and airways.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO) hundreds of millions of people suffer daily from CRDs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/about_topic/en/|title=WHO {{!}} About chronic respiratory diseases|website=www.who.int|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common CRDs are: [[Asthma]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[Occupational lung disease]], and [[Pulmonary hypertension]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/en/|title=Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs)|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While CRDs are not curable, various treatments are available to help improve quality of life for individuals who have them.  Most treatments involve dilating major airways to improve shortness of breath among other symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The main risk factors for developing CRDs are: tobacco smoking, indoor and outdoor air pollution, allergens, and occupational risks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

WHO helped launch the [[Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases]] (GARD) in 2006.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/gard/en/|title=Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GARD is voluntarily composed of national and international organizations and works toward "reducing the global burden of chronic respiratory diseases" and focus mainly on vulnerable populations and low and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/gard/en/|title=Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6413">'''Participatory poverty assessment''' (PPA) is the approach to analyzing and reducing poverty by incorporating the views of the poor. PPAs attempt to better understand the poor, to give the poor more influence over decisions that affect their lives, and to increase effectiveness of poverty reduction policies.&lt;ref name="ppa_guide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/238411/ppa.pdf |title=A rough guide to PPAs |author=Andy Norton with Bella Bird Karen Brock Margaret Kakande Carrie Turk |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hakikazi.org/tcdd/newpage7.htm |title=Presentation on Introduction to Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPAs) |publisher=Hakikazi Catalyst |accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPAs are seen as complements to traditional household surveys by helping to interpret survey results, and aim to capture the experiences of the poor by being more open-ended.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xiii,xv}}

==History==

Before the 1990s, household-survey approaches were the main way to measure poverty. This shifted to participatory activities in the 1990s after critiques of these traditional methods.&lt;ref name="mcgee"&gt;McGee, Rosemary, ed. ''Knowing Poverty''. London, GB: Routledge, 2012. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 11 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1,3}}

The term "participatory poverty assessment" was coined within the [[World Bank]] in 1992,&lt;ref name=ppa_guide/&gt; and was seen as a participatory form of poverty assessments (PAs, i.e. survey-based approaches).&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|2,3}}

Early experiences of PPAs were in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|3}}

By 1998, 43 PPAs had been conducted: 28 in Africa, 6 in Latin America, 5 in Eastern Europe, and 4 in Asia.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xiii,xiv,15}}

Early PPAs focused most on making higher quality information available to policy makers, rather than seeing the poor as itself being involved in the process of reducing poverty.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|3}}

Later in the 1990s, "second generation" PPAs appeared, which tried to allow the poor to influence policy decisions.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|4}}

As of 2012, the [[World Bank]]'s [[Voices of the Poor]] is the largest PPA ever to have been conducted.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|4}}

==Rationale and comparison to previous methods==

Both PPAs and traditional surveys contain both quantitative and qualitative information, as well as "subjective" and "objective" parts, so this is not necessarily a distinguishing feature of PPAs.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|4}} Rather:

{{quote |text=Traditional survey data can be used to count, compare, and predict.  The strength of the PPA is not in counting but rather in understanding hidden dimensions of poverty and analyzing causality and processes by which people fall into and get out of poverty.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5}}}}

PPAs are also distinguished from anthropological studies because the latter analyze few communities in depth, whereas PPAs analyze various communities of a country. PPAs also focus on policy decisions (which anthropological studies don't need to).&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5,6}}

==Types of methodologies and activities==

Within PPAs, various methodologies exist. Some PPAs use more than one methodology.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|6}}

* Field work and conducting interviews&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Rapid rural appraisal
* [[Participatory rural appraisal]] (includes use of visuals, such as matrices and diagramming)
* SARAR (self-esteem, associative strength, resourcefulness, action planning, and responsibility)
* Beneficiary assessment
* Semistructured interviews and focus groups

PPAs can last from several weeks to several months.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|7}}

==Organizations using this approach==

Various organizations have used PPAs as part of their work.

* [[World Bank]]
* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP)&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|3}}
* [[Department for International Development]]&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|17}}
* [[ActionAid]]
* [[Asian Development Bank]]
* [[Danish International Development Agency]]
* [[Oxfam UK]]
* [[Thailand Development Research Institute]]

In addition, "secondary stakeholders" (i.e. organizations that do not conduct PPAs directly, but participate in PPAs) such as [[UNICEF]], various NGOs (e.g. [[Save the Children]] and [[Oxfam]]), academic institutions, etc., have also participated in PPAs.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==Results==

Participatory poverty assessments confirmed the multidimensional nature of poverty (i.e. that the poor deal not just with lack of money, but with various problems like lack of resources, poor health, physical violence, social isolation, etc.) that was seen from traditional household questionnaire-based methods.&lt;ref name="robb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/07/22/000094946_99040105542482/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf |title=Can the Poor Influence Policy? Participatory Poverty Assessments in the Developing World |author=Caroline M. Robb |year=1999 |publisher=[[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}} PPAs have also been able to access information that was not obtained in household surveys by building trust. For instance PPAs have obtained information on sensitive topics such as [[child prostitution]], drug use, and [[domestic violence]] in relation to poverty.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xiv}}

In [[Zambia]], PPAs discovered that the timing of school fees caused economic stress for households, so new legislation to change this timing was proposed.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xv}}

In [[Niger]], a PPA found that the poor see education only as a seventh priority for poverty reduction due to "the concern that what children learn had little relevance to getting people out of poverty". As a result of this PPA, food security was prioritized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/09/21/000160016_20060921172552/Rendered/PDF/373930PAPER0NE0participatory0poverty.pdf |title=Participatory Poverty Assessment - Niger}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vii}}

PPAs have also informed World Bank's [[World Development Report]]s.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|vi}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25317">In [[world systems theory]], the '''periphery countries''' (sometimes referred to as just '''the periphery''') are those that are less developed than the [[semi-periphery countries|semi-periphery]] and [[core countries]].  These countries usually receive [[International inequality|a disproportionately small share of global wealth]]. They have weak state institutions and are dependent on – according to some, exploited by – more developed countries. These countries are usually behind because of obstacles such as lack of technology, unstable government, and poor education and health systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/25642636/_Peripheral_Realism_Revisited_in_Revista_Brasileira_de_Pol%C3%ADtica_Internacional_59_1_1-18|title=Peripheral Realism Revisited|first1=Carlos |last1=Escudé|first2=Luis L|last2=Schenoni|publisher=|journal=Revista Brasileira de Política Internacional|volume=59|issue=1|pp=1-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, the exploitation of periphery countries' agriculture, cheap labor, and natural resources aid core countries in remaining dominant. This is best described by [[dependency theory]],&lt;ref name= Shannon&gt;Thomas Shannon. An Introduction to the World-System Perspective. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; which is one [[theory]] on how [[globalization]] can affect the world and the countries in it. It is, however, possible for periphery countries to rise out of their status and move into semi-periphery or core status. This can be done by doing things such as [[Industrialisation|industrializing]], stabilizing the government and political climate, etc.

Based on the list in Dunn, Kawana, Brewer (2000).{{update-inline|date=May 2018}}]]

==Background==

Periphery countries are those that exist on the outer edges of global trade.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} There could be many reasons for a country to be considered peripheral, such as a dysfunctional or inefficient government.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} For example, some nations customs and ports are so inefficient that even though they are geographically closer it is cheaper to ship goods from longer distances.&lt;ref name=dollar&gt;Dollar, David, "Globalization, Inequality, and Poverty since 1980" Development Research Group, World Bank. November 2001, Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons such as wars, non-central location, insufficient infrastructure (rail lines, roads and communications) will keep a country in the periphery of global trade.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Generally the populations tend to be poor and destitute so the core countries will exploit them for cheap labor and will even purposely interfere with their politics to keep things this way.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Usually a peripheral country will specialize in one particular industry, leaving it vulnerable to economic instability and limiting international investment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Sometimes countries decide to isolate themselves, such as 14th century China.&lt;ref name=Before&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet L., "Before European Hegemony" Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
There are a variety of reasons that periphery countries remain the way they are. One important factor that keeps countries in the periphery is the lack of development of [[technology]].&lt;ref name = world&gt;Immanuel Wallerstein. The Modern World System : Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century. Academic press. 1976.http://marriottschool.byu.edu/emp/WPW/Class%209%20-%20The%20World%20System%20Perspective.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Another way periphery countries come to be is either the lack of a central [[government]] or the periphery country is under the control of another country. Periphery countries are known for exporting raw goods to core countries. What tends to happen is the maximum gain a periphery nation could earn is less than needed to maintain an equilibrium between [[cost]]s and [[revenues]]. One thing periphery nations could do is to stop the increase of exports.&lt;ref name = periphery&gt;Raul Prebischb. Commercial Policy in the Underdeveloped Countries. American Economic Association. 1959.https://www.jstor.org/stable/1816120.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 19th century, Asia and Africa were considered periphery and their lack of development enabled the United States and Germany to remain successful core nations.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

Although periphery nations are exploited by core countries, there is a purpose to the unequal exchanges of goods. For instance, the core countries have an incentive to gain a [[Profit (economics)|profit]] and this enables the [[world]] [[Market (economics)|market]] to further grow. At times, there is a change in the balance of trade between the periphery and core countries. This occurs when the prices of [[exports]] from periphery countries decrease at a faster rate than the exports from core nations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In this case, the [[governments]] of the periphery nation are affected in several ways. For instance, there is an increase in [[unemployment]] as well as a decrease in state income. This type of interaction is unique because the core country involved is somewhat weaker than normal. An example of this occurring is the growth of the industrial capabilities of [[Italy]] and [[Russia]] towards the end of the 19th century. This has also occurred in other periphery nations such as [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name= global&gt;Immanuel Wallerstein. Dependence in an Interdependent World: The Limited Possibilities of Transformation within the Capitalist World Economy. African Studies Association. April 1974.https://www.jstor.org/stable/523574.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===15th century and 16th century===
The world system at this time was much different from the world system of today.  Several areas were beginning to develop into trading powers but none were able to gain total control.  For this reason, a core and periphery developed in each region as opposed to a global scale.  Cities began to become the "core" with the more agricultural countryside becoming a sort of "periphery".  The most underdeveloped region that was still involved in trade at the time was Europe.  It had the weakest core and periphery areas.&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;

Two examples of periphery countries in the late 15th century and early 16th century are [[Poland]] and [[Latin America]]. At this time, Poland was mainly exporting wheat to other areas of [[Europe]] and Poland wanted cheap labor.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; As a result, [[landlord]]s enslaved rural workers on their estate lands. Also, Latin America experienced an enslavement of their natives and imports of [[slaves]] from [[Africa]]. Forced mining labor was placed on the slaves, which enabled Latin America to export cheap goods to Europe.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; Both Poland and Latin America were similar during this time period because the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] of these areas became more wealthy due to their interactions with the [[world economy]]. These areas of the world were also different from during medieval times in Europe. They are different because during the late 15th century and early 16th century, Poland and Latin America were producing goods and exporting them rather than simply consuming their raw goods.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

==Interactions==
The relationship that the periphery countries have with the core countries is one that is defined by the exploitation of the periphery countries by the core countries. As many countries began to [[industrialize]] they looked for cheap goods and products.&lt;ref name=Kardulias&gt;P. Nick Kardulias. World Systems Theory in Practice. https://books.google.com/books?id=fFmBTldqTbsC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=core+periphery+interactions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I6Jm-uPMEJ&amp;sig=ZhpHKHMd-vKpAB96Ewbv4T_9EEM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=J6gPTN26FIOC8gaDpvj6CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=core%20periphery%20interactions&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; These [[industrialized]] "core" countries would then look to the less developed "periphery" countries for cheap goods.  In most cases it is much easier and inexpensive to get these goods from other countries.&lt;ref name= Hobsbawm&gt;Eric Hobsbawm. The Age of Empires. Vintage Books, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  Core countries realized this and began to use these cheap resources.

For the core countries to remain at the core, it is necessary that the periphery countries keep producing these cheap goods and remain mostly [[agricultural]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; The core countries are able to get goods very cheaply from the periphery and then are able to [[manufacture]] products and sell them at a relatively high price.&lt;ref name= Shannon /&gt; The periphery countries are unable to make any gains because of this relationship and it is therefore impossible for them to ever industrialize.  It is argued that if these countries are never able industrialize, they will continue to remain on the periphery.&lt;ref name= Shannon /&gt;

===Imperialism's effect on core-periphery interactions===
The current relationship between core countries and periphery countries was mostly defined in the era of [[imperialism]] that occurred in the late 19th through the early 20th centuries.  It was at this time that the countries with the strongest [[economy|economies]] and militaries began to exploit those countries with weaker states.&lt;ref name= Hobsbawm /&gt;  A result of this exploitation was the tendency of underdeveloped states or [[colony|colonies]] to move more towards the production of one type of [[export]] that would then come to  dominate their land, territory and lifestyle economy.  Some examples of the time include Brazil's [[coffee]] production and Cuba's [[cigar]] production.&lt;ref name= Hobsbawm /&gt;

==Economic possibilities==
Periphery countries are continuously exploited by countries due to the exportation of surpluses of raw goods to the more technologically industrialized core countries for manufacturing and distribution.&lt;ref name=Martinez-Vela&gt;Martinez-Vela. [http://marriottschool.byu.edu/emp/WPW/Class%209%20-%20The%20World%20System%20Perspective.pdf World Systems Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306210823/http://marriottschool.byu.edu/emp/WPW/Class%209%20-%20The%20World%20System%20Perspective.pdf |date=2009-03-06 }}. ESD-83. Fall 20001.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently some of the manufacturing has been moved to periphery countries but it is still controlled and owned by the core countries. There are, however, ways in which periphery countries can rise from their poor status and become semi-periphery countries or even core countries. It is crucial for the core countries to keep exploiting the natural resources of the periphery countries and to keep the governments semi-stable or else it could cause economic unrest for the core countries as a whole.&lt;ref name = Soc&gt;Anderson, Taylor. Sociology, the essentials. Cengage Learning. February 2006. [https://books.google.com/books?id=X7s9hvROWjoC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=sociology+core+countries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xkRctPKLVL&amp;sig=_kKfeGYVSKBSGxFEHJG-s5ypyT4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Olz9S9nlA5TKMeHzzd4H&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sociology%20core%20countries&amp;f=false Sociology, the essentials]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ways to improve===
There are several ways in which periphery countries are able to escape their poor status. Some of these ways are stabilizing their governments, becoming more industrialized and using [[natural resource]]s to benefit themselves rather than core countries, and creating a better [[education system]].&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt; Developing a banking system that can compete on a global scale is also another way in which periphery countries can help better themselves in the global market.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt;

====Stabilized government====
One main way in which a periphery country can rise to [[semi-periphery]] or core status is through the stabilization of its government. A country with a [[dictatorship]] type government is much easier to exploit and corrupt than one with a well organized, elected government and core countries use this to their advantage.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt; Political unrest is usually a cause for military action from the core countries in order to protect their interests and keep a cooperative dictator or government in power.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt; Once the citizens of these countries become exploited enough, they can stage a coup in order to overthrow their government and put someone who they feel will help the country into power.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt; If this is done successfully and the new leader is stays true to his/her word, the country can take the next necessary step in rising from periphery status and that is to start to industrialize.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt;

Some [[Neo-Marxists]] believe that it would actually be best for periphery countries to cut all economic and political ties with the core countries.&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt; This would, in their opinion, allow the periphery countries to develop and industrialize at their own pace instead of being exploited and driven by core countries demands. Doing this would allow these countries to spend their money on industrializing and bettering themselves, rather than importing goods from core countries. It also would allow these countries to become more independent from the core countries, causing them to move to semi-peripheral status.&lt;ref name = Politics&gt;Duncan, Webster, Switky. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mQIy4FjLEC0C&amp;pg=PA416&amp;dq=%22periphery+countries%22&amp;lr=&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22periphery%20countries%22&amp;f=false World Politics in the 21st Century]. page 416. Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Industrializing====
Most periphery countries rely almost entirely on agriculture and other natural resources such as oil, coal, and diamonds in order to gain some sort of profit, but this also keeps them from growing economically. In order for them to grow they must industrialize in order to produce finished goods for exportation around the world, instead of allowing the core countries to profit from their natural resources. Industrializing and adapting newer technology is one of the major ways in which periphery countries can begin to raise their standard of living and help increase the wealth of their citizens.&lt;ref name = Martinez-Vela/&gt; Becoming industrialized also will help to force trade to come to their cities, if they can produce goods at competitive prices, allowing them to reach out to the global market and take hold.&lt;ref name = Martinez-Vela/&gt; Once a periphery country can industrialize, and use its own resources to its own benefit, it will begin to enter semi-periphery status.

In order for a periphery country to industrialize, it must first undergo [[proto-industrialization]].&lt;ref name = proto/&gt; In this stage, a [[market economy|market-based economy]] begins to form, normally in rural areas, using agricultural products. Proto-industrialization also helps to organize the rural market in these country and allows for them to become more capitalistic. Finally, once these countries develop this style of economy, they can begin to build factories and machines.&lt;ref name = proto&gt;John Hicks. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2117187 A Theory of Economic History]. page 141. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Education====
One of the final steps for a periphery country to rise to semi-periphery or core status is to educate its citizens.&lt;ref name = Education/&gt; Raising the [[literacy]] rate allows ideas to spread more quickly through a country and also allows people to better communicate with themselves and the rest of the world. Also once universities are developed a country can begin to research new technology. Researching new technology can help a country to better compete in a global market by becoming more efficient or selling new technology and industrial techniques. If education and industry is allowed to become developed enough it is entirely possible for a periphery country to rise to [[core country]] status and become a leader in the global market.&lt;ref name = Education/&gt; Another way in which periphery countries better their education system is by spending money to send university level students and staff abroad to places such as the U.S. and Europe to receive better education.&lt;ref name = Education&gt;Arnove. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1187395 Comparative Education Systems]. page 48. Comparative and International Education Society. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the people in these countries have become educated enough and they realize their place in the world economy, they can also demand help from the core countries. Although unlikely, due to the fact that the core countries rely on the exploitation of the periphery, there have been pushes for core countries to help better the periphery countries. Some of the ideas suggested are to help aid the periphery countries in developing by exploiting them less, help the periphery countries lose some of their debt and raise the prices on goods coming from these countries to allow them to be more profitable.&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt; These policies are obviously not beneficial to the core countries and is mostly why they have never been adapted successfully but this is another way in which the periphery could rise to a higher status.&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt;

===Examples===

====Russia====
During the early 20th century the economy of the Russian Empire was a primarily agrarian country with isolated pockets of heavy industries. The Empire fell in 1917; the core of its industrial workers shrank from 3.6 million in 1917 to 1.5 million in 1920.&lt;ref name="R141"&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick (2008). ''The Russian Revolution''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-923767-0}}. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the [[Russian Civil War]] the Soviet Union was [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)#Industrialization in practice|industrialized]] under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Industrialization peaked in 1929-1932 in a [[first five-year plan|rapid campaign]] described as "a revolution from above".&lt;ref name = R121&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick (2008). ''The Russian Revolution''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-923767-0}}. p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  Former personal private farms were [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivized]] in the early 1930s and gradually supplied with tractors and other machinery. Mechanization of farm labor, among other factors, contributed to freeing up workers for the newly built factories. In 1928-1932 alone at least ten million peasants migrated to the cities, causing "an unprecedented demographic upheaval".&lt;ref name="R141"/&gt; Industrialization allowed the country to trade in the global trade market. By the 1950s and 60s, only about 30&amp;nbsp;years after it began to industrialize, the Soviet Union was considered by most scholars a core country along with the United States.

===Adaptation===
Once a periphery country rises up to [[core countries status]] it will be more dependent on other periphery countries for natural resources. They may also start to exploit other periphery countries to continue to better themselves. One of the biggest impacts of this rise of status is the effects it has on the people of these countries. [[Health care]] is one of the first major improvements these countries will see, people will no longer die en masse from diseases such as [[malaria]] and will be better treated for [[non-communicable diseases]].&lt;ref name= "Globalization and NC disease"&gt;Beaglehole, Yach. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T1B-49H6JNK-W&amp;_user=88470&amp;_coverDate=09%2F13%2F2003&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1349324087&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000006998&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=88470&amp;md5=e0d7ec9dbc232f5d0749b718023228d1 Globalisation and the prevention and control of non-communicable disease: the neglected chronic disease of adults].  Elsevier Ltd. 13 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Education]] is also another way in which the citizens will benefit.&lt;ref name = Education/&gt; As a [[country]] becomes richer, it is able to build more [[schools]] and better fund the schools already built. This was seen in Russia after the [[October Revolution]]. A better educated public leads to a more efficient [[workforce]], and can also lead the country to technological breakthroughs in [[industry]] and [[manufacturing]]. These countries will also experience much less severe famine now that they are able to trade successfully on a [[world|global]] scale.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The '''Revolutions of 1917–1923''' were a period of political unrest and revolts around the world inspired by the success of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the disorder created by the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The uprisings were mainly [[socialist]] or [[anti-colonial]] in nature and were mostly short-lived, failing to have a long-term impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historytoday.com/david-motadel/waves-revolution |title=Waves of Revolution |last1=Motadel |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=April 4, 2011 |website=History Today |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the revolutionary activity of the era, the [[revolutionary wave]] of 1917–1923 mainly refers to the unrest caused by [[World War I]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnLI8ooHHPgC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=1917%E2%80%9323+wave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3tb3I4H5ZA&amp;sig=j8d0sgDCa3o0D0fK8fPGymAhdlM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW0Mr-q8TMAhULKh4KHfsFDlAQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=1917%E2%80%9323%20wave&amp;f=false |title=Neutral Europe Between War and Revolution, 1917-23 |last1=Schmitt |first1=Hans |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist revolutions in Europe==
===Russia===
{{Main|Russian Revolution|Russian Civil War}}
[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] but before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]], and [[Peace of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]]]

In war-torn [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], the liberal [[February Revolution]] toppled the monarchy. It was unstable and the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power in the [[October Revolution]]. The ascendant [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|communist party]] soon withdrew from the war with some territorial concessions by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].  It then battled its political rivals in the [[Russian Civil War]], including [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|invading forces from the Allied Powers]]. In response to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], the Bolshevik Party and the emerging [[Soviet Union]], [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] from a broad assortment of ideological factions fought against them, particularly through the [[counter-revolutionary]] [[White movement]] and the peasant [[Green armies|Green Army]], the various nationalist movements in [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution]] and other would-be new states like those in Soviet [[Transcaucasia]] and [[Soviet Central Asia]], through the [[Anarchism|anarchist]]-inspired [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|Third Russian Revolution]] and [[Tambov Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Ascher, //The Russian Revolution: A Beginner's Guide'' (Oneworld Publications, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1921, due to exhaustion, the collapse of transportation and markets, and threats of starvation, even dissident elements of the [[Red Army]] itself were in revolt against the [[communist state]], as shown by the [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. However, the multiple anti-Bolshevik forces were uncoordinated and disorganized, and in every case operated on the periphery. The Red Army, operating at the center, defeated them one by one and regained control. The complete failure of Comintern-inspired revolutions was a sobering experience in Moscow, and the Bolsheviks moved from world revolution to the theme of socialism in one country, Russia. Lenin moved to open trade relations with Britain, Germany, and other major countries. Most dramatically, in 1921, Lenin introduced a sort of small-scale capitalism with his [[New Economic Policy]] (or NEP). In this process of revolution and counter-revolution the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) was officially born in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Rex A. Wade, "The Revolution at One Hundred: Issues and Trends in the English Language Historiography of the Russian Revolution of 1917."

===Western Europe===

[[File:Berlin.revolution1918.statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of a revolutionary soldier; memorial to the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] in [[Berlin]]]]

The [[Leninist]] victories also inspired a surge by the [[History of communism|world Communist movement]]: the larger [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] and its offspring, like the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], as well as the neighboring [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Hungarian Revolution]], and the [[Biennio Rosso]] in Italy in addition to various smaller uprisings, protests and strikes, all proved abortive.

The Bolsheviks sought to coordinate this new wave of revolution in the Soviet-led [[Communist International]], while new [[Communist party|communist parties]] separated from their former socialist organizations and the older, more moderate [[Second International]]. Despite ambitions for [[world revolution]], the far-flung Comintern movement had more setbacks than successes through the next generation, and it was abolished in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McDermott and Jeremy Agnew, ''The Comintern: A History of International Communism from Lenin to Stalin'' (Macmillan, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; After the Second World War when the [[Red Army]] occupied most of Eastern Europe, Communists would come to power in the Baltic states, [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Comrades!: A History of World Communism'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Communist revolutions==
===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], then part of the United Kingdom, the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 anticipated the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921) within the same historical period as this first wave of [[communist revolution]]. The [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] movement of the time was predominantly nationalist and [[Populism|populist]], and although it had left-wing positions and included socialists and communists, it was not Communist. The Irish and Soviet Russian Republics nevertheless found common ground in their opposition to [[British Empire|British interests]], and established a trading relationship.

===Mexico===
The same was true of the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1920), which had broken out in 1910 but had devolved into factional fighting among the rebels by 1915, as the more radical forces of [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Pancho Villa]] lost ground to the more conservative "Sonoran oligarchy" and its [[Constitutional Army]]. The [[Felicistas]], the last major group of counterrevolutionaries, abandoned their armed campaign in 1920, and the internecine power struggles abated for a time after revolutionary General [[Álvaro Obregón]] had bribed or slain his former allies and rivals alike, but the following decade witnessed the assassination of Obregon and several others, abortive [[Coup d'état|military coup]] attempts and a massive right-wing uprising, the [[Cristero War]], due to religious persecution of Roman Catholics.

===Malta===
The [[Sette Giugno|Sette Giugno of 1919]] was a revolt characterised by a series of riots and protests by the Maltese population, initially as a reaction to the rise in the cost of living in the aftermath of [[World War I]], and the sacking of hundreds of workers from the dockyard. This coincided with popular demands for [[Self-governance|self-government]], which resulted in a National Assembly being formed in Valletta at the same time of the riots. This dramatically boosted the uprising, as many people headed to Valletta to show their support for the Assembly. This led to the British forces firing into the crowd, killing four local men. The cost of living increased dramatically after the war. Imports were limited, and as food became scarce prices rose; this made the fortune of farmers and merchants with surpluses to trade.

===Egypt===
The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] was a countrywide [[revolution]] against the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. It was carried out by [[Egyptians]] and Sudanese from different walks of life in the wake of the British-ordered exile of revolutionary leader [[Saad Zaghloul]], and other members of the [[Wafd Party]] in 1919. The revolution led to Britain's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|recognition of Egyptian independence]] in 1922, and the implementation of a new [[Egyptian Constitution of 1923|constitution in 1923]]. Britain, however, continued in control of what was renamed the [[Kingdom of Egypt]]. British guided the king and retained control of the Canal Zone, [[Sudan]] and Egypt's external and military affairs. King Fuad died in 1936 and [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] when Italy invaded Ethiopia, he signed the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]], requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt by 1949, except at the Suez Canal. During World War II, British troops [[Military history of Egypt during World War II|used Egypt]] as a major base for its operations throughout the region. British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947, but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the war.&lt;ref&gt;P.J.

==History==

===United States===
[[Sirius Satellite Radio]] was founded by [[Martine Rothblatt]], [[David Margolese]] and [[Robert Briskman]].&lt;ref name="mherper"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Herper |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0510/second-acts-pharmaceuticals-orphan-drugs-pah-deep-breaths.html |title=From Satellites to Pharmaceuticals |work=[[Forbes]] |date=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swarren"&gt;{{cite book |first=Steve |last=Warren |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s0jSxLqs-TwC&amp;pg=PT181&amp;lpg=PT181&amp;dq=cd+radio+david+margolese |title=Radio: The Book |publisher=[[Focal Press]] |year=2004 |p=166|isbn=9780240806969 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1990, Rothblatt's shell company, Satellite CD Radio, Inc., petitioned the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to assign new frequencies for satellites to broadcast digital sound to homes and cars.&lt;ref name="eandrews"/&gt; The company identified and argued in favor of the use of the [[S-band]] frequencies that the FCC subsequently decided to allocate to digital audio broadcasting. The [[National Association of Broadcasters]] contended that satellite radio would harm local radio stations.&lt;ref name="lbelsie"/&gt;

In April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as CEO of Satellite CD Radio;&lt;ref name="mherper"/&gt; former NASA engineer Robert Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-12310541.html |title=Robert Briskman appointed chairman and CEO |work=Satellite News |date=June 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmclean"&gt;{{cite news |first=Bethany |last=McLean |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2001/01/22/295563/index.htm |title=Satellite Killed The Radio Star| work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=January 22, 2001 |pp=94–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, [[Rogers Wireless]] co-founder David Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from [[Kazakhstan]] in July 2000.&lt;ref name="bmclean"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nancy |last=Dillon |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/beaming-radio-high-tech-fast-lane-article-1.875098 |title=Beaming Radio Into High-Tech Fast Lane |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=June 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher H. |last=Sterling |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z4XJQD4O_TkC&amp;pg=PA750&amp;lpg=PA750&amp;dq=sirius+name+change+orbital#v=onepage&amp;q=sirius%20name%20change%20orbital&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of Radio, Volume 1 |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |year=2003 |p=750|isbn=9780203484289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Romero |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/10/business/xm-satellite-radio-completes-its-financing.html |title=XM Satellite Radio Completes Its Financing |work=New York Times|date=July 10, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and "effectively created the industry," the FCC also sold a license to the American Mobile Radio Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Houpt |url=http://www.davidmargolese.com/pub/report-on-business-web.pdf |title=Radio Flyer |work=[[Report on Business]] |issue=September 2001 |pp=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which changed its name to [[XM Satellite Radio]] in October 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F98E7271A1EFA29&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=AMRC changes name to XM Satellite Radio |author=XM Satellite Radio |location=New York |publisher=BBC Archive |date=November 16, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; XM was founded by Lon Levin and [[Gary Parsons]], who served as chairman until November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Vince |last=Beiser |url=https://www.wired.com/science/space/magazine/15-11/ff_spacehotel?currentPage=4 |title=Hotel Biz Zillionaire’s Next Venture?

===Japan===
{{Main|MobaHo!}}
[[MobaHo!]] was a mobile satellite digital audio/video broadcasting service in [[Japan]] whose services began on October 20, 2004, and ended on March 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Conneally |url=http://betanews.com/2008/07/30/toshiba-to-shut-down-mobile-broadcast-tv-service/ |title=Toshiba to shut down mobile broadcast TV service |work=betanews.com |date=July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System design==
Satellite radio uses the 2.3&amp;nbsp;GHz [[S band]] in North America for nationwide digital radio broadcasting.&lt;ref name="csgnetwork.com"/&gt; MobaHO! operated at 2.6&amp;nbsp;GHz. In other parts of the world, satellite radio uses part of the 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz [[L band]] allocated for DAB.&lt;ref name="kbonsor"/&gt;

Satellite radio subscribers purchase a receiver and pay a monthly subscription fee to listen to programming. They can listen through built-in or portable receivers in automobiles; in the home and office with a portable or tabletop receiver equipped to connect the receiver to a stereo system; or on the Internet.&lt;ref name="shop.siriusxm.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shop.siriusxm.com/ |title=Sirius XM: Shop |website=Siriusxm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ground stations transmit signals to the satellites which are 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles) above the [[Equator]] in [[Geostationary orbit|Clarke belt]] orbits. The satellites send the signals back down to radio receivers in cars and homes. This signal contains scrambled broadcasts, along with meta data about each specific broadcast. The signals are unscrambled by the radio receiver modules, which display the broadcast information. In urban areas, ground repeaters enable signals to be available even if the satellite signal is blocked. The technology allows for nationwide broadcasting, so that, for instance US listeners can hear the same stations anywhere in the country.&lt;ref name="kbonsor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news |first=Kathleen |last=Kingsbury |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/07/30/satellite.radio/ |title=Satellite radio captures ears of millions |work=[[CNN]] |date=August 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content, availability and market penetration==
Satellite radio in the US offers commercial-free music stations, as well as news, sports, and talk, some of which include commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siriusxm.com/channellineup |title=Channel Lineup |website=Siriusxm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, satellite radio companies in the United States began providing background music to hotels, retail chains, restaurants, airlines and other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Bunkley |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/techinvestor/industry/2005-01-05-sat-radio-gains_x.htm |title=Satellite radio scores with exclusive programming, in-car deals |work=[[USA Today]] |date=January 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bfeder"&gt;{{cite news |first=Barnaby J. |last=Feder |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/16/business/technology-tuning-in-to-music-that-people-tune-out.html |title=Tuning In to Music That People Tune Out |work=New York Times |date=February 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 30, 2013, Sirius XM CEO Jim Meyer stated that the company would be pursuing opportunities over the next few years to provide in-car services through their existing satellites, including telematics (automated security and safety, such as stolen [[vehicle tracking system|vehicle tracking]] and roadside assistance) and entertainment (such as weather and gas prices).&lt;ref name="lbaker"&gt;{{cite news |first=Liana B. |last=Baker |url=https://news.yahoo.com/ceo-expand-sirius-beyond-satellite-radio-cars-182254828.html |title=New CEO to expand Sirius beyond satellite radio in cars |work=[[Reuters]] |date=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of Q3 2016, SiriusXM had 31 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Georg |last=Szalai |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sirius-xm-names-permanent-ceo-448969 |title=Sirius XM Names Jim Meyer Permanent CEO, Boosts Subs, Profit in First Quarter |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was primarily due to the company’s partnerships with automakers and car dealers. Roughly 60% of new cars sold come equipped with Sirius XM, and just under half of those units gain paid subscriptions.

==Satellite radio vs. other formats==
Satellite radio differs from [[AM broadcasting|AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio, and [[digital television radio]] (DTR) in the following ways (the table applies primarily to the United States):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Radio format !! Satellite radio !! [[AM broadcasting|AM]]/[[FM broadcasting|FM]] !! [[Digital television radio]] (DTR)
|-
| '''Monthly fees''' || US$10.99 and up || Free|| Free for terrestrial. Very low for [[cable television]] or satellite—DTR represents a small portion of the total monthly television fee.
|-
| '''Portability''' || Available || Prominent || None—a typical set consists of a stereo attached to a television [[set-top box]] (the primary function of the set top-box is normally designed for viewing digital television on an analogue set).
|-
|-
| '''Listening availability''' || Very high—a satellite signal's footprint covers millions of square kilometres. || Low to moderate—implementation of FM service requires moderate to high population densities and is thus not practical in rural and/or remote locales; AM travels great distances at night. || Very high
|-
| '''Sound quality''' || Varies² || AM: Usually very low &lt;br/&gt; FM: Usually Moderate, but can be very high || Varies²
|-
| '''Variety and depth of programming''' || Highest || Variable—highly dependent upon economic/demographic factors || Variable—dependent on location and the television providervfor cable and satellite, dependent on the various packages they provide and on the user's subscription.
|-
| '''Frequency of programming interruptions (by DJs or commercial advertising)³''' || None to high—mostly dependent on the channels, some of which have DJs; most channels are advertisement-free because of the paid subscription model of satellite radio. || Highest&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ||  None to low—dependent on the provider; however, it is common that some stations will have DJs. Usually no advertisements on subscription services ([[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] both claim to provide advertisement-free content).
|-
| '''Governmental regulation''' || Yes&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (minimal) || Yes—significant governmental regulations regarding content&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; || Yes for terrestrial. For cable and satellite, low to none &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

² The sound quality with both satellite radio providers and DTR providers varies with each channel. Some channels have near CD-quality audio, and others use low-bandwidth audio suitable only for speech. Since only a certain amount of bandwidth is available within the licenses available, adding more channels means that the quality on some channels must be reduced. Both the frequency response and the dynamic range of satellite channels can be superior to most, but not all AM or FM radio stations, as most AM and FM stations clip the audio peaks to sound louder; even the worst channels are still superior to most AM radios, but a very few AM tuners are equal to or better than the best FM or satellite broadcasts when tuned to a local station, even if not capable of stereo. The use of [[HD Radio]] technology can allow AM and FM broadcasts to exceed the quality of satellite. AM does not suffer from multipath distortion or flutter in a moving vehicle like FM, nor does it become silent as you go behind a big hill like satellite radio.

³ Some satellite radio services and DTR services act as ''in situ'' repeaters for local AM/FM stations and thus feature a high frequency of interruption.

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Nonprofit stations and public radio networks such as [[Public Radio International|PRI-affiliated]] stations and the [[BBC Radio|BBC]] are commercial-free. In the US, all stations are required to have periodic station identifications and public service announcements.

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; In the United States, the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulates technical broadcast spectrum only. Program content is unregulated. However, the FCC has tried in the past to expand its reach to regulate content to satellite radio and cable television, and its options are still open to attempt such in the future. The FCC does issue licenses to SiriusXM, the satellite radio provider, and controls who holds these licenses to broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erskine|first=Daniel H.|date=2007-05-20|title=Satellite Digital Audio Radio Searching for Novel Theories of Action|ssrn=987358|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their channels, including the pop music ones, are self-regulated.

&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Degree of content regulation varies by country; however, the majority of industrialized nations have regulations regarding obscene and/or objectionable content.

Based on the list in Dunn, Kawana, Brewer (2000).]]
{{International relations theory sidebar}}
In [[world-systems theory]], the '''semi-periphery countries''' (sometimes referred to as just '''the semi-periphery''') are the [[industrialization|industrializing]], mostly [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[country|countries]] which are positioned between [[periphery countries|the periphery]] and [[core countries]]. Semi-periphery countries have organizational characteristics of both core countries and periphery countries and are often geographically located between core and peripheral regions as well as between two or more competing core regions.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt; Semi-periphery regions play a major role in mediating economic, political, and social activities that link core and peripheral areas.&lt;ref name=chase&gt;Chase-Dunn and Thomas D. Hall.''The Seedbed of Change''.Chapter 5 of C.&lt;/ref&gt;

These regions allow for the possibility of innovative technology, reforms in social and organizational structure, and dominance over peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt; These changes can lead to a semi-periphery country being promoted to a core nation.&lt;ref name="chase"/&gt; Semi-periphery is, however, more than a description, as it also serves as a position within the world hierarchy in which social and economic change can be interpreted.&lt;ref name=terlouw&gt;Terlouw 1992 pg 136-145&lt;/ref&gt;

World-systems theory describes the semi-periphery as a key structural element in the world economy.&lt;ref name=waller&gt;Wallerstein 1976, pp. 229-233&lt;/ref&gt; The semi-periphery plays a vital role comparative to that of the role that Spain and Portugal played in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as intermediate trading groups within the European colonial empire.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt;

Today, the semi-periphery is generally industrialized.&lt;ref name=waller2&gt;Wallerstein 1974 Vol.3, No.4., pp 461-483&lt;/ref&gt; Semi-peripheral countries contribute to the manufacturing and exportation of a variety of goods.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; They are marked by above average land mass, as exemplified by Argentina, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, and [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; More land mass typically means an increased market size and share.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-peripheral nations are not all large though, as smaller countries such as [[Israel]], Poland, and Greece exist within the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

==Sociological theory==
Semi-peripheral countries offer their citizens relatively diverse economic opportunities but also have extreme gaps between the rich and poor. World-system theorists originally used only two categories: [[periphery countries]] and [[core countries]]. A need for an in between category became quickly apparent,&lt;ref name="Chirot"&gt;Chirot. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the establishment of the semi-periphery category for societies that have moved away from the periphery but have not become core. In other words, the category describes societies that remain dependent, and to some extent underdeveloped, despite having achieved significant levels of industrialization.&lt;ref name="Chirot"/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are tied into dynamic world systems that focus on the reliance of poor nations upon the wealthy, a concept known as the [[dependency theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Tausch A.&lt;/ref&gt; The term semi-periphery has been applied to countries that existed as early as in the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu&gt;Janet Abu-Lughod 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the creation of a semi-periphery category has added sociological and historical layers to previous developmental theories—yet it still has similar, inherently capitalist foundations.&lt;ref name="waller" /&gt;

===Function===
[[File:China fuels 1983.jpg|thumb|250px|Energy and mineral resources]]
The semi periphery is needed to stabilize the world system,&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; as it facilitates interaction and provides a connection between the low-income [[periphery countries|peripheral states]] and the high-income [[core countries|core states]] by adding another step in the world system hierarchy.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; As the middle ground, semi-peripheral countries display characteristics of both the [[Core countries|core]] and the [[Periphery countries|periphery]].&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; They also serve as a political buffer zone in that while they are exploited, they are also the exploiters.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; These areas have either been core regions in the past or formerly-peripheral areas that have since advanced in the world economy.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

Semi-peripheral nations are a necessary structural element in a world-trade system,&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; since such nations can serve to alleviate the political pressures that the core can exert upon the periphery and the political unrest that the periphery can direct back at the core.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; On the other hand, the semi-periphery can find itself excluded from the region's politics, as it lies just outside the bounds of political arena of the core states.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt;

The semi-periphery exists because it needs to divide the economic power between the core and the periphery. Semi-periphery, referred to as the middle class by Wallerstein, is what makes the capitalist world function because it is much like the sociological [[structural functionalism]] theory, where norms, customs, traditions, and institutions act as "organs" that work toward the proper functioning of the "body" as a whole. Without these industrializing countries, change will never reach the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Chirot, Daniel, and Thomas D. Hall. 1982. 8:81-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of their contribution to industry and economy, the contemporary semi-peripheral states are semi-industrialized.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are major exporters of minerals and agricultural goods. They are often focused in the manufacturing and exportation of industrial goods and commodities. While these advances separate the semi-periphery from the periphery, they lack the power and the economic dominance of core nations and still have a lot of un-managed poverty, placing them beneath the core.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are important contributors to the world economy because of the above reasons and because they tend to have above average land mass, meaning that they are host to an above average market.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; A primary example is China, a country with not only a large area but with a booming population.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt;

==History and development==

===13th century===
[[File:Silkroutes.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[silk road]] [[trade routes]] across [[Eurasia]]]]This era of human history found the semi-periphery concentrated in the area stretching from the Middle East to China, including India and the [[Mongol Empire]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; This was the first time in history that the peripheries and semi-peripheries of the world became connected and involved in the trade of the world, both with cores and with each other.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Through a lucrative trade system, including heavy taxing of goods traveling through their borders, they were able to maintain a steady stream of wealth, becoming the driving forces of economic change throughout this time period.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;  In addition, a heavy emphasis on defense and border security, particularly among the [[Mongols]], allowed them to be fairly impenetrable [[trade]] obstacles.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; [[Geography]] also played a role, as seen in India's development of an impressive [[maritime industry]].  Because of its position along a convenient route through the Indian Ocean, India established its role as a "hinge" between the [[East]] and [[West]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Through their positions within the world trade system, semi-peripheries in the Middle East became crucially important in connecting the cities of Chinese and Indian cores with the fledgling cities of Europe, as well as serving as key points between other, more major core cities in the region, such as [[Baghdad]], [[Cairo]], and [[Aden]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

Following increases in population and commerce in Western Europe in the thirteenth century, the [[feudal system]] met severe economic difficulties in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.&lt;ref name=halsall&gt;Halsall 1997, pp.14-19&lt;/ref&gt; This decline in development was caused by a combination of the decline in agricultural production, the shrinking economy that had already hit its peak within the current feudal structure, and the devastating effects of the [[Black Plague]] epidemic.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; The regression of Western Europe into the semi-periphery and periphery allowed for the rise of the trading powers of Italy, most notably [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; These Italian city-states took advantage of their established trade connections with the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Far East]], the Middle East, and the other Mediterranean powers to maintain their growth despite the economic failures of their European trade partners.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa and Venice had influence beyond their trade channels. Both were instrumental in the [[Crusades]] through their provisions of troops, transport vessels, and naval ships.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa also assisted the [[Byzantine Empire]] when it helped recapture the capital, [[Constantinople]], in the late thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; The Byzantine Empire took advantage of its strategic position along various trade routes and the decline of Western Europe to rise to [[Core countries|core]] status until its fall in 1453.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

During this time period, Genoa and Venice developed forms of [[laissez-faire]] government and institutions that are viewed as precursors to modern [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Despite these advances in influence and entrepreneurship, Genoa and Venice suffered from the crippling effects of the Black Plague, as much of the rest of Europe had before them.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Venice was able to survive due to its connection with the Southern trade route, though her strength was much reduced by the middle of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa never fully recovered from the [[Black Death]] and its defeat at the hands of Venice in the late fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; The decline of Genoa and the shift in Venice's focus to the [[Red Sea]] trade route left the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic open to Portugal and Spain, who were already better positioned geographically to control Atlantic trade routes.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

===1450–1700===
[[File:Spanish Empire Anachronous 0.PNG|thumb|460px|The areas of the world that at one time were territories of the Spanish Empire.]]
  
In a push to ensure stable economic growth, Europe turned to a capitalistic economy in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries to replace the failed feudal system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Modern capitalism allowed for economies to extend beyond geographical and political boundaries, leading to the formation of the first worldwide economic system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; At the base of this world system was an [[international division of labor]] that determined countries' relationships and placement within the categories of the world system: core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The core regions, most notably the countries of Northwestern Europe like England, France, and the [[Netherlands]], gained the most from the world economy.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Their ascension from previous peripheral and semi-peripheral status to the core was driven by the development of strong central government and military power, the combination of which made possible control of international commerce and exploitation of colonial possessions.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

At the other end of the spectrum was the periphery, marked by lack of central government, exportation of raw materials to the core, and exploitive labor practices.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; In this time period, especially toward the end of the 17th century, South America and parts of North America stood out as peripheral zones under the control and capitalistic exploitation of core countries in Europe.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; [[Slaves]] and indigenous workers in these regions developed [[raw materials]] for export to Europe, a distinctive characteristic of the new capitalism, as goods were no longer produced solely for internal consumption.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The [[aristocracy]] of these regions controlled commerce and became wealthy through the new world economy, leading to their rise in power above the government.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Even in periods of upheaval, local aristocrats were able to rely on core European powers to assist in keeping control over the economic system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

In between the core and periphery was the semi-periphery, which constituted both previous core regions that had declined, like Italy, Spain and Portugal, and peripheries that had improved their position, like southern Germany and southern France.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Spain and Portugal had taken advantage of the opening to Atlantic control left by the decline of Italian powers like Genoa and Venice.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Much like the core European powers, Spain and Portugal had strong navies and expansive colonial domains, which they exploited for their natural resources and cheap labor.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Rather than using the increased wealth to develop strong domestic [[manufacturing]] sectors, as other Western European powers did, Spain and Portugal used imported gold and silver to obtain manufactured goods from the core countries, relegating them to semi-periphery instead of core status.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; So, while they had control over several peripheral regions and exploited them, a characteristic of a core region, these countries failed to develop the quality manufacturing industries and the access to international banking that further defined core countries, leaving them a step below in the world system at semi-periphery status.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

===1700–1875===
[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|300px|thumb|As the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged ahead of other economies]]
The development of trade between Europe, the Americas, and the East generated massive profits for a relatively small [[merchant]] elite in the European colonial powers.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; These merchants were able to utilize their profits to take control of [[agriculture]] and other industries.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The merchant class further consolidated its power by extending control over internal markets and the prices of finished goods.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The end result was the development of the necessary capital to [[industrialize]] the European core states.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

This era was defined by the transition from agriculture to [[industrialization]].&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The rapid development of industry triggered several reactions. Many European states explored new territories in addition to their original colonial holdings for new markets to exploit.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The European world system continued to expand and include more regions, as it absorbed the Indian Ocean economic system through the acquisition of colonies by Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, among others.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Previously isolated regions, like much of the American interior zone, joined newly independent South American countries in becoming part of the periphery.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; By the nineteenth century, Asia and Africa had also entered the world system as peripheral regions.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; This development of Africa and Asia as peripheral continents allowed for new cores like the United States and Germany to improve their core status, rising higher within the world system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

Throughout this time period was a constant shift within core regions from a combination of agriculture and industry to solely industrial enterprise.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; In this period, England was the leader in industrial and agricultural production, though by 1900, only ten percent of England's populace worked in agriculture, demonstrating the shift to industry not only in England but across the core stratum.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The dramatic shift to industry extended beyond the core by the end of this time period, as core regions encouraged the development of [[manufacturing]] in peripheral and semi-peripheral zones to further develop those markets and create demand for newly developed machines and other goods.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

===1875–1914===
[[File:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|thumb|A ration party of the Royal Irish Rifles in a communication trench.]] The [[West]] represented both the core and the semi-periphery, as Europe dominated 80% of the world's market share.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"&gt;Hobsbawn, Eric. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the rest of the world was a diverse periphery, though Japan was a notable exception.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; As expansionism continued, new core nations emerged, such as the Britain, Germany, and the United States, while old cores such as Spain and Portugal faded to the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; The growth of the power of the common man led to an expansion of thought concerning democracy, communism, and revolution, which pervaded the weaker semi-peripheral nations overcome with civil distress.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; In some cases, this led to the weakening of the nations, such as the violent revolution in France.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; This contributed to the adoption of totalitarian leaders, as seen in Germany and France.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; The major factors contributing to world war were the conflicts and power struggles taking place between the three classes of nations in the global system.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; Nations considered part of the semi-periphery felt oppressed by the stronger, larger core nations.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt;

This trend known to continued throughout the century, with Germany, Russia, and Japan also taking seats at the core. At the end of World War II however, Germany quickly fell to the [[semi-periphery]] along with war-ravaged France. As the rest of Europe struggled to rebuild itself, it also fell to the [[semi-periphery]], with the exception of many [[Eastern European]] nations, who fell under the Soviet Union as bloc countries. Japan also fell back into semi-periphery, along with the industrializing China and India, until their recent upswing in influence. Change also came to North America, where [[American imperialism]] led to the rise of countries like [[Guatemala]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. On the other side of the Pacific, Australia was also developing, helping to secure an Allied Victory in World War II.

In today's global hierarchy, some states are transitioning upward while others are moving downward in terms of status and influence. Former colonial powers no longer exercise control over an international domain and are instead mostly relegated to their core; for example, former European world powers do not exert influence over colonial outposts in the [[Americas]], Africa, or Asia, but rather have consolidated their power in the form of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;Shaw, Timothy M. ''The Review of Black Political Economy'': pp. 341-358.
[http://www.springerlink.com/content/2118h2x63n84u170/]&lt;/ref&gt; The new leading powers are mostly non-European (United States, Canada, Japan). Outside of these developed countries are countries (see list below) that are considered semi-periphery and are both dominant and dominated within economic, political, and social realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morales Ruvalcaba|first1=Daniel Efrén|title=INSIDE THE BRIC: ANALYSIS OF THE SEMIPERIPHERAL NATURE OF BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA|journal=Austral: Brazilian Journal of Strategy &amp; International Relations|date=11 September 2013|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://seer.ufrgs.br/index.php/austral/article/view/40942/26976|language=es|issn=2238-6912}}&lt;/ref&gt; These middle powers are a combination of nations that have emerged as a result of the fragmentation of the Soviet Union and nations that have risen because of their possession of resources in high demand, like oil in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; While these nations are by no means on the level of the stated world powers, they are able to exert influence over the weaker nations of the impoverished [[Fourth World]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

Other terms used to describe semi-periphery countries include sub-imperial and semi-industrial.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] identifies three ways by which countries can emerge from the periphery into the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Countries with a large market and room for industrial growth, like [[Brazil]], South Africa, and Mexico, and countries with valuable energy resources, like [[Iran]] and Saudi Arabia, can utilize the strategy of seizing the chance.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; The strategy of promotion by invitation can be utilized by countries willing to be open to foreign governmental and regional administrative centers.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Examples of past countries to utilize this strategy are the capitalist regimes in Africa like [[Egypt]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Zaire]], [[Senegal]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; These countries use [[dependency theory|dependent development]] to integrate into the world economy and establish local dominance.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Outside of these strategies is that of self-reliance, a basic theory that as some countries grow, others will decline.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Many countries in Africa and South America have exhibited the qualities of a sub-imperial or semi-industrial power.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

Wallerstein examines the role of semi-periphery countries during a period of economic downturn.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; To redefine core and periphery countries in an economic sense, core countries are characterized by advanced technology, high [[Profit (economics)|profits]], high wages, and diversified production while periphery countries have less technology, low profits, low wages, and less diversified production.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-periphery countries fall in the middle of these spectra, and their unique political and social structure place them in a position where they can best take advantage of economic downturns.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

These economic downturns occur because of increased [[supply (economics)|supply]] and decreased [[demand]], which combine to create a shift in surplus and power to the semi-periphery. Semi-periphery regions take advantage of the situation by expanding control of their home markets and the surrounding periphery countries at the expense of core countries.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; The underlying reason for this shift in power lies in the basic economic principle of [[scarcity]]. As long as core countries maintain scarcities of their goods, they can select customers from semi-periphery and periphery countries that are competing over them. When excess supply occurs, the core countries are the ones competing over a smaller market. This competition allows semi-peripheral nations to select from among core countries rather than vice versa when making decisions about commodity purchases, manufacturing investments, and sales of goods, shifting the balance of power to the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; While in general there is a power shift from core to semi-periphery in times of economic struggles, there are few examples of semi-peripheral countries transitioning to core status.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; To accomplish this, semi-peripheral nations must not only take advantage of weaker core countries but must also exploit any existing advantages over other semi-peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; How well they exploit these advantages determines their arrangement within the semi-periphery class.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

[[File:Election MG 3455.JPG|thumb|A ballot box]]
The semi-peripheral nations of the world have played an important role to world trade and interaction since early periods of globalized trade. This "middle ground" between the very powerful [[Core countries|cores]] and the backwaters of the far [[Periphery countries|periphery]] allowed those two zones to interact with greater ease. For example, during the [[Pax Mongolica|13th-century world system]], the semi-periphery areas around Europe's Mediterranean Coast facilitated trade between the peripheries of the more manufacturing based [[Flanders|Northern Europe]] and the cores of India and China.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; John Markoff, a [[sociology|sociologist]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], also notes that political developments, particularly in the advancement of [[democracy]], originate in the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="Markoff"/&gt; He notes that innovations in democracy came from the semi-periphery rather than the more established, stable [[First World|core nations]], where profit discourages great reform, or the extremely poor [[Third World|periphery]] where instability makes reform too dangerous to attempt.&lt;ref name="Markoff"/&gt; It has been within semi-peripheral nations where democratic reforms like the expansion of suffrage and the institution of the secret ballot have been implemented.&lt;ref name="Markoff"&gt;Markoff, John. 1999-1041:4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Flattery Show''''' was the first [[English-language radio]] [[chat show]] aired in the south west of [[France]] and a flagship Sunday evening programme broadcast on [[Radio Coteaux]] in the [[Gascony]] region. The show was presented by Irish radio presenter John Slattery with American co-host Patricia McKinnes. It ran for twenty-one weeks and proved to be very popular with expatriates living in France.

==The show==

Slattery and McKinnes regularly began the show at 5pm and finished at 7pm with a handover to Patrick Martinez. ''The Flattery Show'' was a music-based programme that included light-hearted banter and whimsical jokes by the hosts. Listeners' views and comments were discussed and there were rotating segments such as "Song of The Week", "Ask a Frenchie" and "Life in the South-West". To keep listeners on their toes, random topics were picked from a big "Bag O' Topics".

==Invited guests==

The show ran interviews with regular and/or rotating guests, dealing with subjects of both local interest and of general interest to the [[expatriate]] community. The first people to be interviewed on the show were the English sisters Marcha King and Sian Cash, former proprietors of the landmark café "Bar Memory" in the [[Hautes-Pyrénées]] town of [[Castelnau-Magnoac]]. They recounted humorous stories of their years behind the bar at the French café. The interview proved enormously popular with English-speaking listeners in France and it served to create a pattern of jesting and buffoonery that would become an underlying trait of later interviews.

==Regular contributors==

The show relied heavily on e-mailed material sent in by listeners that was then read out on air. Most of the regular contributors were local expatriates living in the Gascony region.

==The end==

The show ran for twenty-one weeks in the early months of 2011. When it ceased, Radio Coteaux's Sunday evening slot was filled by a new show called ''[[The Gascony Show]]'', also hosted by John Slattery.

'''The World''' or '''The World Islands, located in Dubai,''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: جزر العالم; ''Juzur al-Ālam'') is an [[Artificial island|artificial]] [[archipelago]] of various small [[island]]s constructed in the rough shape of a [[world map]], located in the waters of the [[Persian Gulf]], {{Convert|4.0|km|mi}} off the coast of [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref name="Progress Update"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ameinfo.com/133896.html |publisher=''[[AMEInfo]]'' |title=Dubai's Palm and World Islands - progress update |date=2007-10-04 |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011022845/http://www.ameinfo.com/133896.html |archivedate=2007-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The World islands are composed mainly of sand [[dredging|dredged]] from Dubai's shallow coastal waters, and are one of several [[artificial island]] developments in Dubai.&lt;ref name="Progress Update"/&gt; The World's developer is [[Nakheel Properties]], and the project was originally conceived by [[Sheikh]] [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], the ruler of Dubai. The actual construction was done by two Dutch (joint venture) specialist companies, Van Oord and Boskalis. The same companies also created the [[Palm Jumeirah]].

Construction of the 300 islands began in 2003, only to halt due to the [[2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Sinking"&gt;{{cite news|title='The World' is sinking|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/international/4594274/The-World-is-sinking|accessdate=28 January 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though 60 percent of the islands had been sold off to private contractors back in 2008, development on most of these islands has failed to initiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schaffer|first1=Sierra|title=The "World" Is Sinking Back Into The Sea, Dubai's World Islands That Is – TechMalak|url=https://www.techmalak.com/the-world-is-sinking-back-into-the-sea-dubais-world-that-is/#.WS2awHXyukA|work=TechMalak|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2012, the Lebanon Island was developed and was the only island that had so far been developed commercially, being used for private corporate events and public parties. As of late 2013, only two of the islands had been developed. In January 2014, Kleindienst Group announced the launch of "The Heart of Europe" project;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jk-properties.com/newsletters/january2014/ |title= KLEINDIENST GROUP LAUNCHES ICONIC THE HEART OF EUROPE PROJECT|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= January 2014 |publisher= JK Properties |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by February 2014, one of Kleindienst Group's brands - JK Properties - announced in their monthly newsletter that the project was "well underway".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jk-properties.com/newsletters/february2014/ |title= WORK CONTINUES TO PROGRESS AT A PACE ON THE HEART OF EUROPE  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= February 2014  |publisher= JK Properties |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these series of islands will be Europe, Sweden and Germany with development led by Kleindienst Group.

==Project==
Islands in the project range from {{convert|14000|to|42000|m2|sqft}} in area.&lt;ref name="Progress Update"/&gt; Distances between islands average {{convert|100|m|ft}}; they are constructed from {{convert|321,000,000|m3|abbr=out}} of sand and 386 million tons of rock.&lt;ref name="Progress Update"/&gt; Designed by [[Creative Kingdom Dubai]], the development is an area that covers {{convert|6|by|9|km|mi}} and is surrounded by an oval-shaped [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] island. Roughly {{convert|232|km|abbr=on}} of shoreline was created. The World's overall development costs were estimated at $13 billion [[Canadian Dollar|CAD]] in 2005.

The archipelago consists of seven sets of islands; [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Antarctica]], and [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="Atlas Obscura 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=The World Islands | website=Atlas Obscura | date=September 26, 2016 | url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-islands | access-date=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each artificial islands are named for their representative regions, including those representing [[countries]], [[landmarks]], and [[regions]] such as the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|186483481|United Kingdom}} {{coord|25.22334|N|55.15937|E|format=dec|name=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|r|2713321|California|tools=short}} {{coord|25.20300|N|55.14376|E|format=dec|name=California}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Everest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|87185503|Mount Everest}} {{coord|25.23683|N|55.17535|E|format=dec|name=Mount Everest}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|87185938|Australia}} {{coord|25.23149|N|55.19435|E|format=dec|name=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|r|8402261|New Mexico}} {{coord|25.201379|N|55.151797|E|format=dec|name=New Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Upernavik]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|87184344|Upernavik}} {{coord|25.22142|N|55.13939|E|format=dec|name=Upernavik}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|202033673|Buenos Aires}} {{coord|25.20106|N|55.1695|E|format=dec|name=Buenos Aires}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|87184265|New York}} {{coord|25.21421|N|55.15101|E|format=dec|name=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|r|8402263|Mexico}} {{coord|25.201824|N|55.154394|E|format=dec|name=Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Petersburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|200489433|St. Petersburg}} {{coord|25.23475|N|55.16479|E|format=dec|name=St. Petersburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|170773643|India}} {{coord|25.23110|N|55.1796|E|format=dec|name=India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The project was unveiled in May 2003 by Sheikh Mohammed&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/507983-the-world-islands-in-dubai-completed |publisher=''ArabianBusiness.com'' |title=The World islands in Dubai complete |date=2008-01-10 |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dredging began four months later in September 2003.&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt;  By January 2008, 60% of the islands were sold, 20 of which were bought in the first four months of 2007.&lt;ref name="Progress Update"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt;  On 10 January 2008 the final stone on the breakwater was laid, completing development of the archipelago.&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt; As of July 2012, a second island, the Lebanon Island was developed and was 'the only island that has so far been developed commercially, is used for private corporate events and public parties.' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/the-world-is-back-on-dubais-map|title=The World is back on Dubai's map|author=Colin Simpson|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project difficulties==
[[The Times]] Online reported in September 2009 that work on The World had been suspended due to the effects of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|global financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="creditcrunch"&gt;{{cite  news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/news/article6831481.ece|title=Credit crunch signals end of The World for Dubai’s multi-billion dollar property deal|publisher=Times Online UK|date=September 12, 2009|accessdate=2009-11-28 | location=London | first=James | last=McLean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="darkside"&gt;{{cite news

And in February 2010 the [[Daily Mail]] reported that the islands had started sinking back into the sea.&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the denial, [[The Daily Telegraph]] reported in January 2011 that an independent company, Penguin Marine, provided verification on the erosion of the islands and the silting of the passageways between the islands.&lt;ref name=Penguin&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/dubai/8271643/The-World-is-sinking-Dubai-islands-falling-into-the-sea.html

|last=Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to finance and technical problems, Penguin Marine, the company contracted to provide transportation to the archipelago, is attempting to get out of the annual fees of $1.6 million paid to Nakheel properties.&lt;ref name =Penguin/&gt;

As of early 2011, only one of the islands had been occupied by a building (a show home) on it,&lt;ref name=Sinking/&gt; and commercial or residential properties were not currently being constructed on any of the other islands. Property prices in the Emirates had fallen 58 percent from their peak in the fourth quarter of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The End of The World|url=http://english.kompas.com/read/2011/01/23/03401537/The.End.of.The.World|work=Kompas.com|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The world economic recovery from the [[Great Recession]] has resulted in a rebound for the Dubai real estate market: it has been reported that "residential prices [in Dubai] rose by 17.9% from August 2012 to 2013, while rents soared by 14.9% in the same period." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jk-properties.com/newsletters/november2013/|title=JK Properties Monthly Newsletter (Nov. 2013) "A BRIGHT OUTLOOK FOR DUBAI’S PROPERTY MARKET" |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 2013 |publisher=JK Properties |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World was supposed to be serviced by four major transportation hubs linked by waterways. Land parcels are supposedly zoned for various uses: estate, mid density, high density, resorts and commercial.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.ae/videoGallery.html | title=The World Video Gallery|author=Nakheel}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Dubai Infinity Holdings construction planner has stated that developers have been negotiating with Nakheel about temporary siting of a cement batching plant on one of the islands to supply subdivided construction.&lt;ref name="national3quarters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/property/the-world-three-quarters-sold-out|title=‘The World’ three-quarters sold out|author=The National Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan was for utilities to be routed under water, with water plants at each of the hubs pumping fresh water to the islands. Power was to be supplied by the Dubai Grid and distributed through underwater cables, however as of February 2015 no cables had been laid, so that developers currently have to provide their own power from diesel generators. Waste water and refuse systems are an individual concern for each island.&lt;ref name="video"/&gt;

Nakheel Group is itself further developing a resort named Coral Island over 20 islands that make up the North American part of The World. The low-rise development will include a marina and hotel village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uaeinteract.com/docs/Nakheel_unveils_super-luxury_resort_at_Coral_Island_of_The_World/25125.htm|title=Nakheel unveils super-luxury resort at Coral Island of The World |date=2007-03-05|publisher=National Media Council UAE|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second largest confirmed development is the purchase of 14 islands that make up Australia and New Zealand by Investment Dar of [[Kuwait]].  The islands are being [[terraforming|terraformed]] to be developed as a resort named [[OQYANA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiatraveltips.com/news05/134-TheWorld.shtml|title=Nakheel sells Australasia segment of The World|date=2005-04-13|publisher=AsiaTravelTips.com|accessdate=2006-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish business consortium Larionovo had plans to develop the [[Ireland]] island into an Irish-themed resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theislandofireland.com/|title=The Island of Ireland|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans include a large internal marina, apartments and villas, a gym, hotel, and an Irish-themed pub. In July 2007 it was announced that the Ireland Island would feature a recreation of [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Giant's Causeway]]. However, on 25 November 2008 a provisional liquidator was appointed to Larionovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands of [[Great Britain]] and [[Moscow]] on The World were acquired by Premier Real Estate Bureau in the Summer of 2008. News was leaked in a [[Daily Mail]] article of January 2009, refuting claims that Great Britain was owned by [[Richard Branson]], [[Rod Stewart]] or John O'Dolan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Homesick Balham boy buys Britain-shaped island for £43m |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1120695/Homesick-Balham-boy-buys-Britain-shaped-island-43m--8211-London-pub.html |publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=2009-04-08 | first=Martin | last=Delgado | date=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, Salya Corporation announced that it had acquired the islands of Finland and Brunei in The World and planned to develop them into fashion-themed resorts. Salya spent about [[United Arab Emirates dirham|Dh]]800 million ($218 million USD) to purchase the islands and plans to spend a further Dh2.4 billion ($654 million USD) on development. Brunei Island will be turned into a [[Fashion TV]] resort and Finland Island will be turned into a fashion community called FTV palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World's Finland and Brunei to be hub of fashion |url=http://www.business24-7.ae/articles/2008/4/pages/worldhub.aspx |publisher=Emirates Business 24/7 |date=2008-04-24 |accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Time–space compression''' (also known as '''space–time compression''' and '''time–space distantiation'''), articulated in 1989 by geographer [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] in ''The Condition of [[Postmodernity]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David. ''The Condition of Postmodernity: An Enquiry into the Origins of Cultural Change''. Cambridge, MA: Blackwell, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; it refers to anything that impacts time and space. Harvey's idea was rooted in Karl Marx's theory of the "annihilation of time and space". A similar idea was proposed by [[Elmar Alvater]] in an article in ''[[PROKLA]]'' in 1987 translated into English as "Ecological and Economic Modalities of Time and Space" and published in ''[[Capitalism Nature Socialism]]'', 1(3) in 1989.

Time–space compression often occurs as a result of technological innovations including technology of communication and economics. 

According to theorists like [[Paul Virilio]], time-space compression is an essential facet of contemporary life: "Today we are entering a space which is speed-space ... This new other time is that of electronic transmission, of high-tech machines, and therefore, man is present in this sort of time, not via his physical presence, but via programming" (qtd. in ''Decron'' 71&lt;ref&gt;Decron, Chris. ''Speed-Space.''  Virilio Live. Ed. John Armitage. London: Sage, 2001. 69–81.&lt;/ref&gt;). In ''"Vitesse et Politique"'', Virilio  coins the term '''dromology''' to describe "speed-space." Virilio describes velocity as the hidden side of wealth and power, which represents a determining factor concerning societies' structures. Historical eras and political events, out of this perspective, are also speed-ratios. In his view, acceleration destroys space and compresses the time in ways of perceiving reality.

[[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]] maintains this idea about time-space compression in her discussion of globalization and its effect on our society. Similar to Virilio, she states that because our world is "speeding up" and "spreading out", time-space compression is more prevalent than ever as [[internationalization]] takes place. Cultures and communities are merged during time-space compression due to rapid growth and change, as "layers upon layers" of histories fuse together to shift our ideas of what the identity of a "place" should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Massey|first1=Doreen |authorlink=Doreen Massey (geographer)|chapter=A Global Sense of Place|title=Space, Place, and Gender|date=1994 |ISBN= 0816626162|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists generally identify two historical periods in which time–space compression occurred; the period from the mid-19th century to the beginnings of the [[First World War]], and the end of the 20th century. In both of these time periods, according to Jon May and Nigel Thrift, "there occurred a radical restructuring in the nature and experience of both time and space ... both periods saw a significant acceleration in the pace of life concomitant with a dissolution or collapse of traditional spatial co-ordinates".&lt;ref&gt;May, Jon and [[Nigel Thrift]]. "Introduction." ''TimeSpace: Geographies of Temporality''. NY: Routledge, 2001. pp.&amp;nbsp;1–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

For [[Moishe Postone]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Postone, Moishe]]. "Theorizing the Contemporary World: Robert Brenner, Giovanni Arrighi, David Harvey" in ''Political Economy of the Present and Possible Global Future(s)'', Anthem Press&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey's treatment of space-time compression and postmodern diversity are as merely reactions to [[capitalism]].  Hence Harvey's analysis remains "extrinsic to the [[social form]]s expressed" by the deep structure concepts of capital, value and the [[commodity]].

For Postone the postmodern moment is not necessarily just a one-sided effect of the contemporary form of capitalism but can also be seen as having an emancipatory side if it happened to be part of a post-capitalism.  And because postmodernism usually neglects its own context of embeddedness it can legitimate capitalism as postmodern, whereas at the level of deep structure it may in fact be more concentrated, with large capitals that, accumulate rather than diverge, and with an expansion of commodification niches with fewer buyers.

Postone asserts one cannot step outside capitalism and declare it a pure evil, or as a one-dimensional badness.  For Postone, the [[emancipatory]] content of such things as equal distribution or diversity are potentials of capitalism itself in its abundant and diverse productive powers.  It misfires however, when a form of life such as postmodernism takes itself for being the whole when in fact it is just another appearance of the same capitalist essence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3319">'''Transnational organization''' is a term used in scholarly literature. It refers to [[international organization]]s (usually, [[international nongovernmental organization]]s) that "transcend" the idea of a [[nation-state]].

The distinction between an international and a '''transnational organization''' is unclear and has been criticized by some scholars (ex. Colás, 2002).

Transnational relations have been defined as “contacts, coalitions, and interactions across state boundaries that are not controlled by the central foreign policy organs of governments.”  Examples of transnational entities are “multinational business enterprises and revolutionary movements; trade unions and scientific networks; international air transport cartels and communications activities in outer space.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nye, Jr.|first=Joseph S.|author2=Robert O.

Similarly, an organization will be called "international" rather than "national" only if the control of the organization is explicitly shared among representatives of two or more nationalities. And an organization is "multinational" rather than "national" only if people from two or more nationalities participate significantly in its operation.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|title=Transnational Organizations in World Politics|journal=World Politics|year=1973|volume=25|issue=3|jstor=2010115|page=336|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Transnational organizations are designed to facilitate the pursuit of a single interest within many national units.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|title=Transnational Organizations in World Politics|journal=World Politics|year=1973|volume=25|issue=3|jstor=2010115|page=338|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voice of America Bethany Relay Station.jpg|thumb|250px|The National Voice of America Museum of Broadcasting is the main building and campus of the original VOA, Bethany Relay Station.]]
'''The [[Voice of America]]'s Bethany Relay Station''' was located in [[Butler County, Ohio]]'s [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|Union Township]] about 25 miles (40&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], adjacent to the transmitter site of [[WLW]]. Starting in 1944 during [[World War II]] it transmitted American radio programming abroad on [[shortwave]] frequencies, using 200,000-watt transmitters built by [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation|Crosley]] engineers under the direction of R.J. Rockwell. The site was developed to provide 'fallback' transmission facilities inland and away from the East Coast, where transmitters were located in Massachusetts, on Long Island in New York, and in New Jersey, all close to the ocean, subject to attack from German submarines or other invading forces.

Programming originated from studios in New York until 1954, when VOA headquarters moved to Washington.

The station operated until 1994. The facility took its name from the [[Liberty Township, Butler County, Ohio|Liberty Township]] community of [[Bethany, Ohio|Bethany]], which was about two miles north of the facility.

==History==
In 1943, the United States government bought nearly all of [[section (land)|Section]] 12 of Township 3, Range 2 of the [[Symmes Purchase]], the northeasternmost section of Union Township. From Hazel Beckley, 170 acres (688,000 m²) were purchased; from Philip Condon, 143 acres (579,000 m²); from Lola Gray Coy, 100 acres (405,000 m²); from John Miller, 69 acres (279,000 m²); and from Suzie Steinman, 142 acres (575,000 m²). The site was chosen for its elevation and its shallow bedrock and is today bounded by Tylersville Road on the south, Cox Road to the west, Liberty Way to the north, and [[Butler County, Ohio|Butler]]-[[Warren County, Ohio|Warren]] Road.

The transmitters were built by [[Powel Crosley Jr.]]'s [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] about one mile west of the company's tower for [[WLW-AM]] in [[Mason, Ohio|Mason]]. The [[Office of War Information]] began broadcasting in July 1944 and [[Adolf Hitler]] is said to have denounced the "Cincinnati liars". Following the war, with the OWI abolished, the facility was taken over by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] in 1945. It became part of the newly created [[United States Information Agency]] in 1953. The Crosley Broadcasting Corporation operated the facility for the government until November 1963, when the Voice of America assumed direct control.

At its peak the facility had six transmitters broadcasting with 250&amp;nbsp;kW and two transmitting with 50&amp;nbsp;kW.

The facility was closed on November 14, 1994; because of changing technologies, the transmissions shifted to [[satellite]]s. The towers were brought down from December 1997 to February 1998.

==Post-closing use==
Most of the land was turned over to the [[Butler County, Ohio|county]] and [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|township]] for use as a [[park]].

Part in the southwest corner was sold to developers who have erected a shopping center called the Voice of America Centre.

The [[Miami University Voice of America Learning Center]] opened on the site in January 2009.

==National Voice of America Museum of Broadcasting==
The 30,000 sq. ft. former Bethany Station building at 8070 Tylersville Road is being transformed into the National Voice of America Museum of Broadcasting, a historical center about the history of The Voice of America, radio and television.

Using a blueprint developed by Jack Rouse Associates, the facility features displays and interactive experiences that relate the story of the Voice of America and incorporate other related collections from Media Heritage and the Gray History of Wireless Museum in [[Cincinnati]].

Displays include the radio station control room, re-creations of radio and television studios from the 1920s through the present, [[Old-time radio]] memorabilia and from the early days of television, and displays about area pioneers in the development of radio technology.

An amateur radio club West Chester Amateur Radio Association, also operates a station using the callsign WC8VOA.

The '''WBSC World Rankings''' is a ranking system for [[National sports team|national teams]] in [[baseball]] and [[softball]]. The teams of the member nations of the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]] (WBSC), baseball's world governing body, are ranked based on their tournament results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. A point system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of WBSC-recognized international tournaments. Under the existing system, rankings are based on a team's performance over the last four years, with major international tournaments awarded a higher weighting compared to minor international and continental tournaments.

== History ==
In January 2009, the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF) first published a listing in rank order of its member associations to provide a basis for comparison of the relative strengths of these teams. Though primarily focused on the respective men's senior teams of member nations, the current ranks also include points awarded based on results at the IBAF [[World Junior Baseball Championship|'AAA' (Under 18) Junior]] and [[World Youth Baseball Championship|'AA' (Under 16) Youth Championships]] held during the tracking period. Beginning in 2015, the rankings also determine which twelve teams participate in the [[WBSC Premier12]] tournament.

The initial women's baseball rankings were based upon results from past [[Women's Baseball World Cup]]s. While the calculations of the women's rankings are similar to that of the men's, one main difference is that they are inclusive of the three most recent IBAF Women's Baseball World Cups whereas the men's rankings only include the last two. Points are weighted in favor of the more recent results.&lt;ref name="ibaf women's rankings"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibaf.org/index.php?id=10&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=311&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=9&amp;cHash=e4d61fbf48 | title=IBAF Releases First-Ever Women’s World Rankings | date=13 August 2009 | accessdate=13 August 2009 | publisher=International Baseball Federation | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sBX8m4lp?url=http://www.ibaf.org/en/article-detail.aspx?id=7cdb8cdb-525d-4501-8f40-2d59622392e6 | archivedate=23 August 2010 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Softball rankings==
In the wake of the [[International Olympic Committee]]'s decision to cut baseball from the [[2012 Olympics]] program, the IBAF pushed the growth of women's baseball as to include a women's component in its bid for a reinstatement of the sport in future Olympics. The effort to unify the sports resulted in the merger of the IBAF with the [[International Softball Federation]] in 2013 to create the WBSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABOUT THE WORLD BASEBALL SOFTBALL CONFEDERATION|url=http://wbsc.org/en/about|publisher=[[World Baseball Softball Confederation]]|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the WBSC is also responsible for ranking international men's and women's softball teams.&lt;ref name="sb2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=WBSC launches first-ever Softball World Rankings: Japan Women’s No. 1, New Zealand Men’s No. 1|url=http://www.mister-baseball.com/wbsc-launches-firstever-softball-world-rankings-japan-womens-1-zealand-mens-1/|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=Mister Baseball|date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation method ==
{{Update|section|inaccurate=yes|date=March 2016}}
Under the current system used, points are awarded to member nations based purely on their final position in recognised international tournaments.{{IBAF World Rankings ref/Notes}} This is opposed to other international sports ranking systems such as the [[ICC Test Championship]] for [[cricket]], that is based on both individual matches and the results of series, or the [[FIFA World Rankings]] for [[association football|football]], that is based solely on individual matches.

Points are awarded according to the following table:
{| class="wikitable" style="font-size: 90%; text-align:center;"
|-
! Final position !! Points awarded
|-
| 1st || '''50'''
|-
| 2nd || '''40'''
|-
| 3rd || '''30'''
|-
| 4th || '''15'''
|-
| 5th – 2nd-last{{ref| *|*}} || Spread evenly between '''15''' &amp; '''1'''
|-
| Last{{ref| *|*}} || '''1'''
|}
{{refbegin}}
''{{note|*|*}}'' - If more than 32 teams compete, points are only awarded to the first 32 teams. (i.e. the spread is from 5th - 31st, Last gets 1 point.)
{{refend}}

The points awarded after 4th place are spread evenly in an attempt to ensure balance between tournaments with different-sized fields: finishing 6th out of 20 teams is considered to be a higher accomplishment than finishing 6th out of 8 teams. Given that points are not fixed beyond 4th place, a calculation is used to determine how many points are awarded to each position. The calculation gives the difference between any two consecutive positions from 4th through to last (e.g. 4th and 5th, 7th and 8th, 21st and 22nd, etc.). The calculation is:

:&lt;math&gt;Points\ difference\ = \frac{14}{No\ of\ teams\ -\ 4}&lt;/math&gt;

This is illustrated in the following table:
{| class="wikitable" style="font-size: 90%; text-align:center;"
|-
! Number of teams !! Points difference !! 4th !! 5th !! 2nd-Last !! Last
|-
| 6 || 7 || rowspan=5 | 15 || colspan=2 | 8 || rowspan=5 | 1
|-
| 8 || 3 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 11 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 4 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| 12 || 1 &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; || 13 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; || 2 &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| 16 || 1 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; || 13 &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; || 2 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| 32 || &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 14 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

A multiplier is used in awarding points, based on the prestige of the tournament and the quality of the teams involved. The table below reflects the changes in the international baseball schedule recently approved by the WBSC. Below are the multipliers that will be used beginning in 2012.

[[World Baseball Classic]]            6x  (Winner receives 50 points, multiplied by 6 for a total of 300 points)

Premier 12                                  6x

WBC Qualifiers                          *    (Pool winner receives 50 points, 2nd – 40 pts, 3rd – 30 pts, 4th – 15 pts)

21U and 18U                              2x

15U and 12U                              1x

Continental Championships, Continental Qualifiers, and all other WBSC-sponsored events will receive a multiplier based on the number of top-10 teams from the previous year-end rankings that are entered in the tournament. (See below)

1.00× - Continental Championships/Qualifying Tournaments, where 3 or more competing teams are in the previous year-end top 10

0.75× - Continental Championships/Qualifying Tournaments, where 2 competing teams are in the previous year-end top 10

0.50× - Continental Championships/Qualifying Tournaments, where 1 competing team is in the previous year-end top 10

0.25× - Continental Championships/Qualifying Tournaments, where no competing teams are in the previous year-end top 10

After each tournament where ranking points are awarded, the WBSC re-releases the ranking list with the points from the most recent tournament added, and points from tournaments more than four years old removed.

== History ==

=== Launch and initial years of WHO-CHOICE ===

In May 1998, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] succeeded [[Hiroshi Nakajima]] as the Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]], and the organization was significantly restructuring as a result of the leadership change. With her election, a new program, called '''Choosing Interventions: Effectiveness Quality, Costs, Gender and Ethics''', was launched as part of the Global Programme for Evidence on Health and Policy. The name of the program would later morph into WHO-CHOICE.&lt;ref name=murray-2000/&gt;

=== Subsequent use ===

WHO-CHOICE was used in the [[World Health Report]] of 2002, specifically informing the recommendations in Chapter 5.&lt;ref name=whr-2002/&gt;

Results based on WHO-CHOICE were published in a series of papers in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=who-economic-evaluation/&gt;

== Tools and methods ==

=== Adoption of sectoral CEA ===

Prior to WHO-CHOICE, most projects that did cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in the real world focused on evaluating a single program or intervention, comparing it against either a fixed price threshold or an existing array of interventions with predetermined cost-effectiveness taken from the literature. However, theoretical literature on CEAs considered a broader kind of CEA called "sectoral CEA" where all programs and interventions available within a sector would be compared and cost-effectiveness priorities would be determined. Prior to WHO-CHOICE, there were only a few examples of practical implementation of sectoral CEAs: the [[Oregon Health Services Commission]] (tasked with prioritizing for [[Medicaid]] in the [[United States]]), the [[World Bank Health Sectors Priorities Review]], and the [[Harvard Life Saving Project]]. Of these, only the World Bank's work had attempted a global comparison.&lt;ref name=murray-2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=hutubessy-2003/&gt; In a 2000 paper discussing the WHO-CHOICE approach, Murray et al. identified four challenges to a wider application of sectoral CEA:

# Resource allocation decisions affecting the entire health sector must also take into account social concerns, such as priority for the sick, reducing social inequalities in health, or the well-being of future generations. The history of the Oregon Health Services Commission provides an example of the sort of conflicts that emerge as a result of balancing all these concerns.
# Current CEA is too focused on the evaluation of new strategies, rather than identifying potential for efficiency improvements by reallocating within existing strategies.
# For all but the richest societies, the cost and time required to evaluate the large set of interventions required may be prohibitive.
# It is difficult to institutionalize CEA, and a number of conflicting CEA guidelines at national and regional levels have proliferated.

=== Use of generalized CEA (a type of sectoral CEA) based on epidemiological subregions ===

WHO-CHOICE identified a key trade-off in sectoral CEA based on the granularity of the region at which the CEA was performed. At one extreme, sectoral CEA could be performed at the level of individual cities or districts, incorporating information about local resources, costs, and current context. At the other extreme, a single CEA could be carried out globally. Highly localized sectoral CEA would be very expensive and difficult to perform whereas global CEA would fail to take into account the huge differences between the epidemiology and resource structure of regions.&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=murray-2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=guide-2003/&gt;

WHO-CHOICE's solution was to use an intermediate level of granularity, that it called "generalized CEA" (GCEA). It argued that at this intermediate level, it could conduct CEAs more efficiently while also allowing local policymakers and agents to use its findings and further adapt them to local contexts.&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=murray-2000/&gt;

WHO-CHOICE has divided the world into 14 epidemiological subregions, and publishes its findings by subregion, as shown below. Each subregion is a combination of a region (a geographical region of the world) and a mortality stratum (a stratum describing the level and nature of mortality). WHO-CHOICE chose to put each country in a single mortality stratum and a single region (and therefore a single subregion) even if mortality varies widely within the country.&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=hutubessy-2003/&gt;

* There are 6 regions: AFR (Africa), AMR (Americas), EMR (Middle East), EUR (Europe), SEAR (South-East Asia), and WPR (West Pacific). 
* There are 5 mortality strata, defined as follows:
** A = very low rates of adult and child mortality
** B = low adult mortality, low child mortality
** C = high adult mortality, low child mortality
** D = high adult mortality, high child mortality
** E = very high adult mortality, high child mortality

Although the 6 regions and 5 mortality strata could give a theoretical maximum of 6 X 5 = 30 subregions, only 14 subregions occur in practice because not every region has countries with all mortality strata.

Below is the classification into subregions as of 2003.&lt;ref name=hutubessy-2003/&gt;

=== Modifications to ICM-CEA to use null set as comparator for interventions ===

The CEA done by WHO-CHOICE differed from the standard ICM-CEA in two important ways:&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=murray-2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=guide-2003/&gt;

# Interventions were compared against the null set of interventions, rather than the existing backdrop of interventions. This provides a complete cost-effectiveness analysis that can be adapted more easily to different subregions and different times.
# Results are presented in a single league table. For each set of mutually exclusive interventions (between which a selection is being made), the intervention with the lowest average cost-effectiveness with respect to the null set is presented first. If there are two or more rows, the second intervention is the one with the lowest slope with respect to the internvention with the lowest CE, and so on. Essentially, this identifies the [[principal component analysis|principal component]]s for the best intervention.

=== Intended usage ===

The results that WHO-CHOICE reports are not intended to be applied literally when choosing policies or selecting interventions. This is for a few reasons:&lt;ref name=hutubessy-2003/&gt;

* The interventions available in a specific local context, as well as the cost and effectiveness estimates, may vary between contexts. Some interventions covered by WHO-CHOICE may not exist in the local context, and other interventions available in the local context may not be covered by WHO-CHOICE.
* The model does not fully capture all the real-world interactions and phenomena. For instance, transition costs are not modeled separately.
* The ranking of interventions by cost-effectiveness could be fairly non-robust, with huge margins of error making the ranking uncertain.

Rather, the results are intended to be used as a starting point in classifying interventions as highly cost-effective, moderately cost-effective, and cost-ineffective. With this classification in place, a more detailed and localized analysis can be done for the highly cost-effective interventions, incorporating concerns such as poverty, equity, implementation capacity, and feasibility.&lt;ref name=hutubessy-2003/&gt;

=== Tools used for the estimates ===

WHO-CHOICE lists the following tools that it uses and can provide to researchers interested in using WHO-CHOICE:&lt;ref name=cea-tools&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/cost-effectiveness/tools/en/|title = Cost effectiveness and strategic planning (WHO-CHOICE)|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* PopMod simulates the time evolution of an arbitrary population subject to births, deaths, and two distinct disease conditions. It has yearly granularity and keeps track of population by age and sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/cost-effectiveness/tools/popmod/en/|title = PopMod|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research paper describing PopMod called it the first multi-state dynamic [[life table]], and highlighted how it modeled multiple diseases with interaction terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = PopMod: a longitudinal population model with two interacting disease states|last = Lauer|first = Jeremy|last2 = Röhrich|first2 = Klaus|last3 = Wirth|first3 = Harald|last4 = Charette|first4 = Claude|last5 = Gribble|first5 = Steve|last6 = Murray|first6 = Christopher J.L.|journal = Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation|doi = 10.1186/1478-7547-1-6|date = February 26, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CEA country contextualization templates: These templates help contextualize WHO-CHOICE's results (that are provided at the level of epidemiological subregion) to specific countries based on estimated information about population and costs in the country, that is pre-populated into the tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/cost-effectiveness/tools/CEA_context/en/|title = CEA country contextualization templates|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CostIt (Costing Intervention Templates) is a software for the recording and analysis of cost data. It is not a data-collection tool but can guide the development of instruments for collecting data. Its main value add is in automating the computation of the [[economic cost]]s of intervention, though it can also be used to compute financial costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/toolkit/cost_it/en/|title = CostIt, under Cost effectiveness and strategic planning (WHO-CHOICE)|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One feature of CostIt is that it automatically adjusts for capacity utilization, and therefore, comes to different conclusions based on different levels of capacity utilization: for instance, it would come to different conclusions if the hospital bed occupancy rate were 30% than if it were 80%.
* MCLeague (Monte Carlo League) is a software program that represents uncertainty around costs and effects to decision-makers in the form of stochastic league tables. It provides information on the probability that any given intervention is in the optimal intervention mix for a given level of resource availability. The program also allows for covariance between costs and outcomes.&lt;ref name=guide-2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/toolkit/mc_league/en/|title = MC League, under Cost effectiveness and strategic planning (WHO-CHOICE) |publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Health Report of 2002 ===

The [[World Health Report]] of 2002 relied on WHO-CHOICE. Specifically, it used the division of the world into epidemiological subregions in its analysis of health risks, and used recommendations generated by WHO-CHOICE in Chapter 5, "Some Strategies to Reduce Risk".&lt;ref name=whr-2002&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/whr/2002/en/whr02_en.pdf?ua=1|title = The World Health Report 2002: Reducing Risks, Promoting Healthy Life|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here are the key results in the report based on WHO-CHOICE:

{| class="wikitable sortable" border="1"
! Risk being considered !! Potential interventions !! Conclusion about best intervention
|-
| [[Malnutrition|Childhood undernutrition]] (and [[breastfeeding]]) || Complementary feeding&lt;br/&gt;Complementary feeding with growth monitoring and promotion || Both interventions have identical impact, and the latter is cheaper, and more likely to be cost-effective in most regions.
|-
| [[Iron deficiency]] || Iron fortification&lt;br/&gt;[[Iron supplement]]ation || Supplementation yields greater improvements in population health in subregions with high child mortality (all D and E subregions) and at all levels of coverage.&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, fortification is the preferred option at low levels of resource availability, as it has lower and less sharpy increasing unit cost and does not require a visit to a provider.&lt;br/&gt;However, in some settings, fortification is hindered by the absence of ideal food vehicles to fortify, and supplementation could be the better approach.
|-
| [[Vitamin A deficiency]] || Vitamin A supplementation&lt;br/&gt;Vitamin A fortification || Vitamin A fortification is more cost-effective in all regions because of its lower cost. Supplementation has a higher population benefit despite the higher cost. Both interventions are cost-effective.
|-
| [[Zinc deficiency]] || Zinc supplementation&lt;br/&gt;Zinc fortification || Fortification is more cost-effective. However, it has lower total population benefit than Vitamin A supplementation in subregions where both Vitamin A deficiency and zinc deficiency are problems.
|-
| Other individual-based interventions focusing on children under five years of age || [[Oral rehydration therapy]]&lt;br/&gt;Case management of [[pneumonia]] || Vitamin A supplementation achieves greater health effects than ORT in some areas (AMR-B, SEAR-B, WPR-B) but in others the reverse is true. Both ORT and case management of pneumonia achieve substantially greater benefits than zinc fortification and supplementation, though the latter is more cost-effective.
|-
| [[Blood pressure]] ([[hypertension]]) || Population wide salt reductions&lt;br/&gt;Individual-based hypertension treatment and education || In all subregions, strategies to reduce blood pressure are very cost-effective. Legislation is potentially more cost-effective than voluntary agreement with industry.&lt;br/&gt;Strategies to reduce blood pressure by treating individuals with a blood pressure with a SBP greater than 160mmHg are the most cost-effective, and lowering the threshold to 140mmHg is not cost-effective in many subregions such as AFR-D and AMR-D.&lt;br/&gt;Combinations of individual treatment and population based approaches are cost-effective at the 160mmHg SBP threshold in all settings.
|-
| [[Cholesterol]] || Population-wide health education through mass media&lt;br/&gt;Individual-based treatment and education || In all subregions, population strategies to reduce cholesterol are very cost-effective, but the total impact on DALYs gained is small.&lt;br/&gt;Statins are low-cost and effective and thus cost-effective in all regions.
|-
| Combined interventions to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events || Individual-based treatment and education for systolic blood pressure and cholesterol&lt;br/&gt;Population-wide combination of interventions to reduce hypertension and cholesterol.&lt;br/&gt;Absolute risk approach: focus on the absolute risks of individuals and choose medication based on that&lt;br/&gt;Combining population interventions and the absolute risk approach || The absolute risk approach for a threshold of 35% is very cost-effective in all subregions. At lower thresholds, the health benefits increase but so do the costs. The threshold for cost-effectiveness can vary based on region, and can vary from 5% to 25%.
|-
| Unsafe sex and [[HIV/AIDS]] || Population-wide mass media&lt;br/&gt;[[Voluntary counseling and testing]]&lt;br/&gt;School-based AIDS education&lt;br/&gt;Peer outreach for men who have sex with men&lt;br/&gt;Treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STI)&lt;br/&gt;[[Vertically transmitted infection|Mother-to-child transmission]] (MTCT)&lt;br/&gt;[[Management of HIV/AIDS|Antiretroviral therapy]] (ARV)&lt;br/&gt;Intervention combinations || All preventive interventions have a substantial impact on population health in the high mortality subregions. The specific intervention that is best varies with the setting.&lt;br/&gt;Treatment of STIs has a higher impact on population health than the other preventive interventions in all except the A subregions where peer outreach for men who have sex with men also has a substantial impact.
|-
| [[Smoking]] || Taxation&lt;br/&gt;Clean indoor air laws in public places&lt;br/&gt;Comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising&lt;br/&gt;Information dissemination through health warning labels, counter-advertising, and consumer information packages.&lt;br/&gt;Nicotine replacement therapy || The interventions have a larger impact in subregions with more tobacco use (AMR-B, AMR-D, EUR-B, EUR-C, SEAR-B, SEAR-D, WPR-B). If only one intervention is to be chosen, it should be taxation.
|-
| Unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene || [[Millennium Development Goals]]&lt;br/&gt;Disinfection at point of use&lt;br/&gt;Improved water supply and sanitation, low technologies&lt;br/&gt;Improved water supply and sanitation, with disinfection at point of use&lt;br/&gt;Improved water supply and sanitation, high technologies || In subregions other than EUR-A and AMR-A (where almost everybody has access to safe water and basic sanitation), the intervention that is consistently the most cost-effective is the provision of disinfection capacity at the point of use. However, the principal driver for improvement to water supplies is not health but economic development, and this should be factored into the evaluation.
|-
| Unsafe health care injections || Decreased reuse of injected equipment without sterilization&lt;br/&gt;Decreased unnecessary use of injections || Interventions were not evaluated in A subregions.&lt;br/&gt; In other mortality strata, reducing unnecessary use of injections has a lower total impact of health, and the impact of the interventions is additive.&lt;br/&gt;In approximately half the subregions (AMR-B, AMR-D, EUR-B, EUR-C), reducing reuse is also the most cost-effective intervention.&lt;br/&gt;In other regions (AFR-D, AFR-E, EMR-D, SEAR-B, SEAR-D, WPR-B), behavioral interventions to reduce overuse are more cost-effective, and would be done first if resources are scarce.

=== Report on scaling up Millennium Development Goals ===

The WHO-CHOICE database was one of the sources of data used for the 2009 [[World Health Organization]] costing report ''Constraints to Scaling Up the Health Millennium Development Goals: Costing and Financial Gap Analysis. Background Document for the Taskforce on Innovative International Financing and Health Systems'' (published 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/publications/d_ScalingUp_MDGs_WHO_finalreport.pdf?ua=1|title = Constraints to Scaling Up the Health Millennium Development Goals: Costing and Financial Gap Analysis.

=== Series of papers in the ''British Medical Journal'' in 2012 ===

In 2012, a number of papers were published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' disseminating results from WHO-CHOICE.&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=who-economic-evaluation&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/documents/economic_evaluation/en/|title = Economic evaluation|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discussion of the findings on the [[Giving What We Can]] blog summarized the results as follows: "countries should try to expand high-priority interventions to near-universal coverage before considering second-priority interventions on a limited scale."&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt; Below are the main results:

Giving What We Can, a charity evaluator and advocate of more effective giving, reviewed WHO-CHOICE's results, and emphasized that these results "should perhaps not be taken from the individual donor’s perspective, but rather from the perspective of someone who can influence the health system of that country."&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt; GWWC has also referenced WHO-CHOICE and compared it with DCP2 in some of its coverage of diseases.&lt;ref name=gwwc-tb&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/other-causes/tuberculosis/|title = Tuberculosis|accessdate = January 21, 2017|publisher = [[Giving What We Can]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women's World Golf Rankings''', also known for sponsorship reasons as the '''[[Rolex]] Rankings''', were introduced in February 2006. They are sanctioned by eight women's golf [[professional golf tours|tours]] and the organisations behind them: [[Ladies Professional Golf Association]] (LPGA Tour), [[Ladies European Tour]], [[Ladies Professional Golfers' Association of Japan]] (LPGA of Japan Tour), [[Korea Ladies Professional Golf Association]] (LPGA of Korea Tour), [[Australian Ladies Professional Golf]] (ALPG Tour), [[Symetra Tour]], [[China LPGA Tour|China Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour]], the [[LET Access Series|Ladies European Tour Access Series]] and also by the [[Ladies' Golf Union]], which administers the [[Women's British Open]] and the [[United States Golf Association]] which conducts the [[U.S. Women's Open]].

The idea of introducing a set of women's rankings similar to the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] was developed at the May 2004 World Congress of Women's Golf, and was first planned for 2005,&lt;ref name="rankingsplanned"&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Women's World Rankings to begin in 2005
  | publisher = Golf Today
  | date = 2004
  | url = http://www.golftoday.co.uk/news/yeartodate/news04/womens_rankings.html
  | accessdate =16 April 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; but then put back to 2006.

==Calculation of the rankings==
The rankings are based on performances on the eight major tours (LPGA, JLPGA, KLPGA, LET, ALPG, Symetra Tour, LETAS, CLPGA) over a two-year period. Amateur players are eligible. The system for calculating the rankings is similar to that for the men's Official World Golf Ranking. Players receive points for each good finish on the relevant tours, with the number of points available in each event depending on the strength of the field, as determined by the competitors' existing rankings (when the rankings were introduced rankings were calculated for earlier periods; the first ever set showed notional changes since the previous week). The only exceptions are the five [[LPGA majors]] and all Symetra Tour, CLPGA and LETAS events, which have a fixed-point allocation. Rankings are tapered so the recent results are more important.

===Original formula===
When the rankings were first introduced in February 2006, a player's ranking as calculated in the above description was divided by the number of events played, with a minimum required events of 15 over the previous two years. In addition, players were required to play in a minimum of 15 eligible events over the previous two-year period to be included in the rankings.

===Formula revisions===
On 2 August 2006 the Rolex Rankings Board and Technical Committee announced following its bi-annual meeting two changes to the ranking formula.&lt;ref name="aug2006rev"&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Two modifications announced for Rolex Rankings
  | publisher=LPGA
  | date = 3 August 2006
  | url = http://www.lpga.com/content_1.aspx?mid=2&amp;pid=7574
  | accessdate =3 August 2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
#The elimination of the minimum event requirement. Players would no longer be required to participate in 15 qualifying events to be included in the rankings and could be included after playing in as few as one qualifying event. This change would also have the effect of permitting amateurs who had played well in one event to be ranked (e.g., [[Morgan Pressel]], who finished second in the 2005 [[U.S. Women's Open]], or [[Michelle Wie]] from age 13).
# The introduction of a minimum divisor. Where previously a player's point total was divided by the number of events she played over the previous 104 weeks, now the player's point total would be divided by the greater of (i) the number of events played or (ii) 35. Thus, players with 35 or more events over the previous 104 weeks would continue to use the actual number of events played as the divisor, but players with fewer than 35 events would use 35 as the divisor.

Many commentators saw the latter change as directed at [[Michelle Wie]], who at the time was ranked second in the world despite having competed in only 16 women's professional events in the two-year period. However, the chairman of the Rolex Rankings Technical Committee defended the change as one designed to make the women's rankings more comparable to the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] for men, which use a minimum divisor of 40 events.

On 16 April 2007, another modification in the formula was introduced. Instead of points being awarded on an accumulated 104-week rolling period, with the points awarded in the most recent 13-week period carrying a stronger value, points began to be reduced in 91 equal decrements following week 13 for the remaining 91 weeks of the two-year Rolex Ranking period rather than the seven equal 13 week decrements previously used.&lt;ref name="apr162007rev"&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Modification Announced to Rolex Rankings Calculations
  | publisher=LPGA
  | date = 9 April 2007
  | url = http://www.lpga.com/content_1.aspx?pid=10409&amp;mid=4
  | accessdate =16 April 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This modification did not have an immediate impact on the rankings.

==Criticisms==
When they were introduced the rankings attracted considerable criticism on two grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://golf.about.com/b/a/245967.htm |title=First Women's World Golf Rankings Stir Up Controversy |last=Kelley |first=Brent |publisher=about.com |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First, it was widely felt that members of the LPGA of Japan Tour were ranked too high, since few of them had competed successfully outside Japan. Second, the minimum of 15 events needed to qualify for a ranking was widely seen as having been selected purely to enable [[Michelle Wie]] to be highly ranked because she had played exactly that number in the preceding two years, while every other highly ranked player had played many more events. If the women's rankings used the same system used for the men's rankings – that is a minimum number of events of one but a minimum denominator of 40 to calculate the average points per tournament – Wie would have been just outside the top 10. But under the women's ranking system where only players who had played a minimum number of events were included, if the minimum number of events had been set higher than 15, Wie would not have been ranked at all.

The August 2006 revised formula addressed the second criticism. The technical committee that administers the rankings urged patience with regard to the first criticism, since the continuing "strength of the field" weighting of tournaments may correct the issue without any technical changes being made.

==Significance of the rankings==
The rankings are used by each of the sponsoring tours to determine eligibility criteria for certain events. For example, 40 of the 144 places in the [[Women's British Open]] are currently awarded on the basis of the rankings—10 to LET members and 30 to LPGA members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lgu.org/data/files/entry_2011_rwboconditions.pdf |title=Entry Form, 2011 Ricoh Women's British Open: Rules and Conditions |publisher=[[Ladies' Golf Union]] |format=PDF |accessdate=29 July 2011}} See especially "7. Exemptions from Pre-Qualifying and Final Qualifying", pages 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the 12 places in the European [[Solheim Cup]] team are allocated on the basis of the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/4918154.stm |title=Solheim selection process changes |work=BBC Sport |date=18 April 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, the rankings at the end of each LPGA Tour season in odd-numbered years have determined the eight countries that will compete in the following year's [[International Crown]], a LPGA-sponsored team event scheduled in even-numbered years and first held in 2014. More specifically, the countries whose top four players have the highest cumulative rankings are invited to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.lpga.com/golf/news/2013/1/global-announcement.aspx |title=32 Players, 8 Countries, 1 Crown: LPGA Unveils the International Crown |publisher=LPGA |date=24 January 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual participants from each qualified country are determined by the rankings immediately prior to the [[ANA Inspiration]] (known before 2015 as the Kraft Nabisco Championship) in the year of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.lpgainternationalcrown.com/golf/news/2013/7/international-crown-tickets.aspx |title=LPGA International Crown Celebrates "Year from Here" Event |publisher=LPGA |date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes'''&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;
*On 12 January 2009, [[Annika Sörenstam]], who was ranked No. 3 the previous week despite having announced her retirement effective at the end of the 2008 season, was removed from the rankings. No official explanation was given for her removal. Sörenstam later posted in her personal blog that she asked to be removed.&lt;ref name="sorenstam-removal"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sörenstam |first=Annika |title=Annika's Blog February 2009 |date=February 2009 |url=http://www.annikablog.com/annika-qa.html |accessdate=2 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324083936/http://www.annikablog.com/annika-qa.html |archivedate=24 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 10 May 2010, one week after announcing that she was retiring from golf, [[Lorena Ochoa]] also voluntarily removed herself from the rankings. Her last position in the rankings was No. 2 for the week of 3 May 2010.&lt;ref name="ochoa-removal"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ochoa removed from women's golf rankings |publisher=UPI.com |date=10 May 2010 |url=http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2010/05/10/Ochoa-removed-from-womens-golf-rankings/UPI-75091273507237/ |accessdate =10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10386">The '''World Curling Rankings''' system is designed to track and list the amount of success achieved by each member association of the [[World Curling Federation]] (WCF) in a given curling season. The system, which was implemented in December 2006, is similar to the [[FIFA World Rankings|ranking system]] used by [[FIFA]]. The events taken into account when calculating each nation's score include the [[Curling at the Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]], the [[World Curling Championships]], the [[European Curling Championships]], and the [[Pacific Curling Championships]]. The system was developed by [[Patrick Hürlimann]], who is a former [[List of Olympic medalists in curling|Olympic champion]] and was the vice president of the WCF from 2010 to 2012.

==Method of calculation==
The points are calculated for each nation based on performance during the last six curling seasons. Results in seasons prior to the current season are scaled by the following factors:
{| class="wikitable" style="font-weight:bold; text-align:center"
|-
|align=left bgcolor=#efefef| Years prior to current season ||width=20| 0 ||width=20| 1 ||width=20| 2 ||width=20| 3 ||width=20| 4 ||width=20| 5

|}

===Points distribution===
Points are allocated based on the final rankings of each nation at an eligible event.

====International events====
The points distributions are given for each event as follows:

'''World Environment Day''' ('''WED''') is celebrated on the 5th of June every year, and is the [[United Nations|United Nation's]] principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the [[environmental protection|protection of our environment]]. First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging [[environmental issue]]s from [[marine pollution]], human [[overpopulation]], and [[global warming]], to [[sustainable consumption]] and wildlife crime. WED has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.

==History==
World Environment Day [WED] was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/environmentday/background.shtml|title=World Environment Day - 5 June|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the first day of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]], resulting from discussions on the integration of human interactions and the environment. Two years later, in 1974 the first WED was held with the theme "Only One Earth". Even though WED celebration have been held annually since 1974, in 1987 the idea for rotating the center of these activities through selecting different host countries began.

The campaign addressed the huge annual wastage and losses in food, which, if conserved, would release a large quantity of food as well as reduce the overall carbon footprint. The campaign aimed to bring about awareness in countries with lifestyles resulting in food wastage.

we are humans, the earth is our home
all the people and the nations of the world
all for one and one for all

[[File:World Heritage Logo global.svg|thumb|[[Logo]] of the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage Committee]]]]

A '''World Heritage site''' is a landmark or area which is selected by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] ([[UNESCO]]) as having cultural,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; historical, scientific or other form of significance, and is legally protected by international treaties. The sites are judged important to the collective interests of humanity.

To be selected, a World Heritage site must be an already classified landmark, unique in some respect as a geographically and historically identifiable place having special cultural or physical significance (such as an ancient ruin or  historical structure, building, city, complex, desert, forest, island, lake, monument, mountain, or [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12976/full wilderness area]). It may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity, and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Centre|first1=UNESCO World Heritage|title=The Criteria for Selection|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=1 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity, which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing, unmonitored/uncontrolled/unrestricted access, or threat from local administrative negligence. Sites are demarcated by UNESCO as protected zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Heritage|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630023048/http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|archivedate=30 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lists of World Heritage Sites|The list]] is maintained by the international World Heritage Program administered by the UNESCO [[World Heritage Committee]], composed of 21 states parties which are elected by their General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/|title=The World Heritage Committee|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Site|accessdate=14 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109181158/http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/|archivedate=9 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme catalogues, names, and conserves sites of outstanding [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage|natural]] importance to the common culture and heritage of [[World population|humanity]]. Under certain conditions, listed sites can obtain funds from the World Heritage Fund. The program began with the ''Convention Concerning the Protection of the World's Cultural and Natural Heritage'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/convention-en.pdf Convention Concerning the Protection of World's Cultural and Natural Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704214349/http://whc.unesco.org/archive/convention-en.pdf |date=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] on 16 November 1972. Since then, 193 state parties have ratified the convention, making it one of the most widely recognized international agreements and the world's most popular cultural program.

As of July 2018, a total of 1,092 World Heritage sites (845 cultural, 209 natural, and 38 mixed properties) exist across [[Table of World Heritage Sites by country|167 countries]]. [[List of World Heritage Sites in Italy|Italy]], with 54 sites, has the most of any country, followed by [[List of World Heritage Sites in China|China]] (53), [[List of World Heritage Sites in Spain|Spain]] (47), [[List of World Heritage Sites in France|France]] (44), [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|Germany]] (44), [[List of World Heritage Sites in India|India]] (37), and [[List of World Heritage Sites in Mexico|Mexico]] (35).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https:/whc.unesco.org/en/list|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the government of [[Egypt]] decided to build the new [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]], whose resulting future reservoir would eventually [[Flood|inundate]] a large stretch of the [[Nile]] valley containing cultural treasures of [[ancient Egypt]] and ancient [[Nubia]]. In 1959, the governments of Egypt and [[Sudan]] requested UNESCO to assist their countries to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites. In 1960, the Director-General of UNESCO launched an appeal to the member states for an International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429024818/http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172 |date=29 April 2009 }} World Heritage Convention, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites, the recovery of thousands of objects, as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of a number of important temples, the most famous of which are the temple complexes of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]] and [[Philae]]. The campaign, which ended in 1980, was considered a success. As tokens of its gratitude to countries which especially contributed to the campaign's success, Egypt donated four temples: the [[Temple of Dendur]] was moved to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[Temple of Debod]] was moved to the [[Parque del Oeste]] in Madrid, the [[Temple of Taffeh]] was moved to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in the Netherlands, and the [[Temple of Ellesyia]] to [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227222650/http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ |date=27 February 2015 }}, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

The project cost $80&amp;nbsp;million, about $40&amp;nbsp;million of which was collected from 50 countries.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The project's success led to other safeguarding campaigns: saving [[Venice]] and its [[Venetian Lagoon|lagoon]] in Italy, the ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Pakistan, and the [[Borobodur]] Temple Compounds in Indonesia. UNESCO then initiated, with the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], a draft convention to protect the common cultural heritage of humanity. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Convention and background===
The United States initiated the idea of cultural conservation with nature conservation. The [[White House]] conference in 1965 called for a "World Heritage Trust" to preserve "the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry". The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] developed similar proposals in 1968, and they were presented in 1972 to the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]]. Under the World Heritage Committee, signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic [[data reporting]] providing the World Heritage Committee with an overview of each participating nation's implementation of the World Heritage Convention and a "snapshot" of current conditions at World Heritage properties.

A single text was agreed on by all parties, and the "Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage" was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972.

The Convention came into force on 17 December 1975. As of May 2017, it has been ratified by 193 states parties,&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|title=States Parties – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 189 [[UN member states]] plus the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Holy See]], [[Niue]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. Only four UN member states have not ratified the Convention: Liechtenstein, Nauru, Somalia and Tuvalu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage: Treaty status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719235637/http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E |date=19 July 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nominating process&lt;!--This section is linkedd from Citadel of Arbil--&gt;==

A country must first list its significant cultural and natural sites; the result is called the Tentative List. A country may not nominate sites that have not been first included on the Tentative List. Next, it can place sites selected from that list into a Nomination File.

The Nomination File is evaluated by the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|World Conservation Union]]. These bodies then make their recommendations to the World Heritage Committee. The Committee meets once per year to determine whether or not to inscribe each nominated property on the World Heritage List and sometimes defers or refers the decision to request more information from the country which nominated the site. There are ten selection criteria – a site must meet at least one of them to be included on the list.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ | title=The Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention | publisher=UNESCO | accessdate=10 July 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714073431/http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ | archivedate=14 July 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection criteria==
Up to 2004, there were six criteria for cultural heritage and four criteria for natural heritage. In 2005, this was modified so that there is now only one set of ten criteria. Nominated sites must be of "outstanding universal value" and meet at least one of the ten criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|title=Criteria for Selection|publisher=World Heritage|accessdate=14 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612152223/http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|archivedate=12 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria have been modified or/amended several times since their creation.

&lt;/ol&gt;

===Legal status of designated sites===
UNESCO designation as a World Heritage site provides ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence that such culturally sensitive sites are legally protected pursuant to the Law of War, under the [[Geneva Convention]], its articles, protocols and customs, together with other treaties including the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] and international law.

Thus, the Geneva Convention treaty promulgates:

"Article 53. PROTECTION OF CULTURAL OBJECTS AND OF PLACES OF WORSHIP. Without prejudice to the provisions of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954,' and of other relevant international instruments, it is prohibited:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=UN General Assembly |authorlink=United Nations General Assembly |date=1979 |origyear=8 June 1977 |title=UN Treaty No. 17512 |series=Treaty Series |url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201125/volume-1125-I-17512-English.pdf |format=PDF |work='Volume 1125-1' UN |page=27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309204240/http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201125/volume-1125-I-17512-English.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:(a) To commit any acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples;
:(b) To use such objects in support of the military effort;
:(c) To make such objects the object of reprisals."

==Extensions and other modifications==
A country may request to extend or reduce the boundaries, modify the official name, or change the selection criteria of one of its already listed sites. Any proposal for a significant boundary change or modify the site's selection criteria must be submitted as if it were a new nomination, including first placing it on the Tentative List and then onto the Nomination File.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

A request for a minor boundary change, one that does not have a significantly impact on the extent of the property or affect its "outstanding universal value", is also evaluated by the advisory bodies before being sent to the Committee. Such proposals can be rejected by either the advisory bodies or the Committee if they judge it to be a significant change instead of a minor one.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

Proposals to change the site's official name is sent directly to the Committee.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

==Endangered sites==
{{main|List of World Heritage in Danger|Former UNESCO World Heritage sites}}

A site may be added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] if there are conditions that threaten the characteristics for which the landmark or area was inscribed on the World Heritage List. Such problems may involve armed conflict and war, natural disasters, pollution, poaching, or uncontrolled urbanization or human development. This danger list is intended to increase international awareness of the threats and to encourage counteractive measures. Threats to a site can be either proven imminent threats or potential dangers that could have adverse effects on a site.&lt;ref name="UNESCO-WHinDanger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|title=List of World Heritage in Danger|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321040701/http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|archivedate=21 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of conservation for each site on the danger list is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

Only two sites have ever been [[Former UNESCO World Heritage sites|delisted]]: the [[Arabian Oryx Sanctuary]] in Oman and the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] in Germany. The Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted in 2007, instead of first being put on the danger list, after the Omani government decided to reduce the protected area's size by 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362|title=Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary: first site ever to be deleted from UNESCO's World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118001455/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362|archivedate=18 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dresden Elbe Valley was first placed on the danger list in 2006 when the World Heritage Committee decided that plans to construct the [[Waldschlösschen Bridge]] would significantly alter the valley's landscape. In response, the Dresden City Council attempted to stop the bridge's construction, but after several court decisions allowed the building of the bridge to proceed, the valley was removed from the World Heritage List in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522|title=Dresden is deleted from UNESCO’s World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707003437/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522/|archivedate=7 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first global assessment to quantitatively measure [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716310138 threats to Natural World Heritage sites] found that 63 percent of sites have been damaged by increasing [https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12558 human pressures] including encroaching roads, agriculture infrastructure and settlements over the last two decades. These activities endanger Natural World Heritage sites and could compromise their unique values. Of the Natural World Heritage sites that contain forest, 91 percent of those experienced some loss since the year 2000. Many Natural World Heritage sites are more threatened than previously thought and require immediate conservation action.

There are 1092 World Heritage sites located in 167 states. Of these, 845 are cultural, 209 are natural and 38 are mixed properties. The World Heritage Committee has divided the world into five geographic zones which it calls regions: Africa, Arab states, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

Russia and the [[Caucasus]] states are classified as European, while Mexico and the Caribbean are classified as belonging to the Latin America &amp; Caribbean zone, despite their location in North America. The UNESCO geographic zones also give greater emphasis on administrative, rather than geographic associations. Hence, [[Gough Island]], located in the South Atlantic, is part of the Europe &amp; North America region because the government of the United Kingdom nominated the site.

The table below includes a breakdown of the sites according to these zones and their classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat|title=World Heritage List Statistics|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514002820/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027174218/http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region|archivedate=27 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The properties "[[Uvs Nuur Basin]]" and "[[Transbaikal|Landscapes of Dauria]]" ([[Mongolia]], [[Russian Federation]]) are trans-regional properties located in Europe and Asia and the Pacific region. They are counted here in the Asia and the Pacific region.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The property "[[The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier|The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement]]" ([[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Switzerland]]) is a trans-regional property with component sites located in three regions - Europe and North America, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. It is counted here in Europe and North America.

==Consequences==
Despite the successes of World Heritage listing in promoting conservation, the UNESCO administered project has attracted criticism from some for perceived under-representation of heritage sites outside Europe, disputed decisions on site selection and adverse impact of mass tourism on sites unable to manage rapid growth in visitor numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barron|first1=Laignee|title='Unesco-cide': does world heritage status do cities more harm than good?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/30/unescocide-world-heritage-status-hurt-help-tourism|accessdate=3 September 2017|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vallely|first1=Paul|title=The Big Question: What is a World Heritage Site, and does the accolade make a difference?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html|work=The Independent|date=7 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192333/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sizable [[Lobbying|lobbying industry]] has grown around the awards because World Heritage listing has the potential to significantly increase tourism revenue from sites selected. Site listing bids are often lengthy and costly, putting poorer countries at a disadvantage. Eritrea's efforts to promote [[Asmara]] are one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Modernist masterpieces in unlikely Asmara|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|work=The Economist|date=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715102559/https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|archivedate=15 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Australian government was reported to have successfully lobbied for [[Great Barrier Reef]] conservation efforts to be removed from a UNESCO report titled 'World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate'. The Australian government's actions were in response to their concern about the negative impact that an 'at risk' label could have on tourism revenue at a previously designated UNESCO World Heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slezak|first1=Michael|title=Australia scrubbed from UN climate change report after government intervention|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention|work=The Guardian|date=26 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027130133/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hasham|first1=Nicole|title=Government spent at least $400,000 lobbying against Great Barrier Reef 'danger' listing|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-spent-at-least-400000-lobbying-against-great-barrier-reef-danger-listing-20150914-gjlwr2.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228235450/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-spent-at-least-400000-lobbying-against-great-barrier-reef-danger-listing-20150914-gjlwr2.html|archivedate=28 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of listed World Heritage locations such as [[George Town, Penang]], and [[Casco Viejo, Panama]], have struggled to strike the balance between the economic benefits of catering to greatly increased visitor numbers and preserving the original culture and local communities that drew the recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maurel|first1=Cholé|title=The unintended consequences of UNESCO world heritage listing|url=https://theconversation.com/the-unintended-consequences-of-unesco-world-heritage-listing-71047|accessdate=4 September 2017|publisher=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''World Radio TV Handbook''''', also known as '''''WRTH''''', is a [[directory (databases)|directory]] of virtually every [[Radio station|radio]] and [[TV station]] on Earth, published yearly. It was started in 1947 by [[Oluf Lund Johansen]] (1891–1975) as the ''World Radio Handbook'' (WRH).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oz6gh.byethost33.com/lund_johansen.htm O. Lund-Johansen], presented by OZ6GH.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "TV" was added to the title in 1965, when [[Jens M. Frost]] (1919–1999) took over as editor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dswci.org/specials/membersofhonour/jens_frost.html DSWCI Member of Honour:  Jens M. Frost]&lt;/ref&gt; It had then already included data for [[television broadcasting]] for some years. After the 40th edition in 1986, Frost handed over editorship to [[Andrew G. Sennitt|Andrew G. (Andy) Sennitt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agsmedia.nl/body_who.html Andy Sennitt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208225753/http://www.agsmedia.nl/body_who.html |date=2012-02-08 }}, own presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition that bears an edition number is the 4th edition, published in 1949. The three previous editions appear to have been:
* the 1st edition, marked "Winter Ed. 1947" on the cover and completed in November 1947
* the 2nd edition, marked "1948 (May-November)" on the cover and completed in May 1948
* the 3rd edition, marked "1948-49" on the cover and completed in November 1948.

Summer Supplements appear to have been issued from 1959 through 1971. From 1959 through 1966 they were called the Summer Supplement. From 1967 through 1971 they were called the Summer Edition.

Through the 1969 edition, the WRTH indicated the date on which the manuscript was completed.

Issues with covers in Danish are known to have been available for the years 1948 May-November (2d ed.), 1950-51 (5th ed.; cover and 1st page in Danish, rest in English, most ads in Danish), 1952 (6th ed.; cover and 1st page in Danish, rest in English, most ads in Danish), and probably others. The 1952 English ed., which is completely in English, has an extra page with world times and agents, and ads in English which are sometimes different from the ads in the Danish edition. Also, the 1953 ed. mentions the availability of a German edition.

[[Oluf Lund Johansen]] published, in conjunction with [[Libreria Hispanoamericana]] of [[Barcelona]], Spain, a [[softbound]] Spanish-language version of the 1960 WRTH. The book was printed in Spain and called ''Guia Mundial de Radio y Television'', and carried the WRTH logo at the time as well as all the editorial references contained in the English-language version. 

Hardbound editions are known to have been available for the years 1963 through 1966, 1968, 1969, and 1975-1978, and probably others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">The '''world to come''', '''age to come''', and '''heaven on Earth''' are [[eschatological]] phrases reflecting the belief that the [[World (theology)|current world]] or [[Dispensation (period)|current age]] is flawed or [[curse]]d{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and will be replaced in the future by a better world, age, or [[paradise]]. The concept is related to but differs from the concepts of [[heaven]], the [[afterlife]], and the [[Kingdom of God]] in that heaven is another place or state generally seen as above the world, the afterlife is generally an individual's life after death, and the [[Kingdom of God]] could be in the present (such as [[Realized eschatology]]) or the future.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Hindu eschatology==
[[Image:Kalki.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kalki]] with his  white horse]]
{{main|Hindu eschatology}}
In Hindu eschatology the current age is the [[Kali Yuga]], a period of decline. [[Kalki]] ('Destroyer of Filth') will appear to purge all evil, beginning a [[golden age]] of [[Satya Yuga]].

There have been a range of dates predicted, purportedly from different methods of calculation.&lt;ref name="Chandra"&gt;{{cite book|last = Chandra| first = Suresh| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses | publisher = Kindle Edition| date = Aug 15, 2012| location = | pages = | url =   | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri [[Potuluri Virabrahmendra Swami]], for example, wrote 400 years ago in his ''Divya Maha Kala Gnana,'' or 'Divine Knowledge of the Time,' that Kalki would arrive when the moon, sun, Venus and Jupiter entered the same sign. This is not a rare occurrence and last happened in early 2012, passing without event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Santanu Acharya |url=http://ww-iii.tripod.com/hindu.htm |title=Hindu Prophecies: Translations from the Kalki Purana |publisher=Ww-iii.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of arrival of Kalki has not been consistently asserted by astrologers.&lt;ref name="Chandra"/&gt;

==Jewish eschatology==
[[File:Resurrection of the Dead vision.jpg|thumb|[[Resurrection of the dead]], fresco from the Dura-Europos synagogue]]
[[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|''HaOlam HaBa'']], or "the world to come", is an important part of [[Jewish eschatology]], although [[Judaism]] concentrates on the importance of ''HaOlam HaZeh'' ("this world").  The [[afterlife]] is known as ''Olam haBa'', ''[[Gan Eden#In Jewish eschatology|Gan Eden]]'' (the Heavenly Garden of Eden) and ''[[Gehenna|Gehinom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jews are told to live their lives on earth to the full, as their bodies will stay there but their souls live on. [http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/jewish-afterlife-beliefs.htm Jewish Afterlife Beliefs at SimpleToRemember.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/afterlife.html Afterlife at JewishVirtualLibrary.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba: The Afterlife at JewFAQ.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Talmud]], any non-Jew who lives according to the [[Seven Laws of Noah]] is regarded as a ''[[Ger toshav]]'' (righteous gentile), and is assured of a place in the world to come, the final reward of the righteous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot M'lakhim 8:11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry ''Ben Noah'', end of article); note the variant reading of Maimonides and the references in the footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian eschatology==
[[Image:Apocalypse vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'', an 1887 painting by [[Victor Vasnetsov]]. The [[Lamb of God]] is visible at the top.]]
{{main|Christian eschatology}}
Under [[Christian]] [[eschatology]], the phrase is found in the [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use#1988 ecumenical version .28ELLC.29|Nicene Creed (current Ecumenical version)]]: "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christian-bible.com/Exegesis/creeds.htm |title=The Nicene Creed |publisher=Christian-bible.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found in the [[King James Version]] of the [[New Testament]] at {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:32|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|10:30|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|18:30|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|2:5|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|6:5|KJV}}. Other related expressions are "age to come" which is typically found in more recent translations, [[Kingdom of God]], [[Messianic Age]], [[Millennial Age]], [[The New Earth]] and [[New Jerusalem]], and [[dispensation of the fulness of times]] and possibly also [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].

==Zoroastrian eschatology==
In [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[eschatology]], the world to come is the ''[[frashokereti]]'', where the ''[[saoshyant]]'' will bring about a [[resurrection of the dead]] in the bodies they had before they died. This is followed by a [[last judgment]]. The ''[[yazata]]s'' [[Airyaman]] and [[Atar]] will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and the molten metal will then flow across the earth like a river. All humankind—both the living and the resurrected dead—will be required to wade through that river, but for the righteous (''[[ashavan]]'') it will seem to be a river of warm milk, while the wicked will be burned. The river will then flow down to [[hell]], where it will annihilate [[Angra Mainyu]] and the last vestiges of wickedness in the universe.

'''Zero world government''' refers to a hypothetical future in which [[central government|national governments]] cease to exist or to matter, as a result of [[globalization]] and a worldwide rejection of politics, as known today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The term contrasts with that of one [[world government]] in the sense that rather than there being a world-[[state (polity)|state]], there are no political states in the world.
