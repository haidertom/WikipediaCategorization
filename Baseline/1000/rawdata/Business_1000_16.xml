{{advert|date=April 2017}}
'''''A Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''''' ('''''BABOK&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Guide''''') is the globally recognized standard for the practice of business analysis. ''BABOK Guide'' reflects the collective knowledge of the business analysis community and presents the most widely accepted business analysis practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BABOK Guide - IIBA {{!}} International Institute of  Business Analysis|url = http://www.iiba.org/babok-guide.aspx|website = www.iiba.org|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''BABOK Guide'' recognizes and reflects the fact that business analysis is continually evolving and is practised in a wide variety of forms and contexts. It defines the skills and knowledge that people who work with and employ business analysts should expect a skilled practitioner to demonstrate.

''BABOK Guide'' is a framework that describes the business analysis tasks that must be performed to deliver a solution that will provide value to the sponsoring organization. Each business analysis task contributes to this overall goal directly or indirectly. Many elements of a task may vary, including the form those tasks take, the order they are performed in, or the relative importance of the tasks.

''BABOK Guide'' describes the skills, knowledge, and competencies required to perform business analysis effectively. It does not describe the processes that people will follow to do business analysis.

According to Capability Maturity Model Integration, organizations interested in process improvement need to adopt industry standards from ''Business Analysis Body of Knowledge'' (and [[Body of knowledge|other associated references]]) to lift their project delivery from the ''ad hoc'' to the ''managed'' level.

== History ==
''BABOK Guide'' was first published by [[International Institute of Business Analysis|International Institute of Business Analysis&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt;]] (IIBA&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) as a draft document version 1.4, in October 2005, for consultation with the wider business analysis and project management community, to document and standardize generally accepted business analysis practices. The first formal release was at version 1.6 in June 2006. Version 2.0 was released 31 March 2009.  Version 3 was released in April 2015.

''BABOK Guide'' is defined and updated by the professionals who use it every day and is under active review and consultation all the time.  Prior to publication, ''BABOK Guide'' undergoes a full public review where any person can provide feedback and comment on the content.

=== Professional Certification ===
Once the body of knowledge was established, IIBA created the [[Certified Business Analysis Professional]]&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; (CBAP'''''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''''') designation to recognise senior business analysts who could demonstrate in-depth long-term experience in these knowledge areas (5–10 years in a dedicated business analyst role).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CBAP Certification - IIBA {{!}} International Institute of  Business Analysis|url = http://www.iiba.org/Certification-Recognition/CBAP-Designation.aspx|website = www.iiba.org|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IIBA also offers the [[Certification_of_Competency_in_Business_Analysis|Certification of Competency on Business Analysis]] &lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; (CCBA'''''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''''') designation that recognises Business Analysts with 3750 hours business analysis experience, including 900 hours experience in two knowledge areas or 500 hours experience in four knowledge areas, and 21 professional development hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = CCBA Designation|url = http://www.iiba.org/Certification-Recognition/CCBA-Designation.aspx|accessdate =21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For both certifications above the applicant must have a minimum high school education (or equivalent), two references from a career manager, client or Certified Business Analyst Professional and sign the IIBA Code of Conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Certified Business Analysis Professional|url = http://www.iiba.org/Certification-Recognition/CBAP-Designation.aspx|work = Certification|publisher = IIBA|accessdate =21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IIBA also offers the Entry Certificate in Business Analysis&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; (ECBA'''''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''''') that does not require a reference.

== Structure and content ==
''BABOK Guide'' includes chapters on:
* Business Analysis Key Concepts: define important terms that are the foundation of the practice of business analysis.
* Knowledge Areas: represents the core content of ''BABOK Guide'' and contain the business analysis tasks that are used to perform business analysis.
* Underlying Competencies: describes the behaviours, characteristics, knowledge, and personal qualities that help business analysts be effective in their job.
* Techniques: describes 50 of the most common techniques used by business analysts.
* Perspectives: describes 5 different views of business analysis (Agile, Business Intelligence, Information Technology, Business Architecture, and Business Process Management). New to ''BABOK Guide'' version 3, Perspectives demonstrate the continued evolution of the practice of business analysis.

=== Knowledge areas ===
''BABOK Guide'' organizes business analysis tasks within 6 knowledge areas. Each task describes the typical knowledge, skills, deliverables, and techniques that the business analyst requires to be able to perform those tasks competently. The knowledge areas logically organize tasks but do not specify a sequence, process, or methodology.

The knowledge areas of ''BABOK Guide'' are:
* '''Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring:''' describes the tasks used to organize and coordinate business analysis efforts.
* '''Elicitation and Collaboration:''' describes the tasks used to prepare for and conduct elicitation activities and confirm the results.
* '''Requirements Life Cycle Management:'''  the tasks used to manage and maintain requirements and design information from inception to retirement.
* '''Strategy Analysis:''' describes the tasks used to identify the business need, address that need, and align the change strategy within the enterprise.
* '''Requirements Analysis and Design Definition:''' describes the tasks used to organize requirements, specify and model requirements and designs, validate and verify information, identify solution options, and estimate the potential value that could be realized.
* '''Solution Evaluation:''' describes the tasks used to assess the performance of and value delivered by a solution and to recommend improvements on increasing values.

'''ActiveReports''' is a [[.NET Framework|.NET]] reporting tool used by developers of [[WinForms]], [[ASP.NET]], and [[HTML5]] applications. It was originally developed by [[Data Dynamics]], which was then acquired by [[GrapeCity]]. ActiveReports is a set of components and tools that facilitates the production of reports to display data in documents and web-based formats. It is written in managed C# code and allows [[Visual Studio]] programmers to leverage their knowledge of C# or [[Visual Basic.NET]] when programming with ActiveReports.

Among the components included with ActiveReports are exports to file formats such as [[PDF]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], and [[TIFF]]. The main components are a [[Visual Studio]] integrated report designer, and an API that developers use to create customized reports from a variety of data sources. ActiveReports Standard Edition also includes a Visual Query Designer, a customizable Windows Viewer control, an [[HTML5]] Viewer control, and a [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]] Viewer control.

The integrated report designer handles three types of reports:

* Section Reports with banded sections like the original ActiveReports (reminiscent of [[Microsoft Access]] reports)
* Page Reports with a fixed layout for forms 
* RDL Reports with a continuous page layout like the original Data Dynamics Reports (uses [[Report Definition Language]])

The Professional Edition of ActiveReports includes the Standard Edition tools plus an End-User Report Designer control that developers use to host the report designer in their own Microsoft Windows applications to let end users create and modify reports. It also includes a server-side ASP.NET web viewer with Flash, PDF, and HTML viewer types; ASP.NET HTTP Handlers that export reports to HTML or PDF format without custom code; a [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]] viewer; and advanced PDF encryption and rendering features.

==ActiveReports Server==
ActiveReports Server is a [[Scalability|scalable]] server platform with built in [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]]. It provides a secure and [[Extensibility|extensible]] report server to publish reports designed in ActiveReports. A comprehensive [[Representational state transfer|RESTful API]] enables integration of the [[Responsive web design|responsive]] [[HTML5]] Report Portal for end users to view, schedule and export reports.

==Known Issues==

In the past, ActiveReports was known to be unable to handle large reports.&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.asp.net/p/1454550/3327154.aspx?Re+System+Out+of+Memory+Exception+active+reports+asp+net+C+&lt;/ref&gt; This issue was ongoing across years and versions.&lt;ref&gt;http://arhelp.grapecity.com/groups/topic/approach-to-building-a-large-report/#post-502669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9365434/pdf-tmp-file-are-not-deleted-and-out-of-memory-exception-when-cachetodisk-is-us&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, development efforts have focused on improving large report handling in every release.

ActiveReports can be used in many ways, so each project can have a number of reasons for consuming memory. In newer versions, CacheToDisk and CacheToDiskLocation properties were added for PDF exports. Some other considerations that may cause too much memory use in section reports include:&lt;ref&gt;http://arhelp.grapecity.com/webhelp/AR10/index.html#OptimizingActiveReports.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* Large or repeated images on every page 
* Subreports in repeating sections instantiated in the wrong event so that many new instances are created instead of one
* Summaries in header sections that delay rendering 
* Report and Document object instances not released from memory

'''Agile Business Intelligence''' (BI) refers to the use of [[Agile software development]] for [[Business intelligence|BI]] projects to reduce the time it takes for traditional BI to show value to the organization, and to help in quickly adapting to changing business needs. Agile BI enables the BI team and managers to make better business decisions, and to start doing this more quickly.

==Agile BI==
'''Agile Business Intelligence (BI)''' refers to the use of the agile software development methodology for BI projects&lt;ref name="Enabling Agile Business Intelligence"&gt;{{cite web |title=Enabling Agile Business Intelligence with Balanced Insight Consensus |url=http://www.balancedinsight.com/wp-content/files/BIWhitepaper_EnablingAgileBI.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce the time-to-value of traditional BI and helps in quickly adapting to changing business needs.&lt;ref name="What is Agile BI"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Agile BI |url=http://www.nathean.com/index.php/what-is-agile-bi/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agile BI enables the BI team and managers to make better business decisions.  Agile methodology works on the iterative principle; this provides the new features of software to the end users sooner than the traditional waterfall process which delivers only the final product.  With Agile the requirements and design phases overlap with development, thus reducing the development cycles for faster delivery.  It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed iterative approach, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agile software development]]&lt;/ref&gt; Agile BI encourages business users and IT professionals to think about their data differently and it characterized by low Total Cost of Change (TCC).{{r|What is Agile BI}}  With agile BI, the focus is not on solving every BI problem at once but rather on delivering pieces of BI functionality in manageable chunks via shorter development cycles and documenting each cycle as it happens.&lt;ref&gt;DeSarra, Paul.  "BI Dashboards the Agile Way", BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE Journal • vol. 17, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Many companies fail to deliver right information to the right business managers at the right time.&lt;ref name="Three Steps to Analytic Heaven"&gt;White, David. "Agile BI – Three Steps to Analytic Heaven", April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
Agile BI is a continual process and not a onetime implementation.  Managers and leaders need accurate and quick information about the company and business intelligence provides the data they need.  Agile BI enables rapid development using the agile methodology.  Agile techniques are a great way to promote development of BI applications, such as dashboards, scorecards, reports and analytic applications.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Rick. "How to leverage agile BI to help your BI architecture", January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

"Forrester Research defines agile BI as an approach that combines processes, methodologies, tools and technologies, while incorporating organizational structure, in order to help strategic, tactical and operational decision-makers be more flexible and more responsive to ever-changing business and regulatory requirements".&lt;ref name="Getting a fast start with agile BI development" &gt;Violino, Bob. "Getting a fast start with agile BI development", ComputerWorld, Nov 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the research by the Aberdeen Group, organizations with the most highly agile BI implementations are more likely to have processes in place for ensuring that business needs are being met.{{r|Getting a fast start with agile BI development}}  Success of Agile BI implementation also heavily depends on the end user participation and "frequent collaboration between IT and the business".{{r|Getting a fast start with agile BI development}}

==Key Performance Criteria==
Aberdeen’s Maturity Class Framework{{r|Three Steps to Analytic Heaven}} uses three key performance criteria to distinguish the Best-in-class in the industry:

# '''Availability of timely management information''' – IT should be able to provide the right and accurate information in timely manner to the business managers to make sound business decisions.  “This performance metric captures the frequency with which business users receive their information they need in the timeframe they need it”{{r|Three Steps to Analytic Heaven}}.
# '''Average time required to add a column to an existing report''' – Sometimes new columns need to be added to an existing report to see the required information.  "If that information cannot be obtained within the time required to support the decision at hand, the information has no material value.  This metric measure the total elapsed time required to modify an existing report by adding a column"{{r|Three Steps to Analytic Heaven}}.
# '''Average time required to create a new dashboard''' – This metric considers the time required to access any new or updated information and it measures the total elapsed time required to create a new dashboard{{r|Three Steps to Analytic Heaven}}.

==The Agile SDLC==
[http://www.agiledata.org/essays/dataWarehousingBestPractices.html Agile SDLC Iterative Process]

==Five Steps To Agile BI==
Bruni&lt;ref name="5 Steps To Agile BI" /&gt;  in her article '''5 Steps To Agile BI''' outlines the five elements that promote an Agile BI enterprise environment.

# '''Agile Development Methodology''' – “need for an agile, iterative process that speeds the time to market of BI requests by shortening development cycles”.&lt;ref name="5 Steps To Agile BI"&gt;Bruni, Margherita. "5 Steps To Agile BI", Informationweek.com, June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Agile Project Management Methodology''' – continuous planning and execution.  Planning is done at the beginning of each cycle, rather than one time at the beginning of the project as in traditional projects.  In Agile project, scope can be changed any time during the development phase.
# '''Agile Infrastructure''' – the system should have virtualization and horizontal scaling capability.  This gives flexibility to easily modify the infrastructure and could also maintain near-real-time BI more easily than the standard [[Extract, transform, load]] (ETL) model{{r|5 Steps To Agile BI}}.
# '''Cloud &amp; Agile BI''' – Many organizations are implementing cloud technology now as it is the cheaper alternative to store and transfer data.  Companies who are in their initial stages of implementing Agile BI should consider the Cloud technology as cloud services can now support BI and ETL software to be provisioned in the cloud{{r|5 Steps To Agile BI}}.
# '''IT Organization &amp; Agile BI''' – To achieve agility and maximum effectiveness, the IT team should interact with the business, but also address the business problems and should have a strong and cohesive team{{r|5 Steps To Agile BI}}.

==Twelve Agile Principles==
There are 12 Agile Principles (Manifesto) [http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html Agile Manifesto] grouped as Process, People, and Other.

===Process===
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.&lt;ref name="Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse"&gt;"Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse"&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse" /&gt;

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.&lt;ref name="Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse" /&gt;

4. Working software is the primary measure of progress.&lt;ref name="Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse" /&gt;

===People===
5. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

6. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}.

7. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

===Other===
8. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face conversation.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

9. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

10. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

11. Simplicity-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-is essential.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

12. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.{{r|Agile – Does It Work With Data Warehouse}}

==BI model and its characteristic goals==
Kernochan, in his two-year study of organization’s BI process came up with the below model and its characteristic goals:{{r|What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means}}
# Data entry — accuracy  
# Data consolidation — consistency  
# Data aggregation — scope  
# Information targeting — fit  
# Information delivery — timeliness  
# Information analysis — analyzability

===Common Issues===
Kernochan’s study found these common issues with the current BI processes:{{r|What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means}}
* 20% of data has error in it (accuracy)  
* 50% of data is inconsistent (consistency)  
* It typically takes 7 days to get data to the end user (timeliness)  
* It isn't possible to do a cross-database query on 70% of company data (scope)  
* 65% of the time, executives don't receive the data they need (fit)  
* 60% of the time, users can't do immediate online analysis of data they receive (analyzability)  
* 75% of new key information sources that surface on the Web are not passed on to users within the year (agility) 
The result concluded that the adding of agility to existing business intelligence will minimize problems. 
Organizations are slowly trying to move the entire organization processes to agile methodology and development.  Agile BI will play a big part in company’s success as it "emphasizes integration with agile development and innovation".{{r|What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means}}

==Improving Business Intelligence Agility==
There are couple of factors that influence the success of Business Intelligence Agility.

===Data Entry===
20% of data is inaccurate and about 50% is inconsistent and these numbers increases with new type of data.  Processes need to be re-evaluated and corrected to minimize data entry errors.&lt;ref name="What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kernochan, Wayne. "What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means", IT Business Edge, April 7, 2011 |url=http://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/business-intelligence/what-agile-business-intelligence-really-means-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data Consolidation===
Often companies have multiple data stores and data is scattered across multiple data stores.  "Agility theory emphasizes auto-discovery of each new data source, and automated upgrade of metadata repositories to automatically accommodate the new information".{{r|What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means}}

===Data Aggregation===
Is a process in which information from many data stores is pulled and displayed in a summary report. [[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP) is a simple type of data aggregation tools which is commonly used.

===Information Delivery===
One of the key principal of Agile BI is to deliver the right data at the right time to the right individual.  Historical data should also be maintained for comparing the current performance with the past.{{r|What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means}}

===Information Analysis===
One of the largest benefits of Agile BI is in improving the decision-making of its users.  Real Agile BI should focus on analysis tools that make an operational process or new product development better.{{r|What Agile Business Intelligence Really Means}}  The Agile BI approach will save company money, time, and resources that would otherwise be needed to build a traditional data warehouse using the Waterfall methodology.

==Agile BI Checklist==
* A team of developers and business representatives should be assembled to work together
* Select either a business stakeholder or technical liaisons to represent the business
* Identify and prioritize appropriate user stories or requirements to address during an initial project{{r|Enabling Agile Business Intelligence}}
* Assess various Agile BI delivery tools that can integrate with your existing data warehouse and BI environment{{r|Enabling Agile Business Intelligence}}
* Initiate iterative development process

==Advantages of using Agile BI==
Agile BI drives its users to self-serve BI.  It offers organizations flexibility in terms of delivery, user adoption, and ROI.

===Faster to Deliver===
Using Agile methodology, the product is delivered in shorter development cycles with multiple iterations.&lt;ref name="Making Business Intelligence Easy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Making Business Intelligence Easy |url=http://www.yellowfinbi.com/Document.i4?DocumentId=118864}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each iteration is a working software and can be deployed to production.

===Increased User Acceptance===
In an Agile development environment, IT and business work together (often in the same room) refining the business needs in each iteration.{{r|Making Business Intelligence Easy}}  "This increases user adoption by focusing on the frequently changing needs of the non-technical business user, leading to high end-user engagement, and resulting in higher user adoption rates".{{r|Making Business Intelligence Easy}}

===Increased ROI===
Organizations can achieve increased rate-of-return (ROI) due to shorter development cycles.  This minimizes the IT resources and time while delivering working, relevant reports to end-users.{{r|Making Business Intelligence Easy}}

==Agile BI Best Practices==
# A program charter should be created, which will set the stakeholder expectations on how Agile BI system will work.&lt;ref name="BI Principles for Agile Development"&gt;Larson, Deanne.  "BI Principles for Agile Development", Business Intelligence Journal, Volume 14, Number 4, Pg 41, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# Start with the business information needs to provide context for scope.{{r|BI Principles for Agile Development}}
# Iterations should be time-boxed.{{r|BI Principles for Agile Development}}
# Stress on data discovery through the requirements and design phase.{{r|BI Principles for Agile Development}}
# Use the Agile process of incremental and iterative development and deployment.{{r|BI Principles for Agile Development}}
# Validate the BI Architecture and get approval on the proof of concept.{{r|BI Principles for Agile Development}}
# Data validation and verification should be completed for each development iteration.{{r|BI Principles for Agile Development}}
# Use flow charts or diagram to explain the BI process along with some documentation.{{r|BI Principles for Agile Development}}
# Any change that will be deployed to production should be thoroughly tested in regression environment.{{r|BI Principles for Agile Development}}
# Have a formal change control; this will minimize the risk as all changes have to be approved before it goes into production.{{r|BI Principles for Agile Development}}

'''Arrow diagramming method''' (ADM) is a network diagramming technique in which activities are represented by arrows.&lt;ref&gt;CPM in Construction – A Manual for General Contractors(Copyright 1965 by the Associated General Contractors of America)&lt;/ref&gt;  ADM is also known as the activity-on-arrow (AOA) method.  

==Usage==
ADM is used for scheduling activities in a [[project plan]].  Precedence relationships between activities are represented by circles connected by one or more arrows. The length of the arrow represents the duration of the relevant activity. ADM only shows finish-to-start relationships, meaning that each activity is completed before the successor activity starts.

Sometimes a "dummy task" is added, to represent a dependency between tasks, which does not represent any actual activity. The dummy task is added to indicate precedence that can't be expressed using only the actual activities. Such a dummy task often has a completion time of 0.

[[Image:Arrow Diagramming Method.png|500px|ADM example]]

Use of ADM as a common project management practice has declined with the adoption of computer-based scheduling tools.  In addition, the precedence diagram method (PDM), or activity-on-node (AON), is often favored over ADM.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, 4th Edition: ANSI/PMI 99-001-2008 (copyright Project Management Institute, Inc. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

ADM network drawing technique the start and end of each node or event is connected to an arrow.

The start of the arrow comes out of a node while the tip of the arrow goes into a node. Between the two nodes lies an arrow that represents the activity. 

The event represented by the circular node consumes neither time nor resources. 

* A node is a specific, definable achievement in the project. 
* It has zero duration and consumes nil resources. 
* All activities that lead into a node must be completed before the activity lines following this node  can start.

'''Brand culture''' is a company culture in which employees "live" to brand values, to solve problems and make decisions internally, and deliver a branded [[customer experience]] externally. It is the desired outcome of an internal [[brand]]ing, internal brand alignment or [[employee engagement]] effort that elevates beyond communications and training.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}

A '''bursar''' (derived from "[[wikt:bursa|bursa]]", [[Latin]] for ''[[Coin purse|purse]]'') is a professional [[finance|financial]] [[academic administration|administrator]] in a [[school]] or [[university]]. In the United States, bursars usually exist only at the level of higher education (4-year colleges and universities) or at private secondary schools. In Australia, Great Britain, and other countries, bursars are common at lower levels of education.

==Duties==

The Office of the Bursar is responsible for billing of student tuition accounts. This responsibility involves sending bills and making payment plans; the ultimate goal is to bring all student accounts to a "paid off" status. Bursars are not necessarily involved in the [[Student financial aid|financial aid]] process. Bursars' duties vary from one institution to another. At many institutions, bursars deal only with student finances. At other institutions, bursars also deal with some faculty finance issues. Elsewhere, they also oversee accounts receivable, or the payments that the university receives from outside organizations for which it performs services. In some institutions, all money held by the institution is the bursar's responsibility. Some Bursars (in the UK for instance) also have responsibility for payroll, investments, facilities, IT, HR, Health and Safety and oversight of admin functions at an institution.

The Bursar Statement is also known as a tuition [[invoice|bill]] or a student account bill.

The bursar often reports to a [[comptroller]]. For example, [[Barnard College]] employs an Associate Comptroller–Bursar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://barnard.edu/bursar Barnard College Bursar's webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the bursar has the same level as the comptroller, and both report to the director or vice president of finance. Some universities in the United States still have a Director of Student Financial Services whose role is similar to that of a bursar. The [[University of Pennsylvania]] employs an associate vice president who essentially combines the role of a bursar (using the student financial services title) and that of a [[Registrar (education)|registrar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfs.upenn.edu/about/index.htm UPenn website on student financial services]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable bursars ==
&lt;!--- Only add people with Wikipedia articles ---&gt;

===Fictional===
[[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' novels contain a character called "[[The Bursar]]". This character, like most other faculty members of Pratchett's [[Unseen University]], is almost always referred to by his job title.

In the ''[[Hamilton (musical)]]'' in the song "Aaron Burr, Sir", it is mentioned that Alexander Hamilton punched the bursar.

A '''business necessity''' is a legitimate [[business]] purpose that justifies an employment decision as effective and needed to optimally achieve the organization’s goals and ensure that operations run safely and efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, W. F., &amp; Aguinis, H. (2010). Applied Psychology in Human Resource Management,  Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This is often presented as a defense of an employment decision that is questioned because it was found to cause [[disparate impact]].

'''[[Capability management]]''' is the approach to the management of an organization, typically a business organization or firm, based on the "[[theory of the firm]]" as a collection of capabilities that may be exercised to earn revenues in the marketplace and compete with other firms in the industry. "Capability Management" seeks to manage the stock of capabilities within the firm to ensure its position in the industry and its ongoing profitability and survival.

Prior to the emergence of capability management, the dominant theory explaining the existence and competitive position of firms, based on [[Ricardian economics]], was the [[resource-based view of the firm]] (RBVF). The fundamental thesis of this theory is that firms derive their profitability from their control of resources – and are in competition to secure control of resources. Perhaps the best-known exposition of the Resource-based View of the Firm is that of one of its key originators: economist [[Edith Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edith Penrose|title= The Theory of the Growth of the Firm|publisher=New York, John Wiley and Sons|year=1959|isbn=978-0-19-828977-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Capability management" may be regarded as both an extension and alternative to the RBVF that asserts that it is not control over physical resources that is the basis for firm profitability but that "Companies, like individuals, compete on the basis of their ability to create and utilize knowledge;...".&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In short, firms compete not on the basis of control of resources but on the basis of superior [[Know-How]]. This Know-How is embedded in the capabilities of the firm – its abilities to do things that are considered valuable (in and by the market).

==Types of (business) capability==

Leonard defines three types of business capability that a firm might possess: Core Capabilities, Enabling Capabilities and Supplemental Capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=Drothy|title=Wellsprings of Knowledge|date=1995|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|isbn=0-87584-612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Core Capabilities are defined as those "built up over time", that "cannot be easily imitated" and therefore "constitute a competitive advantage for a firm". They are distinct from the other types of capability and sufficiently superior to similar capabilities in competitor organizations to provide a "sustainable competitive advantage". It is implied that such core capabilities are the product of sustained, long [[organizational learning]].

Supplemental Capabilities are defined as those that "add value to core capabilities but that could be imitated".

Enabling Capabilities are defined as those that "are necessary but not sufficient in themselves to competitively distinguish a company." In other words, enabling capabilities are those which a firm has to do, in support of its normal operations and core capabilities, but which are not themselves core capabilities (because they could be imitated, developed quickly or would not be very different from competitors' capabilities). Enabling capabilities are distinguished from supplemental capabilities in that they are required, but do not necessarily add value to core capabilities.

A business capability is ''what'' a company needs to do to execute its [[business strategy]] (e.g., enable ePayments, tailor solutions at point of sale, demonstrate product concepts with customers, combine elastic and non-elastic materials side by side, etc.).

Another way to think about a capability is that it is an assembly of people, process and technology for a specific purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Merrifield, Jack Calhoun and Dennis Stevens "The Next Revolution in Productivity", (''Harvard Business Review'', June, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Capability Management is the active management, over time, of the portfolio of capabilities in a firm – their development and depreciation in conscious response to changes in the business environment.

Capability management is an approach that uses the organization's customer value proposition to establish performance goals for capabilities based on value contribution. It helps drive out inefficiencies in capabilities that contribute low customer impact and focus efficiencies in areas with high financial leverage; while preserving or investing in capabilities for growth.

==Distinctive capabilities==

Oxford economist [[John Kay (economist)|John Kay]] defines Distinctive Capabilities as those capabilities a firm has which other firms cannot replicate even after they realize what the benefits are that owning the capability confers. These distinctive capabilities are the source or superior performance of successful firms. Kay's Distinctive Capabilities may be identified with Leonard's inimitable and hard-won "Core Capabilities". However, Kay goes further in arguing that in order for a capability to be truly distinctive and the basis for competitive advantage it must meet two further criteria: sustainability and appropriability.

Sustainability refers to the firm maintaining the distinctiveness and superiority of the capability relative to other firms despite their efforts to imitate or replicate it. One approach to sustainability is for the firm to develop the capability faster than the competitors through learning and innovation.

Appropriability refers to the firm securing the benefits of the capability – or the exercising of its capability – for itself as opposed to those benefits accruing to the firm's customers, its staff – management or employees, or its shareholders, regulators or other stakeholders. [[Intellectual Property Rights]] are one means for securing appropriability.

On the basis of analysis of empirical data regarding the performance of companies Kay argues that there are only a few types of distinctive capability that meet the additional criteria. Three are said to recur in the analysis: Innovation, Architecture and Reputation. These are briefly discussed below.

==Capability or competency?==

In a 1990 edition of the [[Harvard Business Review]], [[Gary Hamel]] and [[C.K.Prahalad]] published an article entitled "The Core Competence of the Corporation" which defined the notion of  a "[[core competency]]". Core Competencies are identified by three criteria: 1) they are difficult for competitors to imitate 2) they make a substantial contribution to a number of the firm's products (or services) they give the firm access to several markets and 3) they make a substantial contribution to the perceived customer-value of the products (or services). The (superior) competitive position of the firm's products (or services) in its markets is thought to be the expression of the firm's competitive advantage. Hamel and Prahald go on to assert that core competencies are the result of "collective learning across the corporation".

Since that publication there has been active debate in the academic literature as to whether (the concept of) "core competencies" is the same notion as core capabilities.  Several authors consider that the concepts are the same, the differences purely terminological, and use the terms interchangeably while others insist there is a substantive distinction. Given the similarities in their definitions it is a reasonable position to think they are the same. However, neither Leonard, nor Hamel and Prahalad (nor indeed Kay) were philosophically precise enough in their definitions and expositions of the concepts for the identity to be definitively established. One reasonable position is that "core competencies" are a view of "core capabilities" from a customers and products perspective while "core capabilities" are a view of "core competencies" from the perspective of knowledge and skills and staff and suppliers in firms. This may reflect the philosophical biases of their respective institutions.

Others, such as [[Max Boisot]], take the view that competence or competency is some measure of the level of performance in a capability or that competence is a much narrower concept than capability. Hence a firm may have a high or low level of competence in a particular, notional, abstract capability. There is some evidence that general managers often fail to appreciate the subtlety of the definition of "core competencies" and over-estimate the degree of their firm's competence in common capabilities. Consequently, they over-identify "things the firm is good at" as core competencies – which falls foul of the distinctiveness criterion for a core capability (and/or the inimitability criterion of core competencies and core capabilities). Hence some things managers mistakenly identify as "core competencies" may be more properly considered as Enabling or Supplemental Capabilities.

When applying the concepts of "core competence" or "core capability" academics and practitioners should be clear and precise as to their intended semantics for these ambiguous terms.

==Structure of a capability -or- dimensions of a core capability==

Leonard analyzes the nature of a (business) capability and concludes that core capabilities "comprise at least four interdependent dimensions" (pp.&amp;nbsp;19) as follows:
# Physical technical systems – machinery, databases, software systems etc.
# Managerial systems – systems for the management of operations, including operation of technical systems
# Skills and Knowledge (systems) – systems for the maintenance of personal and team skills and knowledge
# Values and Norms – systems for the regulation of behaviours and objectives in organizations
[[File:Dimensions of a Core Capability.jpg|thumb|right|Dimensions of a Core Capability]]
Around this complex of systems that realize a core capability Leonard situates a loop "Capability-Creating Activities" that comprise "Shared Problem Solving" and encompass Present and Future and Internal and External Perspectives (see Leonard, 1995, chapter 3). This capability development loop, is considered a system of organizational learning (knowledge-creating and knowledge-diffusing activities) and comprises the following activities:
#Problem Solving (in the context of the PRESENT)
#Implementing and Integrating (in the INTERNAL context)
#Experimenting (in the context of the FUTURE)
#Importing Knowledge (from the EXTERNAL context)
These activities, however, do not form a simple cycle or sequence and may be conducted in any order and several "in parallel" around any particular capability. It is these knowledge-creating and knowledge-diffusing (or knowledge-acquiring and knowledge-sharing) activities that make the capability dynamic (change over time) in the Leonard model.

Clearly, Leonard takes a [[System-of-Systems]] perspective on organizational or business or enterprise capabilities – and this establishes the link to the notion of a [[Capability (systems engineering)|Capability]] in [[Systems Engineering]]. Given that the Leonard model of a capability incorporates elements of skills and knowledge, and is adaptive and intelligent in the sense of importing knowledge from the external context, experimenting and problem-solving, while moving from present to future, it may be considered an ICASOS – an Intelligent Complex Adaptive System-of-Systems – model of an enterprise or firm. Note that the knowledge created and diffused in the Leonard model is organizational knowledge, not personal knowledge and is Know-How, not Know-That, that is often [[Tacit Knowledge]].

According to Hadaya and Gagnon, in their book ''Business Architecture - The Missing Link is Strategy Formulation, Implementation and Execution'', a business capability is an integrated set of resources designed to work together to achieve a particular result&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/989865288|title=Business architecture : the missing link in strategy formulation, implementation and execution|last=Hadaya|first=Pierre|last2=Gagnon|first2=Bernard|publisher=ASATE Publishing|year=2017|isbn=9780994931900|location=Montréal|pages=59-60|oclc=989865288}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A capability is always made up of one or more business functions, business processes, organizational units, know-how assets, information assets and technology assets. ″For example, to have the capability to Fabricate Metal Parts, an organization must have the necessary machines (technology assets), the knowledge of how to operate them (know-how assets), the specific sequence of activities needed to fabricate the parts (process), the drawings of the parts to be fabricated (information assets), and the teams of people (organizational units) specializing in the various types of fabrication required to make the parts (business functions)″&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. According to these authors, some capabilities also include one or more brands or natural resource deposits. Indeed, ″the Coca Cola Company could not sell 1.9 billion servings a day in more than 200 countries were it not for the power of its brands″&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In turn, for a farmer to be able to Produce Vegetables, he must have not only the right business functions, business processes, organizational units, know-how assets, information assets and technology assets, but also a piece of land (natural resource deposit) on which to grow his vegetables. A business capability can also be made up of lower-level capabilities. For example, to have the capability to manufacture cars, an organization must have several lower-level capabilities, including the capability to manufacture engines and the capability to fabricate and assemble the bodywork of the cars.

The consideration of a portfolio of capabilities in an enterprise in the context of the PRESENT and FUTURE contexts, with the Importing of Knowledge from the EXTERNAL context and the Implementing and Integrating of Knowledge in the INTERNAL context, establishes the link to [[Enterprise Architecture]]. In Enterprise Architecture this knowledge and planning of present-to-future evolution is diffused through the medium of models shared and used throughout the enterprise.

==Dynamic capabilities theory==
The Leonard model of a Capability is a dynamic model at the micro-level; focused on the detailed mechanisms for development and change of individual capabilities. Building on the work of Hamel and Prahalad, and others [[David Teece]] and colleagues developed a macro-level theory of [[Dynamic capabilities]] and framework for their management. In this theory a (or perhaps ''the'') "Dynamic Capability" is defined as "the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teece, D., Pisano, G., &amp; Shuen, A.|title=Dymamic Capabilities and Strategic Management|journal=Strategic Management Journal|date=1997|volume=18|issue=7|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::aid-smj882&gt;3.0.co;2-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on earlier work from the 1960s, the central thesis of the Dynamic Capabilities theory is that "... the real key to a company's success or even to its future development lies in its ability to find or create a competence that is truly distinctive". In this literature the term "competence" is used in both the sense of degree of performance in some capability and as a low-level, short-term capability. Competence in the latter sense echoes the concepts from Hamel and Prahalad, but may also be identified with Leonard's Enabling and Supplemental Capabilities as well as the short-term Core Capabilities of a firm. The term "capabilities" is also used somewhat interchangeably with "competencies".

The competencies or low-level capabilities are regarded as assets or knowledge-resources of the enterprise, alongside physical assets and other resources that are difficult for competitor firms to acquire. In this sense Teece's Dynamic Capabilities Theory is a move back towards the Resource-Based View of the Firm, but with a broader notion of "Resources" that includes intangible knowledge-based and practice-based resources, not just tangible assets. In the Dynamic Capabilities Theory, "Resources" are firm-specific assets that are difficult for competitors to acquire or imitate, "Organizational Routines" (based on prior work of Nelson and Winter) or "Organizational Competences" are the low-level capabilities of the firm and "Core Competences" are taken from the Hamel and Prahalad concept. Citing Dorothy Leonard (or Leonard-Barton), Teece et al. define (higher-level) Dynamic Capabilities as the "ability to integrate, build and reconfigure" these tangible and intangible assets.
"Dynamic Capabilities thus reflect an organizations ability to achieve new and innovative forms of competitive advantage given path dependencies and market positions."

"Path dependencies" refers to the history of development of organizational knowledge embedded in its capabilities, routines and technological assets – echoing the concept from Leonard, but on a macro-scale and explaining why competitive advantage takes time and persistence to build. The incorporation of "Routines" and path-dependent development of firms in the theory establishes the link to evolutionary theories of management and (business) strategy.

The Dynamic Capabilities Theory also refers to notions of coherence, congruence and complementary assets across the firms portfolio of assets, routines, competencies and capabilities. This has resonances with similar notions of coherence in [[System-of-Systems Engineering]] and in [[Enterprise Architecture]].

Teece et al. also discuss Technological Assets, Structural Assets and Reputational Assets – echoing the three recurrent categories of Distinctive Capability identified by John Kay – Innovation, Architecture and Reputation. The discussion of technological assets and technology-based competences establishes the link to [[Technology Management]] and [[Technology Strategy]]. Teece et al. also discuss organizational structure, market/industry structure, organizational boundaries, notions of co-specialization in assets, cross-firm integration and the trade-offs between hierarchical management control and a nexus of contracts. This presages notions of the "[[Virtual Enterprise]]" or "Extended Enterprise" and establishes the link to [[Enterprise Architecture]].

It can be seen therefore that Dynamic Capabilities Theory is a highly integrative theory of the firm that links a wide range of fields including Business Strategy, Strategic Management, Knowledge Management, Technology Management, Technology Strategy, Systems Thinking, Enterprise Architecture or Enterprise Engineering and others.

From the perspective of Dynamic Capabilities Theory, Capability Management is the approach to management that focuses on the development of the portfolio of capabilities (resources, assets, routines, knowledge etc.) available to the firm, and the meta level capability of reconfiguring them and integrating them for market exploitation and competitive advantage.

==Capability management in defence==

[[Capability management in defence]] has a history dating back to the early years of the 21st Century.
The [[UK Ministry of Defence]] adapted the existing [[DoDAF]] architecture framework to the procurement practices of what was then the MOD Procurement Executive, later Defence Equipment and Support, – in particular a [[Capability management]] approach to Defence procurement called "Through-Life Capability Management" (TLCM). The DoDAF was extended with additional 'Views' for capability planning and notions of capability configurations and capability increments. These views were standard ways to represent how the capabilities in some segment of the Defence Enterprise (such as the Army, Navy or Air Force) were expected to or planned to evolve over time, given investments by MOD and the UK Government. This was published in 2004 as the MOD Architecture Framework ([[MODAF]]) version 1.0. The current, and probably last, version of MODAF is 1.4. This will be the last version since MOD intends to migrate to the forthcoming new version of the [[NATO Architecture Framework]], which incorporates much from MODAF, including the concepts and views of capability planning. The notion of capability in MODAF, however, is slightly different from the notion of capability in, for example, Dynamic Capabilities Theory.

In MODAF "Capability" refers to a ''military'' capability – an ability to produce military effects – or enabling or supporting capabilities. Nevertheless, the central thesis that politico-military conflicts or business competitions in markets are contests in which the organisation or enterprise with the superior capabilities wins holds. On this basis the same capability-based strategy and planning techniques are thought to be effective in both spheres.

The aim of "Through-Life Capability Management" (TLCM) was to promote in defence procurement a shift of perspective away from a focus on military equipment towards what was really required from UK Defence organizations: the capabilities, or abilities to produce effects in the world that enhance UK national security. The MOD considers that such capabilities are delivered by trans-organisation networks of operational units across the Defence Enterprise – and hence uses the terminology "[[Network Enabled Capability]]" (NEC). This is (a part of) MOD's interpretation of the concept of [[Network Centric Warfare]] which itself was a 1990s interpretation of a [[System-Of-Systems]] approach or perspective in the context of Defence.

The earlier cultural focus on equipment had led to over-specification, incoherent equipment purchases, unnecessary duplication, an over-emphasis on initial purchase costs, insufficient consideration of recurrent support and maintenance costs, project and programme delays and significant cost overruns that the UK Government could no longer tolerate. TLCM promoted a capability lifecycle perspective, that sought a balanced investment profile in time that would minimise whole-life costs, while efficiently producing effective, coherent and maximally cost-effective Defence capabilities over the medium term – and thereby ensuring maximum Value-for-Money for the UK taxpayer from Defence. TLCM was therefore central to the strategic planning of the evolution of the UK Defence Enterprise. While formally superseded, elements of TLCM live on in MOD's whole-systems, non-equipment-centric System-Of-Systems Approach, which was mandated in UK Defence Strategic Direction in 2013.

==Capability management and strategic management==

==Capability management and enterprise architecture==

Capability-based planning had long been entrenched in the Defense realm in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada before it was adopted within Version 9 of [[The Open Group Architecture Framework|The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap32.html#tag_32_02 | title =Capability-Based Planning Paradigm | date =2011 | publisher =[[The Open Group]] | access-date =18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capability Management has in recent years become a popular sub-discipline or method of [[Enterprise Architecture]]. Enterprise Architecture seeks to build a rigorous model of an enterprise that identifies its component parts and their relationships for the purpose of planning the evolution of the enterprise. A Capability Management perspective – such as Leonard's model or Teece's Dynamic Capabilities Theory – suggests that a firm is best viewed as a collection of capabilities that have a composition from and configuration of the tangible and intangible assets of the firm. In this view the firm and its portfolio of capabilities evolve in response to the (perceived) demands of the business environment. An enterprise may comprise one or more firms, or parts of firms (or other types of organization) and their interrelationships – and so is describable (may be modelled) in the same terms.

In the IBM Enterprise Architecture Method, the "Enterprise Capabilities Neighborhood" – a segment of the overall Enterprise Architecture description or model – "captures the strategic intent of the enterprise". It "provides the bridge from the organization's strategy to the architectural building blocks that enable and realize the strategy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Doucet |editor-first=G. |editor2-last=Gotze |editor2-first=J. |editor3-last=Saha |editor3-first=P. |editor4-last=Bernard |editor4-first=S.|last=Collins |first=F.C. |last2=De Meo |first2=P.|chapter=Realizing the Business Value of Enterprise Architecture through Architecture Building Blocks|title=Coherency Management – Architecting the Enterprise for Alignment, Agility and Assurance|date=2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4389-9606-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the IBM EA Method, "Both the Enterprise Capabilities and Business Architecture are technology independent." It is not clear how this view can be rationalised and made coherent with the Leonard model or the Teece theory which places some technology-implemented system at the center of a capability. Collins and De Meo go on to assert that "To focus the EA (description) on delivering the right plan for the enterprise, it must be based on a detailed understanding of the Enterprise Capabilities the enterprise has decided it needs...". Collins and De Meo's "Enterprise Capabilities" can thus be identified with Leonard's "Core Capabilities". The IBM EA Method defines the "Strategic Capability Network" which "depicts the strategic capabilities and associated enablers of a business, their interrelationships and their combined roles and significance in ... the value net of a business." The SCN is therefore a modeling technique and [[network theory|network analysis]] method that expresses both the Leonard model of Core, Enabling and Supplemental capabilities, the Hamel and Prahalad notion of core competencies and, given EA's time dimension of enterprise evolution, the Dynamic Capabilities Theory.

==Capability management topics==

===Capability vs. process===
A process is ''how'' the capability is executed. Much of the reengineering revolution or [[Business process reengineering]] focused on how to redesign business processes.

===Business vs. organizational capability===
An organization capability refers to the potential of the people in an organization and their [[cooperation]] to get things done.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Ulrich and Norn Smallwood, How Leaders Build Value: Using People, Organization, and Other Intangibles to Get Bottom-Line Results (Jossey-Bass, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  The way leaders foster shared mindset, talent, change, accountability, and collaboration across boundaries define the company's culture and leadership edge.

===Capability vs. competency===
[[Dave Ulrich]] makes a distinction between capabilities and [[competence (human resources)|competencies]]: individuals have competencies while organizations have capabilities.  Both competencies and capabilities have technical and social elements.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Individual !! Organization
|-
| Technical|| Functional Competencies|| Business Capabilities
|-
| Social|| Leadership Competencies|| Organizational Capabilities
|}

At the individual-technical intersection, employees in the firm bring functional skills and competencies such as programming, cost accounting, electrical engineering, etc. At the individual-social intersection, leaders also have a set of competencies or skills such as setting the strategic agenda and building relationships. Moving to the intersection of organizational and technical, are business capabilities. In short, they are the technical things or what the firm must know how to do to execute strategy. For example, a financial service firm must know how to manage risk and design innovative products.
Finally, we have organization capabilities such a talent management, collaboration, and accountability. They integrate all the other parts of the firm and bring it together. When leaders have mastered certain competencies, organization capabilities become visible. For example, when a leaders master "turning vision in to action" and "aligning the organization," the organization a whole shows more [[accountability]].

==History of capability modeling in business==
Capability management's earlier ancestors include the [[value chain]], also known as value chain analysis, first described and popularized by [[Michael Porter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1985 |title=Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[core competency|Core competencies]] (also called core capabilities) are what give a company one or more competitive advantages in creating and delivering value to its customers in its chosen field, a cluster of extraordinary abilities or the [[excellence]] that a firm acquires from its founders, and which cannot be easily imitated.

Lee Perry, Randall Stott and Norm Smallwood&lt;ref&gt;Lee Perry, Randall Stott and Norm Smallwood ''Real Time Strategy'' (Wiley 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; added to the capabilities body of work the concepts of strategic options based on customer value proposition and business focus&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin B. Tregoe and John W. Zimmerman ''Top Management Strategy'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1980) Business Focus builds on the work of the "driving force" and "nine strategic areas" and how they suggest capabilities needed.&lt;/ref&gt; and types of work which characterized work as either:

* Unit of competitive advantage (UCA) – the work and capabilities that create distinctiveness for the business in the marketplace
* Value-added support work – the work and capabilities that facilitate the UCA
* Essential support work – the work that doesn't support UCA or facilitate it but must be done to operate the business

Building on earlier themes, the concept of [[dynamic capabilities]] was introduced in 2000. The basic assumption of the dynamic capabilities framework is that in fast changing markets, firms need to respond quickly and innovatively.

Around the same time, Richard Lynch, John Diezemann and James Dowling extended the concepts above in ''The Capable Company: Building the capabilities that make strategy work''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lynch, John Diezemann and James Dowling, ''The Capable Company: Building the capabilities that make strategy work'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Key additions to the body of work were tools to translate strategic shifts to new sets of capabilities required whether these were core competencies or not. Building on the types of work ideas, the authors added performance target setting based on the capability value contribution. When compared to actual performance, the method outlined an approach to identify capability gaps and priorities. They also laid out a framework to continually align capabilities based on strategy shifts and external changes through the project agenda. The first full capability model was built by the authors in 2001 as the framework for the demerger of Intercontinental Hotels Group (then known as Six Continents) from the parent Six Continents PLC (formerly Bass &amp; Co Brewery).&lt;ref&gt;James Larson and Richard Lynch, "Reinventing a Hotel Company" (''BPM Connections'', October/November 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The model included thee levels of capabilities, value contribution, performance targets, capability gaps, recommended actions and sourcing decisions.

In 2004, the [[UK Ministry of Defence]] released its [[enterprise architecture framework]], [[MODAF]]. This framework extended the existing [[DoDAF]] specification by adding views for capability planning. These views were standard ways to represent how the enterprise was expected to perform over time, expressed in terms of capabilities.

Other important contributions include the concept of value maps for detailing the customer proposition and more recently the profit proposition to identify capabilities that will help create [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]. Value maps extend the work of real-time strategy and the capable company by depicting a strategy canvas and providing an action framework to capture markets. In the mid-2000s, a team at Microsoft, in concert with Accelare, developed the motion methodology – a capability-based framework.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Merrifield, ''Rethink: What do you need to do today?'' (FT Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ric Merrifield, Jack Calhoun and Dennis Stevens, in "The Next Revolution in Productivity" added the use of SOA and its role in supporting capability delivery at breakthrough cost and speed.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Merrifield, Jack Calhoun and Dennis Stevens "The Next Revolution in Productivity", (''Harvard Business Review'', June, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Also introduced was the use of heats maps for capability analyses.

==Capability management frameworks==
A complete picture of the capabilities is the enterprise capability model.&lt;ref&gt;''Capability-Based Management'' (White Paper from Accelare, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a blueprint for the business expressed in terms of the capabilities necessary to execute strategy including delivery of services. Capabilities are described in levels of abstraction; usually three levels of details:

* Family of capabilities; often shown as [[chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s
* Groups of capabilities; illustrated in the health care provider diagram
* Specific capabilities; the level of detail to assess capabilities

At the higher level, are the attributes of ownership, location, and project road maps. The lower level is where the action is and where performance targets are set, performance assessed and gaps noted. It is at this level sourcing decisions are made or projects established to close gaps. The framework includes strategic, core and enabling capabilities.

* Strategic capabilities: capabilities in organizational planning, strategy, and investment
* Core capabilities: the inventory of business capabilities that are identified as delivering the products and services that an organization offers to its market.
*  Enabling capabilities: the inventory of business capabilities that are required to support them but not sold or offered to the market

===Strategic planning===
Companies like Harvard Pilgrim Health Care&lt;ref&gt;Jack Calhoun, Richard Lynch and Jim Dowling, "The Cost-Take-Out Challenge",  (www.accelare.com).&lt;/ref&gt; and Intercontinental Hotels Group&lt;ref&gt;James Larson and Richard Lynch, "Reinventing a Hotel Company"(October/November 2004 issue of ''BPM Connections'')&lt;/ref&gt; have used capabilities to focus on where to take out costs and outsource non strategic capabilities while improving service and adding brands.

===IT–business alignment===
Microsoft is using capability models to enter into conversations with clients to identify capability and process pain points to better align IT solutions to the business.[http://www.microsoft.com/applicationplatform/about/applicationplatformoptimization.mspx%20%20Microsoft%20APO%5D]

===New growth platforms===
Capabilities are also being used in new [[growth platforms|growth platform]] development.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L.  Laurie, Claude Sheer and Yves Doz, "New Growth Platforms" (''Harvard Business Review'', May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Platforms are a foundation that spawns multiple products and/or services that, by themselves, are eventually the size of a business unit.&lt;ref&gt;Leander Kahney, "Straight Dope on the IPod's Birth" (''Wired'', October 17, 2006) illustrates this concept well.&lt;/ref&gt; These innovations result from identifying new domains created at the intersection of enablers or "unstoppable trends" and customer dynamics, linked to an essential set of core capabilities called the platform logic: those capabilities that are unique, valuable, and portable.

==Capability value contribution==
Building of the earlier type of work logic, Accelare added a distinction in assessment of the capabilities necessary to operative the business by examining the financial impact as well as the customer impact.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Calhoun, Richard Lynch and Jim Dowling, ''The Cost-Take-Out Challenge'', (Accelare, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

::::'''Figure 3: Capability value contribution to strategy'''
[[File:Capability Value Contribution.jpg]]

Some capabilities directly contribute to the customer value proposition and have a high impact on company financials. These "advantage capabilities" are shown in the upper right. Value contribution is assured when performance is among the best in peer organizations at acceptable cost. Keep them inside and protect the intellectual property. Moving to the top left quadrant, strategic support capabilities have high contribution in direct support of advantage capabilities. Keep them close. Value contribution is assured when performed above industry parity at competitive cost. Other capabilities shown in the bottom right are essential. They may not be visible to the customer but contribute to company's business focus and have a big impact on the bottom line.  Focus on efficiency improvement; especially in high volume work.  Value contribution is assured when performed at industry parity performance below competitors' cost. Other capabilities are "business necessity". Value contribution is assured when performed at industry parity performance below competitors' costs. They can be candidates for alternate sourcing.

==Gap analysis and heat maps==
A capability gap assessment can be portrayed in a [[heat map]].

* A heat map is a visualization of which capabilities required attention.
* A heat index is calculated using effectiveness and efficiency scores and the gap between targeted and actual performance; high heat (red/orange) in the gap column suggests investment.

Capability value contribution helps stack rank investments, for example advantage capabilities with high heat move to the top of the agenda, followed by business essential capabilities with large inefficiencies.

The fund can also draw upon $140 million in funds underwritten by [[reinsurance]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21729003-too-little-not-too-late-caribbeans-pioneering-form-disaster-insurance|title=The Caribbean’s pioneering form of disaster insurance|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other regions have since setup similar government disaster instance including in the [[African Union]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== History ==
In 2008, CCRIF made its first payout to the government of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] in response to damage from [[Hurricane Ike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claimsjournal.com/news/international/2008/09/10/93527.htm

During its formative years, day-to-day operations were handled by Caribbean Risk Managers Limited (CaribRM), who acted as the facility supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100428/business/business1.html |title=CCRIF management contract up for grabs |publisher=Jamaica Gleanor |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2016-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501173655/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100428/business/business1.html |archivedate=2010-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Isaac Anthony, previously a member of the Board of Directors of CCRIF and the Permanent Secretary for Planning and National Development in the Government of [[St Lucia]], was appointed the first Chief Executive Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/CCRIF-appoints-CEO_13423754 |title=CCRIF appoints CEO |publisher=Jamaica Observer |date=2013-01-18 |accessdate=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, CCRIF reorganized into a segregated portfolio company, and expanded its product line to include parametric insurance for excess rainfall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2014/08/11/337230.htm |title=CCRIF/Swiss Re Offer Caribbean Governments Insurance against Excess Rainfall |publisher=Insurance Journal |date=2014-08-11 |accessdate=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to offer its portfolio of insurance products to countries in Central America, including members of the Council of Ministers of Finance of Central America, Panama and the Dominican Republic (COSEFIN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2015/04/20/365020.htm |title=Caribbean, Central American Countries Sign Cat Risk Insurance Partnership |publisher=Insurance Journal |date=2015-04-20 |accessdate=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCRIF also was the first company to participate in the [[World Bank]] Capital-at-Risk Notes Program to diversify its sources of risk capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2014/07/10/334175.htm |title=CCRIF Members to Benefit from World Bank’s First Cat Bond Issuance |publisher=Insurance Journal |date=2014-07-10 |accessdate=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Group of Seven (G7)|G7]] leaders summit in 2015, CCRIF SPC was highlighted as an example to be used, "... to increase by up to 400 million the number of people in the most vulnerable developing countries who have access to direct or indirect insurance coverage against the negative impact of climate change related hazards by 2020..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/08/g-7-leaders-declaration |title=G-7 Leaders' Declaration |publisher=White House |date=2015-06-08 |accessdate=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris, [[Ban Ki-moon]], Secretary General of the United Nations, mentioned CCRIF SPC as an example as he launched an initiative on climate resilience that included increased access to insurance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=9295 |title=Secretary-General’s remarks at High-level meeting on Climate Resilience |publisher=United Nations |date=2015-11-30 |accessdate=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and President Obama announced a commitment of $30&amp;nbsp;million by the United States government to provide additional insurance through platforms, including CCRIF, in his remarks to the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] at the Paris Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/12/01/these-countries-are-the-moral-center-of-the-climate-debate-can-obama-help-them/ |title=These countries are the ‘moral center’ of the climate debate. Will they be left behind? |publisher=Washington Post |date=2014-07-10 |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[World Bank]] announced a partnership with CCRIF SPC to create a new insurance product to protect food security and promote the resilience of the small-scale fisheries sector in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/01/07/as-climate-change-hits-the-caribbean-partners-collaborate-to-boost-resilience-and-rejuvenate-coasts |title=As Climate Change Hits the Caribbean, Partners Collaborate To Boost Resilience and Rejuvenate Coasts |publisher=World Bank |date=2016-01-07 |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the World Bank announced the Pandemic Emergency Facility built using CCRIF SPC as a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2016/06/09/416507.htm |title=Pandemics and Climate Change Present Opportunity for Insurers |publisher=Insurance Journal |date=2016-06-09 |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2374">The '''category development index''' (CDI) measures the sales performance of a category of goods or services in a specific group, compared with its average performance among all consumers.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics&gt;Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). ''Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0-13-705829-2}}. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in ''Marketing Metrics'' as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, CDI measures the sales strength of a particular product category within a specific market (e.g., soft drinks in 10–50 year old's).

==Purpose==
The purpose of the CDI metric is to quantify the relative performance of a category within specified customer groups. The CDI helps marketers identify strong and weak segments (usually demographic or geographic) for categories of goods and services.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

The CDI is useful in all marketing strategies when used with the [[Brand Development Index]] (BDI). The CDI can give vital data for marketers to allocate advertising to specific areas maximizing product category knowledge and profit.

==Construction==

CDI: An index of how well a category performs in a given market segment, relative to its performance in the market as a whole.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

::CDI (I) = 	
::[Category sales to group (#) ÷ Households in group (#)] ÷ 
::[Total category sales (#) ÷ Total households (#)]
::''Note: Although defined here with respect to households, these indexes could also be calculated for customers, accounts, businesses, or other entities.'' &lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

For example, Boston enjoys high per-capita consumption of ice cream. Bavaria and Ireland show higher per-capita consumption of beer than Iran.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8211">'''Cohort analysis''' is a subset of [[behavioral analytics]] that takes the [[data]] from a given [[data set]] (e.g. an [[e-commerce]] platform, [[web application]], or online game) and rather than looking at all users as one unit, it breaks them into related groups for analysis. These related groups, or [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s, usually share common characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span.  Cohort analysis allows a company to “see patterns clearly across the life-cycle of a customer (or user), rather than slicing across all customers blindly without accounting for the natural cycle that a customer undergoes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lean Analytics: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster|publisher=O'Reilly|location=Sebastopol, CA|isbn=1449335675|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=VJS5qQWOKUIC|author=Alistair Croll|author2=Benjamin Yoskovitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By seeing these patterns of time, a company can adapt and tailor its service to those specific cohorts. While cohort analysis is sometimes associated with a [[cohort study]], they are different and should not be viewed as one and the same. Cohort analysis is specifically the analysis of cohorts in regards to [[big data]] and [[business analytics]], while in cohort study, data is broken down into similar groups.

==Examples==
The goal of a business analytic tool is to analyze and present actionable information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aukeman|first=Mark|title=Cohort Analysis — understanding your customers|url=http://edwblog.com/adhoc/cohort-analysis-%E2%80%94-understanding-customer-behavior/32|work=edwblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a company to act on such information it must be relevant to the situation under analysis. A database full of thousands or even millions of entries of all user data makes it tough to gain actionable data, as that data spans many different categories and time periods. Actionable cohort analysis allows for the ability to drill down to the users of each specific cohort to gain a better understanding of their behaviors, such as if users checked out, and how much did they pay.  In cohort analysis "each new group [cohort] provides the opportunity to start with a fresh set of users,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Balogh|first=Jonathon|title=Introduction to Cohort Analysis for Startups|url=http://jonathonbalogh.com/2012/03/24/introduction-to-cohort-analysis-for-startups/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  allowing the company to look at only the data that is relevant to the current query and act on it.

In eCommerce, a firm may only be interested in customers who signed up in the last two weeks and who made a purchase, which is an example of a specific cohort. A software developer may only care about the data from users who sign up after a certain upgrade, or who use certain features of the platform.

[[File:Cohort Analysis Chart - Gaming Example.png|200px|thumbnail|right]]An example of cohort analysis of gamers on a certain platform: Expert gamers, cohort 1, will care more about advanced features and lag time compared to new sign-ups, cohort 2. With these two cohorts determined, and the analysis run, the gaming company would be presented with a visual representation of the data specific to the two cohorts. It could then see that a slight lag in load times has been translating into a significant loss of revenue from advanced gamers, while new sign-ups have not even noticed the lag. Had the company simply looked at its overall revenue reports for all customers, it would not have been able to see the differences between these two cohorts. Cohort analysis allows a company to pick up on patterns and trends and make the changes necessary to keep both advanced and new gamers happy.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Deep actionable cohort analytics==
"An actionable metric is one that ties specific and repeatable actions to observed results [like user registration, or checkout]. The opposite of actionable metrics are vanity metrics (like web hits or number of downloads) which only serve to document the current state of the product but offer no insight into how we got here or what to do next."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Maurya|first=Ash|title=3 Rules to Actionable Metrics in a Lean Startup|url=http://leanstack.com/3-rules-to-actionable-metrics/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without actionable analytics the information that is being presented may not have any practical application, as the only data points represent vanity metrics that do not translate into any specific outcome. While it is useful for a company to know how many people are on their site, that metric is useless on its own. For it to be actionable it needs to relate a "repeatable action to [an] observed result".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Performing cohort analysis==
In order to perform a proper cohort analysis, there are four main stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Cohort Analysis to Optimize Customer Experience|url=http://uxmag.com/articles/using-cohort-analysis-to-optimize-customer-experience|work=UX Magazine|author=James Torio|author2=Rishabh Dayal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Determine what question you want to answer.''' The point of the analysis is to come up with actionable information on which to act in order to improve business, product, user experience, turnover, etc. To ensure that happens, it is important that the right question is asked. In the gaming example above, the company was unsure why they were losing revenue as lag time increased, despite the fact that users were still signing up and playing games.
* '''Define the metrics that will be able to help you answer the question.''' A proper cohort analysis requires the identification of an event, such as a user checking out, and specific properties, like how much the user paid. The gaming example measured a customer's willingness to buy gaming credits based on how much lag time there was on the site.
* '''Define the specific cohorts that are relevant.''' In creating a cohort, one must either analyze all the users and target them or perform attribute contribution in order to find the relevant differences between each of them, ultimately to discover and explain their behavior as a specific cohort. The above example splits users into "basic" and "advanced" users as each group differs in actions, pricing structure sensitivities, and usage levels.
* '''Perform the cohort analysis.''' The analysis above was done using [[data visualization]] which allowed the gaming company to realize that their revenues were falling because their higher-paying advanced users were not using the system as the lag time increased. Since the advanced users were such a large portion of the company's revenue, the additional basic user signups were not covering the financial losses from losing the advanced users. In order to fix this, the company improved their lag times and began catering more to their advanced users.

==Company history==

Computhink Incorporated was founded in 1994 near Chicago, Illinois. The company originally sold a high security identification card production and management software program called IDtel. In their first year, Computhink sold one hundred IDtel systems to the United Nations for $1 million and became their sole ID tag provider. After the success with IDtel, Computhink created their first image viewing and management software program, The Paperless Office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Nicole|title=Computhink Introduces A New Concept With The Innovative Product, The Paperless Office; New Product Is Considered An Office Information Manager.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Computhink+Introduces+A+New+Concept+With+The+Innovative+Product,+The...-a019100192|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|publisher=the free library|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995. This was the first 32-bit software package designed for personal, single user, image viewer and image management use. Originally sold as a single user system, The Paperless Office was later developed to be used as a multiple user system.

By 1996, Computhink had operating offices in Chicago, London, Kuwait, South Africa, and Moscow with 85 total employees and consultants, and annual revenue exceeded $15 million. The single-user product was phased out, and network versions for small businesses were created and offered. As customer needs changed, Computhink moved from image management to document management. The reseller channel was developed in the United States and Internationally.

Between 1998 and 1999, The Paperless Office and IDtel were sold in 29 countries, across six continents. At this time, Computhink purchased Whetstone Technologies, the primary partner of Novell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computhink Works with Novell To Provide an Extensive Suite of Integrated Imaging and Document Management Facilities for GroupWise|url=http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/gwmag/assets/computhink_imaging_press_release.pdf|website=www.novell.com|publisher=Novell|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to further expand their market presence. The Paperless Office was re-developed in Java and launched as ViewWise, the first ever server-based image-enabling product in the industry. In 2000, ViewWise became Novell’s preferred imaging partner, and Computhink decided to forego any involvement with the Whetstone Technologies products.

The network for domestic and international resellers was updated and broadened in 2006. Computhink became qualified as a Microsoft Front Runner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Britton|first1=Lauren|title=Computhink Becomes a Microsoft ''Front Runner'' With Its ViewWise Document Management Software|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060501005864/en/Computhink-Microsoft-Front-Runner-ViewWise-Document-Management|website=www.businesswire.com|publisher=business wire|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing them to release solutions alongside Microsoft’s product line. By 2008, Computhink had begun incorporating partnerships and connections with Kodak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kontaktujte nás|title=KODAK Capture Pro Software Adds Output Module for Scanning Data into COMPUTHINK VIEWWISE Document Management Software|url=http://graphics.kodak.com/cz/cs/about_gcg/news/2010/100811b.htm|website=graphics.kodak.com|publisher=Eastman Kodak Company|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canon, and other third party viewers that complemented document management software. Computhink reached Tier III for the United Nations.

In 2013, the staff at Computhink realized that since 2006, the market’s needs and interests had shifted from document management to content management. Despite consistent updates and enhancements of ViewWise, the company decided to take the next step. The product was rebranded to Contentverse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHICAGO: Enterprise Content Management Company Computhink Announces Product Rebranding to Contentverse|url=http://www.veooz.com/news/20069Z.html|website=www.veooz.com|publisher=Heraldonline|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the eighth version of the software. In 2014, version 8.1 of Contentverse was released.

'''Data plan''' refers to data quotas from a [[telecommunication]]s or data hosting contract. Data plans are offered by [[internet service provider]]s. These include mobile data plans, offered on [[cellular network]]s, from cellular telephony companies, and those from conventional fixed [[land line]] links, amongst other forms of offered [[data communication]]s. Network data hosting servers also offer plans based on data served, such as for websites.

'''DealCenter''' is a social media platform and online meeting management system used at trade shows and events for arranging face-to-face meetings.  DealCenter, LLC was established January 2008 though the online meeting planner has been designed and in use by [[Jaymie Scotto &amp; Associates]] as an event planning product since 2005, pre-dating today’s social networking communities.  The DealCenter platform is an easy and user-friendly way to see who else is attending or exhibiting an event, to search the list of attendees by relevant information (such as company name, product offering or area served etc.) and then to create one-on-one meetings that will be held on-site at the event.  The DealCenter system is traditionally rolled out months before the show date, so attendees can pre-plan their meetings and attend the event with a scheduled timetable of targeted prospect, customer or partner meetings.

To utilize the platform, attendees and exhibitors log on to the customized event website and are able to see the profiles of other participants who will be attending the event. The DealCenter manages the meeting schedules, accepts or declines invitations and allows users to send secure messages via the DealCenter to further expand the business opportunity pipeline. All the planning is done through the platform interface, enabling users to arrive with a roster of meetings already scheduled and confirmed. No contact information is shared or released unless the user voluntarily provides it. The confirmed meetings are assigned a table number and held on-site in a designated area, including, if desired, meeting rooms, bilateral tables, exhibit booths and/or a DealCenter Area. 
The '''DealCenter Concierge Service''' is a new development within the DealCenter technology. The Concierge Service automatically schedules meetings on a user's behalf based on the information provided when creating a profile.

[[File:Decision Support System for John Day Reservoir.jpg|thumb|360px|Example of a decision support system for [[John Day Dam|John Day Reservoir]].]]
{{Recommender systems}}

A '''decision support system''' ('''DSS''') is an [[Information systems|information system]] that supports business or organizational [[decision-making]] activities. DSSs serve the management, operations and planning levels of an organization (usually mid and higher management) and help people make decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified in advance—i.e. unstructured and semi-structured decision problems. Decision support systems can be either fully computerized or human-powered, or a combination of both.

While academics have perceived DSS as a tool to support [[decision making process]], DSS users see DSS as a tool to facilitate organizational processes.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, Peter; (1980),"Decision support systems : a research perspective."Cambridge, Massachusetts : Center for Information Systems Research, Alfred P. Sloan School of Management.http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/47172&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have extended the definition of DSS to include any [[system]] that might support [[decision making]] and some DSS include a [[decision-making software]] component; Sprague (1980)&lt;ref name='sprague1980'&gt;Sprague, R;(1980). "A Framework for the Development of Decision Support Systems." MIS Quarterly. Vol. 4, No. 4, pp.1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; defines a properly termed DSS as follows:
# DSS tends to be aimed at the less well structured, underspecified [[problem]] that upper level [[Management|manager]]s typically face;
# DSS attempts to combine the use of models or analytic techniques with traditional [[data access]] and retrieval functions;
# DSS specifically focuses on features which make them easy to use by non-computer-proficient people in an interactive mode; and
# DSS emphasizes [[flexibility]] and [[adaptability]] to accommodate changes in the [[Knowledge environment|environment]] and the [[decision making]] approach of the user.

DSSs include [[knowledge-based systems]]. A properly designed DSS is an interactive software-based system intended to help decision makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data, documents, and personal knowledge, or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions.

Typical information that a decision support application might gather and present includes:
*inventories of information assets (including legacy and relational data sources, cubes, [[data warehouse]]s, and [[data mart]]s),
*comparative sales figures between one period and the next,
*projected revenue figures based on product sales assumptions.

==History==
The concept of decision support has evolved mainly from the theoretical studies of organizational decision making done at the [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Institute of Technology]] during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the implementation work done in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Scott Morton "&gt;Keen, P. G. W. (1978). ''Decision support systems: an organizational perspective''. Reading, Mass., Addison-Wesley Pub. Co. {{ISBN|0-201-03667-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; DSS became an area of research of its own in the middle of the 1970s, before gaining in intensity during the 1980s. In the middle and late 1980s, [[executive information system]]s (EIS), group decision support systems (GDSS), and organizational decision support systems (ODSS) evolved from the single user and model-oriented DSS.

According to Sol (1987)&lt;ref name="HGS87"&gt;[[Henk G. Sol]] et al. (1987). ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence in decision support systems: proceedings of the Second Mini Euroconference, Lunteren, The Netherlands, 17–20 November 1985''. Springer, 1987. {{ISBN|90-277-2437-7}}. p.1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; the definition and scope of DSS has been migrating over the years: in the 1970s DSS was described as "a computer-based system to aid decision making"; in the late 1970s the DSS movement started focusing on "interactive computer-based systems which help decision-makers utilize data bases and models to solve ill-structured problems"; in the 1980s DSS should provide systems "using suitable and available technology to improve effectiveness of managerial and professional activities", and towards the end of 1980s DSS faced a new challenge towards the design of intelligent workstations.&lt;ref name="HGS87" /&gt;

In 1987, [[Texas Instruments]] completed development of the Gate Assignment Display System (GADS) for [[United Airlines]]. This decision support system is credited with significantly reducing travel delays by aiding the management of ground operations at various [[airport]]s, beginning with [[O'Hare International Airport]] in [[Chicago]] and Stapleton Airport in [[Denver]] [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Efraim Turban |author2=Jay E. Aronson |author3=Ting-Peng Liang |page=574 |year=2008 |title=Decision Support Systems and Intelligent Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in about 1990, [[data warehouse|data warehousing]] and [[Online analytical processing|on-line analytical processing]] (OLAP) began broadening the realm of DSS. As the turn of the millennium approached, new Web-based analytical applications were introduced.

The advent of more and better reporting technologies has seen DSS start to emerge as a critical component of  [[management]] design.  Examples of this can be seen in the intense amount of discussion of DSS in the education environment.

DSS also have a weak connection to the [[user interface]] paradigm of [[hypertext]].  Both the [[University of Vermont]] [[Problem-Oriented Medical Information System|PROMIS]] system (for medical decision making) and the Carnegie Mellon [[ZOG (hypertext)|ZOG]]/[[KMS (Hypertext)|KMS]] system (for military and business decision making) were decision support systems which also were major breakthroughs in user interface research.  Furthermore, although [[hypertext]] researchers have generally been concerned with [[information overload]], certain researchers, notably [[Douglas Engelbart]], have been focused on decision makers in particular.

==Taxonomies==
Using the relationship with the user as the criterion, Haettenschwiler&lt;ref name="Haettenschwiler 1999"&gt;Haettenschwiler, P. (1999). Neues anwenderfreundliches Konzept der Entscheidungsunterstützung. Gutes Entscheiden in Wirtschaft, Politik und Gesellschaft. Zurich, vdf Hochschulverlag AG: 189-208.&lt;/ref&gt; differentiates ''passive'', ''active'', and ''cooperative DSS''. A ''passive DSS'' is a system that aids the process of decision making, but that cannot bring out explicit decision suggestions or solutions. An ''active DSS'' can bring out such decision suggestions or solutions. A ''cooperative DSS'' allows for an iterative process between human and system towards the achievement of a consolidated solution: the decision maker (or its advisor) can modify, complete, or refine the decision suggestions provided by the system, before sending them back to the system for validation, and likewise the system again improves, completes, and refines the suggestions of the decision maker and sends them back to them for validation.

Another taxonomy for DSS, according to the mode of assistance, has been created by Daniel Power: he  differentiates ''communication-driven DSS'', ''data-driven DSS'', ''document-driven DSS'', ''knowledge-driven DSS'', and ''model-driven DSS''.&lt;ref name="Power 2002"&gt;Power, D. J. (2002). Decision support systems: concepts and resources for managers. Westport, Conn., Quorum Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*A '''communication-driven DSS''' enables cooperation, supporting more than one person working on a shared task; examples include integrated tools like Google Docs or [[Microsoft SharePoint Workspace]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanhope, P. (2002). Get in the Groove: building tools and peer-to-peer solutions with the Groove platform. New York, Hungry Minds&lt;/ref&gt;
*A '''data-driven DSS''' (or data-oriented DSS) emphasizes access to and manipulation of a [[time series]] of internal company data and, sometimes, external data.
*A '''document-driven DSS''' manages, retrieves, and manipulates unstructured information in a variety of electronic formats.
*A '''knowledge-driven DSS''' provides specialized [[problem-solving]] expertise stored as facts, rules, procedures, or in similar structures.&lt;ref name="Power 2002" /&gt;
*A '''model-driven DSS''' emphasizes access to and manipulation of a statistical, financial, optimization, or [[Computer Simulation|simulation]] model. Model-driven DSS use data and parameters provided by users to assist decision makers in analyzing a situation; they are not necessarily data-intensive. Dicodess is an example of an [[open-source model]]-driven DSS generator.&lt;ref&gt;Gachet, A. (2004). Building Model-Driven Decision Support Systems with Dicodess. Zurich, VDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using scope as the criterion, Power&lt;ref name="Power 1996"&gt;Power, D. J. (1996). What is a DSS? The On-Line Executive Journal for Data-Intensive Decision Support 1(3).&lt;/ref&gt; differentiates ''enterprise-wide DSS'' and ''desktop DSS''. An ''enterprise-wide DSS'' is linked to large data warehouses and serves many managers in the company. A ''desktop, single-user DSS'' is a small system that runs on an individual manager's PC.

==Components==
[[File:Drought Mitigation Decision Support System.png|thumb|360px|Design of a [[drought]] mitigation decision support system]]
Three fundamental components of a DSS [[Systems architecture|architecture]] are:&lt;ref name="Haettenschwiler 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Power 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sprague and Carlson 1982"&gt;Sprague, R. H. and E. D. Carlson (1982). Building effective decision support systems. Englewood Cㄴliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-086215-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haag, Cummings, ㅊㄴㅋMcCubbrey, Pinsonneault, Donovan (2000). Management Informatㅍㅈion Systems: For The Information Age. McGraw-Hill Ryerson Limited: 136-140. {{ISBN|0-07-281947-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marakas, G. M. 1999"&gt;Marakas, G. M. (1999). Decision support systems in the twenty-first century. Upper Saddle River, N.J., Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
# the [[database]] (or [[knowledge base]]),
# the [[Model (abstract)|model]] (i.e., the decision context and user criteria)
# the [[user interface]].

The [[End-user (computer science)|users]] themselves are also important components of the architecture.&lt;ref name="Haettenschwiler 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marakas, G. M. 1999" /&gt;

==Development frameworks==
Similarly to other systems, DSS systems require a structured approach. Such a framework includes people, technology, and the development approach.&lt;ref name="Sprague and Carlson 1982" /&gt;

The Early Framework of Decision Support System consists of four phases:
* '''Intelligence''' – Searching for conditions that call for decision; 
* '''Design''' – Developing and analyzing possible alternative actions of solution; 
* '''Choice''' – Selecting a course of action among those; 
* '''Implementation''' – Adopting the selected course of action in decision situation.

DSS technology levels (of hardware and software) may include:
#The actual application that will be used by the user. This is the part of the application that allows the decision maker to make decisions in a particular problem area. The user can act upon that particular problem.
#Generator contains Hardware/software environment that allows people to easily develop specific DSS applications. This level makes use of case tools or systems such as Crystal, [[Analytica (software)|Analytica]] and [[iThink]].
#Tools include lower level hardware/software. DSS generators including special languages, function libraries and linking modules

An iterative developmental approach allows for the DSS to be changed and redesigned at various intervals. Once the system is designed, it will need to be tested and revised where necessary for the desired outcome.

== Classification ==
There are several ways to classify DSS applications. Not every DSS fits neatly into one of the categories, but may be a mix of two or more architectures.

Holsapple and Whinston&lt;ref name="Holsapple Whinston 1996"&gt;Holsapple, C.W., and A. B. Whinston. (1996). Decision Support Systems: A Knowledge-Based Approach. St. Paul: West Publishing. {{ISBN|0-324-03578-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; classify DSS into the following six frameworks: text-oriented DSS, database-oriented DSS, spreadsheet-oriented DSS, solver-oriented DSS, rule-oriented DSS, and compound DSS. A compound DSS is the most popular classification for a DSS; it is a hybrid system that includes two or more of the five basic structures.&lt;ref name="Holsapple Whinston 1996" /&gt;

The support given by DSS can be separated into three distinct, interrelated categories:&lt;ref&gt;Hackathorn, R. D., and P. G. W. Keen. (1981, September). "Organizational Strategies for Personal Computing in Decision Support Systems." MIS Quarterly, Vol. 5, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal Support, Group Support, and Organizational Support.

DSS components may be classified as:
# '''Inputs:''' Factors, numbers, and characteristics to analyze
# '''User knowledge and expertise:''' Inputs requiring manual analysis by the user
# '''Outputs:'''  Transformed data from which DSS "decisions" are generated
# '''Decisions:'''  Results generated by the DSS based on user criteria

DSSs which perform selected [[cognitive]] decision-making functions and are based on [[artificial intelligence]] or [[intelligent agent]]s technologies are called [[intelligent decision support system]]s (IDSS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=F. Burstein |author2=C. W. Holsapple |year=2008 |title=Handbook on Decision Support Systems. Berlin: Springer Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nascent field of [[decision engineering]] treats the decision itself as an engineered object, and applies engineering principles such as [[design]] and [[quality assurance]] to an explicit representation of the elements that make up a decision.

==Applications==
DSS can theoretically be built in any knowledge domain.

One example is the [[clinical decision support system]] for [[medical diagnosis]]. There are four stages in the evolution of clinical decision support system (CDSS): the primitive version is standalone and does not support integration; the second generation supports integration with other medical systems; the third is standard-based, and the fourth is service model-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=A|author2=Sittig, D|title=A framework and model for evaluating clinical decision support architectures q|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|date=2008|volume=41|pages=982–990|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2008.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DSS is extensively used in business and management. [[Executive dashboard]] and other business performance software allow faster decision making, identification of negative trends, and better allocation of business resources. Due to DSS all the information from any organization is represented in the form of charts, graphs i.e. in a summarized way, which helps the management to take strategic decision. For example, one of the DSS applications is the management and development of complex anti-terrorism systems.&lt;ref name = "Zhang &amp; Babovic"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=S.X. |last2=Babovic |first2=V. |year=2011 |title=An evolutionary real options framework for the design and management of projects and systems with complex real options and exercising conditions |journal=Decision Support Systems |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=119–129 |doi= 10.1016/j.dss.2010.12.001|ssrn= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220197192_An_evolutionary_real_options_framework_for_the_design_and_management_of_projects_and_systems_with_complex_real_options_and_exercising_conditions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include a bank loan officer verifying the credit of a loan applicant or an engineering firm that has bids on several projects and wants to know if they can be competitive with their costs.

A growing area of DSS application, concepts, principles, and techniques is in [[agriculture|agricultural production]], marketing for [[sustainable development]].  For example, the [[DSSAT| DSSAT4]] package,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aglearn.net/resources/isfm/DSSAT.pdf DSSAT4 (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icasa.net/dssat/ The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer]&lt;/ref&gt; developed through financial support of [[USAID]] during the 80s and 90s, has allowed rapid assessment of several agricultural production systems around the world to facilitate decision-making at the farm and policy levels. [[Precision agriculture]] seeks to tailor decisions to particular portions of farm fields. There are, however, many constraints to the successful adoption on DSS in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, W. and Middleton, T. (2002). Why has the uptake of Decision Support Systems been so poor? In: Crop-soil simulation models in developing countries. 129-148 (Eds R.B. Matthews and William Stephens). Wallingford:CABI.&lt;/ref&gt;

DSS are also prevalent in [[forest management]] where the long planning horizon and the spatial dimension of planning problems demands specific requirements. All aspects of Forest management, from log transportation, harvest scheduling to sustainability and ecosystem protection have been addressed by modern DSSs. In this context the consideration of single or multiple management objectives related to the provision of goods and services that traded or non-traded and often subject to resource constraints and decision problems. The Community of Practice of Forest Management Decision Support Systems provides a large repository on knowledge about the construction and use of forest Decision Support Systems.&lt;ref&gt;Community of Practice Forest Management Decision Support Systems, http://www.forestdss.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A specific example concerns the [[Canadian National Railway]] system, which tests its equipment on a regular basis using a decision support system. A problem faced by any [[railroad]] is worn-out or defective rails, which can result in hundreds of [[derailment]]s per year. Under a DSS, the Canadian National Railway system managed to decrease the incidence of derailments at the same time other companies were experiencing an increase.

A '''deployment flowchart''' (sometimes referred to as a '''cross functional flowchart''') is a [[business]] process mapping tool used to articulate the steps and [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] of a given [[business process|process]].

"Deployment [[flowchart]]s consist of a sequence of activity steps and also the interactions between individuals or groups."&lt;ref&gt;The Leader's Handbook: Making Things Happen, Getting Things Done
 By Peter R. Scholtes&lt;/ref&gt;  Each participant  in the process is displayed on the map (which is constructed as a matrix)  - tasks/activity are then articulated in sequence under the column corresponding to that stakeholder.

As deployment flowcharts highlight the relationships between stakeholders in addition to the process flow&lt;ref&gt;Essential Readings in Nursing Managed Care
 By Susan Odegaard Turner, Aspen Reference Group (Aspen Publishers)
&lt;/ref&gt; they are especially useful in highlighting areas of inefficiency, duplication or unnecessary processing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leanyourcompany.com/methods/How-to-construct-a-deployment-flowchart.asp How to draw a deployment flowchart? - Leanyourcompany.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   Often utilized within [[Six sigma]] activity,&lt;ref&gt;Rath &amp; Strong's Six Sigma Leadership Handbook By Rath &amp; Strong, Thomas Bertels
&lt;/ref&gt; completed flowcharts are commonly used to examine the interfaces between “participants” which are typically causes for delays and other associated issues.   Deployment flowcharts are useful for determining who within an organization is required to implement a process and are sometimes used as a business planning tool.  

While deployment flowcharts can be drawn by hand using pen and paper – various software tools include functionality to construct the flowcharts on computer, these include products such as [[Microsoft Visio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/Visio/visio2000/maintain/iddepend.mspx Identify Cross-Department Dependencies with Microsoft Visio Flowcharts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other process mapping techniques, deployment flowcharts require a certain degree of detail (and accuracy) to provide useful benefit.  Care and attention is required to ensure that the correct stakeholder is attributed to the correct parts of the process.  Complex flowcharts may  be difficult to interpret, especially where a flow is unclear, or many stakeholders are identified.  Consistent terminology throughout the map is also important to provide clarity to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Flowcharts: Plain &amp; Simple. By Joiner Assocs., Inc. Staff&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11552">[[File:GreatGoodFriend.jpg|thumb|right|An 1862 letter of condolence from [[Abraham Lincoln]] to [[Queen Victoria]] on the occasion of the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] shows the republican salutation "Great and Good Friend".]]
'''Diplomatic correspondence''' is correspondence between one state and another, usually – though not exclusively – of a formal character. It follows several widely observed customs and style in composition, substance, presentation, and delivery and can generally be categorized into letters and notes.

==Letters==
Letters are correspondence between [[head of state|heads of state]], typically used for the appointment and recall of ambassadors; for the announcement of the [[Demise of the Crown|death of a sovereign]] or an accession to the throne; or for expressions of congratulations or condolence.&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt; 

Letters between two monarchs of equal rank will typically begin with the salutation "Sir My Brother" (or "Madame My Sister", in the case of a female monarch) and close with the valediction "Your Good Brother" (or Sister, in the case of a female monarch). In the case where one monarch is of inferior rank to the other (for instance, if the [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] were to correspond to the [[Queen of the United Kingdom]]), the inferior monarch will use the salutation "Sire" (or "Madame"), while the superior monarch may refer to the other as "Cousin" instead of "Brother".&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;  If either the sender or the recipient is the head-of-state of a [[republic]], letters may begin with the salutation "My Great and Good Friend" and close with the valediction "Your Good Friend"; beneath the signature line will be inscribed "To Our Great and Good Friend [Name and Title of Recipient]".&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

===Letters of credence===

{{Main|Letter of credence}}

[[File:Estonian Ambassador H.E. Mr Andres Unga presents his credentials to the Governor-General of Australia H.E. Ms Quentin Alice Louise Bryce. 28.03.2013 (8597769358).jpg|thumb|right|Estonian ambassador to [[Australia]] Andres Unga presents his letter of credence to Governor-General [[Quentin Bryce]] in 2013.]]

A '''letter of credence''' (''lettres de créance'') is the instrument by which a [[head of state]] appoints ("accredits") ambassadors to foreign countries.&lt;ref name="Foakes"&gt;Joanne Foakes, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kqXFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 The Position of Heads of State and Senior Officials in International Law]'' (Oxford University Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oppenheim371"&gt;[[Lassa Oppenheim]], ''International Law: A Treatise'' (Vol. 1, 2005: ed. Ronald Roxburgh), § 371, p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as '''credentials''', the letter closes with a phrase "asking that credit may be given to all that the ambassador may say in the name of his [[Monarch|sovereign]] or Government."&lt;ref name="Foakes"/&gt; The credentials are presented personally to the receiving country's head of state or viceroy in a formal ceremony. Letters of credence are worded carefully, as the sending or acceptance of a letter implies [[diplomatic recognition]] of the other government.&lt;ref name="Foakes"/&gt; Letters of credence date to the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Chaplais]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pR58WnXzh-wC&amp;pg=PA246 English Diplomatic Practice in the Middle Ages]'' ([[Hambledon and London]], 2003), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letters of recall===

A letter of recall is formal correspondence from one head-of-state notifying a second head-of-state that he or she is recalling his state's ambassador.

===Full powers===
In cases where an envoy is entrusted with unusually extensive tasks that would not be covered by an ordinary permanent legation (such as the negotiation of a special [[treaty]] or convention, or representation at a diplomatic congress), an envoy may be given [[full powers]] (''pleins pouvoirs'') "in [[letters patent]] signed by the head of the State" designing "either limited or unlimited full powers, according to the requirements of the case."&lt;ref name="Oppenheim371"/&gt;

According to ''Satow's Diplomatic Practice'', the bestowal of full powers traces its history to the Roman ''plena potestas''; its purpose &lt;blockquote&gt;was to be able to dispense, as far as possible, with the long delays needed in earlier times for referring problems back to higher authority. Their use at the present day is a formal recognition of the necessity of absolute confidence in the authority and standing of the negotiator.&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Notes==
[[File:Ambassador Kennedy After the Presentation of Credentials Ceremony (10941227714).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Caroline Kennedy]], the [[United States Ambassador to Japan|United States ambassador to Japan]], departs [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]] after presenting her credentials to [[Akihito]] in 2013.]]

===Note verbale===
{{main|Note verbale}}
A ''note verbale'' is the most formal form of note and is so-named as it originally represented a formal record of information delivered orally. Notes verbale are written in the third person and printed on official letterhead; they are typically [[seal (emblem)|sealed]] with an embosser or, in some cases, a stamp. All notes verbale begin with a formal [[salutation]], typically:&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

{{cquote|The [name of sending state's] Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has the honor to invite their attention to the following matter.}}

Notes verbales will also close with a formal [[valediction]], typically:&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

{{cquote|The Embassy avails itself of this opportunity of assuring the Ministry of its highest consideration}}

Notes verbales composed by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] are written on blue paper.&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

===Collective note===
[[File:GreatSealPressImprinting.jpg|thumb|right|Formal correspondence originating from the U.S. State Department is sealed with the [[Great Seal of the United States]], which is embossed on a paper wafer using this 1903 letterpress.]]
A collective note is a letter delivered from multiple states to a single recipient state. It is always written in the [[Illeism|third person]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acquah-Dadzie|first1=Kofi|title=World Dictionary of Foreign Expressions: A Resource for Readers and Writers|date=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=0865164231|pages=273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4ddQNrt8e8C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective note has been a rarely used form of diplomatic communication due to the difficulty in obtaining agreements among multiple states to the exact wording of a letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lloyd|title=The Palgrave Macmillan Dictionary of Diplomacy|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=1137017619|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jvarq4iy5MoC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identic note===
An identic note is a letter delivered from a single state to multiple recipient states. Examples include the identic note sent by [[Thomas Jefferson]] [[Proposals for concerted operation among the powers at war with the Pyratical states of Barbary|regarding action against the Barbary Pirates]] and that from the [[United States]] to [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929. In it, the United States called on the other two powers to resolve their differences over the [[Chinese Eastern Railway|Eastern China Railway]] peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murty|first1=Bhagevatula|title=The International Law of Diplomacy: The Diplomatic Instrument and World Public Order|date=1989|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=0792300831|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvoLbSGNBqsC&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bouts de papier===
A ''bout de papier'' (speaking note) may be presented by a visiting official when meeting with an official from another state at the conclusion of the meeting. Prepared in advance, it contains a short summary of the main points addressed by the visiting official during the meeting and, firstly, serves as a memory aid for the visiting official when speaking. It, secondly, removes ambiguity about the subject of the meeting occasioned by verbal miscues by the visiting official. Bouts de papier are always presented without credit or attribution so as to [[Plausible deniability|preserve the confidentiality]] of the meeting in case the document is later disclosed.&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

===Démarches and aides-mémoire===
{{main|démarche|aide-mémoire}}
[[File:Aide-Memoire_handed_by_Lord_Hardinge_to_M._Briand.png|thumb|right|A British foreign office internal record of a 1921 aide-mémoire delivered to [[Aristide Briand]].]]
A ''[[démarche]]'' (non-paper) is considered less formal than the already informal bout de papier. Officially described as "a request or intercession with a foreign official" it is a written request that is presented without attribution from the composing state and is, therefore, delivered in-person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Protocol for the Modern Diplomat|date=2013|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|page=30|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/176174.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to a démarche, an ''[[aide-mémoire]]'' is a proposed agreement or negotiating text circulated informally among multiple states for discussion without committing the originating delegation's country to the contents. It has no identified source, title, or attribution and no standing in the relationship involved.

==Protocol==
[[File:Graf_Clemens_Metternich.jpg|thumb|right|Austrian foreign minister [[Klemens von Metternich]] threatened to correspond to the United Kingdom in German if it sent diplomatic correspondence to him in English, instead of French.]]
Standard diplomatic protocol varies from country to country, but generally requires clear yet concise translation between both parties.

===Language===
The earliest forms of diplomatic correspondence were, out of necessity, written in [[Latin]], Latin being a [[Lingua franca|common language]] among states of a linguistically diverse Europe. By the early 1800s French had firmly supplanted Latin as the language of diplomacy; on one occasion, in 1817, the British attempted to correspond with the [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian Imperial Court]] in English, prompting [[Klemens von Metternich]] to threaten retaliatory correspondence in [[German language|German]]. In modern times, French has largely been replaced by English as a diplomatic lingua franca in correspondence between two states that do not share a common tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Keith|title=The Practice of Diplomacy: Its Evolution, Theory, and Administration|date=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0415497647|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection===
States may sometimes reject diplomatic correspondence addressed to them by returning the original copy to the sending state. This is done as a rebuff of the contents of the correspondence and is typically reserved for cases where the receiving state feels the language used by the sending state is rude, or the subject matter represents an inappropriate intercession into the receiving state's internal affairs.&lt;ref name="satow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Ivor|title=Satow's Diplomatic Practice|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199693552|pages=45–66|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dynamic Business Modeling''' ("DBM") describes the ability to automate [[business model]]s within an open framework. The independent analyst firm [[Gartner]] has recently called Dynamic Business Modeling "critical for [[Business Support Systems|BSS]] solutions to succeed".

Dynamic Business Modeling is based on principles wherein the [[business logic]] of an [[Application software|application]] is managed independently from the [[application server]]s that automate the services and processes defined in the business logic. Business modeling and integration (which itself is defined as part of the business model) are defined in a business logic layer, allowing underlying application servers to be business logic agnostic and therefore need no business driven customization. DBM applied correctly should reduce both the cost and risk in the initial implementation and its future evolution of systems.

Previous generations of IT systems (from 1990 to approximately 2001) were designed to address specific business models and regulatory practices and no value was given to [[logic]]–[[infrastructure]] segregation.  These systems provided value by automating predefined business models (commonly referred to as "off-the-shelf").  As a result, they implicitly drove [[business strategy]] where DBM states that they should be driven by it.  By being "predefined" they do not:

* openly incorporate business changes in the business landscape of an industry
* leverage potential business models that new technologies allow

Dynamic Business modeling is suited for open automation of strategy-driven business models. By removing the need for customization of core application servers it is postulated as more [[Cost efficiency|cost efficient]], rapidly deployed and evolveable. Dynamic Business Modeling was initially described (though applied much earlier in practice) by Doug Zone at MetraTech Corp. in reference to the billing segment of the enterprise software market.  "Service Oriented Applications" (also known as "service based applications") coined by IBM describe potential methodologies to achieve DBM.

==Technical definition ==

Dynamic Business Modeling is defined as the automation of Enterprise Business Models based on the principle that the model's underlying [[business process]]es and business services need to be dynamically and openly definable and re-definable.

==Business definition ==

Dynamic Business Modeling is defined as the enabler of a strategic advantage achieved by focused [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] in any aspect of business (from marketing to finance to operations). This differentiation is achieved through how business is conducted: openly and dynamically defining the business model.  [[Capital investment]] – human, physical and intellectual – must be aimed at allowing the definition of the business model to be dynamic.

Dynamic Business Modeling recognises that businesses dynamically evolve, re-inventing their (business) models to achieve strategic advantage. DBM posits that the role of [[enterprise software]] (CRM, billing, ERP) is to dynamically automate and advance the business processes and services that lie behind these Business models.

==History==

The term was first used to describe the architecture of MetraNet, a [[wiktionary:Charging|charging]], [[Bill (payment)|bill]]ing, [[Settlement (finance)|settlement]] and [[customer care]] from [[MetraTech]] Corp.

==Core principles ==

# Business strategy drives selection of business models.
# These business models drive the design of underlying processes and services.
#* ''Business Analysis is critical: Any number of models can address a strategic imperative. But the best models, services and processes will exploit existing business capabilities (human, IT and physical), the areas where change is possible and the areas where [[investment]] will make most change possible at the lowest cost.''
# Enterprise software automates these services and processes.
# DBM enables change: Strategic adeptness requires tuning and/or the re-definition of the present Business Model.
#* ''The business must begin with the principle that allows rapid tuning and/or re-definition of the underlying services and processes. This must apply at human and technological levels''.

==Key success criteria ==

# Open modeling capabilities:
#* ''Dynamic Business Modeling requires [[IT architecture]] and [[enterprise application]]s that automate the business model  – not just a business model.''
# Ease of modeling:
#* ''Definition and [[automation]] of new and evolved business services and processes must be accessible at the [[business analysis]] level.  Ideally the models and its services and processes are defined and stored in open [[business analyst]] oriented data (for example [[metadata]].)''
# Open integration:
#* ''Dynamic Business Modeling must work with processes and services (both automated and human) that are NOT dynamic. These fixed constraints are not external to the new business model but are part of its fabric. IT Architecture and Enterprise applications must be able to incorporate, embed and/or build upon these existing processes and services.''
# Robustness:
#* ''Regardless of the dynamism of the business model. The automated and human-based business processes and services must have all the robustness of long standing static processes and services.  Dynamic IT automation must have a full [[audit]] capability, reprocessing ability and standards compliance (i.e. PCI).''
# Perpetual dynamism:
#* ''Automation is never finished. Processes and services change and are added constantly. IT Architecture and Enterprise applications must be designed to prevent “lock down” where the service and process automation on “Day One” is so tightly coupled that only minor evolution is economic.  SOA principles of openness and loss coupling must be applied inside business applications.''

==Best practice ==

# DBM is service-based:
#* '' The application should be based on the principle that processes and integration can be de-constructed internally into services.''
# Services and processes are loosely coupled:
#* ''Changing one should not impact the others.''
# Services and process definitions are open:
#* ''And accessible to a business analyst. Ideally definitions are kept in metadata.''
# Application servers must be free of embedded business logic:
#* ''For services, processes, data, workflows alike.''
# Dynamic documentation is a feature:
#* ''As the model evolves the documentation must evolve as well. The application should allow the business analyst to document at service level and then generate a cohesive document that encompasses entire model.''
# Business Analyst Interface is friendly and flexible:
#* ''The application must provide a way to put the definition of services and processes in analyst terms – using universal concepts such as flows and tables. The interface should encourage documentation, warn on inconsistencies, and allow testing.''

All [[member states of the European Union]] are bound to decrease their [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. For example, the EU [[climate and energy]] package requires member states to improve their energy efficiency by 20%, increase -renewable energy production by 20% and reduce their emissions by 20%. With about 40% of CO2 emissions heating, cooling and hot water production in buildings is one of the largest greenhouse gas producers.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Norbert. Heating, cooling, lighting: Sustainable design methods for architects. John wiley &amp; sons, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the building sector has the largest potential for energy savings. In their effort to lead a change towards greater energy efficiency and a reduction of greenhouse gas, many companies, cities and municipalities are in the process of developing [[low carbon]] action plans.&lt;ref&gt;Baeumler, Axel, Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, and Shomik Mehndiratta, eds. Sustainable low-carbon city development in China. World Bank Publications, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broto, Vanesa Castán, and Harriet Bulkeley. "A survey of urban climate change experiments in 100 cities." Global Environmental Change 23.1 (2013): 92-102.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the costs for developing optimal action plans and their continuous monitoring and optimization are very high, thus, often hindered by the tense financial situation, especially of cities and municipalities. With significant economic and environmental downsides; the consequences are additional costs due to the non-compliance to the national and EU emission goals and untapped energy saving potential.

ECOCITIES is an energy optimization system for building portfolios combining and extending the benefits of [[Energy Management Software]] (EMS), [[Computer-aided facility management|Computer-aided Facility Management]] (CAFM) software and building portfolio management software. It integrates building administration and monitoring, energy accounting and building portfolio optimization. Thereby, it supports the definition of low carbon action plans in terms of environmental impact (e.g., [[carbon footprint]], [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]) and financial impact (e.g., investment costs, running, costs). The system considers the following options for each building and the resulting (inter-) dependencies:
* energy-efficient building configurations (e.g., the compatibility of building components and its contribution to the energy efficiency level), 
* energy used at the production and distribution of building components (i.e., gray energy),
* [[environmental impact]] (e.g., [[CO2 emissions]]),
* financial constraints, such as (governmental) funding and limited long term loans,
* legal constraints, e.g., [[building codes]], national and international standards,
* energy consumption for the operation of buildings, i.e., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]) as well as the electricity demand,
* energy production, storage and load shifting between buildings in combination with [[renewable energy production]] ([[solar PV]] and thermal, [[Micro combined heat and power]]) and conversion.
* energy flows between a building’s on-site networks (Heating/Cooling and low voltage networks), the micro networks on neighborhood level and the city-wide energy networks ([[district heating]] and [[district cooling]] networks, mid-voltage distribution networks), 
* local typology (position of buildings, energy networks).

ECOCITIES calculates all energy- and cost-efficient development scenarios, visualizes them on the screen and allows decision makers to interactively explore the consequences of their actions (e.g., what are the citywide costs and the corresponding CO2 reductions of introducing a neighborhood-scale combined heat and power plant). ECOCITIES is an enabler for the realization of energy goals and provides synergies with existing endeavors of achieving national and European energy goals. On an operational level, ECOCITIES supports the following processes:
* Administration and integrated optimization of the entire building portfolio.
* Energy accounting and monitoring for all buildings.
* Identification, evaluation and definition of energy efficiency strategies (low carbon action plans).
* Continuous monitoring, review and optimization of energy efficiency strategies (low carbon action plans).
* Ensure the alignment of individual initiatives with the overall energy strategy of the company/city, e.g., planning the cost- and energy efficient integration of new or refurbished single buildings, groups of buildings or entire neighborhoods into a new or existing energy efficiency strategy.
* Continuous monitoring of the performance related to the contribution to national and European energy goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3424">'''Enterprise asset management''' ('''EAM''') involves the management of the maintenance of physical assets of an organization throughout each asset's lifecycle. EAM is used to plan, optimize, execute, and track the needed maintenance activities with the associated priorities, skills, materials, tools, and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcweb.com/blog/what-enterprise-asset-management-eam/|title=What is Enterprise Asset Management - EAM? |website=www.ARCweb.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-13|first=Ralph|last=Rio|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413193545/https://www.arcweb.com/blog/what-enterprise-asset-management-eam|archive-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This covers the design, construction, commissioning, operations, maintenance and decommissioning or replacement of [[Physical plant|plant]], equipment and facilities.

"Enterprise" refers to the scope of the assets in an Enterprise across departments, locations, facilities and, potentially, supporting business functions eg; Finance &amp; GL, Human Resources and Payroll.  Various assets are managed by the modern enterprises at present.  The assets may be fixed assets like buildings, plants, machineries or moving assets like vehicles, ships, moving equipments etc.  The lifecycle management of the high value physical assets require regressive planning and execution of the work. 

==History==
EAM arose as an extension of the [[Computerized maintenance management system]] (CMMS) which is usually defined as a system for the computerisation of the maintenance of physical assets.&lt;ref name="IBM-EAM"&gt;{{Citation|title=IBM Solution Approach For Enterprise Asset Management|first1=Katie|last1=Doyle|first2=Jerry|last2=Saulman|first3=Bill|last3=Cary|version=1.2|publisher=IBM|id=Introduction|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enterprise asset management software ==
Enterprise asset management software is a computer software that handles every aspect of running a public works or asset-intensive organization. Enterprise asset management (EAM) software applications include features such as asset life-cycle management, preventive maintenance scheduling, warranty management, integrated mobile wireless handheld options and portal-based software interface. Rapid development and availability of mobile devices also affected EAM software which now often supports [[Mobile enterprise asset management]].&lt;ref name="CWdawn2000"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Computer Weekly]]|title=Dawn of the age of smart assets|last=Gurton|first=Annie|date=November 2000|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Dawn-of-the-age-of-smart-assets|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''financial roadshow''' is a series of [[meetings]] across different [[cities]] in which top [[Executive (management)|executives]] from a [[company]] have the opportunity to talk with current or potential [[investors]].  They can range from two or three [[day]]s in one [[country]] or [[continent]] to [[marathon]], three [[week]] trips to [[financial]] centers around the [[world]].  The most common [[Rationality|reason]] for conducting financial roadshows is an initial [[public]] offerings [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]], in which a privately held company’s shares go public and investors have an opportunity to buy into it.  Another reason for roadshows is [[privatization]] of a [[government-owned corporation]], similar to a [[private company]] going public, in which a company seeks investors to buy new [[stock]] it is issuing to raise [[money]].  Finally, a non-deal roadshow is purely so that executives can hold discussions with current and potential investors, and nothing is offered for [[Sales|sale]].

A '''focus group''' is a small, but  demographically diverse group of people and whose reactions are studied especially in market research or political analysis in guided or open discussions about a new product or something else to determine the reactions that can be expected from a larger population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/focus+group|title=Definition of FOCUS GROUP|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504021742/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/focus+group|archivedate=4 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/focus_group|title=focus group - Definition of focus group in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209044025/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/focus_group|archivedate=9 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=focus+group|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: focus group|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|date=|website=www.ahdictionary.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509164640/https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=focus+group|archivedate=9 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of [[qualitative research]] consisting of interviews in which a group of people are asked about their perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards a product, service, concept, advertisement, idea, or packaging. Questions are asked in an interactive group setting where participants are free to talk with other group members.  During this process, the researcher either takes notes or records the vital points he or she is getting from the group. Researchers should select members of the focus group carefully for effective and authoritative responses.

==History==

Focus groups have a long history and were used{{by whom|date=May 2016}} during the [[Second World War]] (1939-1945) to examine the effectiveness of [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Use in disciplines==
===Library and information science===

In library and information science, when the library intends to work on its collection, the library consults the users who are the reason the library was established. This is an important process in meeting the needs of the users.

===Social sciences===
In the [[social sciences]] and [[urban planning]], focus groups allow interviewers to study people in a more natural conversation pattern than typically occurs in a one-to-one interview. In combination with [[participant observation]], they can be used for learning about groups and their patterns of interaction. An advantage is their fairly low cost compared to [[Opinion poll|surveys]], as one can get results relatively quickly and increase the sample size of a report by talking with several people at once.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Catherine and Gretchen B. Rossman. 1999. ''Designing Qualitative Research''. 3rd Ed. London: Sage Publications, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage is that they can be used as an occasion for participants to learn from one another as they exchange and build on one another's views, so that the participants can experience the research as an enriching encounter. This counteracts the extractive nature of research which seeks to "mine" participants for data (with no benefit for them) as criticized by various authors, and in particular Indigenous-oriented authors (and others sharing similar sentiments), as explained, for example, by Romm (2015): http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/2087.

===Marketing===
In the world of [[marketing]], focus groups are seen as an important tool for acquiring feedback regarding new products, as well as various other topics. In marketing, focus groups are usually used in the early stages of product or concept development, when organizations are trying to create an overall direction for marketing initiative. In particular, focus groups allow companies wishing to develop, package, name, or test market a new product, to discuss, view, and/or test the new product before it is made available to the public. This can provide valuable information about the potential market acceptance of the product.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

A focus group is an interview, conducted by a trained moderator among a small group of respondents. The interview is conducted in an informal and natural way where respondents are free to give views from any aspect. Focus groups are similar to, but should not be confused with in-depth interviews. The moderator uses a discussion guide that has been prepared in advance of the focus group to guide the discussion.  Generally the discussion goes from overall impressions of a brand or product category and becomes more specific as the discussion progresses.

Participants are recruited on the basis of similar demographics, psychographics, buying attitudes, or behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenbaum |first=Thomas|title=Moderating Focus Groups|year=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=0-7619-2044-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives of the stake holder (often a design team in the case of testing acceptance on a new product) are not involved in the focus group, not to bias the exercise. However they may attend the focus group, either through video cameras, or by watching through a one way mirror.

Traditional focus groups can provide accurate information, and are less expensive than other forms of traditional [[marketing research]]. There can be significant costs however: if a product is to be marketed on a nationwide basis, it would be critical to gather respondents from various locales throughout the country since attitudes about a new product may vary due to geographical considerations. This would require a considerable expenditure in travel and lodging expenses. Additionally, the site of a traditional focus group may or may not be in a locale convenient to a specific client, so client representatives may have to incur travel and lodging expenses as well.

Today, using [[audience response]] keypads to collect questionnaire answers is the new industry trend.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Usability engineering===
* In [[usability engineering]], a focus group is a survey method to collect the feedback of users on software or a website. This marketing method can be applied to computer products to better understand the motivations of users and their perception of the product. Unlike other methods of [[ergonomics]], focus group implies several participants: users or future users of the application. The focus group can only collect subjective data, not objective data on the use of the application as the [[usability test]] for example.

==Types==
Variants of focus groups include:
* '''Two-way focus group''' - one focus group watches another focus group and discusses the observed interactions and conclusion
* '''Dual moderator focus group''' - one moderator ensures the session progresses smoothly, while another ensures that all the topics are covered
* '''Dueling moderator focus group''' (fencing-moderator) - two moderators deliberately take opposite sides on the issue under discussion
* '''Respondent moderator focus group''' - one and only one of the respondents is asked to act as the moderator temporarily
* '''Client participant focus groups''' - one or more client representatives participate in the discussion, either covertly or overtly
* '''Mini focus groups''' - groups are composed of four or five members rather than 6 to 12
* '''Teleconference focus groups ''' - telephone network is used
* '''Creativity groups'''
* '''Band obsessive group'''
* '''[[Online focus group]]s''' - computers connected via the internet are used

==Discussions==
* Group discussion produces data and insights that would be less accessible without interaction found in a group setting—listening to others’ verbalized experiences stimulates memories, ideas, and experiences in participants. This is also known as the group effect where group members engage in "a kind of ‘chaining’ or ‘cascading’ effect; talk links to, or tumbles out of, the topics and expressions preceding it" (Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;182)&lt;ref&gt;Lindlof, T. R., &amp; Taylor, B. C. (2002). ''Qualitative Communication Research Methods, 2nd Edition''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Group members discover a common language to describe similar experiences. This enables the capture of a form of "native language" or "vernacular speech" to understand the situation
* Focus groups also provide an opportunity for disclosure among similar others in a setting where participants are validated. For example, in the context of [[workplace bullying]], targeted employees often find themselves in situations where they experience lack of voice and feelings of isolation. Use of focus groups to study workplace bullying therefore serve as both an efficacious and ethical venue for collecting data (see, e.g., Tracy, Lutgen-Sandvik, &amp; Alberts, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, S. J., Lutgen-Sandvik, P., &amp; Alberts, J. K. (2006). Nightmares, demons and slaves: Exploring the painful metaphors of workplace bullying. ''Management Communication Quarterly, 20'', 148-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems and criticism==
A fundamental difficulty with focus groups (and other forms of [[qualitative research]]) is the issue of ''observer dependency'': the results obtained are influenced by the researcher or his or her own reading of the group's discussion, raising questions of validity (see [[experimenter's bias]]).
Focus groups are "One shot case studies" especially if they are measuring a property-disposition relationship within the social sciences, unless they are repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Nachmais, Chava Frankfort; Nachmais, David. 2008. ''Research methods in the Social Sciences: Seventh Edition'' New York, NY: Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Focus groups can create severe issues of external validity, especially the reactive effects of the testing arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Donald T., Stanley, Juilian C. ''Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research.'' Chicago, IL: Rand McNally&lt;/ref&gt;  Other common (and related) criticism involve [[groupthink]] and [[social desirability bias]].

Another issue is with the setting itself.  If the focus groups are held in a laboratory setting with a moderator who is a professor and the recording instrument is obtrusive, the participants may either hold back on their responses and/or try to answer the moderator's questions with answers the participants feel that the moderator wants to hear.  Another issue with the focus group setting is the lack of anonymity.  With all of the other participants, there can not be any guarantee of confidentiality.

[[Douglas Rushkoff]]&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas, ''Get back in the box : innovation from the inside out'', New York : Collins, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; argues that focus groups are often useless, and frequently cause more trouble than they are intended to solve, with focus groups often aiming to please rather than offering their own opinions or evaluations, and with data often [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picked]] to support a foregone conclusion. Rushkoff cites the disastrous introduction of [[New Coke]] in the 1980s as a vivid example of focus group analysis gone bad.

Jonathan Ive, Apple’s senior vice president of industrial design, also said that Apple had found a good reason not to do focus groups: "They just ensure that you don’t offend anyone, and produce bland inoffensive products."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Data analysis==
The analysis of focus group data presents both challenges and opportunities when compared to other types of qualitative data. Some authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harding|first1=Jamie|title=Qualitative Data Analysis from Start to Finish|isbn=978-0-85702-138-0|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that data should be analysed in the same manner as interview data, while others have suggested that the unique features of focus group data – particularly the opportunity that it provides to observe interactions between group members - means that distinctive forms of analysis should be used. Data analysis can take place at the level of the individual or the group.

Focus group data provides the opportunity to analyse the strength with which an individual holds an opinion.  If they are presented with opposing opinions or directly challenged, the individual may either modify their position or defend it. Bringing together all the comments that an individual makes in order can enable the researcher to determine whether their view changes in the course of discussion and, if so, further examination of the transcript may reveal which contributions by other focus group members brought about the change.

At the collective level, focus group data can sometimes reveal shared understandings or common views.  However, there is a danger that a consensus can be assumed when not every person has spoken: the researcher will need to consider carefully whether the people who have not expressed a view can be assumed to agree with the majority, or whether they may simply be unwilling to voice their disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Jamie. 2013. ''Qualitative Data Analysis from Start to Finish'' London, SAGE Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States government==
The [[United States]] federal government makes extensive use of focus groups to assess public education materials and messages for their many programs.  While many of these are appropriate for the purpose, many others are reluctant compromises which federal officials have had to make as a result of studies independent of whether a focus group is the best or even appropriate methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Srivastava|first1=T N|title=Business Research Methodology|isbn=0-07-015910-6|page=6.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Swedish artist [[Måns Wrange]] has used the concept of the focus group in his work ''The Good Rumor Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manswrange.com|title=Måns Wrange|author=|date=|website=www.manswrange.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050721/http://www.manswrange.com/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance the focus group situation is used not only as a means to investigate the opinions of the group members, but also to spread an idea (the ''rumor'') across society with the help of the group members.

== Exercises ==
Various creative activity-oriented questions can serve as supplements to verbal questions including but not limited to the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colucci|first=Erminia|date=December 2007|title=Focus groups can be fun": The use of activity-oriented questions in focus group discussions|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.833.1072&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Qualitative Health Research|volume=17 |issue=10|pages=1422–1433|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509164640/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.833.1072&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|archivedate=2018-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Free listings'''- participants produce a list of all elements of a domain 
* '''Rating'''- participants have a list of items which must be rated on a scale, typically using a numbers or adjectives
* '''Ranking'''- participants can either receive a list of items to rank according to a specified dimension or participants can combine items in pairs to compare elements in the pairs
* '''Pile sorting'''- participants sort cards representing elements of a domain into piles according to their similarities and differences
* '''Picture sort'''- Participants are distributed selected pictures from magazines or photographs to sort through, finding matches of a definite characteristic or that best represent a certain category
* '''Magic tools and fantasy'''- the moderator can literally or symbolically pass around a "magical" tool to each participant as he or she shares a fantasy, dream, or idea
* '''Storytelling'''- participants create a narrative around the topic of interest to make others think about a solution to a problem, gauge reactions to a situation, and observe attitudes towards the topic under study
* '''Role-playing'''- participants demonstrate through action how they would behave or act in a situation, how they would solve a problem, or deal with a difficulty
* '''Sentence completion'''- participants are given printed out partial sentences on a topic to complete and share within a group
* '''Collage'''- a moderator assigns a theme and then distributes print materials to participants (who are divided into small groups), so they can use these materials, drawings, and their own words to create a relevant collage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1551">'''Forecast by analogy''' is a [[forecasting]] method that assumes that two different kinds of [[phenomena]] share the same [[behavioral modeling|model of behaviour]]. For example, one way to predict the sales of a new product is to choose an existing product which "looks like" the new product in terms of the expected [[demand (economics)|demand pattern]] for sales of the product.

"Used with care, an [[analogy]] is a form of scientific model that can be used to analyze and explain the behavior of other phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Future Ready: How to Master Business Forecasting |isbn=978-0-470-74705-6 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HP Service Manager is one of the applications acquired by HP when it purchased [[Peregrine Systems]] in 2005. The application was originally known as PNMS (Peregrine Network Management System). After releasing the first version of PNMS, Peregrine Systems eventually added functionality such as Request Management, Call Management, and Change Management and rebranded the application as Peregrine ServiceCenter.

After the acquisition by HP, the application was rebranded as HP Service Manager and was included in the [[HP OpenView]] product suite. HP offers the application as a service desk solution that enables IT to work as a single organization, governed by a consistent set of processes to handle service delivery and support quickly and efficiently.

After the acquisition, the product has been updated with the following significant changes:
* ServiceCenter 3: Client and GUI
* ServiceCenter 4: Process Model and Module Alignment
* ServiceCenter 5 / 5.1: Client, GUI, introduction of Document Engine
* ServiceCenter 6: New Client, New Server-side Application stack (servlets), inclusion of JavaScript, inclusion of SOAP
* Service Manager 7 / 7.11: GUI, Web Client, Process Model (IIA)
* Service Manager 9.2: GUI, introduction of Process Designer
* Service Manager 9.40: Reporting, Smart Analytics.
* Service Manager 9.41: Smart Search, autocomplete, undo in ScriptLibrary editor
* Service Manager 9.50: New Service Portal, Smart Email, Smart Chat.

'''Hamburger University''' is a {{convert|130000|sqft|sing=on}} [[training]] facility of [[McDonald's]], located in [[Oak Brook, Illinois]], a western [[suburb]] of [[Chicago]]. This [[corporate university]] was designed to instruct personnel employed by McDonald's in the various aspects of [[restaurant management]]. More than 80,000 restaurant managers, mid-managers and owner/operators have "graduated" from this facility.&lt;ref name="hamu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/corporate_careers/training_and_development/hamburger_university.html|title=Hamburger University|publisher=McDonald's|date=2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Since its establishment, Hamburger University has been situated on an {{convert|80|acre}} campus. Restaurant employees receive approximately 32 hours of training in their first month with McDonald's and more than 5,000 students attend Hamburger University each year. Founder [[Ray Kroc]] oversaw lessons at its beginning.

In 2016 McDonald's Corporation announced it would move its U.S. and world headquarters including Hamburger University from its long time home in Oak Brook to a newly built complex on property which formerly housed [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Harpo Productions|Harpo Studios]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/06/13/mcdonalds-moving-headquarters-to-chicago/85821422/ McDonald's moving headquarters to downtown Chicago by 2018] (Retrieved from USA Today on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-mcdonalds-headquarters-0603-biz-20160602-story.html McDonald's to move HQ to Chicago as soon as 2018, source says] (Retrieved from the Chicago Tribune on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-mcdonalds-oak-brook-property-20180112-story.html McDonald's begins selling off Oak Brook property before headquarters move] (Retrieved from the Chicago Tribune on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2017 McDonald's put up for sale or sold most of its Oak Brook campus.

==Popular culture==
Hamburger University was satirized in the 1986 comedy, ''[[Hamburger... The Motion Picture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{BFI Explore|id=4ce2b722ee9e8|title=Hamburger - The Motion Picture}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also spoofed by McDonald's itself in a commercial with [[Ronald McDonald]] in which several [[animatronic]] hamburgers were shown graduating from school.

Integrated Business Planning is a planning process that integrates across two or more functions in a business or government entity referred to as an enterprise to maximize
financial value.

The specific functional areas in a company as well as the industry domain associated with the company defines the specific type of IBP process. 
Examples of  IBP processes are:

* [[Sales and Operations Planning]]
* Healthcare Analytics
* Strategic Corporate Performance Management
* Planning and scheduling across multiple plants in a factory

The key requirement for IBP is that two or more functional process areas must be involved and maximizing (optimizing) of financial value should be done.

Corporate executives, business unit heads and planning managers use IBP to evaluate plans and activities based on the economic impact of each consideration.

'''Bridging Corporate Performance Management and S&amp;OP
There has been a lot of focus on Integrated Business Planning in the context of Sales and Operations Planning. Gartner ([http://www.gartner.com www.gartner.com]) refers to a 5-stage
S&amp;OP Maturity model wherein IBP is referred to as the Phased 4 &amp; 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2587021/introducing-fivestage-sales-operations-planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Integrated Business Planning however is more broader than S&amp;OP. It is an approach that combines Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) and sales and operations planning (S&amp;OP) to provide incremental capabilities that neither provides individually. In so doing, IBP platforms address long-standing challenges that financial and operational professionals have struggled to overcome. The result: opportunities for step change improvements to how manufacturers plan, manage and govern their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBP Industry Week cite web|url=http://www.industryweek.com/software-systems/integrated-business-planning-not-just-marketing-hoax}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the focus is on strengthening the financial integration and reconciliation of plans, as well as increasing the responsiveness of the supply chain using ad-hoc reports and what-if scenario analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.camelot-mc.com/en/integrated-business-planning-ibp/|title=Integrated Business Planning (IBP) - Camelot - Management Consultants|website=www.camelot-mc.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
Integrated Business Planning requires the following capabilities to be enabled:

a) Enterprise Model
* Ability to create a demand chain model
* Ability to create a supply chain model
* Ability to create a finance chain model
b) Integrated Planning
* Ability to create a plan across multiple functions
* Ability to create predictive and collaborative plans

c) Enterprise Optimization
* Ability to create optimized plans across multiple constraints
* Ability to create financial integration across optimization

== Applications ==
IBP has been used to model and integrate the planning efforts in a number of applications, including:
* Product profitability
* [[Customer profitability]]
* [[Capital expenditures]]
* Manufacturing operations
* [[Supply chain]]
* Business processes (human and information-based)
* Business policy
* Market demand curves
* Competitive strategy
All of the above can be summarized as Enterprise Optimization use cases.

== Criticism ==
Some argue that IBP is not any different from S&amp;OP.  See article by Patrick Bower [http://www.jaguar-aps.com/pdf/IBP%20is%20a%20Hoax.pdf where he calls IBP a marketing hoax], a name developed to create confusion and sell consulting and system services.  The main proponents of IBP are in fact consulting companies.    In return to this criticism,
it has been pointed out that [http://www.industryweek.com/software-systems/integrated-business-planning-not-just-marketing-hoax IBP is not a marketing hoax], but an important
part of Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) system.

'''''Lex mercatoria''''' (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] for "merchant law"), often referred to as "the Law Merchant" in English, is the body of [[commercial law]] used by merchants throughout Europe during the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period. It evolved similar to English [[common law]] as a system of custom and best practice, which was enforced through a system of merchant courts along the main trade routes. It functioned as the international law of commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Sealy and Hooley (2008) 14&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasised contractual freedom and alienability of property, while shunning [[legal technicality|legal technicalities]]{{clarification needed|date=August 2018}} and deciding cases ''[[ex aequo et bono]]''. A distinct feature was the reliance by merchants on a legal system developed and administered by them{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. States or local authorities seldom interfered, and did not interfere a lot in internal domestic trade{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Under ''lex mercatoria'' trade flourished and states took in large amounts of taxation{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

In the last years new theories had changed the understanding of this medieval treatise considering it as proposal for legal reform or a document used for instructional  purposes{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. These theories consider that the treatise cannot be described as a body of laws applicable in its time, but the desire of a legal scholar to improve and facilitate the litigation between merchants. The text is composed by 21 sections and an annex. The sections described procedural matters such as the presence of witnesses and the relation between this body of law and common law. It has been considered as a false statement to define this as a system exclusively based in custom, when there  are structures and elements from the existent legal system, such as Ordinances and even concepts proper of the Romano-canonical procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lex Mercatoria and Legal Pluralism: A Late Thirteenth Century Treatise and Its Afterlife|last = Basil, Bestor, Coquillette and Donahue|first = |publisher = Ames Foundation|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''lex mercatoria'' was originally a body of rules and principles laid down by merchants to regulate their dealings. It consisted of rules and customs common to merchants and traders in Europe, with some local variation. It originated from the need for quick and effective [[jurisdiction]], administered by specialised [[courts]]. The guiding spirit of the merchant law was that it ought to derive from commercial practice, respond to the needs of the merchants, and be comprehensible and acceptable to the merchants who submitted to it. International commercial law today owes some of its fundamental principles to the ''lex mercatoria''. This includes choice of [[arbitration]] institutions, procedures, applicable law and arbitrators, and the goal to reflect customs, usage and good practice among the parties.

Goods and services flowed freely during the medieval merchant law, thus generating more wealth for all involved. It is debated whether the law was uniform in nature, was spontaneous as a method of dispute resolution, or applied equally to everyone who subordinated to it. The ''lex mercatoria'' was also a means for local communities to [[protectionism|protect]] their own markets. Local kings or lords extracted taxes and set trade restrictions. In 1303 [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] issued the [[Carta Mercatoria]], a charter to foreign merchants in England, which guaranteed them freedom to trade, with certain protections and exemption under the law. Although the charter was revoked by Edward II, due to complaints by English merchants, foreign merchants retained most of their rights in practice, but these would vary widely with the march of time, events and changes to state policy.

==Administration==
The ''lex mercatoria'' was the product of customs and practices among traders, and could be enforced through the local courts. However, the merchants needed to solve their disputes rapidly, sometimes on the hour, with the least costs and by the most efficient means. Public courts did not provide this. A trial before the courts would delay their business, and that meant losing money. The ''lex mercatoria'' provided quick and effective justice. This was possible through informal proceedings, with liberal procedural rules. The ''lex mercatoria'' rendered proportionate judgements over the merchants’ disputes, in light of "fair price", good commerce, and equity.

Judges were chosen according to their commercial background and practical knowledge. Their reputation rested upon their perceived expertise in merchant trade and their fair-mindedness. Gradually, a professional judiciary developed through the merchant judges. Their skills and reputation would however still rely upon practical knowledge of merchant practice. These characteristics serve as important measures in the appointment of international commercial arbitrators today.

The ''lex mercatoria'' owed its origin to the fact that the civil law was not sufficiently responsive to the growing demands of commerce, as well as to the fact that trade in pre-medieval times was practically in the hands of those who might be termed cosmopolitan merchants, who wanted a prompt and effective jurisdiction. It was administered for the most part in special courts, such as those of the guilds in Italy, or the fair courts of Germany and France, or as in England, in courts of the Staple or [[Court of Piepowders|Piepowder]].

==Legal concepts==
The ''lex mercatoria'' was composed of such usages and customs as were common to merchants and traders in all parts of Europe, varied slightly in different localities by special peculiarities. Less procedural formality meant speedier dispensation of justice, particularly when it came to documentation and proof. Out of practical need, the medieval ''lex mercatoria'' originated the “writing obligatory”. By this, creditors could freely transfer the debts owed to them. The “writing obligatory” displaced the need for more complex forms of proof, as it was valid as a proof of debt, without further proof of; transfer of the debt; [[power of attorney|powers of attorney]]; or a formal bargain for sale. The ''lex mercatoria'' also strengthened the concept of party autonomy: whatever the rules of the ''lex mercatoria'' were, the parties were always free to choose whether to take a case to court, what evidence to submit and which law to apply.

==Reception==
Merchant law declined as a cosmopolitan and international system of merchant justice towards the end of medieval times. This was to a large extent due to the adoption of national commercial law codes. It was also connected with an increasing modification of local customs to protect the interests of local merchants. The result of the replacement of ''lex mercatoria'' codes with national governed codes was the loss of autonomy of merchant tribunals to state courts. The main reason for this development was the protection of state interests.

The nationalisation of the ''lex mercatoria'' did not neglect the practises of merchants or their trans-border trade. Some institutions continued to function, and state judges also were appointed for their merchant expertise, just as modern commercial arbitrators. The laws of the merchants were not eradicated, but simply codified. National codes built on the principles laid down by trade commercial practise and to a large extent they embodied ''lex mercatoria'' substantial rules. This was for example the case in France. The Code Commercial was issued in 1807, where ''lex mercatoria'' rules were preserved to govern formation, performance and termination of contracts. In effect, the nation states reconstituted the ''lex mercatoria'' in their image.

==Common law development==
{{See also|United Kingdom commercial law}}
English courts applied merchant customs only if they were "certain" in nature, "consistent with law" and "in existence since [[time immemorial]]." English judges also required that merchant customs were proven before the court. But even as early as 1608, Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]] described ''lex mercatoria'' as "a part of the common law," and [[William Blackstone]] would later concur.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Brown Scott]], [https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=o2ItplkkogIC&amp;pg=PA259&amp; ''Law, the State, and the International Community''], p. 259, Columbia University Press, (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition continued especially under [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], who is said to be the father of English commercial law. Precepts of the ''lex mercatoria'' were also kept alive through [[Equity (law)|equity]] and the [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] courts in maritime affairs. In the US, traditions of the ''lex mercatoria'' prevailed in the general principles and doctrines of [[Uniform Commercial Code|commercial jurisprudence]].

The history of the ''lex mercatoria'' in England is divided into three stages: the first prior to the time of Coke, when it was a special kind of law – as distinct from the common law – administered in special courts for a special class of the community (i.e. the mercantile); the second stage was one of transition, the ''lex mercatoria'' being administered in the common law courts, but as a body of customs, to be proved as a fact in each individual case of doubt; the third stage, which has continued to the present day, dates from the presidency over the king's bench of [[Lord Mansfield]] (q.v.), under whom it was moulded into the mercantile law of to-day. To the ''lex mercatoria'' modern English law owes the fundamental principles in the law of partnership, negotiable instruments and trade marks.

[[Image:William Murray of Mansfield.jpg|thumb|left|Lord Mansfield was a champion of fusing ''lex mercatoria'' with the [[common law]].]]
[[Sir John Holt]] (Chief Justice 1689 to 1710) and [[Lord Mansfield]] (Chief Justice, 1756 to 1788) were the leading proponents of incorporating the ''lex mercatoria'' into the common law.  Holt did not complete the task, possibly out of his own conservatism (see ''[[Clerke v Martin]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1702) 2 Ld Raym 757&lt;/ref&gt;) and it was Lord Mansfield that became known as the 'founder of the commercial law of this country" (Great Britain).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lickbarrow v Mason]]'' (1787) 2 Term Rep 63, 73, Buller J&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst sitting in [[Guildhall]], Lord Mansfield created,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a body of substantive commercial law, logical, just, modern in character and at the same time in harmony with the principles of the common law. It was due to Lord Mansfield's genius that the harmonisation of commercial custom and the common law was carried out with an almost complete understanding of the requirements of the commercial community, and the fundamental principles of the old law and that that marriage of idea proved acceptable to both merchants and lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;CM Schmitthoff, 'International Business Law, A New Law Merchant' in ''Current Law and Social Problems'' (1961) 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Statute of Merchants 1285]] (11 Edw I and 13 Edw I) aka "Statute of Acton Burnell"

==International commercial law and arbitration==
''Lex mercatoria'' precepts have been reaffirmed in new international mercantile law. National trade barriers are torn down in order to induce commerce. The new commercial law is grounded on commercial practice directed at market efficiency and privacy. Dispute resolution has also evolved, and functional methods like international commercial arbitration is now available. These developments have also attracted the interest of empirical sociology of law &lt;ref&gt;cf. Volkmar Gessner/Ali Cem Budak, eds., Emerging Legal Certainty: Empirical Studies on the Globalization of Law. Ashgate: Dartmouth 1998&lt;/ref&gt;The principles of the medieval ''lex mercatoria'' – efficiency, party autonomy, and choice of arbitrator – are applied, and arbitrators often render judgements based on customs. The new merchant law encompasses a huge body of [[international commercial law]].

==Present and future commercial law==
In summary, nation states somewhat fragmented the medieval ''lex mercatoria'' but it is far from destroyed. Local interests triumphed in the medieval ages, just as national interests do today. A modern variant of the ''lex mercatoria'' is the evolving law and dispute resolution in cyberspace. Internet traders are the fastest growing body of merchants in history. Parties can solve domain-name disputes online expeditiously and quickly. In a virtual court documents are filed and examined online, arguments are made online and decisions are published online – seldom challenged before traditional courts of law. ICANN's UDRP (and its proposals for Rapid Suspension) and Nominet's DRS are examples of this. The medieval, the modern and cyberspace merchant laws face comparable issues of enforceability. They solve the problems somewhat differently, but the reaction of the market is the main incentive to comply with a ruling.

Further, ''lex mercatoria'' is sometimes used in international disputes between commercial entities. Most often those disputes are decided by arbitrators which sometimes are allowed (explicitly of implied) to apply ''lex mercatoria'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of such arbitral awards: [http://www.trans-lex.org/000011 Collected by Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, some legal practitioners assume that there is a whole set of legal principles named "''lex mercatoria''" in international or transnational commercial law. The most recent and constantly updated set of rules are the ''[[TransLex Principles]]'' collected and formulated by [[Klaus Peter Berger]] ([[University of Cologne]]) and his [[Center for Transnational Law]].

What remains of ''lex mercatoria'' precepts today is a qualified faith in self-regulation by merchants, and a reluctance to surrender the efficiencies of merchant practice to state confinement.

This is a '''list of the fastest-selling product''' superlatives. The definition of "fastest-selling" typically refers to sales results in the first week of a product's release, (i.e., which product had the biggest launch). Sometimes, rather than comparing sales figures relative to time, the target to be reached is fixed (e.g. sales at 5 million units), and the comparison is based upon how many weeks it takes to reach it (e.g. 52 weeks vs. 56 weeks).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8991">'''Machiavellianism in the workplace''' is the employment of cunning and duplicitous behavior in a business setting. The term ''[[Machiavellianism]]'' is from the book ''[[The Prince]]'' by [[Machiavelli]] which lays out advice to rulers how to govern his or her subjects. Machiavellianism has been studied extensively over the past 40 years as a personality characteristic that shares features with [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] [[leadership]] tactics. It has in recent times been adapted and applied to the context of the workplace and organizations by many writers and academics. The Machiavellian typically manipulates on occasions where it is advantageous to achieve the required objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-09-01|title=American presidential Machiavellianism: Implications for charismatic leadership and rated performance|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984301000820|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=339–363|doi=10.1016/S1048-9843(01)00082-0|issn=1048-9843|last1=Deluga|first1=Ronald J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] identifies Machiavellianism as one of the [[dark triad]]ic personality traits in the workplace, the others being [[narcissism]] and [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;James O Office Politics: How to Thrive in a World of Lying, Backstabbing and Dirty Tricks (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new model of Machiavellianism based in organizational settings consists of three factors:&lt;ref name="Kessler"&gt;Kessler, SR; Bandeiii, AC; Spector, PE; Borman, WC; Nelson, CE; and Penney, LM 2010. Reexamining Machiavelli: A three dimensional model of Machiavellianism in the workplace. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 40, 1868–1896&lt;/ref&gt;
* maintaining [[Power (social and political)|power]]
* harsh management tactics
* manipulative behaviors.

The presence of Machiavellianism in an organisation has been positively correlated with [[counterproductive workplace behaviour]] and [[workplace deviance]].&lt;ref name=Kessler/&gt;

==Job interviews==
{{Main|Job interviews}}
Individuals who are high in Machiavellianism may be more willing and more skilled at lying and less likely to give honest answers during interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Fletch, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Levashina &amp; Campion, 2006"&gt;Levashina, J., &amp; Campion, M. A. (2006). A model of faking likelihood in the employment interview. International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 14(4), 299-316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Roulin &amp; Bourdage, 2017"&gt;Roulin, N., &amp; Bourdage, J. S. (2017). Once an Impression Manager, Always an Impression Manager? Antecedents of Honest and Deceptive Impression Management Use and Variability across Multiple Job Interviews. Frontiers in Psychology, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals high in Machiavellianism have stronger intentions to use deception in interviews compared to psychopaths or narcissists and are also more likely to see the use of lying in interviews as fair.&lt;ref name = "Lopes &amp; Fletcher, 2004"&gt;Lopes, J., &amp; Fletcher, C. (2004). Fairness of impression management in employment interviews: A cross-country study of the role of equity and Machiavellianism. Social Behavior and Personality: an international journal, 32(8), 747-768&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Roulin &amp; Krings, 2016"&gt;Roulin, N., &amp; Krings, F. (2016). When Winning is Everything: The Relationship between Competitive Worldviews and Job Applicant Faking. Applied Psychology, 65(4), 643-670.&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women high in Machiavellianism may use different tactics to [[Social influence|influence]] interviewers. In one study, which examined the how much applicants allowed the interviewers to direct the topics covered during the interview, women high in  Machiavellianism tended to allow interviewers more freedom to direct the content of the interview. Men high in Machiavellianism gave interviewers the least amount of freedom in directing the content of the interview.&lt;ref name = "Weinstein, 1968"&gt;Weinstein, E. A., Beckhouse, L. S., Blumstein, P. W., &amp; Stein, R. B. (1968). Interpersonal strategies under conditions of gain or loss1. Journal of Personality, 36(4), 616-634.&lt;/ref&gt; Men high in Machiavellianism were also more likely to make up information about themselves or their experiences during job interviews.&lt;ref name = "Hogue, Levashina, &amp; Hang, 2013"&gt;Hogue, M., Levashina, J., &amp; Hang, H. (2013). Will I fake it? The interplay of gender, Machiavellianism, and self-monitoring on strategies for honesty in job interviews. Journal of Business Ethics, 117(2), 399-411.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace bullying overlap==
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
According to [[Gary Namie|Namie]], Machiavellians manipulate and exploit others to advance their perceived personal agendas and to maintain dominance over others.&lt;ref&gt;Namie, G. (2006). Why Bullies Bully? A Complete Explanation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are the guiding principles of Machiavellianism:&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Greenberg J, Baron RA Behavior in Organizations: Understanding and Managing the Human Side of Work (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Never show humility
* Arrogance is far more effective when dealing with others.
* Morality and ethics are for the weak: Powerful people feel free to [[lie]], cheat and deceive others when it suits them.
* It is much better to be feared than loved.

High Machiavellians may be expected to do the following:&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt;
* Neglect to share important information.
* Find subtle ways of making another person look bad to management.
* Fail to meet their obligations.
* Spread false rumors about another person.

In studies there was a positive correlation between Machiavellianism and workplace bullying. Machiavellianism predicted involvement in bullying others. The groups of bullies and bully-victims had a higher Machiavellianism level compared to the groups of victims and persons non-involved in bullying. The results showed that being bullied was negatively related to the perceptions of clan and [[adhocracy]] cultures and positively related to the perceptions of [[hierarchical organisation|hierarchy culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Irena Pilch, Elżbieta Turska Journal of Business Ethics February 2014 Relationships Between Machiavellianism, Organizational Culture, and Workplace Bullying: Emotional Abuse from the Target’s and the Perpetrator’s Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

In research, Machiavellianism was positively associated with subordinate perceptions of [[abusive supervision]] (an overlapping concept with workplace bullying).&lt;ref&gt;Kohyar Kiazada, Simon Lloyd D. Restubog, Thomas J. Zagenczyk, Christian Kiewitz, Robert L. Tang In pursuit of power: The role of authoritarian leadership in the relationship between supervisors’ Machiavellianism and subordinates’ perceptions of abusive supervisory behavior&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13416">'''Management due diligence''' is the process of appraising a company's [[senior management]]—evaluating each individual's effectiveness in contributing to the organization's [[Strategic management|strategic objectives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Audit|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/management-audit.asp|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessing company management is crucial when closing business deals. It can mean the difference between long-term success or sudden failure. It also helps the organisation understand how the teams perform their roles in context with the company's future business plan. This helps clarify the structure of the organisation's work-force.&lt;ref name="Best practice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Best practice guideline- Due Diligence|url=http://www.crelos.com/assets/Human-capital-due-diligence-the-assessment-and-development-of-management-teams.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="good manager"&gt;{{cite web|title=What makes a good manager|url=http://www.mas.org.uk/management-advisory-service/what-makes-a-good-manager.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The management due diligence process can be identified as an informative tool for external stakeholders, and can also be referred to as Management Assessment as it addresses the team’s dynamics and highlight the risks.&lt;ref name=Assessment&gt;{{cite web|title=Assessment and development- Management Due Diligence|url=http://www.ashleyhoyle.co.uk/leadership_development_consulting/due_diligence_management.aspx|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management assessment ==

Management assessment usually focuses on assessing the leadership skills and characteristics of the organisation's managers—such as the ability to adjust to a changing environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior management|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/senior-management.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and communicate effectively with other individuals. These characteristics are key points in successful leaders.&lt;ref name="good manager"/&gt;

A leader must consider all factors concerning a strategic decision, such as possible effects on employees and customers. Engaging employees and customers in the decision process helps build better relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Five characteristics of great leaders|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3004914/5-characteristics-great-leaders|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transactions that require management due diligence==
Companies typically apply the due diligence process when they are about to engage in a major transaction with another company—such as selling or purchasing products or services, or buying (merging with or acquiring) the other company.&lt;ref name="What is"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Due Diligence and how do you perform it?|url=http://www.businessknowhow.com/money/duediligence.htm|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some transactions require a due diligence report that includes managements.&lt;ref name=Meaning&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaning of due diligence|url=http://www.jsandco.in/Uploaded%20Image/Due%20diligence.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactions that might require managerial assessments include:

=== Mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances ===
Organizations considering a merger, acquisition or alliance should perform due diligence. This due diligence should investigate the other party's management team. Many mergers and acquisitions fail because of human resources and management-related issues, such as cultural clashes. These incidents occur because of different cultural values or different individual beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merger Due Diligence- The devil in details|url=http://www.workforce.com/articles/merger-due-diligence-the-devil-in-the-details|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid such incidents, and cut costs on the long run, management teams must be assessed thoroughly.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;

=== Partnerships ===
Before organizations signs a partnership contract, they must investigate the other organization’s matters and affiliations, organizational structures, and behaviors. A management due diligence process achieves this.

=== Joint ventures and collaborations ===
When forming a relationship with another organizations, management due diligence helps an organization introduce  management structure the behavior of individuals.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;

=== Management due diligence's responsibility ===
Not only buyers carry out management due diligence, but also sellers of an organization. Usually, the process of selling an organization or adopting any external growth strategies requires the sharing of warranties. These warranties require private information from the organization—possibly including information and activities that they must shield from the view of third parties. In this case, the seller should carry out due diligence to ensure secure data.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;

==Importance==
Management due diligence ensures sustainable profit and growth for organisations, as it identifies the human capital components. It ensures that highly skilled people are assigned the correct jobs and responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Best practice"/&gt; It increases the chance of a good return on investment by reducing risk.&lt;ref name=Assessment/&gt;

Management due diligence identifies strengths and weaknesses of individuals in the management team and assesses their contributions to the organisation.&lt;ref name="Best practice"/&gt; It assesses management team members' abilities to reach common goals.&lt;ref name=Firefly&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Due Diligence|url=http://www.fireflypartners.co.uk/mngmentduediligence.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It identifies undiscovered dangers that eventually affect productivity. These might include unacknowledged motives or personal conflicts between individuals in management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence- The management team aspect: who's driving your company|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=803|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helps organizations efficiently appraise candidates for a management team position.&lt;ref name=Firefly/&gt;

Management due diligence gives an organization a basis for expectations for team and individual performance. Accordingly, the organization can determine whether managers need training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance appraisal for teams|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/reference-materials/historical/teams.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Since management due diligence lies in the financial analysis of a due diligence report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/members/business-resources/business-management-and-strategy/m-and-a/types-of-due-diligence|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares the same process as creating a due diligence report with few variations. 

===Preparation===
Preparation is key to an effective management due diligence process. In this phase, organizations gain sufficient knowledge about other organizations. This helps them decide on communication methods between them and other entities, in addition to putting resources in place to promote a successful process.  After settling those issues, the organization must:

''Form a team for the analysis process'' from skilled people with enough experience. After forming the team, the organization assigns responsibilities and settles on a process timeline. The organization may fill gaps in expertise by hiring or contracting external people.

''Involve managers'' as early as possible''' as they must get to know the other organization's management team. Early introductions help managers deal with later obstacles.

''Create checklists'' tailored to particular risks associated with the other organization.

''Prepare a list of data requests'' for the information an organization needs to complete the process.&lt;ref name="Main steps"/&gt;  Such data could include the business plan's management team section,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence information request|url=http://www.stevensonco.com/documents/Due-Diligence-Information-Request-Sample.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or management organizational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sample Due Diligence request list|url=http://www.theventurealley.com/files/2013/08/Sample-due-diligence-request-list-Trent-Dykes.pd_1.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''After negotiations, have both parties sign a confidentiality report'' to protect sensitive data from third parties. Agree on a method to store all confidential data—for example, an online data repository&lt;ref name="Main steps"/&gt; that both parties can view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Data Room|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/V/Virtual_Data_Room.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution===
In this phase the organization begins analyzing gathered data. The team tries to confirm the target's representations and "soft" aspects of the target, such as its corporate culture. The team must make sure the other organization fits with its own after assessing their management quality. After gathering all the information, the team advises on whether their organization should continue to work with the other organization.

===Closure===
After the team finishes analyzing the management team, they submit a report to the final decision makers. If the team exposes irregularities or unexpected risks, the organization can bid on contract changes. If everything passes the assessment, team members switch to integration planning.&lt;ref name="Main steps"/&gt;

==Aspects==
By performing management due diligence to assess the individuals working in an organization, different aspects must be appraised. The diagram outlines the main aspects that must be evaluated. The four circles in the middle represent the basic qualities that are considered essential for an individual assessment. The bigger circle "Role" represents the duties of the individuals in a certain organization. These duties usually vary from one individual to another depending on the job description of that individual. The biggest circle representing the employing organization is located in a market, making it easy to get affected by various external factors.&lt;ref name="Best practice"/&gt; These external factors are capable of hindering the organization from achieving its strategic goals and long-term objectives, making this a challenge that has to be dealt with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=External Factors|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/external-factors.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the individual assessment to be precise and accurate, it must be done after the organization's requirements have been highlighted and responsibilities of each individual are clear. Having such knowledge helps the business organization overcome future challenges and move closer to strategic objectives.&lt;ref name="Best practice"/&gt;

==Key points==
Management due diligence needs:
*Clear, defined objectives—set expectations in terms of management styles and qualities in individuals
* Commitment—assess whether management resources can make the business succeed.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;
* Assess strengths—recognize strengths of individual members to use them effectively
The management team is an asset to any organisation,&lt;ref name="most important"&gt;{{cite web|title=The most important assets are not on the balance sheet|url=http://www.triplepundit.com/2010/09/the-most-important-assets-are-not-on-the-balance-sheet/|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations and drawbacks==

To assure reliable data, both investor and individuals under assessment must be involved in the feedback process. This can be costly and time-consuming to both parties. Since due diligence can be a detective game, organizations must find individuals who can detect small issues and opportunities. Organizations sometimes bring in outside experts.&lt;ref name="Main steps"&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence: Main steps and success factors|url=http://www.gecapital.eu/en/docs/GE_Capital_Overview_Due_Diligence.pdf|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expense of the due diligence process, and the time involved, can be softened by dividing it into two stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRELIMINARY DUE DILIGENCE (This is the 9th article in the series on M&amp;A) |url=http://businessthinker.com/preliminary-due-diligence-this-is-the-8th-article-in-the-series-on-ma/|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence in mergers and acquisition|url=http://www.accountingcpd.net/Due_Diligence_in_Mergers_and_Acquisitions_by_Peter_Howson|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Executives may be so interested in a deal that they ignore identified risks and move ahead—and later suffer from management issues.&lt;ref name="Main steps"/&gt; 
Information gathering can involve interviewing the management team, but the team may see them as expensive and time-consuming.&lt;ref name="What is"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interviews|url=http://compass.port.ac.uk/UoP/file/d8a7aedc-be56-461b-85e8-ae38ccf49670/1/Interviews_IMSLRN.zip/page_03.htm|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People doing the analysis might not be familiar with the organization's sector, which can lead to wrong conclusions.&lt;ref name="most important"/&gt;

A '''performance supervision system''' ('''PSS''') is a [[software system]] used to improve the performance of a [[Industrial process|process]] [[Factory|plant]].  Typical process plants include [[oil refineries]], [[paper mills]], and [[chemical plant]]s.

The PSS gathers real-time data from the [[process control]] system, typically a [[distributed control system]].  Using this data, the PSS can calculate performance [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] for process equipment, controls, and operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8156">The '''Philadelphia Fed Report''', formally known as the '''Business Outlook Survey''' and sometimes abbreviated as '''BOS''', is a monthly survey produced by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] (informally known as the Philadelphia Fed) which questions manufacturers on general business conditions. The index covers the Third Federal Reserve District (the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Fed), namely  covers eastern and central [[Pennsylvania]], the nine southern counties of [[New Jersey]], and [[Delaware]].&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/|title = Business Outlook Survey|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is sometimes also called the '''Philadelphia Fed Index''' because it includes reporting of some index values.&lt;ref name=investopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/philadelphia-fed-survey.asp|title = Philadelphia Fed Survey|publisher = [[Investopedia]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=investopedia2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/philadelphiafederalindex.asp|title = Philadelphia Federal Index|publisher = [[Investopedia]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Philadelphia Fed Report has been published monthly since May 1968, and archives for all historical data (revised to account for seasonal adjustments) are available on the website.&lt;ref name=historical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/historical-data/|title = Business Outlook Survey Historical Data|date = January 9, 2014|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details and data reported==

===Release schedule===

The Philadelphia Index is conducted monthly by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] and questions voluntary participants on things such as unemployment, new orders, shipments, inventories, and prices paid. The report is released on the third Thursday of every month, making it the earliest such regional report which is released to investors.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;&lt;ref name=investopedia2/&gt; For instance, the report for April 2014 was released on Thursday, April 17, 2014.&lt;ref name=april-2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/2014/bos0414.cfm|title = April 2014 Business Outlook Survey|accessdate = April 22, 2014|date = April 17, 2014|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey questions===

The survey is a one-page survey asking respondents to include their name, title, company name, and mailing address, and then seeking their opinion on how they think various indicators related to business changed over the past month, as well as how they anticipate it changing over the next 6 months. For each question, they may select between the options of ''decrease'', ''no change'', and ''increase''.&lt;ref name=sample&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/SampleBOSForm.pdf|title = Business Outlook Survey Questionnaire Sample|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The questions include:

* '''General Business Conditions''': What is your evaluation of the level of general business activity?
* '''Company Business Indicators''':
** New orders
** Shipments
** Unfilled orders
** Delivery times
** Inventories
** Prices paid
** Prices received
** Number of employees
** Average employee workweek
** Capital expenditures

The percentage of respondents selecting particular responses can be accessed, and charted over time to compare responses in different months.&lt;ref name=april-2014/&gt;

Higher survey figures suggest higher production, which contribute to economic growth. Results are calculated as the difference between percentage scores with zero acting as the centerline point. As such, values greater than zero indicate growth, while values less than zero indicate contraction.&lt;ref name=investopedia/&gt;

Some months have additional special questions included in the survey. For instance, the month of April 2014 asked the following questions:&lt;ref name=april-2014/&gt;

# How important are the following factors in influencing your firm’s decision to remain in the three-state region?
# Have the same factors become more or less important in recent years?

for the following list of factors:

* Availability of skilled labor
* Cost of labor
* Taxes/subsidies/regulation
* Cost of energy
* Proximity of customers
* Proximity to distribution channels
* Proximity to suppliers/raw materials

'''Playbour''' (sometimes spelled '''playbor''') is a term used to describe a hybrid form of play and labour, specifically in the digital games industry. The term was coined by Julian Kücklich in 2005 in his article ''Precarious playbour: Modders and the digital games industry.'' Kücklich describes playbour as a type of free labour that fits neither traditional definitions of work nor the categories of play or leisure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue5/kucklich_print.html|title=Precarious Playbour: Modders and the Digital Games Industry|last=Kücklich|first=Julian|date=|website=journal.fibreculture.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, forms of playbour are often incorrectly perceived as being just an extension of play. Playbour is also sometimes categorized as a part of the [[gamification]] of society in general.

== History ==
While the term playbour itself is a relatively new invention, the phenomena it concerns – those of productive leisure and free labour in the digital games industry – have been around at least since the late 1990s. Kücklich states that since the early 1990s, the relationship between the players of digital games and the digital games industry has changed substantially. He attributes the alteration to the rise of computer [[game modification]], or "modding", as a widespread practice among players.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modding ===
Creating [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] for digital games is the perfect example of playbour: a growing number of consumers of digital games are not satisfied with just playing the game, but prefer to enhance their playing experience by creating content for the game themselves. In modding we can see the very essence of playbour, or free labour: while the work of creating a modification can be seen as playful and enjoyable, it is still work. In this respect modding can be fairly similar to another form of collaborative digital production; [[Open-source software|open-source]] software development. The first game to gain a modder base of considerable size is widely agreed to be [[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]] (1993).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sotamaa|first=Olli|date=3 September 2007|title=On modder labour, commodification of play, and mod competitions|url=http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2006|journal=First Monday|language=en-US|volume=12|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of Doom mods is usually attributed to the fact that the game's code was deliberately designed to facilitate player-created content.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most famous modder creation is probably [[Counter-Strike]], originally a team-based mod for [[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]] (1998). It later also became the first commercially released mod.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Controversy around playbour and modding ==
Not only is modding a big part of [[Video game culture|gaming culture]], but it is also an increasingly important source of value for the digital games industry. Game companies usually retain the [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] of the modifications. Since players need to have a copy of the original game to run the modifications, mods may add to the shelf-life of the product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to that, mods may help with establishing [[brand]]s (e.g. Counter-Strike), thus saving companies a significant amount of money. Marketing costs often take up a large percentage of a game's budget, but successfully established brands require less marketing. Mods also increase customer loyalty and are an important source of innovation in the digital games industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another way that game companies can benefit from the modding culture is that they can recruit modders as employees who are already trained at no cost to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/playbour-farming-and-labour|title=Playbour, farming and labour|last=Goggin|first=Joyce|date=|website=www.ephemerajournal.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While game companies may benefit economically from playbour, the players doing the work are not entirely uncompensated: they may obtain virtual in-game rewards or social capital such as followers on [[social media]]. The experience of play also has value in itself.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/10/15/gamification-playbor-exploitation-2/|title=Gamification, Playbor &amp; Exploitation|last=Patella-Rey|first=PJ|date=16 October 2012|work=The Society Pages|access-date=2018-02-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playbour is a voluntary activity and players don't usually view modding as labour. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that playboures are exploited by the games industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14237">[[File:Elements of Industry Structure.svg|thumb|350px|A graphical representation of Porter's five forces]]
'''Porter's Five Forces Framework''' is a tool for analyzing competition of a business. It draws from [[Industrial organization|industrial organization (IO) economics]] to derive five forces that determine the competitive intensity and, therefore, the attractiveness (or lack of it) of an industry in terms of its profitability. An "unattractive" industry is one in which the effect of these five forces reduces overall profitability. The most unattractive industry would be one approaching "pure competition", in which available profits for all firms are driven to [[Profit (economics)#Normal profit|normal profit levels]]. The five-forces perspective is associated with its originator, [[Michael E. Porter]] of [[Harvard University]]. This framework was first published in ''Harvard Business Review'' in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Porter, "How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy," May 1979 (Vol. 57, No. 2), pp. 137-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter refers to these forces as the [[Market_environment#Micro-environment|microenvironment]], to contrast it with the more general term [[environmental scanning|macroenvironment]]. They consist of those forces close to a [[company]] that affect its ability to serve its customers and make a [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. A change in any of the forces normally requires a business unit to re-assess the [[marketplace]] given the overall change in [[industry information]]. The overall industry attractiveness does not imply that every [[firm]] in the industry will return the same profitability. Firms are able to apply their [[core competencies]], [[business model]] or network to achieve a profit above the industry average. A clear example of this is the airline [[industry]]. As an industry, profitability is low because the industry's underlying structure of high fixed costs and low variable costs afford enormous latitude in the price of airline travel. Airlines tend to compete on cost, and that drives down the profitability of individual carriers as well as the industry itself because it simplifies the decision by a customer to buy or not buy a ticket. A few carriers--[[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Atlantic]] is one--have tried, with limited success, to use sources of differentiation in order to increase profitability.

Porter's five forces include three forces from 'horizontal' competition--the threat of substitute products or services, the threat of established rivals, and the threat of new entrants--and two others from 'vertical' competition--the [[bargaining power]] of suppliers and the bargaining power of customers.

Porter developed his five forces framework in reaction to the then-popular [[SWOT analysis]], which he found both lacking in rigor and ''ad hoc''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Porter, Nicholas Argyres and Anita M. McGahan, "An Interview with Michael Porter", ''The Academy of Management Executive'' '''16''':2:44 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4165839 at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Porter's five-forces framework is based on the [[structure–conduct–performance paradigm]] in [[Industrial organization|industrial organizational economics]]. It has been applied to try to address a diverse range of problems, from helping businesses become more profitable to helping governments stabilize industries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 ''Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization'']&lt;/ref&gt; Other Porter strategy tools include the [[value chain]] and [[Porter generic strategies|generic competitive strategies]].

== Five Forces ==
{{strategy}}

=== Threat of new entrants ===
Profitable industries that yield high returns will attract new firms. New entrants eventually will decrease profitability for other firms in the industry. Unless the entry of new firms can be made more difficult by [[incumbents]], abnormal profitability will fall towards zero ([[perfect competition]]), which is the minimum level of profitability required to keep an industry in business.

The following factors can have an effect on how much of a threat new entrants may pose:
* The existence of [[barriers to entry]] ([[patents]], [[rights]], etc.). The most attractive segment is one in which entry barriers are high and exit barriers are low. It's worth noting, however, that high barriers to entry almost always make exit more difficult.
* Government policy
* Capital requirements
* Absolute cost
* Cost disadvantages independent of size
* [[Economies of scale]]
* [[Product differentiation]]
* [[Brand equity]]
* Switching costs
* Expected retaliation 
* Access to distribution channels
* [[Customer loyalty]] to established brands
* Industry profitability (the more profitable the industry, the more attractive it will be to new competitors)
* [[Network effect]]

=== Threat of substitutes ===
A substitute product uses a different technology to try to solve the same economic need. Examples of substitutes are meat, poultry, and fish; landlines and cellular telephones; airlines, automobiles, trains, and ships; beer and wine; and so on. For example, tap water is a substitute for Coke, but Pepsi is a product that uses the same technology (albeit different ingredients) to compete head-to-head with Coke, so it is not a substitute. Increased marketing for drinking tap water might "shrink the pie" for both Coke and Pepsi, whereas increased Pepsi advertising would likely "grow the pie" (increase consumption of all soft drinks), while giving Pepsi a larger market share at Coke's expense. 

Potential factors:
* Buyer propensity to substitute
* Relative price performance of substitute
* Buyer's [[switching costs]]
* Perceived level of [[product differentiation]]
* Number of substitute products available in the market
* Ease of substitution
* Availability of close substitute

=== Bargaining power of customers ===
The bargaining power of customers is also described as the market of outputs: the ability of customers to put the [[firm]] under pressure, which also affects the customer's sensitivity to price changes. Firms can take measures to reduce buyer power, such as implementing a loyalty program. Buyers' power is high if buyers have many alternatives. It is low if they have few choices. 

Potential factors:
* Buyer concentration to [[firm]] [[concentration ratio]]
* Degree of dependency upon existing channels of distribution
* Bargaining leverage, particularly in industries with high [[fixed cost]]s
* Buyer switching costs
* Buyer information availability
* Availability of existing substitute products
* Buyer [[price sensitivity]]
* Differential advantage (uniqueness) of industry products
* [[RFM (customer value)]] Analysis

=== Bargaining power of suppliers ===
The bargaining power of suppliers is also described as the market of inputs. Suppliers of raw materials, components, labor, and services (such as expertise) to the [[firm]] can be a source of power over the firm when there are few substitutes. If you are making biscuits and there is only one person who sells flour, you have no alternative but to buy it from them. Suppliers may refuse to work with the firm or charge excessively high prices for unique resources.

Potential factors are:
* Supplier switching costs relative to [[firm]] switching costs
* Degree of differentiation of inputs
* Impact of inputs on cost and differentiation
* Presence of substitute inputs
* Strength of distribution channel
* Supplier concentration to [[firm]] concentration ratio
* Employee solidarity (e.g. [[labor unions]])
* Supplier competition: the ability to forward vertically integrate and cut out the buyer.

===  Competitive rivalry ===
For most industries the intensity of competitive rivalry is the major determinant of the competitiveness of the industry. Having an understanding of industry rivals is vital to successfully market a product. Positioning pertains to how the public perceives a product and distinguishes it from competitors. A business must be aware of its competitors marketing strategy and pricing and also be reactive to any changes made. 

Potential factors:
* Sustainable [[competitive advantage]] through [[innovation]]
* Competition between online and offline companies
* Level of [[advertising]] expense
* Powerful competitive strategy
* Firm [[concentration ratio]]

== Usages ==
Strategy consultants occasionally use Porter's five forces [[Conceptual framework|framework]] when making a qualitative evaluation of a [[firm]]'s strategic position. However, for most consultants, the framework is only a starting point. They might use [[value chain]] or another type of analysis in conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://flevy.com/blog/introduction-to-strategy-development-and-strategy-execution/ | title=Introduction to Strategy Development and Strategy Execution | publisher=Flevy | date=21 October 2014 | accessdate=2 November 2014 | author=Tang, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like all general frameworks, an analysis that uses it to the exclusion of specifics about a particular situation is considered naive.

According to Porter, the five forces framework should be used at the line-of-business industry level; it is not designed to be used at the industry group or industry sector level. An industry is defined at a lower, more basic level: a market in which similar or closely related products and/or services are sold to buyers. (See [[industry information]].)  A [[firm]] that competes in a single industry should develop, at a minimum, one five forces analysis for its industry. Porter makes clear that for diversified companies, the primary issue in [[corporate strategy]] is the selection of [[Industry|industries]] ([[Industry|lines of business]]) in which the company will compete. The average ''Fortune Global 1,000'' company competes in 52 industries &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-management/chapter/external-inputs-to-strategy/|title=External Inputs to Strategy {{!}} Boundless Management|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Criticisms ==
Porter's framework has been challenged by other academics and strategists. For instance, Kevin P. Coyne and Somu Subramaniam claim that three dubious assumptions underlie the five forces:
* That buyers, competitors, and suppliers are unrelated and do not interact and [[collusion|collude]].
* That the source of value is structural advantage (creating barriers to entry).
* That uncertainty is low, allowing participants in a market to plan for and respond to changes in competitive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin P. Coyne and Somu Subramaniam, "Bringing Discipline to Strategy, ''[[McKinsey Quarterly]]'', 1996, (Vol. 33, No. 4), pp. 14-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important extension to Porter's work came from Adam Brandenburger and [[Barry Nalebuff]] of [[Yale School of Management]] in the mid-1990s. Using [[game theory]], they added the concept of [[complementors]] (also called "the 6th force") to try to explain the reasoning behind strategic alliances. Complementors are known as the impact of related products and services already in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Brandenburger, A. M., &amp; Nalebuff, B. J. (1995). The Right Game: Use Game Theory to Shape Strategy. ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', (Vol. 73, No. 4), 57-71. [http://faculty.som.yale.edu/barrynalebuff/rightgame_hbr1995.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that [[complementors]] are the sixth force has often been credited to [[Andrew Grove]], former CEO of [[Intel Corporation]]. Martyn Richard Jones, while consulting at [[Groupe Bull]], developed an augmented five forces model in Scotland in 1993. It is based on Porter's Framework and includes Government (national and regional) as well as pressure groups as the notional 6th force. This model was the result of work carried out as part of [[Groupe Bull]]'s Knowledge Asset Management Organisation initiative.

Porter indirectly rebutted the assertions of other forces, by referring to innovation, government, and complementary products and services as "factors" that affect the five forces.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Porter. "The Five Competitive Forces that Shape Strategy", ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', January 2008 (Vol. 88, No. 1), pp. 78-93. [http://hbr.org/2008/01/the-five-competitive-forces-that-shape-strategy/ar/1 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also perhaps not feasible to evaluate the attractiveness of an industry independently of the resources that a [[firm]] brings to that industry. It is thus argued (Wernerfelt 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Wernerfelt, B. (1984), A Resource-based View of the Firm, ''[[Strategic Management Journal]]'', Vol. 5: pp. 171-180 [http://web.mit.edu/bwerner/www/papers/AResource-BasedViewoftheFirm.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; that this theory be combined with the [[Resource-based view|resource-based view (RBV)]] in order for the firm to develop a sounder framework.

'''Public consultation''', or simply '''consultation''', is a regulatory process by which the public's input on matters affecting them is sought. Its main goals are in improving the efficiency, transparency&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/43/36785341.pdf Background Document on Public Consultation] (from the [[OECD]] Code, 10-Mar-2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and public involvement in large-scale projects or laws and policies. It usually involves ''notification'' (to publicise the matter to be consulted on), ''consultation'' (a two-way flow of information and opinion exchange) as well as ''participation'' (involving interest groups in the drafting of policy or legislation).&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; A frequently used tool for understanding different levels of community participation in consultation is known as [[Arnstein's ladder]].

The process is typical of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shannon|first=Moneo|title=Everyone Has An Opinion: The Art of Community Consultation|url=http://cityspaces.ca/art-community-consultation/|accessdate=April 8, 2014|newspaper=Douglas Magazine|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]] or [[Australia]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} though most [[democracy|democratic]] countries have similar systems. In the [[United States]], for example, this process is called "public notice and comment" (see [[Rulemaking]]). Some organisations such as the [[OECD]] also use such processes.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; In Canada, the word "consultation" has a special meaning among some First Nations Groups: "it is the duty of the Crown and third parties to consult with First Nations who have asserted, but not proved, [[Indigenous peoples#Indigenous rights, issues and concerns|aboriginal rights]] or title."&lt;ref&gt;Billy Garton and Sandra Carter, "First Nations Consultation: Higher, Wider, Deeper and Sooner", Bull, Housser &amp; Tupper, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is great variation of public consultations. In some countries there is a list of all consultations, or consultations are mentioned in normal news feed. Depending on the country there can be national or regional public consultations.

Ineffective consultations are considered to be cosmetic consultations that were done due to obligation or show and not true participatory decision making.

Small and Medium Enterprises in [[Afghanistan]] employ 10 to 500 employees, have sales up to US$1 million and [[paid-in capital]] of up to US$1 million. Lenders are banks, financing companies, some MFIs, local money exchange service providers ([[Hawala]] dealers), credit unions and societies. Most of these loans are disbursed against collateral of [[title deeds]], land deeds, property and automobile deeds. Some small loans are secured by neighbors, personal guarantees and character.

The SME loans that are disbursed by these lenders range from US$2,000-250,000.

The majority of SMEs operate in cities such as Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif, Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, Jalalabad, Kunduz, Faizabad, Maimana, JawzJan and Taloqan.

[[Interest rate]]s are marked from 12% up to 24% depending on mutual deals, loan amounts and credit history. Most formal lenders charge 0.5% to 2.0% of the loan amount as an up-front processing fee.

'''Subordination''' in [[banking]] and [[finance]] refers to the order of priorities in claims for [[ownership]] or interest in various [[assets]].

==United States law==
===Subordination of debt===
'''Subordination''' is the process by which a creditor is placed in a lower priority for the collection of its debt from its debtor's assets than the priority the creditor previously had,&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 4th Ed. 1951, defining "subordinate."&lt;/ref&gt; In common parlance, the debt is said to be subordinated but in reality, it is the right of the creditor to collect the debt that has been reduced in priority. The priority of right to collect the debt is important when a debtor owes more than one creditor but has assets of insufficient value to pay them all in full at the time of a default. Except in [[bankruptcy]] proceedings, the creditor with the first priority for collection will generally have the first claim on the debtor's assets for its debt and the creditors whose rights are subordinate will thus have fewer assets to satisfy their claims. Subordination can take place by operation of law or by agreement among the creditors.

===Subordination of security priority===
Subordination is also an issue in the priority of [[security interest]]s in the ownership of property.  For example, in [[real estate]], [[mortgages]] and other [[liens]] on the title to secure the payment or repayment of money usually take their priority from the time they attach to the title.  The purpose of this ordering of priority is to determine, in a [[foreclosure]] resulting from a default, who gets paid first with the sale proceeds from the foreclosure proceeding.  Earlier mortgages or other liens are often subordinated by their holders to later ones in order to accomplish agreed-upon ends.  An example is for the holder of a mortgage on undeveloped land to subordinate that mortgage to a later construction loan mortgage.  The motivation is either the belief that improvement of the land will benefit the first lender or that the first mortgage requires that it be subordinated to a future construction loan.

The ''subordination percentage'' of a security is the percentage of the total capital which is subordinate to the security in question.  Thus, the security will not suffer any losses until after that percentage of capital has been lost.

====Dealer subordinable debt====
In the automotive financing industry, many dealerships are allowed to designate personal loans which are payable to the ownership as subordinable debt. The finance institution and dealership may come to an agreement which allows this debt to stay within the confines of the financial statement and concurrently improve the dealership financial position from a liquidity perspective.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

===Equitable subordination===
[[United States bankruptcy court|Bankruptcy courts in the United States]] have the power and authority to subordinate prior claims on the assets of a bankrupt debtor to the claims of junior claimants based on principles of equity.  This is a remedy called "equitable subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|11|510}}(c)&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for subordination is usually the inequitable conduct of the prior claimant with respect to junior claimants.&lt;ref&gt; See, e.g., ''Murphy v. Meritor Savings Bank'', [[Case citation|126 B.R. 370, 393, 413]] ([[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|Bankr. D. Mass.]] 1991), in which an [[Leveraged buyout|LBO]] left the corporation with insufficient cash to operate for longer than 10 days.  In that case, the court not only avoided the mortgage securing the LBO debt, but it also subordinated the resulting lender's unsecured claim to the claims of all other creditors of the bankrupt debtor.&lt;/ref&gt;  Equitable subordination can be used to subordinate both secured and unsecured claims.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3000">'''Target culture''' is a pejorative term used to refer to the perceived negative effects of rigid adherence to performance targets by businesses and organisations. The term is primarily used to refer to this kind of behaviour within the provision of public services in the [[United Kingdom]]. Target culture often stems from not being able to accurately measure a broad social good like health, education or crime prevention: instead, specific target like increasing the number of people passing an examination  or the number of arrests made by a police force is used.

== Examples ==

School league tables and other education statistics are often criticised as an example of target culture. The use of number of [[GCSE]] examinations passed at grade C as a measure of educational attainment has led schools to focus specifically on getting students on the boundary between grades C and D to improve enough to get a C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24521957|title=School league tables widen to eight subjects|first=Sean|last=Couglan|publisher=BBC News|date=14 October 2013|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2009/jan/15/schools-targets-culture|title=The targets culture in schools is missing the point|first=Donald|last=McLeod|publisher=The Guardian|date=15 January 2009|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Police Federation of England and Wales]] criticised the bureaucratisation of policing and argued that the use of targets increased the number of arrests made for petty offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6656411.stm|title=Police condemn 'target culture'|date=15 May 2007|publisher=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure and investigation of Stafford Hospital has been blamed on target culture by some. [[The Guardian]] report in an interview with an anonymous senior NHS doctor that Stafford Hospital "was a graphic illustration of the growing disconnect we see every day between a target-driven culture and the best interests of our patients".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/mar/19/nhs-targets-stafford-hospital|title='A hospital is able to tick all the boxes, yet still utterly fail patients'|first=Aida|last=Edemariam|date=19 March 2009|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the British Conservative Party politician [[Liam Fox]], writing for the website [[ConservativeHome]], lists Bristol Eye Centre as an example of the negative effects of a target culture: by trying to meet government targets to recruit more patients, they failed to make follow-up appointments with existing patients leading to some patients losing some or all of their eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/centreright/2008/01/changing-our-la.html|publisher=ConservativeHome|title=Changing our Labour induced target culture|date=28 January 2008|first=Liam|last=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{VG Industry}}
The '''video game industry''' is the [[economic sector]] involved in the [[Video game development|development]], marketing, and [[Video game monetization|monetization of video games]]. It encompasses dozens of [[job]] disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Zackariasson, P. and Wilson, T.L. eds. (2012). ''The Video Game Industry: Formation, Present State, and Future''. New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The computer and video game industry has grown from focused markets to mainstream. They took in about [[United States dollar|US$]]9.5 billion in the US in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in 2010 ([[Entertainment Software Association|ESA]] annual report).

Modern [[personal computer]]s owe many advancements and innovations to the game industry: [[sound card]]s, [[graphics card]]s and [[3D graphic accelerator]]s, faster [[CPU]]s, and dedicated co-processors like [[PhysX]] are a few of the more notable improvements.

[[Sound card]]s were developed for addition of digital-quality sound to games and only later improved for music and [[audiophile]]s.&lt;ref name="sndhist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alldidigames.com/video-games-industry-infographics/ | publisher=Didi Games | work=Research on Video Games | author=Bob Johnstone | title=Didi Games | accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, graphics cards were developed for more colors.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; Later, graphic cards were developed for [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) and games; GUIs drove the need for high resolution, and games began using 3D acceleration.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; They also are one of the only pieces of hardware to allow multiple hookups (such as with [[Scan Line Interleave|SLI]] or [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]] graphics cards).&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; CD- and DVD-ROMs were developed for mass distribution of media in general; however the ability to store more information on cheap easily distributable media was instrumental in driving their ever-higher speeds.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt;

== Game industry value chain ==
Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the game industry [[value chain]] is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:
# Capital and publishing layer: involved in paying for development of new titles and seeking returns through licensing of the titles.
# Product and talent layer: includes [[Video game developer|developers]], [[video game designer|designers]] and [[game artist|artists]], who may be working under individual contracts or as part of in-house development teams.
# Production and tools layer: generates content [[game tool|production tools]], game development [[Game Middleware|middleware]], [[Game engine|customizable game engines]], and production management tools.
# Distribution layer: or the "[[video game publisher|publishing]]" industry, involved in generating and marketing catalogs of games for retail and online distribution.
# Hardware (or Virtual Machine or Software Platform) layer: or the providers of the underlying platform, which may be console-based, accessed through online media, or accessed through mobile devices such as [[smartphones]]. This layer now includes network infrastructure and non-hardware platforms such as virtual machines (e.g. Java or Flash), or software platforms such as browsers or even further Facebook, etc.
# End-users layer: or the users/players of the games.&lt;ref name="newmedia"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disciplines ==
The game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: [[game programmer]], [[game designer]], [[level designer]], [[game producer]], [[game artist]] and [[game tester]]. Most of these professionals are employed by [[video game developer]]s or [[video game publisher]]s. However, many [[hobby]]ists also produce computer games and sell them commercially.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Game developers and publishers sometimes employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://uncommonculture.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2965/2526#36&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of video games}}

=== 1940s–1960s ===

{{main|Early history of video games|Early mainframe games}}
Prior to the 1970s, there was no significant commercial aspect of the video game industry, but many advances in computing would set the stage for the birth of the industry.

Many early publicly-available interactive computer-based game machines used or other mechanisms to mimic a display; while technically not "video games", they had elements of interactivity between the player and the machine. Some examples of these included the 1940 "Nimatron", an electromagentic relay-based [[Nim]]-playing device designed by [[Edward Condon]] and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]],&lt;ref name="Priest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|title=The Priesthood At Play: Computer Games in the 1950s |work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-01-22|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172058/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'', an arcade game of [[tic-tac-toe]], built by [[Josef Kates]] for the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]],&lt;ref name="CNE"&gt;{{cite news|first=Marlene|last=Simmons|title=Bertie the Brain programmer heads science council |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rKYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pe0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=916,3790974&amp;dq=josef-kates&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=1975-10-09|page=17|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nimrod (computing)|Nimrod]] created by engineering firm [[Ferranti]] for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Replay: The History of Video Games]]|last=Donovan|first=Tristan|publisher=Yellow Ant|date=2010-04-20|isbn=978-0-9565072-0-4|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[cathode ray tube]]&amp;mdash;the core technology behind televisions&amp;mdash;created several of the first true video games. In 1947 Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann filed a patent for a "cathode ray tube amusement device". Their game, which uses a cathode ray tube hooked to an oscilloscope display, challenges players to fire a gun at target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofplay.org/about/icheg/video-game-history/timeline |title=Video Game History Timeline &amp;#124; The Strong |publisher=Museumofplay.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1950s and 1960s, with mainframe computers becoming available to campus colleges, students and others started to develop games that could be played at terminals that accessed the mainframe. One of the first known examples is ''[[Spacewar!]]'', developed by Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], and Wayne Wiitanen.&lt;ref name="Space"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|title=One, Two, Three, Four I Declare a Space War|work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-08-07|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172136/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of easy-to-program languages like [[BASIC]] for mainframes allowed for more simplistic games to be developed.

However, both the arcade and home markets would be dominated by ''Pong'' clones, which flooded the market and led to the [[video game crash of 1977]]. The crash eventually came to an end with the success of [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s ''[[Space Invaders]]'', released in 1978, sparking a renaissance for the video game industry and paving the way for the [[golden age of video arcade games]].&lt;ref name="Whittaker-122"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=0-415-16835-X|page=122|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The early part of the decade saw the rise of [[8-bit]] home computing, and [[Homebrew (video games)|home-made games]], especially in Europe (with the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]]) and Asia (with the [[NEC PC-8801|NEC PC-88]] and [[MSX]]). This time also saw the rise of [[video game journalism]], which was later expanded to include [[covermount]]ed cassettes and CDs.
In 1983, the [[North American video game crash of 1983|North American industry crashed]] due to the production of too many badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting in the fall of the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as [[Nintendo]],&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt; while a professional European computer game industry also began taking shape with companies such as [[Ocean Software]] and [[Gremlin Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ystop100.html|title=World of Spectrum - Archive - YS Top 100|work=worldofspectrum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the decade saw the rise of the [[Game Boy]] handheld system. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against [[Blockbuster Entertainment]], which enabled games rentals in the same way as movies.

[[File:PlayStation-SCPH-1000-with-Controller.png|thumb|right|The [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] was the most popular gaming console of the fifth generation, which saw the common adoption of CD media.]]
{{see also|History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)}}

The 1990s saw advancements in game related technology. Among the significant advancements were:
* The widespread adoption of [[compact disc|CD]]-based storage and software distribution
* Widespread adoption of [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based [[operating system]]s, such as the series of [[Amiga OS]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS]]
* Advancement in 3D graphics technology, as [[Graphics processing unit|3D graphic cards]] became widely adopted, with [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] now the ''[[de facto]]'' standard for video game visual presentation
* Continuing advancement of [[CPU]] speed and sophistication
* Miniaturisation of hardware, and mobile phones, which enabled [[mobile gaming]]
* The emergence of the internet, which in the latter part of the decade enabled online co-operative play and [[competitive gaming]]

Aside from technology, in the early part of the decade, [[brand licensing|licensed]] games became more popular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fahs |first=Travis |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/896/896893p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Madden - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurby |first=Patrick |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100805/madden |title=ESPN - OTL: The Franchise - E-ticket |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did video game sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Rus |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/954/954426p2.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Street Fighter - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
{{see also|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|History of video game consoles (seventh generation)}}

In 2000s, the video game industry is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as [[Smartphones]], [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, the video game industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping up, and just as quickly, going out of business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Nevertheless, many [[casual game]]s and [[indie game]]s were developed and become popular and successful, such as ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'' and ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]''. Game development for mobile phones (such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a [[Facebook]] game developer, [[Zynga]], has raised in excess of $300 million.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/15/zynga-takes-180-million-venture-round-cue-russian-mafia-jokes/ |title=Zynga Takes $180 Million Venture Round From DST, Others (Cue Russian Mafia Jokes) |publisher=TechCrunch |date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===
{{see also|History of video game consoles (eighth generation)}}

Though not the main driving force, [[independent video games|indie games]] continue to have a significant impact on the industry, with sales of some of these titles such as ''[[Spelunky]]'', ''[[Fez]]'', ''[[Don't Starve]]'', ''[[Castle Crashers]]'', and ''[[Minecraft]]'', exceeding millions of [[United States dollar|dollars]] and over a million users.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurial-insights.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneurial-insights.com/gaming-industry-introduction/|title=The Gaming Industry – An Introduction|work=Entrepreneurial Insights}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|date=February 2017}} The 2010s have seen a larger shift to casual and [[mobile gaming]]; in 2016, the mobile gaming market is estimated to have taken $38 billion in revenues, compared to $6 billion for the console market and $33 billion for personal computing gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-10-24-welcome-to-the-new-era-games-as-media | title = Welcome to the New Era: Games as Media | first = Joost | last = van Dreunen | date = October 24, 2016 | accessdate = October 31, 2016 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Games centered on [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] equipment also arose during this decade. As of 2014, newer game companies arose that vertically integrate live operations and publishing such as crowdfunding and other direct-to-consumer efforts, rather than relying on a traditional publishers, and some of these have grown to substantial size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/business-startup-development-and-more/50e5d9379521 |title=The Future of Games and How to Stop It |last1=Radoff |first1=Jon |last2= |first2= |date=February 10, 2014 |website=medium.com |publisher=medium.com |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurred by some initial events in the late 2000s, [[eSports]] centered around professional players in organized competitions and leagues for prize money, grew greatly over this decade, drawing hundreds of millions of viewers and reaching nearly $500 million in revenue by 2016 and expected to break $1 billion by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/29/sport/esports-revolution-revenue-audience-growth/index.html | title = ESports: Global revenue expected to smash $1 billion by 2019 | first = Don | last=  Riddell | date = May 29, 2016 | accessdate = January 16, 2018  | work = [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==
Early on, development costs were minimal, and video games could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as [[royalties]] on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as [[Origin Systems]], [[Sierra Entertainment]], [[Capcom]], [[Activision]] and [[Electronic Arts]].

As computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/video-gaming-industry-numbers-by-region/|title=Top Gaming Studios, Schools &amp; Salaries|work=Big Fish Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can often take between one and three years to develop. Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite the growing popularity of [[Game Middleware|middleware]] and pre-built [[game engine]]s.  In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Superannuation|title=How Much Does It Cost To Make A Big Video Game?|url=http://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649|website=Kotaku|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game development team has to select a profitable and suitable method [[Video game monetization|to sell or earn money from]] the finished game. Traditionally, the game monetization method is to sell hard copies in retail store. Now some developers are turning to alternative production and distribution methods, such as [[digital distribution|online distribution]], to reduce costs and increase revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kain|first1=Erik|title=Why Digital Distribution Is The Future And GameStop Is Not: Taking The Long View On Used Games|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/05/30/why-digital-distribution-is-the-future-and-gamestop-is-not-taking-the-long-view-on-used-games/|website=Forbes|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the video game industry has a major impact on the economy through the sales of major systems and games such as ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', which took in over $650 [[United States dollar|USD]] million of sales in the game's first five days and which set a five-day global record for a movie, book or videogame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision "Call of Duty: Black Ops" sets record for Activision"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125022802/http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision |date=January 25, 2011 }}.

The industry wide adoption of high-definition graphics during the seventh generation of consoles greatly increased development teams' sizes and reduced the number of [[Triple A (gaming)|high-budget, high-quality titles]] under development. In 2013 [[Richard Hilleman]] of Electronic Arts estimated that only 25 developers were working on such titles for the eighth console generation, compared to 125 at the same point in the seventh generation-console cycle seven or eight years earlier.&lt;ref name="vgchartz20130706"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vgchartz.com/article/251108/ea-aaa-development-in-decline/ | title=EA: AAA Development in Decline | work=VGChartz | date=July 6, 2013 | accessdate=July 8, 2013 | author=D'Angelo, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retail ===

The games industry's shift from brick and mortar retail to digital downloads led to a severe sales decline at video game retailers such as [[GameStop]], following other media retailers superseded by Internet delivery, such as [[Blockbuster (company)|Blockbuster]], [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]], and [[Virgin Megastores]]. GameStop diversified its services by purchasing chains that repair wireless devices and expanding its trade-in program through which customers trade used games for credit towards new games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Wingfield |first1=Nick |title=As Downloads Take Over, a Turning Point for the Video Game Industry |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-12-20 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/technology/as-downloads-take-over-a-turning-point-for-the-video-game-industry.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began to produce its own merchandise and games. In Britain, the games retailer [[Game (retailer)|Game]] revamped its stores so customers would spend time playing games there. It built a gaming arena for events and tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=GAME launches Belong - is this the future of video games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-12-16 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-15-game-launches-belong-is-this-the-future-of-video-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to digital marketplaces, especially for smartphones, led to an influx of inexpensive and disposable titles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Suellentrop |first1=Chris |last2=Totilo |first2=Stephen |title=Video Game Retail Sales Decline Despite New Hits |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-10-03 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/arts/video-games/video-game-retail-sales-decline-despite-new-hits.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lower engagement among gamers who otherwise purchased new games from retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=What's going wrong at UK games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-21 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-21-whats-going-wrong-at-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- more in this source --&gt; Customers also shifted away from the tradition of buying games on their first day of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=Is the industry's obsession with Day One coming to an end? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-08 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-07-is-the-industrys-obsession-with-day-one-coming-to-an-end |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishers often funded trade-in deals to encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business.{{r|Eurogamer: trade-in myths}} They figured that sites such as [[eBay]], which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parfitt |first1=Ben |title=Pre-owned price comparison site Trade In Detectives goes live |work=[[MCV UK]] |date=2013-08-07 |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/pre-owned-price-comparison-site-trade-in-detectives-goes-live/0119776 |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: trade-in myths"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Purchese |first1=Robert |title=Myth-busting the murky world of video game trade-ins |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2013-12-18 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-03-myth-busting-the-murky-world-of-video-game-trade-ins |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
Video game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the [[recording industry|music recording industry]]), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.

However, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes [[video game publisher|publishers]], who fund the [[video game developer|developers]], much more important than in the music industry.

=== Breakaways ===
In the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the "original" independent developer [[Activision]], founded by former [[Atari]] developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|title=Activision Aims for Sweet Spot|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|date=May 24, 2005|publisher=TheStreet.com|accessdate=March 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ffLSaAf0?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] left Activision to start another video game development company, [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] (now [[Atari]] née [[Infogrames]]).

Activision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.

=== Piracy ===
The industry claims [[software piracy]] to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valjalo |first=David |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware |title=3DS Will Fight Piracy With Firmware &amp;#124; Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN2nGrc6?url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware/ |archivedate=February 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Digital rights management]] have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7972677.stm |title=Technology &amp;#124; EA 'dumps DRM' for next Sims game |publisher=BBC News |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to [[Freemium]], where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from [[Cheating in video games|hacked]] (faked) transactions.

=== Creative control ===
On various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between [[Recording Artists' Coalition|recording artists]] and [[RIAA|record labels]] in many ways. But unlike the [[music industry]], which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20021010.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 9.2% in the first half of 2002 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20031001.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 10.9% in the first half of 2003 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20051003.html|title=Digital sales triple to 6% of industry retail revenues as global music market falls 1.9% (2005) from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the video game industry continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2132172920070621|title=Video game industry growth still strong: study|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.

In the [[computer game]]s industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The [[video game console|console]] games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the [[console manufacturer]]:
# A license to develop games for the console
# The publisher must have a license to publish games for the console
# A separate license for each game

In addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.

=== Alternatives ===
An alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the [[shareware]] or [[Open-source software|open source]] model over the [[Internet]].

=== Gaming conventions ===
[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry.

=== Conventions ===
{{See also|:Category:Video game trade shows}}
[[Image:Gamescom 2009 - Koelnmesse Südeingang (5473).jpg|thumb|The [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]], the major gaming fair by attendance.]]
[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany) is a major expo for video games. The [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA) is also of global importance, but is an event for industry insiders only.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

Other notable conventions and trade fairs include [[Tokyo Game Show]] (Japan), [[Brasil Game Show]] (Brazil), [[EB Games Expo]] (Australia), [[Russian Game Developers Conference|KRI]] (Russia), [[China Digital Entertainment Expo &amp; Conference|ChinaJoy]] (China) and the annual [[Game Developers Conference]]. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with [[BlizzCon]], [[QuakeCon]], [[Nvision]] and the [[X (Xbox show)|X shows]] being prominent examples.

=== Africa ===

Video gaming is still in its infancy throughout the African continent, but due to the continent's young population and increasing technological literacy, the sector is growing rapidly. African countries such as [[video gaming in South Africa|South Africa]], [[video gaming in Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[video gaming in Kenya|Kenya]] have been making rapid advances in [[mobile gaming|mobile game development]], both within their country and internationally,&lt;ref name="Africa top 10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2013/10/top-10-african-game-developers/|title=Top 10 African game developers|publisher=''[[IT News Africa]]''|last=Fripp|first=Charlie|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to limited funding and a market over-crowded with western games, success has thus far been minimal.&lt;ref name="Mail &amp; Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2014-12-02-things-africa-will-be-famous-for-in-the-next-10-15-years|title=Africa 2030, the next 25 years: From video games, eco-buildings, robotics, and cycling|publisher=''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] Africa''|last=Spooner|first=Samantha|date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, this industry generates billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in the Montreal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourisme-montreal.org/meetings/2015/01/20/business-sectors/|title=What are the leading business sectors in Montréal?

The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series, along with the ''[[Tom Clancy]]'' series have all been produced in Canada and have achieved worldwide success. For consumers, the largest video games convention in Canada is the Enthusiast Gaming Live Expo (EGLX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Carignan |url=https://www.destructoid.com/dtoid-is-hosting-canada-s-largest-gaming-event-eglx-returns-march-9-11-2018-469022.phtml |title=Dtoid is hosting Canada's largest gaming event!

{{main|Video gaming in Germany}}

[[Germany]] has the largest video games market in Europe, with revenues of $4.1&amp;nbsp;billion forecast for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-100-countries-by-game-revenues/|title=Top 100 Countries By Game Revenues|last=|first=|date=January 2017|website=newzoo.com|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] is Europe's largest gaming expo.

One of the earliest internationally successful video game companies was [[Gütersloh]]-based [[Rainbow Arts]] (founded in 1984) who were responsible for publishing the popular ''[[Turrican]]'' series of games. The [[Anno (series)|Anno series]] and [[The Settlers|The Settlers series]] are globally popular strategy game franchises since the 1990s. The [[Gothic series]], [[SpellForce: The Order of Dawn|SpellForce]] and [[Risen (video game)|Risen]] are established RPG franchises. The [[X (game series)|X series]] by [[Egosoft]] is the best-selling space simulation. The [[FIFA Manager (video game series)|FIFA Manager series]] was also developed in Germany. The German action game [[Spec Ops: The Line]] (2012) was successful in the markets and received largely positive reviews. One of the most famed titles to come out of Germany is ''[[Far Cry]]'' (2004) by [[Frankfurt]]-based [[Crytek]], who also produced the topseller ''[[Crysis]]'' and its sequels later.

Other well-known current and former developers from Germany include [[Ascaron]], [[Blue Byte]], [[Deck13 Interactive|Deck13]], [[EA Phenomic|Phenomic]], [[Piranha Bytes]], [[Radon Labs|Radon]], [[Related Designs|Related]], [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]] and [[Yager Development]]. Publishers include [[Deep Silver]] ([[Koch Media]]), [[dtp entertainment]], [[Kalypso Media|Kalypso]] and [[Nintendo|Nintendo Europe]]. [[Bigpoint Games]], [[Gameforge]], [[Goodgame Studios]] and [[Wooga]] are among the world's leading browser game and social network game developers/distributors.

=== Japan ===
{{main|Video gaming in Japan}}
[[File:Nintendo office.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters of [[Nintendo]] in [[Kyoto]], Japan, 2006.]]
The [[Japan]]ese video game industry is markedly different from the industry in North America, Europe and Australia.

&lt;!-- Generally, games have a greater [[market share]] of total entertainment in Japan than in the West.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} --&gt;
Japanese companies have created some of the largest and most lucrative titles ever made, such as the ''[[Mario]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Metal Gear]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series of games.

&lt;!-- [[Video arcade|Video game arcades]] are still relatively popular in Japan; for every [[arcade game]] released in the US, nine are released in [[Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The history of the Japanese arcade is very significant in the story of the decline of the American arcade, and in the shape of [[game design]] in general. --&gt;
In recent years, [[video game console|consoles]] and arcade games have both been overtaken by downloadable [[free-to-play]] games on the [[PC game|PC]] and [[Mobile game|mobile]] platforms.&lt;ref name=economist12&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan fights back|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21566696-two-japanese-firms-are-challenging-world-new-kind-video-game-japan-fights-back|publisher=The Economist|date=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=capcom_marketdata&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Data|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/market.html|publisher=[[Capcom]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The structure and culture of a Japanese game developer is different from a western one. Throughout the history of Japanese game design, many developers have seen fit to remain mostly anonymous, even using pseudonyms to a large degree in video game credits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Also, the division in labor for video game development is different. For example, Japanese game design teams had a dedicated [[game designer|designer]] (which they called a "director") much earlier than American design teams adopted the practice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Secondly, Japanese game designers throughout history generally had far more people working on a particular game than a comparable western design team. For example, ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' (1992), a Japanese title, had almost one artist working on every character in the game, plus two programmers and a musician, with the result being a team of twenty or more people.  ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992), a comparable American title, was developed by four people: a [[game programmer|programmer]], an [[artist]], a [[musician]], and a background artist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} --&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main|Video gaming in the United Kingdom}}

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] industry is the third largest in the World in terms of developer success and sales of hardware and software by country alone but fourth behind Canada in terms of people employed.&lt;ref name="networkworld1"/&gt; The size of the UK game industry is comparable to its film or music industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-04-04-view-from-the-tower|title=The View From the Tower|publisher=gamesindustry.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years some of the studios have become defunct or been purchased by larger companies such as ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' developer, [[Media Molecule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/03/02/media-molecule-officially-joins-the-playstation-family/ |title=Media Molecule Officially Joins The PlayStation Family – PlayStation.Blog.Europe |publisher=Blog.eu.playstation.com |date=March 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Codemasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinkle |first=David |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/05/reliance-big-entertainment-acquires-50-stake-in-codemasters |title=Reliance Big Entertainment acquires 50% stake in Codemasters |publisher=Joystiq |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to some of the world's most successful video game franchises, such as ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', ''[[Fable (video game series)|Fable]]'', ''[[Colin McRae: Dirt|Colin McRae Dirt]]'' and ''[[Total War (series)|Total War]]''.

The country also went without tax relief until March 21, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Rik |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44996/budget-2012-tax-relief-video-games |title=UK tax relief break |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate= March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the British government changed its mind on tax relief for UK developers, which without, meant most of the talented development within the UK may move overseas for more profit, along with parents of certain video game developers which would pay for having games developed in the UK. The industry trade body TIGA estimates that it will increase the games development sector's contribution to UK GDP by £283 million, generate £172 million in new and protected tax receipts to HM Treasury, and could cost just £96 million over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Post comment Name Email Address Comments |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |title=Game industry tax relief plans are shelved |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625151807/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |archivedate=June 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the tax relief was introduced there was a fear that the UK games industry could fall behind other leading game industries around the world such as France and Canada, of which Canada overtook the UK in terms of job numbers in the industry in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Canada overtakes UK |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/34406/Canada-overtakes-UK-industry-workforce-tally |date=March 31, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
[[Magnavox]] is credited for releasing the first [[video game console]], the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. [[Activision]] was the first developer to create independent/third-party video games. Once the fastest-growing American company, [[Atari]] crashed in spectacular fashion, resulting in the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. This resulted in the domination of the Japanese video game industry worldwide throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

====Companies====
The U.S. is home to major game development companies such as [[Activision Blizzard]] (''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]''), [[Electronic Arts]] (''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'', ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]''), and [[Take-Two Interactive]] ([[Civilization (series)|Civilization]], [[NBA 2K (series)|''NBA 2K'' series]], ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''). [[ZeniMax Media]] (''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'') is the world's largest privately held video game company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Zenimax+Claims+Carmack+Stole+Oculus+VR+Facebook+Barks+Back/article34869.htm|title=Zenimax Claims Carmack Stole Oculus VR, Facebook Barks Back|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niantic, Inc.|Niantic]] (''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'', ''[[Pokémon Go]]'') is a notable mobile game developer.

[[Valve Corporation]] operates [[Steam (software)|Steam]], the largest computer gaming platform, with an active user base (~125 million) that rivals the combined user bases of the current console generation (~150 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgchartz.com/|title=VGChartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not specifically focused on games, the largest mobile gaming platforms are operated by [[Google]] ([[Google Play]]), and [[Apple Inc.]] ([[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]), with the majority of mobile revenue coming from Asia.&lt;ref name=idcannie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-idc-portable-gaming-report-2013-q2/|author=App Annie, IDC|title=App Annie &amp; IDC Portable Gaming Report Q2 2013: iOS &amp; Google Play Game Revenue 4x Higher Than Gaming-Optimized Handhelds}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] operates [[Xbox]], the only major game console hardware franchise not controlled by a Japanese company.

[[Intel]] and [[Nvidia]] are the largest makers of PC graphics chips. [[Advanced Micro Devices]] has become the most important console [[Microprocessor|processor]] vendor, with all three of the [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation home consoles]] using AMD [[graphics processing unit|GPU]]s, and two of them use AMD [[central processing unit|CPU]]s. Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony were not aware that they were all using AMD processors until all their consoles were announced,&lt;ref name=e12a&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/12/amd-vp-saeid-moshkelani-interview/|work=[[Engadget]]|title=AMD's Saeid Moshkelani on building custom silicon for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Wii U |date=June 12, 2013 |first=Michael |last=Gorman}}&lt;/ref&gt; underscoring the secrecy found within the game industry. Notable game engine developers include [[Epic Games]] ([[Unreal Engine]]) and [[Unity Technologies]] ([[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]).

====Regions====
The [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is home to important video game conventions, such as [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), one of the largest video game industry-only events in the world, and [[Penny Arcade Expo]] (PAX West), the largest public video game convention in [[North America]]. The West Coast is also home to many of the major American video game industry companies, particularly the regions of [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[Seattle]]. Major game development regions outside of the West Coast include the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Texas]].

====People====
Over 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/about-esa/industry-facts/|title=Industry Facts|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean [[conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/article/new-study-finds-video-game-players-are-highly-engaged-politically/|title=New Study Finds Video Game Players Are Highly Engaged Politically|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several important [[List of video game industry people|game development personalities]] were born in or moved to the United States. Notable developers include [[Ralph H.

Carmack]] (''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''), and [[Alexey Pajitnov]] (''[[Tetris]]''). [[Mario]] is named after [[Mario Segale]], a former landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]. Some [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] activists, including [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Anita Sarkeesian]], have met extreme resistance from the gaming public in response to the perceived politicizing of their art form.&lt;ref name=TC2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/25/gamergate-an-issue-with-2-sides/ | title=#GamerGate – An Issue With Two Sides | author= Allum Bokhari | publisher=[[TechCrunch]] | accessdate= September 27, 2014|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trends ==
Players become fourth-party developers, allowing for more [[Open-source software|open source]] models of [[game design]], development and engineering. Players also create [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which began as a mod of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.

While this "community of modifiers" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing [[source code]]) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the [[video game industry#Game industry value chain|game industry value chain]] and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt;

The industry has seen a shift towards games with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.

In addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer's website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|pages=220–221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this distinction has been diminished, players' willingness to play and access content on different platforms has increased. The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, "Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3's inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014. And according to Census Bureau data, by the year 2020, there will be 174 million Americans between the ages of 5 and 44. That's 174 million Americans who will have grown up with PlayStations, Xboxes, and GameCubes from their early childhood and teenage years...What this means is that the average gamer will be both older and, given their lifetime familiarity with playing interactive games, more sophisticated and discriminating about the games they play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the increasing player willingness to play video games across a variety of media and different platforms can be seen in the rise of casual gaming on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites as 92% of all smartphone and tablet owners play games at least once a week, 45% play daily, and industry estimates predict that, by 2016, one-third of all global mobile gaming revenue will come from tablets alone. Apple's App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld gaming systems combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J.

'''Whitewash Resolution''' is a proposed resolution for the waiver of rights of independent [[shareholder]]s to receive a mandatory [[takeover]] from the [[investor]] and its concert parties for the [[voting share|ordinary share]]s of the [[company]] not already owned or controlled by them.

A whitewash waiver is a [[corporate law]] concept originating in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].  In some cases an investor will apply to the Executive for the Whitewash Waiver, which, if granted, will be subject to the approval of independent shareholders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3392">A '''work card''' is like an [[Identity Card]] which verifies that a person has been given work, or is eligible to perform work in a given profession or jurisdiction. The work card is not a [[Visa (document)|work visa]], although it may be used in conjunction with a work visa, [[United States Permanent Resident Card|permanent resident card]] or other documentation.

Work cards are often used in countries with high [[unemployment]] to certify that the individual meets certain legal requirements (such as head of household, or with dependent children) making him or her eligible for work.

Work cards are also used in certain industries like [[construction]] (where specialized training and safety skills are required)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | publisher = Ontario Ministry of Labour | title = Workers Performing Specialized Construction Work | date = August 2006 | url = http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/about/ontque/fs_specialized.html | accessdate = 2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[gambling]] (where background and credit checks are required to reduce the incidence of crime).&lt;ref&gt;"ACLU Still Critical of State's Work Card Proposal," ''Gambling Magazine,'' September 10, 2002; "County Rethinks Work Card Requirements," ''Gambling Magazine,'' April 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work cards are used in some employment situations, such as [[prostitution]], so that government officials may track the number of workers in a given industry. Frequent renewal of work cards may also be required to ensure that workers undergo regular health check-ups, or to gather information on working conditions or the incident of crime (such as assault against the prostitute, or a prostitute's criminal background).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.elko.nv.us/codes/City_Municipal_Code/Title_4/9/13.html "Section 4-9-13: Work Permit Registration Requirements." Municipal Code, City of Elko, Nevada.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Work cards are increasingly used in the [[European Union]] (EU) to verify an individual's citizenship in a member-nation, and the kind of work which that individual may engage in. For example, citizens of states with provisional membership in the EU must obtain both an EU work card and a work card from nation in which they wish to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | publisher = Westmoreland Gazette | title = Employees Need a Work Card Permit | date = 2007-01-19 | url = http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/search/1134882.Employees_need_a_work_card_permit/ | accessdate = 2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where a union has won the [[closed shop]], a work card may be issued by a [[trade union]].  The work card will permit the non-union worker to work in the industry or for the employer with union permission.&lt;ref&gt;Lahane, "The Union Work Permit," ''Political Science Quarterly,'' September 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;
