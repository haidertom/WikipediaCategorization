An '''assault course''' (also called '''trim trail''') is a special sort of [[trail]] that combines [[running]] and [[Physical exercise|exercising]]. It was more popular in the 1970s than it is now.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} It is heavily used in [[military training]]. The prime use is to evaluate progress and weaknesses within the team involved.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

==Military training==
Assault courses are used in military training to increase fitness, to demonstrate techniques that can be used for crossing very rough terrain, and to increase teamwork and self-confidence.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

Often military assault courses will be standardised, and will have, for example (in the UK), a six-foot and a ten-foot wall, a climbing net, some type of bar to climb over, and a high rope or net that must be crossed (these being or representing the most likely difficult terrain that a soldier will come across). The standardisation means that every course will be to the same quality, though it also means that there will be certain parts that may be familiar if practised.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

However, they have different purposes. For example, they can be short (less than a minute) with a range on the end (e.g. Junior Leaders, Folkestone), or long (five minutes) as at Thetford.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} This is partially because of space restraints and training objectives. The short one can be run as an individual course and a warmup for the range. The long Thetford course is more of an exercise in endurance and teamwork.

==Trim trail==
The term "trim trail" has more recently been applied to a series of wooden exercise stations, scattered in parkland or other locations beside a jogging or walking trail, which can be used to develop balance, strength and coordination.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} They are suitable for both adults and children, and the individual stations have been scientifically designed to provide a range of exercise.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} Most have simple instructions attached to them, and the stations include balance beams, sit-up bars, chin-up bars, parallel bars, and more challenging stations such as pole climbs and ladder walks.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} Bristol City Council have now installed trim trails in six parks, ranging in complexity from Withywood Park, which has a single station, to Victoria Park, which has nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loughgallcountrypark.co.uk/?page=cycling&amp;sub=17 |title=Welcome to Loughall Country Park |publisher=Loughall Country Park |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/node/6645 |title=Trim trail exercise stations |publisher=Bristol City Council |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the trim trail at [[Hollingworth Lake]], in [[Greater Manchester]], which was the idea of the Friends of Hollingworth Lake and opened in August 2010, was provided by the [[Big Lottery Fund|Big Lottery]] Community Spaces fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwest.groundwork.org.uk/oldham--rochdale/news--events/news/2010/woodland-wonder-opens-for-all.aspx |title=Woodland Wonder opens for all |publisher=Groundwork Oldham and Rochdale |date=17 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212114711/http://www.northwest.groundwork.org.uk/oldham--rochdale/news--events/news/2010/woodland-wonder-opens-for-all.aspx |archivedate=12 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jim Thorpe, 1912 Summer Olympics.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jim Thorpe]] at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]]]]

An '''athlete''' (also '''sportsman'''  or '''sportswoman''') is a person who competes in one or more [[sport]]s that involve [[physical strength]], speed or [[endurance]]. The application of the term to those who participate in other activities, such as horse riding or driving, is somewhat controversial.

Athletes may be [[Professional sports|professional]]s or [[amateur sports|amateurs]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins English Dictionary, Millennium Ed. - 'athlete'&lt;/ref&gt; Most professional athletes have particularly well-developed physiques obtained by extensive physical training and strict exercise accompanied by a strict dietary regimen.

==Overview==
[[File:Armedforces crosscountry coppingerandballas.jpg|thumb|left|Athletes taking part in a race on a snowy park in the U.S.]]
The word "athlete" is a [[romanization]] of the {{lang-el|άθλητὴς}}, ''athlētēs'', one who participates in a contest; from ἄθλος, ''áthlos'', or ἄθλον, ''áthlon'', a contest or feat. The primary definition of "sportsman" according to Webster's ''Third Unabridged Dictionary'' (1960) is, "a person who is active in sports: as  (a): one who engages in the sports of the field and especially in hunting or fishing." Athletes involved in isotonic exercises have an increased mean left ventricular end-diastolic volume and are less likely to be depressed.&lt;ref&gt;MORGANROTH, JOEL, et al. "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1024.7587&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Comparative left ventricular dimensions in trained athletes]." Annals of internal medicine 82.4 (1975): 521-524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oler, Michael J., et al. "[http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/7987512 Depression, suicidal ideation, and substance use among adolescents. Are athletes at less risk?]." Archives of Family Medicine 3.9 (1994): 781-785.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their strenuous physical activities, athletes are far more likely than the general population to visit [[massage]] salons and pay for services from massotherapists and masseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Jönhagen, Sven, et al. "[http://www.taichiqigongreikicentre.com.au/resources/Sports%20Massage%20after%20Eccentric%20Exercise.pdf Sports massage after eccentric exercise]." The American Journal of Sports Medicine 32.6 (2004): 1499-1503.&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes whose sport espouses endurance more than strength usually have a lower calorie intake than other athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Paul D., et al. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002604958490249X The effects of caloric restriction or exercise cessation on the serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations of endurance athletes]." Metabolism 33.10 (1984): 943-950.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Titles ==
{{see also|Athlete of the Year}}

==="All-around athlete"===
An "'''all-around athlete'''" is a person who competes in multiple sports at a high level. Examples of people who played more than one sport professionally include [[Jim Thorpe]], [[Lionel Conacher]], [[Deion Sanders]], [[Danny Ainge]], [[Babe Zaharias]] and [[Erin Phillips]]. Others include [[Ricky Williams]], [[Bo Jackson]], and [[Damon Allen]], each of whom was drafted both by [[Major League Baseball]] and by professional [[gridiron football]] leagues such as the [[National Football League|NFL]] and the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]. Another female example is [[Heather Moyse]], a multiple Winter Olympic gold medalist in [[Bobsleigh|bobsled]] and member of the [[World Rugby Hall of Fame]] who also represented Canada internationally in [[track cycling]] and competed at [[U Sports|university]] level in basketball and track and field. Japanese athletes such as [[Kazushi Sakuraba]], [[Kazuyuki Fujita]], [[Masakatsu Funaki]] and [[Naoya Ogawa]] have successfully performed in [[professional wrestling]] (which isn't a sport) and competed in [[mixed martial arts]].

==="World's Greatest Athlete"===
The title of "'''World's Greatest Athlete'''" traditionally belongs to the world's top competitor in the [[decathlon]] (males) and [[heptathlon]] (females) in [[track and field]]. The [[decathlon]] consists of 10 events: [[100 meters]], [[long jump]], [[shot put]], [[high jump]], [[400 meters]], [[110 m hurdles]], [[discus]], [[pole vault]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], and [[1500 m]]. The [[heptathlon]] consists of seven events: the [[100 m hurdles]], [[high jump]], [[shot put]], [[200 meters]], [[long jump]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], and [[800 meters]]. These competitions require an athlete to possess the whole spectrum of athletic ability in order to be successful including speed, strength, coordination, jumping ability, and endurance.

Although the title "World's Greatest '''Athlete'''" seems a natural fit for these two events, its traditional association with the decathlon/heptathlon officially began with [[Jim Thorpe]]. During the 1912 [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] in Stockholm, Sweden, Thorpe won the gold medal in the [[Decathlon]] (among others). Thorpe notably also competed professionally in [[soccer]], [[baseball]], [[American Football]], and [[basketball]]; and competed collegiately in [[track and field]], [[soccer]], [[baseball]], [[lacrosse]], and did [[ballroom dancing]]. King [[Gustav V of Sweden]], while awarding Thorpe the decathlon gold said: "You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world." That title has become associated with the decathlon event ever since.

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}

In some [[team sport]]s, an '''attacker''' is a specific type of player, usually involved in aggressive play. Heavy attackers are, usually, placed up front: their goal is to score the most possible points for the team.

In [[association football]], attackers are also referred to as [[Forward (association football)#Striker|strikers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2913">'''Belt-sander racing''' is the practice of racing [[belt sander]]s competitively. Belt sanders were one of the first power tools used in the growing field of power tool [[drag racing]]{{cn|date=September 2013}} wherein a pair of stock or modified belt sanders are placed in parallel wooden channels and fitted with long [[extension cord]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/03/technology/screen-grab-a-sport-for-purists-belt-sander-races.html | title=A Sport for Purists: Belt-Sander Races | publisher=New York Times | date=February 3, 2000 | accessdate=June 24, 2012 | author=Pollak, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each heat begins when a common switch or individual switches triggered by the racers energizes them, causing the sanders to race towards the end of the track spitting wood dust along the way.  Both stock sanders  and modified sanders race down a {{convert|75|foot}} long track. Sanders of all shapes and sizes can go very fast, or very slow depending on the power of the motor.  The fastest time on a 75-foot track was 2.2103 seconds recorded by Dudley Harper's Sudden Death Racer of San Marcos, Texas.  Sudden Death raced on that date at the Legends Raceway in Rockport, Texas.  The peak velocity of that belt sander at the finish line was in the range of {{convert|50|–|60|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SoTex Belt Sander Racing Association|url = https://www.facebook.com/SoTexBeltSanderRacingAssociation|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundraising ==
For more than two decades, Bertie's Inn in Reading, Pennsylvania has held a fundraiser called Bertie's Inn Belt Sander Race.  Riders sit on and race hand-held belt sanders on a 40-foot-long plywood track.  All team entry fees ($50), food sales and T-shirts sales are donated to the [[National Multiple Sclerosis Society]].  Their most recent race was July 16, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bertiesinn.com/beltsanderrace.html|title=Bertie's Belt Sander Race|last=Thomas|first=William P.|website=www.bertiesinn.com|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/chapters/pae/fundraising-events/community-fundraisers/berties-belt-sander-race/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925124928/http://www.nationalmssociety.org/chapters/pae/fundraising-events/community-fundraisers/berties-belt-sander-race/index.aspx |archivedate=2013-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=395378|title=Belt-sander race to benefit Multiple Sclerosis Society|website=Reading Eagle|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=493027|title=Riding sanders a blast at charity event|website=Reading Eagle|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bulls_Ishikawa,_Okinawa_2007.jpg|thumb|''Tōgyū'', or "Okinawan bullfighting", is a traditional sport of [[Japan]].]]
'''Bull wrestling''', '''cow fighting''' or '''bull fighting''' is a non-lethal [[bloodsport]] between [[bull]]s or [[cow]]s found in some parts of the world.

==Balkans==
[[File:Sanski Most Korida 2011 006.JPG|thumb|Korida in [[Sanski Most]], Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
''Korida'', from ''corrida'', or ''borbe bikova'' ("fights of bulls") is a traditional sport in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]]. 

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
[[Grmeč]], a mountain in the extreme west of [[Bosnia]], is the best-known site of bullfights in the [[Balkans]]. They are called the ''Korida of Grmeč'' (''Grmečka korida'') and have been organised on every first Sunday in August for over 200 years, attracting thousands of visitors. These are fights between bulls themselves and there is no death of a bull. Fights happen in an empty field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlasobscura.com/place/bullfights-of-grmec |title=Bullfights of Grmec |work=Atlas Obscura |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The korida of [[Grmeč]] was depicted by the sculptor [[Slobodan Pejić]]. The sculpture of two bulls in a fight, made in bronze in 2004, has been compared to a confrontation of the oppressor and the oppressed or of the Bosnian people and the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sl icon}} Vanda Mušič (ed).

===Croatia===
In Croatia, koridas are traditionally organized in [[Dalmatian Hinterland]] region. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=(www.dw.com)|first1=Deutsche Welle|title=Nepoznata atrakcija u Hrvatskoj: Borbe bikova {{!}} Panorama {{!}} DW {{!}} 26.07.2017|url=http://www.dw.com/bs/nepoznata-atrakcija-u-hrvatskoj-borbe-bikova/a-39837182|website=DW.COM|language=bs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
Bull wrestling in Turkey is known as ''[[:tr:Boğa güreşi#T.C3.BCrkiye.27de bo.C4.9Fa g.C3.BCre.C5.9Fi|boğa güreşi]]'' (literally "bull wrestling"). Each year in the third week of June, the Kafkasör (Caucasus) festival takes place in the city of [[Artvin]]. At the beginning of the festival, certain rules are applied in order to save the bulls from injury. For example, if a bull retreats from the fight, it means defeat, etc.&lt;ref name="Darke2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diana Darke|title=Eastern Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9WwsQE6AJ4C&amp;pg=PA334|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=2011|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-339-9|pages=334–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Tōgyū]]'', or "Okinawan bullfighting", is the traditional sport of the [[Ryukyu Islands]], in which two bulls attempt, as in [[sumo wrestling]], to push one another out of a ring.&lt;ref name="University1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Sered Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology Bar-Ilan University|title=Women of the Sacred Groves : Divine Priestesses of Okinawa: Divine Priestesses of Okinawa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0wIW7d8G1sC&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=15 September 2013|date=12 February 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-535233-7|pages=119–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Sossaum'' ({{lang-ko|소싸움}}) is a traditional sport of Korea, in which two oxen are pitted against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=The National Folk Museum of Korea (South Korea)|title=Encyclopedia of Korean Seasonal Customs: Encyclopedia of Korean Folklore and Traditional Culture Vol. 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsR3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA225|date=30 October 2014|publisher=길잡이미디어|isbn=978-89-92128-92-6|pages=225–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bullfighting is also observed by the ethnic Hmong/Miao minority in China, Vietnam and Laos. Bulls are selected by age, horn length and size. They are enticed to fight usually after new year's or summer events. They are usually non-lethal events and bulls that carry the opposing bulls will get the most points if it is a draw. The loser is usually the bull that flees first even if winning.

==South Asia==
''Dhiri'' or ''Dhirio'' ([[Konkani language|Konkani]]: धिरी,धिरयो) is a popular form of traditional bull wrestling in the state of [[Goa]], [[Coastal South West India]]. It was the weekend entertainment staple for most villages. Many families lived off the earnings made on appearance money and bets alone.&lt;ref name=dhiri&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kamat Maad|first1=Govind|title=Dhirio: Bullish about a banned fight|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Dhirio-Bullish-about-a-banned-fight/articleshow/3625723.cms|accessdate=26 April 2015|agency=TNN|publisher=The times of India|date=Oct 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Panaji]] Bench of the high Court vide order dated 20.12.96 directed the State Government to take immediate steps to ban all types of animal fights including Dhiri organised in the State of Goa, which was finally banned in 1997.&lt;ref name=panaji&gt;{{cite book|last1=India.

==Criticism==
On 17 October 1987, during its 10th session, the [[Muslim World League|Islamic Council]] discussed the practices of bullfighting and animal pits (where two or more animals are agitated and forced to fight each other for the sole purpose of entertainment), and issued a [[fatwa]] that both are considered [[haraam]] (forbidden by Allah) due to their cruel nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.binbaz.org.sa/mat/134 حكم الملاكمة ومصارعة الثيران والمصارعة الحرة |&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4930">'''Circuit training''' is a form of body conditioning or [[endurance training]] or [[resistance training]] using high-intensity. It targets strength building or muscular endurance. An exercise "circuit" is one completion of all prescribed exercises in the program. When one circuit is complete, one begins the first exercise again for the next circuit. Traditionally, the time between exercises in circuit training is short, often with rapid movement to the next exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportireland.ie/Coaching-Ireland/Publications-/Circuit-Training.pdf|title=CIRCUIT TRAINING. Development of Strength &amp; Conditioning|last=Comyns|first=Tom|date=|website=Coaching Ireland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was developed by R.E. Morgan and G.T. Anderson in 1953 at the [[University of Leeds]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name="UNM"&gt;{{cite web

==Typical activities in a circuit training==
A circuit should work each section of the body individually. Typical activities include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmac.co.uk/circuit.htm|title=Circuit Training|author=Brian Mackenzie|work=brianmac.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of circuit training==
Studies at Baylor University and The Cooper Institute show that circuit training is the most time efficient way to enhance cardiovascular fitness and muscle endurance. Studies show that circuit training helps women to achieve their goals and maintain them longer than other forms of exercise or diet.&lt;ref name="Curves"&gt;Heavin, Gary and Colman, Carol, C.

Perhaps a most profound finding of this study, from a health perspective, is that this investigation clearly shows that performance of this circuit of exercises,this level of intensity elicited oxygen consumption values (39% to 51.5% of VO2max) that meet established guidelines of the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] (ACSM) for the recommended intensity (40% to 85% of [[VO2max]]R) of exercise for developing and maintaining cardio-respiratory fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klika|first=Brett|title=High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight: Maximum Results With Minimal Investment|url=http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx#P98 |publisher=ACSM's Health &amp; Fitness Journal|accessdate=20 September 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this circuit not only provides a suitable muscular fitness stimulus but also helps to meet ACSM cardiovascular guidelines and the newly published Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 for physical activity.&lt;ref name="UNM" /&gt;
}}

One advantage is that reduced station times will encourage the participants to lift heavier weights, which means they can achieve overload with smaller number of repetitions: typically in the range of 25 to 50 depending on their training goals.&lt;ref name="ACSM"&gt;http://westvalley.edu/academics/pe_department/physical_education/programs/weighttraining/acsm-resistancetraining.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coach's box''' is a term used in numerous sports.  In [[baseball]], it is the space where the [[first base coach]] and [[third base coach]] stands.  
It is also common practice for a coach who has a play at his base to leave the coach’s box to signal the player to slide, advance or return to a base. This may be allowed by the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] if the coach does not interfere with the play in any manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/start_end_4.jsp The Official Site of Major League Baseball: Official info: Official Rules&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[basketball]], it's a line that represents how far a coach may come towards centercourt.  In [[soccer]], the coach's box is simply a term for the typical area that the coach or manager is standing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18166">A number of concerns and controversies surfaced before and during the [[2018 Asian Games]] in [[Jakarta]] and [[Palembang]], [[Indonesia]].

==Prior to the Games==

Jakarta, consistently ranked as having one of the world's worst traffic congestion problems, is building a subway. However, it will not be ready until 2019, so organizers have proposed closing schools during the event to curb traffic from millions of commuting pupils. Authorities also proposed to set aside toll roads and bus lanes for special official and athlete use during the Games. Jakarta has also instated an [[Odd–even rationing|odd-even licence plate system]] to limit congestion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-games-asia-indonesia/indonesia-confident-on-asian-games-preparations-traffic-concerns-remain-idUSKCN1GK1CC|title=Indonesia confident on Asian Games preparations, traffic concerns...|last=Davies|first=Ed|work=U.S.|access-date=21 July 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.talkvietnam.org/2018/07/asian-games-2018-risks-of-traffic-jam-and-terror-attack-concern-organisers/|title=Asian Games 2018: Risks of traffic jam and terror attack concern organisers|date=18 July 2018|work=Talk Vietnam|access-date=21 July 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air pollution also becomes a concern on both cities. Jakarta has long struggled to boost air quality, regularly rated as unsafe by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as Jakarta's average score on the Air Quality Index (AQI) had exceeded 100 during early July 2018, once reaching the "unhealthy" range at 171 on 11 AM, Tuesday, 17 July 2018. Palembang also had been constantly under risk of [[haze]] caused by peatland fire during dry season which coincides with the Games. Authorities are looking into the possibility of [[cloud seeding]] to combat the fire hotspots by triggering rainfall in dry areas with flares of salt shot into suitable clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/us-games-asia-pollution/from-cloud-seeding-to-vehicle-curbs-indonesia-fights-pollution-ahead-of-asian-games-idINKBN1K713D|title=From cloud seeding to vehicle curbs, Indonesia fights pollution...|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=IN|access-date=21 July 2018|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities covered a polluted, foul-smelling river near the Asian Games athletes' village in Jakarta with black nylon mesh over fears it will be an eyesore at the showpiece event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/jakarta-covers-up--stinky--toxic--river-near-asian-games-village-10549506|title=Jakarta covers up 'stinky, toxic' river near Asian Games village|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=21 July 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security is another concern, with the Games taking place just a few months after [[Surabaya bombings|a series of terror attacks]], which killed dozens of people and provoked fear over Islamist militants. Some 100,000 security staff including bomb squad and sniper teams will be deployed in Jakarta, Palembang, and West Java, where the majority of events are hosted. Local police said they have been taking part in a pre-Asian Games crackdown on terror suspects and petty street criminals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.vietnamplus.vn/asian-games-2018-risks-of-traffic-jam-and-terror-attack-concern-organisers/134883.vnp|title=Asian Games 2018: Risks of traffic jam and terror attack concern organisers|date=18 July 2018|work=vietnamplus.vn|access-date=21 July 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) also raised concerns over [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysian men's U-16 national football team]] security issues due to the recent provocations by Indonesian fans at venues and on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nst.com.my/sports/others/2018/08/396949/ocm-look-athletes-safety-asian-games|title=OCM look into athletes' safety at Asian Games|last=Peter|first=Fabian|work=New Straits Times|access-date=5 August 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, it was initially triggered by the [[Instagram|Instagram's post]] of one Malaysian when they were competing the [[2018 AFF U-16 Youth Championship]] at [[East Java]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jateng.tribunnews.com/2018/07/27/muda-muda-provokator-pemain-timnas-u-16-malaysia-pasang-terbalik-bendera-indonesia|title=Muda-muda Provokator, Pemain Timnas U-16 Malaysia Pasang Terbalik Bendera Indonesia - Tribun Jateng|date=2018-07-27|work=Tribun Jateng|access-date=2018-08-28|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2018, less than one month from the Games, women football venue of Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium in Palembang had been partially damaged in a riot during local football league. At least 335 seats had been destroyed by the mob.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bola.kompas.com/read/2018/07/21/20005778/kecewa-dengan-manajemen-suporter-sriwijaya-fc-rusak-kursi-stadion|title=Kecewa dengan Manajemen, Suporter Sriwijaya FC Rusak Kursi Stadion - Kompas.com|last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|date=21 July 2018|work=KOMPAS.com|access-date=21 July 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials had held Asian Games' men football tournament drawing three times due to protest from UAE and Palestine which were incidentally not included in the first drawing. Later, Iraq withdrew from tournament which forced officials to rebalance the groups by determining which of Palestine or UAE would be moved to Group C to replace Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1068349/draw-for-asian-games-football-tournament-held-for-third-time|title=Draw for Asian Games football tournament held for third time|last=Mackay|first=Duncan|date=4 August 2018|work=insidethegames.biz|access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the start of the [[Golf at the 2018 Asian Games|golf tournament of the Asian Games]], several national golf associations complained to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] that Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Macau and Uzbekistan had possibly entered professional golfers, but the CAS ruled that none of the players were professional as the golf tournament was reserved only for the amateur players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/games-asia-golf/games-cas-satisfied-asian-games-golfers-arent-professional-idUKL8N1VD3CD|title=Games-CAS satisfied Asian Games golfers aren't professional |agency=Reuters|date=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Careem|first=Nazvi|date=23 August 2018|title=Asian Games: pros cut from Sri Lanka golf squad after Hong Kong and others complain about breach of amateur rules|url=https://www.scmp.com/sport/golf/article/2160924/asian-games-pros-cut-sri-lanka-golf-squad-after-hong-kong-and-others|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|location=Hong Kong, China|access-date=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Games==

===Alcohol ban===
The Indonesian Asian Games Organizing Committee ([[Indonesian Olympic Committee|INASGOC]]) banned athletes competing in the Games from consuming alcohol and outside food in their accommodation in the host cities of Jakarta and Palembang. On 28 August 2018, officials said they had confiscated many bottles and cans of beer that athletes and officials had tried to bring in from outside the athletes' villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Potkin |first1=Fanny |title=No Drowning Your Sorrows: Indonesia Bans Alcohol at Athletes' Villages |url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/no-drowning-sorrows-indonesia-bans-alcohol-athletes-villages/ |accessdate=30 August 2018 |agency=Reuters |publisher=Jakarta Globe |date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged gratification===

Since the sales of closing ceremony ticket, Indonesian anti-corruption commission, [[Corruption Eradication Commission|KPK]] has alleged to receive 14 free tickets with 13 of them had not been used. The gratification allegations started when the state enterprises of Indonesia ([[State-owned Enterprise of Indonesia|BUMN]]) bought several tickets, KPK has warned some officials in BUMN to report back of the buying. [[Jusuf Kalla]], Vice President of Indonesia, had declared that "it did not include in gratification because it is less than Rp 10 millions [threshold of official gratification in Indonesia]". Even more, KPK had not known whether it was included in gratifications or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dewi|first=Santi|title=KPK Terima 14 Laporan Dugaan Gratifikasi Tiket Asian Games 2018|url=https://www.idntimes.com/news/indonesia/santi-dewi/kpk-sudah-terima-14-laporan-penerimaan-tiket-asian-games|work=IDN TIMES|date=5 September 2018|accessdate=5 September 2018|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational issues===

During the medal ceremony of [[Swimming at the 2018 Asian Games – Men's 200 metre freestyle|men's 200 metre freestyle]] swimming on 19 August 2018, the flags of the three medalists crashed to the ground due to a technical malfunction. [[Sun Yang]], the Chinese swimmer and the gold medalist of the event, immediately got off the podium, walked to some officials and demanded the medal ceremony to be conducted once again. The flags were re-attached to the broken hoist but couldn't be raised, and the [[March of the Volunteers|Chinese anthem]] was played for a second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/sun-celebrates-asian-games-win-upset-over-flag-malfunction/2018/08/19/29fa97cc-a3bc-11e8-ad6f-080770dcddc2_story.html|title=Sun celebrates Asian Games gold medal before flags fall|last=Pye|first=John|date=19 August 2018|work=The Washington Post|access-date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletics===

On 25 August 2018, [[Hiroto Inoue]] won the Asian Games men's marathon in a controversial sprint finish, with Bahrain later lodging a complaint to race officials, accusing the Japanese runner of barging second-place finisher [[Elhassan Elabbassi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1LA04M| title = Asian Games: Bahrain complain after Inoue wins marathon for Japan | author = Amlan Chakraborty | date = August 25, 2018 | accessdate = August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, on the same day, a [[cat]] [[pitch invasion|ran into the track]] of the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium during the interval of women's 100m qualification competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-08/26/c_137419050_3.htm| title = Cat runs into track during 18th Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia | author = Xinhua | date = August 25, 2018 | accessdate = August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basketball===

Coach [[Yeng Guiao]] of the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippine men's National Basketball team]] raised doubts on why a Hong Kong referee officiated the match up between China and the Philippines. Despite having its own organized sports body, [[Hong Kong]] is special administrative region of the of China. He questioned the number of China's free throw attempts to the Philippines', 39 foul shots to 15. The Chinese team was assessed to only 16 fouls compared to the Philippines, 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.philstar.com/sports/2018/08/23/1845139/no-excuses-yeng-guiao-calls-out-hong-kong-referee#L99T6ZcO1ydb21Xv.99 | title = No excuses but Yeng Guiao calls out Hong Kong referee | author = Joaquin Henson | date = August 23, 2018 | accessdate = August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boxing===
In women's 57&amp;nbsp;kg, Filipino boxer Nesthy Petecio lost a controversial bout against Chinese rival Yin Junhua  to the surprise of most of the crowd at the Jakarta International Expo Hall C. Japanese and Turkmen judges ruled in favor of the Filipino while Bulgarian and South Korean judges ruled in favor of the Chinese. The French judge scored a 28-28, but later handed the fight to the Chinese to break the deadlock. Petecio shed tears of anger and stared at the judges. Philippine chef de mission [[Richard Gomez]] said it's a case of “bad call, bad decision and bad scoring” while [[Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines]] (ABAP) executive director Ed Picson blasted the result of the bout and appeals to officials “that the judges responsible for this travesty not be assigned to officiate in the coming Philippines fights as judges or referees.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.philstar.com/sports/2018/08/25/1845769/petecio-phl-sports-officials-cry-foul | title = Petecio, Phl sports officials cry foul  | author = Nelson Beltran | date = August 25, 2018 | accessdate = August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://manilastandard.net/sports/fightsports/273907/boxing-exec-wants-3-judges-banned-from-philippine-asiad-fights.html|title=

===Football===

[[Luis Milla]], the head coach of [[Indonesia national under-23 football team|Indonesian men's national football team]] called the referee Shaun Evans from Australia 'unfit' after he gave two controversial penalties during a game between Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. Milla was disappointed because the referee was biased during the whole game. "The referee doesn't have any competence to officiate at the Asian Games. He [Shaun Evans] is not on that level. He's the [opponent’s] 12th player and I am sad that our players' struggle had to end like this," the Spanish coach said. The Indonesian goalkeeper, [[Andritany Ardhiyasa]], added at the press conference, "Today is a sad day for us because we were robbed by [the referee]. The second penalty should not have been awarded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/24/asian-games-uae-eliminates-indonesia-in-round-of-16-soccer-match.html | title = Asian Games: UAE eliminates Indonesia in round of 16 soccer match | author = Fachrul Sidiq  | date = August 24, 2018 | accessdate = August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pencak Silat===

On 26 August 2018, in the Semifinal of [[Pencak silat at the 2018 Asian Games – Men's tanding 90 kg|Men's tanding 85 kg to 90 kg]], Muhammad Robial Sobri, a Malaysian athlete, deliberately kicked his Singaporean opponent, Sheik Alauddin Sheik Ferdous, after the Singaporean had fell to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://theindependent.sg/malaysian-silat-athlete-sparks-uproar-after-illegally-kicking-singaporean-opponent-while-hes-down/| title = Malaysian silat athlete sparks uproar after illegally kicking Singaporean opponent while he’s down | author =  Jewel Stolarchuk | date = August 28, 2018 | accessdate = August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August 2018, another Malaysian pencak silat athlete, Mohd Al-Jufferi Jamari accused the judges of bias. Even he was walked out off the [[Pencak silat at the 2018 Asian Games – Men's tanding 70 kg|final match]], the furious three-time world champion left a damage in the changing room's partition at venue after the match,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nst.com.my/sports/others/2018/08/405445/malaysia-robbed-silat-gold| title = Malaysia robbed of silat gold | work = New Straits Times | date = August 27, 2018 | accessdate = August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; something for which the Malaysian delegation had apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.cnnindonesia.com/olahraga/20180829214728-178-326029/sekjen-pencak-silat-malaysia-minta-maaf-atas-aksi-al-jufferi| title = Sekjen Pencak Silat Malaysia Minta Maaf Atas Aksi Al Jufferi | work = CNN Indonesia | date = August 29, 2018 | accessdate = September 4, 2018| language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.scmp.com/sport/other-sport/article/2161932/asian-games-indonesia-little-things-they-declare-war-malaysia| title = Asian Games: ‘Indonesia is like that, little things they declare war’ – Malaysia fuming over pencak silat ‘walk-off’ incident | work = South China Morning Post | date = August 30, 2018 | accessdate = September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indonesia had won 14 out of 16 gold medals on offer, while several countries including Singapore and Iran had complain about the judging in this event, claiming that judges are favouring local atheltes.&lt;ref name="silat"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.scmp.com/sport/other-sport/article/2162113/asian-games-indonesia-rejects-pencak-silat-cheating-claims-says#comments| title = Asian Games: Indonesia rejects pencak silat cheating claims – top official Erick Thohir ‘saddened by fellow Muslim countries’ | work =  South China Moring Post | date = August 31, 2018 | accessdate = September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the Indonesian Asian Games Organizing Committee (INASGOC) chairman [[Erick Thohir]], had rejected accusations of cheating, claiming that  the game "is open, with people can see it on television and it is clear". Erick also insisted that they have "monitor closely all judges, who are chosen by the Asian governing body".&lt;ref name="silat"/&gt; He added that, "We see the domination of certain countries in sports such as judo, karate and taekwondo. The funny thing is when Indonesia achieves such success, why do people complain?".&lt;ref name="silat" /&gt;

==Doping==

On August 24, Turkmenistani wrestler, Rustem Nazarov became the first athlete to fail a doping test. Nazarov had competed in the men's 57 kilograms freestyle event on August 19 and was beaten 12-8 in his first match by India's Sandeep Tomar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.manilastandard.net/sports/sports-plus/273855/doping-case-hits-asiad-ikee-eyes-history.html|title=

[[Concussion]]s and other types of repetitive play-related head blows in [[American football]] have been shown to be the cause of [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), which has led to player deaths and other debilitating symptoms after retirement, including memory loss, [[depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, headaches, and also sleep disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=concussions|last=Meehan III|first=William|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9781440838941|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of NFL players with chronic traumatic encephalopathy|list of ex-NFL players]] that have either been diagnosed ''post-mortem'' with [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|CTE]] or have reported symptoms of CTE continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/article58501703.html|title=The grim list of football players with CTE continues to grow|work=kansascity|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/sports/football/ken-stabler-nfl-cte-brain-disease.html?nytmobile=0|title=Ken Stabler, a Magnetic NFL Star, Was Sapped of Spirit by C.T.E.|last=Branch|first=John|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Boston University CTE Center, CTE is a brain degenerative disease found in athletes, military veterans, and others with history of repetitive brain trauma. Although CTE is highly controversial and misunderstood; it is believed that a protein called Tau forms clumps that slowly spread throughout the brain, killing brain cells.

=== History ===
A [[concussion]], from the Latin word [[wiktionary:concussio|''concussio'']], is a frequent injury among football players. Concussions occur when the head is subject to a large impact force, resulting in a minor brain injury.  There has been a growing concern about concussions since the early 1900s.  In 1906, a Harvard student athlete died from a head injury and the team doctors released a report titled "The Physical Aspect of American Football" in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal describing the type, severity, and number of injuries the team sustained in the 1905 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Emily|title=The First Concussion Crisis; Head Injury and Evidence in Early American Football|journal=Public Health Then and Now|date=May 2014|volume=104|issue=5|page=825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL first began to review the subject formally in 1994, then [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Paul Tagliabue]] approved the creation of the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee with the stated goal of studying the effects of concussions and sub-concussive injury in NFL players. Tagliabue appointed [[rheumatologist]] Elliot Pellman to chair the committee.&lt;ref name="Peter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peter|first=Peter|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3644940|title=Elliot Pellman, the NFL's top medical adviser, claims it's okay for players with concussions to get back in the game. Time for a second choice|publisher=ESPN Sports|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pellman's appointment was met with harsh criticism, because he is not a neurologist or [[neuropsychologist]] and often admitted ignorance about head injuries.&lt;ref name="Peter"/&gt; The concussion data collected by the league from 1996 to 2001 has been shown to understate the actual number of diagnosed concussions by ten percent. The league legal representation has been shown to have had ties to the tobacco industry legal defense.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Schwarz, Walt Bogdanich and Jacqueline Williams. (24 March 2016).

The same year, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) reported a statistically significant increase in the risk of [[neurological]] disorders such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) in retired football players, which furthered public knowledge about the risk of long-term neurocognitive disease related to repeated head impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/reports/pdfs/1988-0085-letter.pdf|title=Concussion in professional football: helmet testing to assess impact performance – part 11|publisher=[[United States Public Health Service]] [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|date=2004-01-10|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the NIOSH study, Pellman and the MTBI Committee drew their own conclusions that continued to contradict these findings and those of other organizations. Biomechanical engineers and neurosurgeons informed the Committee that the helmet safety standard at that time was insufficient to minimize the risk of concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Concussion in professional football: helmet testing to assess impact performance – part 11|date=January 2006|pmid=16385332|volume=58|vauthors=Pellman EJ, Viano DC, Withnall C, Shewchenko N, Bir CA, Halstead PD |pages=78–96; discussion 78–96|journal=Neurosurgery|doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000196265.35238.7c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MTBI Committee began studying the nature of [[Tackle (American football)|tackle]] plays resulting in concussive impacts and developing its own biomechanical analysis of the effect of these forces on the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Practice parameter: the management of concussion in sports (summary statement).

A six-year study by the Committee concluded that, "Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Concussion in professional football: players returning to the same game – part 7 |pmid=15617589 | volume=56|vauthors=Pellman EJ, Viano DC, Casson IR, Arfken C, Feuer H |pages=79–90; discussion 90–92|journal=Neurosurgery|doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000150180.16552.8d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
Other organizations continued to publish study results that linked repeated concussions and long-term health problems contrary to reports by the MTBI Committee. A 2003 report by the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the [[University of North Carolina]], for example, found a connection between numerous concussions and depression among former professional football players. Further, the Center's follow-up study in 2005 associated both brain impairment and Alzheimer's disease with retired NFL players who had histories of concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Association between recurrent concussion and late-life cognitive impairment in retired professional football players. |pmid=16239884 | volume=57|date=Oct 2005|pages=719–26|journal=Neurosurgery|doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000175725.75780.DD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 doctoral dissertation by Don Brady examined NFL Players' knowledge of concussions, studying both active and retired National Football League Players' knowledge of concussions. Brady's findings concluded: that many NFL players lacked accurate and essential knowledge pertaining to various aspects of a concussion; that the preponderance of credible experimental and clinical evidence pertaining to the adverse effects of concussion indicates that the brain is injured as a result of a concussion; that the altered cell functioning and cell death along with subtle to more visible neurological, neurocognitive, psychological, and other medical problems reflect a diverse range of lifelong negative consequences of a concussion / brain injury; and that sports team health-care personnel need to focus primarily on the athletes' health and well-being, and not minimize an injury or primarily concentrate on the players' capacity to perform on the field. This expanded focus of health care is necessary in order to avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest emerging in the concussion research, concussion management and related return to play decision-making process.&lt;ref name=Brady04&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Don |last=Brady |title=A Preliminary Investigation of Active and Retired NFL Players' Knowledge of Concussions |publisher=The Union Institute and University |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During November 2014, Brady filed objections to the proposed NFL concussion settlement offer. Brady sent a cover letter and detailed objections on behalf of NFL retired players to the presiding US district court judge, Anita Brody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballvets.org/blog/2014/11/dr-don-brady-files-objection/|title= Dr. Don Brady Files Objection to NFL Concussion Settlement Offer|work=Footballvets.org|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the studies that continued to contradict the work of the MTBI Committee, renowned experts and sports journalists wrote critical reviews of the Committee's studies. Robert Cantu of the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] noted bias in the committee's extremely small sample size and held that no conclusions should be drawn from the NFL's studies. In an ESPN Magazine article titled "Doctor Yes," Peter Keating criticized Pellman and the MTBI Committee's work and argued that the "... Committee has drawn a number of important conclusions about head trauma and how to treat it that contradict the research and experiences of many other doctors who treat sports concussions, not to mention the players who have suffered them."&lt;ref name="Peter"/&gt;

More studies continued to associate repetitive head injuries with neurological problems later in life. [[Kevin Guskiewicz]], Director of the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes in the Department of Exercise and Sport Science at the University of North Carolina, analyzed data from a 2007 study of nearly 2,500 former NFL players. He found about 11 percent of the study participants suffered from [[clinical depression]], with a threefold increased risk in former players who had a history of three or four concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Associated Press|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/sports/football/31concussions.html?pagewanted=all|title = NFL Study Links Concussions, Depression|publisher = New York Times|date = 2007-05-31|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the NFL commissioned the [[University of Michigan Institute for Social Research]] to conduct a study involving more than 1,000 former NFL players. The results reported that Alzheimer's disease or similar diseases appear to have been diagnosed in former NFL players vastly more often than in the general population at a rate of 19 times the normal rate for men ages 30 through 49. The NFL responded to these results by claiming the study was incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Ken Belson|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/sports/football/actuarial-reports-in-nfl-concussion-deal-are-released.html|title = Dementia Risk Seen in Players in NFL Study|work = New York Times|date = 2014-09-12|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2014, researchers with [[Boston University]] announced that in autopsies of 79 brains of former NFL players, 76 had tested positive for CTE.&lt;ref name="Breslow"&gt;{{cite web|last=Breslow|first=Jason|date=30 September 2014|title=76 of 79 Deceased NFL Players Found to Have Brain Disease|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sports/concussion-watch/76-of-79-deceased-nfl-players-found-to-have-brain-disease/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2017, that number had grown to 90 out of 94.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/cte/our-research/case-studies/|title=Case Studies »  CTE Center  {{!}} Boston University|website=www.bu.edu|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in July 2017 showed that 110 of 111 former NFL players whose brains were examined were found to have suffered from CTE.&lt;ref name="110of111"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Joe|last2=Williams|first2=Josh|last3=Manchester|first3=Sam|title=111 NFL Brains.

=== Prevention ===
In October 2009, NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] and the NFL Concussion Committee were called before Congress to defend their policies against allegations of neglect.&lt;ref name=ESPN09&gt;{{cite news|title=Conyers wants review of all data|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4601966|newspaper=[[ESPN]]|date=28 October 2009|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwarz09&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwarz|first=Alan|date=28 October 2009|title=NFL Scolded Over Injuries to Its Players|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/29/sports/football/29hearing.html?_r=1&amp;|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodell provided testimony, but was unable to answer many questions, as none of the primary authors of the league's research, [[Ira Casson]], David Viano, or Elliot Pellman were present.&lt;ref name=ESPN09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwarz09/&gt; As a result of this incident and pressure from the NFL Players Association, the NFL released a comprehensive overhaul of the league concussion policy in November and December 2009.&lt;ref name=Neale09&gt;{{cite news|last=Neale|first=Todd|date=5 December 2009|title=NFL Institutes New Concussion Policy|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodNews/nfl-institutes-concussion-policy/story?id=9251126|newspaper=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy expanded the list of symptoms that would prevent a player from returning to a game or practice on the same day their injury occurred.&lt;ref name=Neale09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Storrs09&gt;{{cite news|last=Storrs|first=Carina|date=27 November 2009|title=NFL gains yards in its treatment of players' head injuries|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2009/11/27/nfl-gains-yards-in-its-treatment-of-players-head-injuries/|newspaper=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Farmer&gt;{{cite news|last=Farmer|first=Sam|date=11 September 2010|title=NFL is taking the long-term impact of concussions seriously|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/11/sports/la-sp-nfl-concussions-20100912|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With continued pressure to protect players, the NFL began preventing players knocked unconscious by a concussion from returning to a game or practice, a policy that applied to [[Detroit Lions]] running back [[Jahvid Best]] in {{NFL Year|2009}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=Associated Press|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2011-08-22/lions-rb-jahvid-best-misses-second-practice-with-concussion|title=Lions RB Jahvid Best misses second practice with concussion|work=The Sporting News|date=2011-08-22|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various players have filed lawsuits against the league for the concussions, accusing the league of hiding information that linked head trauma to permanent brain damage, [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[dementia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/nfl-concussion-brain-trauma-lawsuit-players_n_1577497.html|title=NFL Concussions Mega-Lawsuit Claims League Hid Brain Injury Links From Players|publisher=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=2012-06-27|date=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Mike|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/19085374/concussion-lawsuit-plaintiffs-an-eye-opening-cross-section-of-nfl-past|title=Concussion lawsuit plaintiffs an eye- opening cross section of NFL past|publisher=Cbssports.com|date=2012-05-18|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some teams chose not to draft certain players in the [[NFL Draft]] due to their past concussion history. According to an Outside the Lines report, the head impact telemetry system (HITS) was in question by the League, although Kevin Guskiewicz, a professor at the University of North Carolina, said the system is functional.&lt;ref name=HITS /&gt; The technology could detect and measure the impact of blows to the head in real time during a game, but no such measurement exists in the league at this time.&lt;ref name=ESPN12&gt;{{cite news|title=OTL: Football At A Crossroads: The Hit System|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=8085758|newspaper=[[ESPN]]|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Pittsburgh Steelers receiver and current NBC Sports analyst [[Hines Ward]] stated the use of the system would be "opening a Pandora's Box," and that the data recorded by the system could be used by team owners to give players lower salaries.&lt;ref name=HITS /&gt;

In November 2011, the Cleveland Clinic Center for Spine Health created an online study released by the ''[[Journal of Neurosurgery]]'' in which various [[football helmet]]s were compared with each other via [[crash test dummy|crash test dummies]]. It was also found that leather helmets provided similar results to modern helmets, and in some cases, the leather helmets proved to have superior protection against concussive blows. However, the leather helmets did not provide as much protection against skull fractures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/story/2011-11-03/leather-helmets-concussion-prevention/51070952/1 Study reveals leather helmets may help reduce concussions], ''USA Today'', Erik Brady, 11/4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthland.time.com/2011/11/07/in-football-leather-helmets-could-provide-a-better-defense-against-concussion/#ixzz1u20uvfQf Why Leather Football Helmets Could Provide a Better Defense Against Concussion], ''Time'' magazine, Sean Gregory, November 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2011.9.JNS111059?prevSearch=helmets&amp;searchHistoryKey= Impact test comparisons of 20th and 21st century American football helmets], Abstract, ''Journal of Neurosurgery'', Adam Bartsch, Ph.D., Edward Benzel, M.D., Vincent Miele, M.D., and Vikas Prakash, Ph.D., Jan. 2012 (published online November 4, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concussion protocol process ===
When a [[American football|football]] player sustains a [[concussion]] in the NFL, he is required to go through the concussion protocol the league has in place by the NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2013/10/01/0ap2000000254002.pdf|title=NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee's Protocols Regarding Diagnosis and Management of Concussion|last=|first=|date=|website=NFL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Preseason evaluation ====
Before the NFL season starts, all players and coaching staff of an organization are required to be educated on concussions and the importance of promptly reporting any concussion symptoms. All players in the league are also mandated to take a baseline [[neurological]] and [[Physical examination|physical exam]]. The baseline neurological exam is either a computerized or paper and pencil exam that will test different brain functions. The exam tests attention span, memory, language, speech skills, reasoning, planning, and organizational skills. The results of this test are used as a baseline if a player suffers a head injury at any point throughout the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/neuropsychological-tests#1|title=Neuropsychological Tests|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preseason physical examination allows the team physician and athletic trainer the opportunity to review and answer any questions the player might have. This also gives the physician and athletic trainer the time to go over any previous concussions, discuss the importance of reporting any symptoms of a concussion, and explain the concussion protocol that is in place for the current season.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/nfl-concussion-protocol-policy-history|title=What is the NFL's concussion protocol?|last=Flynn|first=Erin|work=SI.com|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In-game identification ====
Current NFL concussion protocol creates positions in each organization's medical staff who are specifically charged with identifying and diagnosing concussions. One of these roles involves an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant who work with other team physicians and [[athletic trainer]]s to conduct evaluations. Another position involves athletic trainers who are positioned in the booth at every game to spot potential concussions in players from both teams. These spotters review film throughout the game that could possibly result in concussions and are capable to call "medical timeouts" to relay that information to the medical personnel on the sidelines so that further evaluation can be conducted. These spotters have been in use since the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== In-game evaluation ====
If a player shows to have a concussion or concussion symptoms, it is mandatory that the individual be removed from the game. If the player is diagnosed with a concussion, they are prohibited from re-entering the game or practice that day. According to the league's protocol, signs of a concussion include: loss of consciousness, lack of balance, holding head after contact, absentmindedness, lethargy, confusion or a visible facial injury in combination with any of the other factors. If the medical staff rule the player clear from a concussion, then the video of that hit must be reviewed before the player can re-enter the game or practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Post-game ====
After a concussion has occurred, the player must be monitored and examined on a daily basis in a training room by the team medial staff until fully cleared from concussion. Along with the continuous examination prior to a concussion, the player must meet standards that are in place by the league in order to return a game or contact practice. The player may not return to football activities until he has returned to his baseline [[cognitive function]]. Next, the player must go through a graduated exercise challenge, followed by a gradual return to practice and play. If player is feeling any setback or post- concussion symptoms, evaluation then starts from the beginning. Finally, the team doctor and an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant must both clear him for return to play.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== NFL litigation ==

===A league of denial===
The NFL spent years trying to deny and cover up any link that emerged connecting head injuries sustained while playing football with long-term brain disorders. The NFL Mild Traumatic Brain Committee, first formed in 1994, reported in December 1999 that the number of head injuries had remained "remarkably the same over the course of four years."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ezell, Lauren. "Timeline: The NFL's Concussion Crisis." PBS.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee went a step further in 2004 when it suggested in an article published in ''Neurosurgery'' that "NFL players have evolved to a state where their brains are less susceptible to injury." Two months after that, MTBI publishes another article that concludes "Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, when Dr. [[Bennet Omalu]] examined the brain of former Pittsburgh Steeler [[Mike Webster]], he discovered a new brain disease, which he called [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], or CTE. He outlined his findings in a scientific paper published in ''Neurosurgery'' in July 2005.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The NFL's MTBI committee wrote in May 2006 that the article be retracted. Dr. Omalu instead wrote a second paper in the same magazine, this time about former Pittsburgh Steeler [[Terry Long (American football)|Terry Long]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Dr. Ira Casson, who was then co-chair of MTBI, denied in a televised interview that there was any link between head injuries sustained playing in the NFL and long-term brain damage. His repeated denials won him the nickname "Dr. No."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In September 2009, ''The New York Times'' published an article of an NFL-funded study stating that former players are 19 times more likely than the general population to have dementia, Alzheimer's or other memory-related diseases. The NFL's spokesperson, Greg Aiello, publicly said, "the study did not formally diagnose dementia, that it was subject to shortcomings of telephone surveys."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Two months later, Aiello told ''New York Times'' reporter [[Alan Schwarz]] that "it's quite obvious from the medical research that's been done that concussions can lead to long-term problems."&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Alan. "N.F.L Acknowledges Long-Term Concussion Effects." The New York Times, December 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time any League official had acknowledged a link between the two.

Things got worse for the NFL when investigative reporters [[Steve Fainaru]] and his brother [[Mike Fainaru-Wada]] learned from an anonymous source that the NFL Retirement Board had awarded "disability payments to at least three former players after concluding that football caused their crippling brain injuries - even as the league's top medical experts for years consistently denied any link between the sport and long-term brain damage."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Fainaru, Steve, and Mark Fainaru-Wada. "NFL Board Paid $2M to Players While League Denied Football-Concussion Link." PBS.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the cases was that of Mike Webster, who filed a claim in 1999. In 2005,  three years after his death, his family received $1.8 million from the Retirement Board. "That same year," write the Fainuru brothers, "the NFL published the 10th installment in its series on concussions research in the medical journal ''Neurosurgery.'' The paper, whose authors included three members of the League's [MTBI], asserted that chronic brain injury 'has never been reported in American football players.'"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Since Aiello's admittance, the link between head injuries in football and long-term brain damage have become more accepted in the NFL In a roundtable discussion with the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] Committee on Energy and Commerce, Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice-president for health and safety, admitted that "there is a link between football-related head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy."&lt;ref&gt;Fainuru, Steve. "NFL acknowledges, for first time, link between football, brain disease." ESPN.&lt;/ref&gt; However, public relations issues continue to plague the League. A report from the Democratic members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce said that "the NFL rescinded a gift to the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) for concussion research when it learned the study's findings would be detrimental to the league's image."&lt;ref&gt;Vasilogambros, Matt. "The NFL's Concussion Cover-Up." The Atlantic, May 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The N.F.L had tried to funnel the funds it gave to the NIH towards its own studies. The League rejected the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;Fainaru, Steve, and Mark Fainaru-Wada. "Congressional report says NFL waged improper campaign to influence government study." ESPN.&lt;/ref&gt;

To mitigate the public relations (PR) nightmare, the NFL has taken several steps to better assure player safety and bring awareness to head injuries in football players of all ages. Several rule changes took place between 2007 and 2014. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell issued a memo in December 2009 to all 32 teams stating that a player who sustains a concussion cannot return to play if he shows signs or symptoms, such as inability to remember assignments or plays, a gap in memory and persistent dizziness. This move changed the 2007 rule saying a player cannot return only if he has lost consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;NFL "Goodell issues memo changing return-to-play rules for concussions."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, new rules regarding "crown of the helmet" tackles have been installed where a runner or a tackler cannot initiate forcible contact with the crown of the helmet outside the tackle box so as to protect players' heads.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael David. "NFL officiating video stresses new "crown of the helmet" rule." NBC Sports.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the NFL and [[USA Football]] launched the [https://usafootball.com/programs/heads-up-football/ Heads Up Football] initiative, which "emphasizes a smarter and safer way to play and teach youth football, including proper tackling and taking the head out of the game."&lt;ref&gt;NFL "NFL celebrates USA Football Month with launch of USA Football's Heads Up Football initiative."&lt;/ref&gt; A mobile application was also launched with help from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] where information about concussion protocols and player health and safety can be easily reached by parents and coaches.

The PR issues surrounding the NFL's cover-up of concussions are far from over, and it is too early to tell how and to what extent these events will impact the NFL or football playing. Robert Boland, professor of sports management at [[New York University]] and former college football player says, "In the short-run, [the NFL] is still thriving," but downward trends in youth football players shows that future generations "might have less of an intimate attachment to the sport."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Drummond, Katie. "Can the NFL survive its concussion crisis?." The Verge.&lt;/ref&gt; Boland says this in light of [[Pop Warner]] football enrollment dropping by 9.5 percent between 2010 and 2012, likely linked to the high-profile concussion problem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Federal NFL concussion litigation===
In April 2011, attorneys [[Sol H. Weiss]] and [[Larry E. Coben]] from the Philadelphia law firm of Anapol Weiss filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of [[Ray Easterling]], [[Jim McMahon]] and five other players. Thousands of former NFL players have since filed lawsuits against the League after suffering repeated concussions throughout their careers.

The multidistrict litigation (MDL) titled In re: National Football League Players' Concussion Injury Litigation (MDL 2323) was filed on January 31, 2012 in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]]. Judge [[Anita B. Brody]] presides over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2012md02323/457890/|title=MDL-2323 IN RE: NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE PLAYERS' CONCUSSION INJURY LITIGATION|date=2012-01-31|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The master administrative long-form [[complaint]], filed by Plaintiff's Co-Lead Counsel Sol Weiss and [[Christopher A. Seeger|Christopher Seeger]] on June 7, 2012, alleges the League "... was aware of the evidence and the risks associated with repetitive traumatic brain injuries virtually at the inception, but deliberately ignored and actively concealed the information from the Plaintiffs and all others who participated in organized football at all levels." The master complaint argues the NFL knew or should have known players who sustain repetitive head injuries are at risk of suffering "... early-onset of Alzheimer's Disease, [[dementia]], depression, deficits in [[cognitive function]]ing, reduced processing speed, attention, and reasoning, loss of memory, sleeplessness, moods swings, personality changes, and the debilitating and latent disease known as [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] ('CTE')."

In April 2012, Easterling was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/five-nfl-players-whove-died-self-inflicted-gunshot-002000760--nfl.html|title=Five NFL Players Who've Died from a Self-Inflicted Gunshot Wound|publisher=Yahoo Sports|date=2012-07-30|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy report concluded Easterling's brain had evidence of CTE, a degenerative brain disease associated with frequent blows to the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/sports/football/ray-easterling-autopsy-found-signs-of-brain-disease-cte.html|title=Football Player Who Killed Himself Had Brain Disease|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-07-26|accessdate=2013-09-03|first=Mike|last=Tierney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One month later, former [[San Diego Chargers]] player [[Junior Seau]] also died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and a brain autopsy showed he suffered from CTE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/8830344/study-junior-seau-brain-shows-chronic-brain-damage-found-other-nfl-football-players|title=Doctors: Junior Seau's brain had CTE|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2013-01-13|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Easterling and Seau, an autopsy of Bears safety [[Dave Duerson]]'s brain after he committed [[suicide]] earlier that year revealed he also suffered from the same degenerative brain disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/sports/football/03duerson.html?_r=0|title=Duerson's Brain Trauma Diagnosed|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2011-05-13|accessdate=2013-09-03|first=Alan|last=Schwarz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autopsy results following these players' suicides heightened existing concerns regarding the connection between player deaths and concussions. Neuropathologist [[Bennet Omalu]] has identified CTE in the autopsies of former players [[Mike Webster]], [[Terry Long (American football)|Terry Long]], [[Justin Strzelczyk]], [[Andre Waters]], and [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2012/05/neurosurgeon-junior-seaus-death-fuels-concussion-concerns/1#.T7RHJ1LjwnI|work=USA Today|title=Neurosurgeon: Junior Seau's death fuels concussion concerns|date=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Habib|first=Hal|url=http://www.canada.com/sports/football/nfl/Seau+death+heightens+concerns+over+concussions/6584370/story.html|title=Seau's death heightens concerns over concussions|publisher=Canada.com|date=2012-05-08|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the difficult issues facing doctors is attempting to identify mental health effects from concussions during the lives of former players rather than after their deaths.&lt;ref name=ESPNMay12&gt;{{cite news |title=Junior Seau dies at 43 |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7882750/junior-seau-former-san-diego-charger-found-dead- |work=[[ESPN]] |date=May 2, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, a group of former [[Dallas Cowboys]]—including [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] inductees [[Randy White (American football)|Randy White]], [[Bob Lilly]], and [[Rayfield Wright]] (among other retired players from around the league)—filed a lawsuit against the NFL, again accusing it of ignoring a link between concussions and brain injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/7851511/dallas-cowboy-greats-file-concussion-suit-nfl Ex-Cowboys sue over concussions], ESPN, Associated Press, April 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the number of players involved in suits against the NFL increased to 3,402, and the League sued three dozen insurance companies in an attempt to force them to cover the costs of defending claims of not protecting players. However, [[The Travelers Companies|Travelers]] ultimately sued the League on August 21 in a lawsuit called Discover Property &amp; Casualty Co. et al. vs. National Football League et al., [[New York State Supreme Court]], New York County, No. 652933/2012. The company provided liability coverage for the League's merchandising arm (NFL Properties), and the insurer also pointed out that the above-mentioned lawsuit has allegedly 14 counts against the League, while only two against NFL Properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ax|first=Joseph|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/travelers-sues-nfl-over-ex-players-brain-injury-184938731--nfl.html|title=Travelers sues NFL over brain injury lawsuits|publisher=Yahoo!

However, the proposal was met with criticism from players like running backs [[Matt Forte]], [[Emmitt Smith]] and [[Marshall Faulk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/Matt-Forte-calls-proposed-new-rule-absurd/c120925a-70ee-44b5-8adb-e974e44af1b1|title=Matt Forte calls proposed new rule absurd|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=2013-03-18|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A federal hearing was held on April 9, 2013 in Philadelphia to discuss the League's motion to dismiss the lawsuits brought on behalf of more than 4,500 former players On July 8, 2013, Judge Brody ordered representatives of both sides of the litigation to explore a possible settlement in the litigation. Judge Brody ordered a report on or before September 3, 2013 regarding the results of the mediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflconcussionmdl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Order-on-mediation-7-8-13.pdf|title=Mediation Order|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposed settlement was reached in the litigation on August 29, 2013. Under the agreement, the NFL will contribute $765 million to provide medical help to more than 18,000 former players. Retired players who suffer severe neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diseases in the future will also be eligible to apply for medical help. In addition, $10 million will fund brain injury research as well as safety and education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=John|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-08-31/news/41622052_1_retired-players-former-players-ray-easterling|title=NFL ex-players reach $765 million deal in concussion case|publisher=[[Philly.com]]|date=2013-08-29|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement says it should not be interpreted as a statement of legal liability on the part of the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=NFL, Retired Players Resolve Concussion Litigation; Court-Appointed Mediator Hails Historic Agreement|publisher=Alternative Dispute Resolution Center|date=August 29, 2013|url=http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/press-release-2.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement, which is projected to protect retired players for nearly 65 years, will compensate injured former players who need immediate help and will provide baseline assessments and medical benefits to those who are symptom-free or beginning to show signs of neurological problems.

"I think it's more important that the players have finality, that they're vindicated, and that as soon as the court approves the settlement they can begin to get screening, and those that are injured can get their compensation. I think that's more important than looking at some documents," attorney Weiss said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2013/08/29/nfl-players-reach-proposed-765m-settlement-concussion-related-lawsuits/|title=NFL players reach proposed $765M settlement of concussion-related lawsuits|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=2013-08-29|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement also allows a player diagnosed with CTE the eligibility to up to 4 million dollars in compensation. This has been met with criticism of the settlement's structure as it only applies to players diagnosed before the settlements preliminary agreement and disallows those diagnosed after the approval of the deal in July.&lt;ref name="Breslow"/&gt;

The NFL has paid nearly $1 billion in settlements from claims alleging long-term injuries from repeated blows to the head. Courts have examined these claims using a "Trigger" process. This trigger process includes 4 triggers: The "exposure" trigger, the "manifestation" trigger, the "injury-in-fact" trigger, and the "continuous" trigger. Reiter, Thomas M., and Lucas J. Tanglen.

===Kansas City Chiefs concussion lawsuit===
On December 3, 2013, five former NFL players filed a lawsuit against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] organization: former Chiefs players [[Alexander Cooper (American football)|Alexander Cooper]], [[Leonard Griffin (American football)|Leonard Griffin]], [[Christopher Martin (American football)|Christopher Martin]], [[Joe Phillips (American football)|Joe Phillips]], and [[Kevin Porter (American football)|Kevin Porter]]. They wish to know what the Chiefs knew about concussions and when they knew it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paylor|first=Terez|title=Five Former Players Sue Chiefs over Consusisons|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/12/03/4666316/five-former-players-suing-chiefs.html#storylink=cpy|publisher=The Kansas City Star|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This lawsuit is unique and different from the thousands of lawsuits previously filed against the NFL. These players are not suing the NFL, and are instead suing the Chiefs.

From 1987 to 1993 there was no [[Collective Bargaining Agreement]] established in the NFL. With no existence of a CBA in these years, players who played during this time for the Chiefs can sue the team for many of the same reasons the NFL has been sued. The $765 million settlement in August 2013 between the NFL and former players only protected the NFL. "I think all of our clients were disappointed," McClain said of his clients reaction to the settlement with the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paylor|first=Terez|title=Five Former Players Suing Chiefs over Concussions|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/12/03/4666316/five-former-players-suing-chiefs.html|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players currently suing the Chiefs have all opted-out of the settlement from the previous mediation with the NFL.

A law unique to Missouri allows certain former NFL players to sue the individual team. The current Missouri law states that employees can sue employers in civil court if the employees declined worker's compensation. The Independence attorney for the five ex-Chiefs, Ken McClain said, "The lawsuit is allowed in Missouri after a state workers' compensation statute was amended in 2005 to exclude cases of occupational injury that occur over an extended time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drapper|first=Bill|title=Five ex-Chiefs sue Kansas City over concussions|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/sports/20131203/five-ex-chiefs-sue-kansas-city-over-concussions|publisher=Daily Times|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment of the 2005 law is set to be changed at the end of December 2013. Martin and McClain have both encouraged former players who are eligible to join the lawsuit before their window of opportunity expires.

On December 1, 2012, [[Jovan Belcher]], current member of the Kansas City Chiefs, shot and killed his fiancée, Kassandra Perkins, before committing suicide in the Arrowhead practice facility parking lot. On behalf of Belcher's and Perkin's daughter, lawyers have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Chiefs. Belcher's mother has filed a similar suit accusing the Chiefs of ignoring Belcher's cries for help as he complained of concussion like symptoms. The first occurrence came against Jacksonville in 2009 where Belcher was knocked unconscious and failed to receive adequate treatment. The second occurrence was against the Bengals in November 2012. The lawsuits allege, Belcher "suffered what should have been recognized as an acute concussion." However, one lawsuit continues, "despite exhibiting obvious symptoms, Decedent was never removed from play for evaluation and recovery." The lawsuits also claims Belcher exhibited signs of CTE, including changes in his mood and behavior.&lt;ref name="Delsohn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Delsohn|first=Steve|title=OTL:Belcher's Brain Had CTE Signs|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11612386/jovan-belcher-brain-showed-signs-cte-doctor-says-report|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2014, it was announced that the brain of former Kansas City Chiefs player, Jovan Belcher, contained neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein; which is associated with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. The tangles were distributed throughout Belcher's hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with memory, learning and emotion. If the findings of CTE come to be true, Belcher's daughter and mother are eligible for up to $4 million under the National Football League's current Collective Bargaining Agreement.&lt;ref name="Delsohn"/&gt;

===Cook County, Illinois Riddell concussion litigation===
On March 11, 2016, the family of deceased San Diego Charger defensive back [[Paul Oliver (American football)|Paul Oliver]] sued helmet-maker [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] along with its related corporate entities, in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois.  Shortly thereafter, NFL hall of fame running back and Super Bowl champion [[Paul Hornung]], represented by [[The Brad Sohn Law Firm]] and [[Corboy &amp; Demetrio]], filed a related case against these defendants.  Now, some 100 former professional players have sued Riddell in the consolidated litigation in Cook County, which alleges Riddell to have conspired with the NFL in creating false science.  Riddell's attempt at the same federal labor preemption defense attempted by the NFL failed.  The NFL remains subject to discovery in this case, even though it is a non-party.

The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], like the NFL, has been criticized for its handling of concussions, with numerous players having retired from football due to concussions, or have filed lawsuits against the association for failing to protect student-athletes from concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Post Comment|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/09/04/former-football-players-sue-ncaa-over-concussions/2762575/|title = Former college football player sues NCAA in federal court over concussions|publisher = USA Today|date = 2013-09-04|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, former players Derek Owens and Alex Rucks filed lawsuits against the association for failing to cover the players' safety.

In addition, all athletes must have baseline cognitive testing while the post-injury cognitive testing is strongly recommended.  The athletes diagnosed with concussions must be removed from sports for a minimum of one day and can only return when decided by a team physician.

===Canadian Football League===
In the [[2010 CFL season|2010 season]] for the [[Canadian Football League]], there have been 50 reported concussions; 44.8 percent of players reported having a concussion or concussion-like symptoms, 16.9 percent had confirmed that they had a concussion, and 69.6 percent of all players who suffered from concussions that year suffered from more than one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reactcanada.org/EN/resources/articles/sport_specific/CFL_DELANEY.pdf|title=Concussions During the 1997 Canadian Football League Season|work=[[Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine]]|format=PDF|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the average of 0.59 concussions per game is lower than the 0.67 recorded by the NFL in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/cfl/argos/article/971336--cfl-concussions-not-always-revealed-to-fans|title=CFL concussions not always revealed to fans|work=The Star|date=2011-04-07|accessdate=2012-06-27|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league eventually started a concussion-awareness program with the help of [[Football Canada]], [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] (CIS), the [[Canadian School Sport Federation]], the [[Canadian Football League Players Association]] (CFLPA), the [[Canadian Football League Alumni Association]] (CFLAA), and the [[ThinkFirst]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/article/985088--canadian-football-tackles-concussions-head-on|title=Canadian football tackles concussions head-on|work=The Star|date=2011-05-03|accessdate=2012-06-27|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league eventually pointed out eight protocols:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/article/working-to-promote-concussion-awareness|title=Official Site of the Canadian Football League|publisher=CFL.ca|date=2011-05-03|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Team physicians and therapists are to use a SCAT2 (a medical protocol), to diagnose concussions and preventing athletes from playing until they have been cleared to play.
* All players are to be submitted to IMPACT, which is a form of cognitive testing, during training camp.
* All player concussion assessments in the CFL are to only be used by team physicians and therapists.
* All coaches and players will receive educational items to aid in recognizing signs of a concussion.
* Administrators are to report a change from the expectation that a player returns to the game to one that encourages players to be honest about symptoms.
* The formation of certification programs that teach coaches how to recognize the symptoms of concussions.
* The formation of training programs for coaches that emphasize that players should never use their helmets to tackle.
* A new rule in the amateur football rulebook was implemented that requires officials to report suspected concussed players to the coaching or medical staff during games.

In 2012, ThinkFirst founder and [[Toronto Western Hospital]] neurosurgeon Charles Tator led a study that was conducted by the [[University of Toronto]], which examined the brains of 20 former players with a history of concussions, and compared them to 20 other players without a history of head injury. A separate group of 20 without football experience served as a control group. Also in 2012, the league and Tator announced a partnership to work in a study that would perform postmortem tests on former CFL players to look for signs of CTE.&lt;ref name="Study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cflaa.ca/2012/may-5-2012-former-cfl-players-to-be-studied-for-long-term-concussion-effects/|title=Former CFL players to be studied for long term concussion effects|publisher=Canadian Football League Alumni Association|date=May 5, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arena Football League===
In the [[Arena Football League]], despite the league's intense play, very few lawsuits have been filed for concussions. The most notable lawsuit against the league was a lawsuit filed by former [[Colorado Crush]] kicker [[Clay Rush]] in 2010, who claimed that he suffered from permanent brain damage due to repeated blows to the head during games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/sports/football/19concussions.html|title=Lawsuit Cites Mishandling of Football Concussions|author=Alan Schwarz|date=18 March 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the NFL, the AFL prohibits players who suffered from concussions from practicing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/more-sports/arena-football-league-adopts-strict-guidelines-on-concussions-296455/?p=0|title=Arena Football League adopts strict guidelines on concussions|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2012-03-29|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, during the original league's [[2008 Arena Football League season|final season]], the "Shockometer" made its debut at two season-opening games ([[Dallas Desperados]] vs. [[Georgia Force]]/[[San Jose SaberCats]] vs. [[Chicago Rush]]) on 40 player helmets.

===Youth football===
Youth athletes make up 70% of football players in the United States. Every year there are 23,000 nonfatal traumatic brain injuries stemming from playing football that required an emergency visit to the hospital.  Of those visits, 90% of them are children between the ages of 5–18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=L. Syd|title=Return to Play Guidelines Cannot Solve the Football-Related Concussion Problem|journal=Journal of School Health|volume=82|pages=180–185|doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2011.00684.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted from 2010-2104 showed that of the 529 million emergency room visits; 819,000 were contact sport related. This accounted for 0.15% of all emergency visits. This number although small, may effect and cause ramifications in the American healthcare system. Theses figures are represented with nearly 80-90% of that of the youth population {ages 7-18).  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGinity|first=Michael|date=2018|title=The impact of tackle football injuries of the American healthcare system|url=http://link.galegroup.com.exproxy.jccc.edu/apps/doc/A5376681/AONE?u=jcl_jccc&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=5a1116f7|journal=Academic OneFile|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first studies of its kind was performed during the Fall 2011 football season when researchers from [[Virginia Tech]], receiving permission from parents, placed [[accelerometer]]s (which measure [[g force]]s) inside the helmets of seven youth players. These seven players were 7- and 8-year-old boys participating in a community youth league who were chosen because they were expected to have high participation and also because they wore at least a youth medium [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] Revolution helmet (enabling the accelerometers, [[battery (electricity)|battery]], and wireless transmitter to fit inside the helmet within the padding). That is, these seven were not a random selecting of players. Rather, the purpose of this study was to establish a baseline of what range of hits are generally expected.&lt;ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daniel | first1 = R.

As way of comparison, a collision of 80g is a big hit in a college football game of which there might be only six per game. And the range of 80, 90, or 100g is generally where risk of acute injury and [[concussion]] begins to occur (concussion being symptoms such as feeling foggy or woozy and not necessarily loss of consciousness). An example of a lesser force of 40g is heading a [[soccer ball]], and even with blows in this 30 to 40g range, it is not known whether these pose a cumulative risk of injury.&lt;ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy/&gt;

This 2011 study measured a total 753 impacts among these seven players with a median impact of 15g. It did, however, observe 38 impacts of 40g or greater, and six impacts of greater than 80g. Fortunately, none of these youth players experienced a concussion. There is also a concern that since many young players have less developed chest and neck muscles than older players, almost every impact potentially acts likes a surprise hit.&lt;ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy/&gt;

A Virginia Tech doctor stated that reducing the number of higher hits during practice sessions constitutes a real opportunity. Of the 38 impacts of 40g or greater, 29 took place during practice. And of the six impacts greater than 80g, all took place during practice.&lt;ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy/&gt;

The Center for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC's) has developed the "Heads Up concussion in Youth Sports." It helps youth coaches, players, and parents be more aware of a concussion. Heads up provides important information on preventing, recognizing and responding to a concussion. 63% of youth coaches viewed concussions being more serious, 72% said they are educating others about concussions, and 50% had learned something new.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.jccc.edu/pqrl/docview/1001027749/AB20FED092AE4579PQ/1?accountid=2200#center|title=Educating Coaches About Concussion in Sports: Evaluation of the CDC's "Heads Up: Concussion in Youth Sports" Initiative|last=Covassin, Elbin, Sarmiento.|first=Tracey, R J, Kelly|date=May 2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concussions in high school football===
Concussions are frequent in high school football. Football has the highest rate of concussion among high school sports, with about 11 concussions occurring per 10,000 athletic exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Breslow|first1=Jason|title=High School Football Players Face Bigger Concussion Risk|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sports/league-of-denial/high-school-football-players-face-bigger-concussion-risk/|website=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 50 high school or younger football players across the country were killed or sustained serious head injuries on the field since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/09/16/sports/20070916_CONCUSSION_GRAPHIC.html?ref=headinjuries&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=Young Players, Serious Injuries|work=New York Times|date=2007-09-16|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many concussions that occur during high school football often go untreated and are not monitored. This is a big concern because repeated trauma to the head, especially injuries with concussion like symptoms, puts a young athlete health at serious risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Unreported Concussion in High School Football Players: Impli... : Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine|url=http://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/Abstract/2004/01000/Unreported_Concussion_in_High_School_Football.3.aspx|journal=LWW|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2013 study by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center found that, despite knowing the risk of serious injury from continuing to play with a concussion, half of high school football players would still play if they had a headache from an injury sustained on the field. Researchers surveyed 120 high school football players. Of those students, 30 reported having suffered a concussion. More than 90 percent recognized the risk of serious injury if they returned to play too quickly, but more than half of those aware of the risks responded they would "always or sometimes continue to play with a headache sustained from an injury," and only 54 percent indicated they would "always or sometimes report symptoms of a concussion to their coach."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-05/cchm-src050113.php|title=Study raises concerns that teen athletes continue to play with concussion symptoms|publisher=Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center|date=2013-05-06|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that 15.8% of football players who sustain a concussion severe enough to cause loss of consciousness return to play the same day. Due to the fact that only 42% of high schools have access to athletic training services, there has been a large debate regarding the risks that high school football players face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics on Youth Sports Safety|url=http://www.clearedtoplay.org/concussion-information/concussions-by-the-numbers|website=Cleared to Play|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven high schools in North Central Florida agreed to take a written questionnaire evaluating the varsity football teams knowledge about concussions. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Research Subjects by the University of Florida. The review consisted of three sections. First was to identify symptoms of a concussion, second what they believed were possible consequences from not getting the proper treatment of a concussion, and the last section was to indicate if they have ever received information about concussions. 25% of them had never received information about concussion and only 54% had talked about the issue of a concussion with a parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4208870/|title=Concussion Knowledge in High School Football Players|last=Janie Cournoyer, MSc, ATC, CAT(C) and Brady L.

==Prevention efforts==
Numerous efforts have attempted to identify potential concussions quickly. Helmet [[shock data logger]]s and [[impact sensor]]s help monitor impacts a player receives.  One example is a device created by [[Schutt Sports]] during the [[Arena Football League]]'s 2008 season known as the "Shockometer"—a triangle-shaped object with adhesive on its side that sticks to players' helmets. When a player gets hit by a [[g-force]] which exceeds 98, a capsule with a green light in it will change to a red light. Doctors have determined that a g-force of approximately 100 will increase the risk of a concussion, even though a quarterback that gets sacked would normally register a g-force of 150 g. A possible flaw to the Shockometer is that fan activity could accidentally trigger the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=3269214|title = Indicator on AFL helmets|work = ESPN|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to help record the frequency and severity of player impacts during practices and games. Every HITS helmet features MX Encoders, which would automatically record every hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riddell.com/innovation/hits-technology/|title=HITS™ Technology|publisher=Riddell|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight NFL teams had planned to use the system in the {{NFL Year|2010}} season, but it was ultimately not used.&lt;ref name=HITS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/06/24/failure-to-use-hit-system-exposes-league-to-future-concussion-liability/|title=Failure to use HIT system exposes league to future concussion liability|publisher=Profootballtalk.nbcsports.com|date=June 24, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Reebok]] developed the Head Impact Indicator, which is a [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]-sized device placed on a player's skull, which activates a red/yellow light if the player is hit too hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Sauser|first = Brittany|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/408643/a-helmet-that-detects-hard-hits/|title = A helmet that detects hard hits|publisher = [[National Football League]]|date = 2007-09-10|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Reebok's Impact Indicator, Battle Sport Science has released the Impact Indicator 2.0.

Vicis, a Seattle-based firm, has created a new unique type of helmet that is very flexible due to the many layers that make up this new intricate helmet. This helmet consists of four layers, beginning with the Lode Shell. This layer absorbs the shock from the hit, which then leads to the Core Layer contorting and bending in all directions. This technology alleviates stress from the impact, which consists of all the linear and rotational forces involved in the hit. The Arch Shell exists directly under the Core Layer and is precisely designed to fit a player's head shape. The last layer, the Form Liner, works with the Arch Shell to apportion pressure evenly around the perimeter of the head. Instead of measuring a player's head the conventional way by taking the circumference, Vicis measures the length and width of the head to get more accurate data. A better fit of the helmet allows for the technology to work more advantageously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/zero-1-football-helmet-helps-prevent-concussions/|title=Flexible football helmet absorbs hits like a car bumper, could put an end to concussions|author=|date=4 April 2017|website=digitaltrends.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several NFL players have tried this new helmet and have provided great feedback. Cliff Avril from the Seattle Seahawks said, "You don't feel the thuds as hard as they normally are." In the NFL's 2017 Helmet Laboratory Testing Performance Results, the Vicis helmet finished first out of the 33 helmets that could have been worn in 2017 NFL season. Concussion-preventing technology continues to improve the safety in the game of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geekwire.com/2017/seattle-seahawks-players-talk-experience-wearing-new-high-tech-vicis-helmet/|title=Seattle Seahawks players talk about their experience wearing new high-tech Vicis helmet|author=|date=28 August 2017|website=geekwire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NFL===

The National Football League has made numerous rule changes to reduce the number of concussions suffered by players while making the game safer.

In 2010, the NFL reworded the League's rules to prohibit a player from "launching himself off the ground and using his helmet to strike a player in a defenseless posture in the head or neck." Violations of this rule only result in the imposition of a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty. In the same season, the NFL mandated that once a player loses his helmet on the playing field, the current play must immediately be whistled dead.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Drysdale|date=13 December 2013|title=Helmet-to-Helmet Contact: Avoiding a Lifetime Penalty by Creating a Duty to Scan Active NFL Players for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy|journal=Journal of Legal Medicine|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis ltd|volume=34|issue=4|pages=425–452|doi=10.1080/01947648.2013.859969}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, the NFL mandated that during field goals or extra point attempts, defenders must line up with their entire bodies on the outside of the snapper's body to protect the snapper while he is in a position of vulnerability. Violations of this rule, however, result in only a five-yard penalty for illegal formation.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"/&gt;

The Competition Committee reviews all competitive aspects of the game, including playing rules, roster regulations, technology, game-day operations and player protection. The process for modifying or adopting rules and regulations is systematic and consensus-oriented.&lt;ref&gt;playsmartplaysafe.com Coaching For Change:Rule Changes Designed to Improve Health and Safety. website.&lt;/ref&gt;

To reinforce the seriousness of the rule changes, in the middle of the 2010 season, Commissioner Goodell issued a memo to all NFL teams stating that "more significant discipline, including suspensions, will be imposed on players that strike an opponent in the head or neck area in violation of the rules."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81b7b9ef/article/goodell-issues-memo-enforcing-player-safety-rules|title=Goodell issues memo enforcing player safety rules|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-07-26|accessdate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most drastic step the NFL has taken to reduce head injuries was the 2010 change to the NFL kickoff rules. To reduce what has been referred to as one of the most violent plays in the game, the kickoff was moved up from the 30-yard line to the 35-yard line. The NFL also outlawed the use of the three-man wedge on kickoffs, while allowing the two-man wedge to remain a legal play. Consequently, players on the kicking team must now line up closer to midfield, reducing the amount of space the players have in which to get a running start.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"/&gt;

In 2011, the NFL also mandated that certified athletic trainers be available in press boxes during all NFL games. These athletic trainers assist medical personnel located on the sidelines in identifying potential concussions because the symptoms are often difficult to spot and assess from the field level.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"/&gt;

On March 20, 2013, the NFL voted to introduce yet another new rule aimed at player safety. Starting in the 2013-2014 season, if a running back lowers the crown of his helmet while he is inside the tackle box or while he is less than three yards downfield and makes contact with a defender, the team will be given a 15-yard penalty.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"/&gt;

After three years of declines in reported cases, the 2015 regular season contained a spike in concussions even after making several improvements the previous year. The total cases reported for the practices, pre-season, and regular season was 271, a 31.6 percent spike. The 2015 cases reported for regular season games was 182, a 58.3 percent spike.&lt;ref&gt;Shpigel, Ben. (29 January 2016). Diagnoses of Concussions Increase by Nearly a Third Over Last Season.

In the 2016 offseason, the NFL implemented a new policy to their concussion protocol. The NFL can now punish teams that do not follow their concussion protocol by imposing a monetary fine or taking away their draft picks. The first violation can be a fine up to $150,000 and the second violation can be a fine no less than $100,000 and a possible removal of draft picks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/nfl-concussion-protocol-policy-history|title=What is the NFL's concussion protocol?|author=|date=|website=si.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Seattle Seahawks were under much scrutiny for violating the NFL's concussion protocol by allowing [[Russell Wilson]] to return to the game against the Arizona Cardinals without the proper treatment.

=== WFA ===
The Women's Football Alliance has come a long way when it comes to the guidelines on making the game safer for its players.

from 2012 to 2017 they have since made it illegal to send a player back into the game with suspicions of a concussion unless cleared by a certified health official.

===Youth football===

Return to play guidelines (RTPs), such as Washington State's  Lystedt Law, have been legally mandated since 2009.  All 50 states, including Washington D.C, have now passed legislation to help reduce the number of traumatic brain injuries in youth football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachynski|first1=Kathleen|title=Youth Sports &amp; Public Health:  Framing Risks of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in American Football and Ice Hockey|journal=Journal of Law, Medicine &amp;Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Dick Durbin, from Illinois, introduced the Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act on September 25, 2013 to the U.S. Senate.  This act would require athletes, parents, coaches and school officials to be informed of the risks of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and it would also require the "when in doubt, sit it out" policy to be used  with athletes that have been suspected of having a concussion and be removed from the field of play.  A press release from Senator Durbin stated that many major U.S. sports organizations, including the NFL and NHL, endorsed the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachynski|first1=Kathleen|title=Youth Sports &amp; Public Health: Framing Risks of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in American Football and Ice Hockey|journal=Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics|issue=Fall 2014|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, researchers with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] and [[Boston University]] announced that they had identified CTE in 96 percent of NFL players that they had examined and in 79 percent of all football players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breslow|first=Jason|title=New: 87 Deceased NFL Players Test Positive for Brain Disease|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/new-87-deceased-nfl-players-test-positive-for-brain-disease/|accessdate=9 January 2016|publisher=Frontline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2015, Gary Small and colleagues have been called into question by the [[FDA]] for their overzealous commercialization and promotion of clinically unproven screening that fellow peer researchers deem fit only for research and they have responded by withdrawing related materials from their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-brain-scan-warning-taumark-20150410-story.html|title= FDA forces UCLA researchers to stop touting experimental dementia scan|first= Alan |last= Zarembo|date= Apr 10, 2015|publisher= LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= Feb 15, 2015|url= http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM436520.pdf|title= Warning Letters and Notice of Violation Letters|publisher= FDA|quote= Restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, all screening procedures that examine football players for brain damage have been post mortem. In 2013, Gary Small and colleagues developed an in vivo chemical tracer that can detect tau protein build up in living players. Small and his team invented this new chemical tracer, 2-(1-&lt;nowiki/&gt;{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile, or FDDNP, that could be used in [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) scans.&lt;ref name="Small 2013 138-144"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=G.W.|title=PET Scanning of Brain Tau in Retired National League Football Players: Preliminary Findings|journal=American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry|year=2013|volume=21|issue=2|pages=138–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new tracer measures for tau protein and amyloid plaque accumulation in human brains; symptoms of repetitive brain trauma among other things. Although tracers have been developed to screen for the build-up of tau proteins in the human brain, FDDNP is the first PET tracer that can be used in vivo in human trials. FDDNP was originally developed in an effort to detect Alzheimer's in elderly individuals, thus the article was published in the [[The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry|journal]] of the [[American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry]]. However, because there are similarities between Alzheimer's and the effects of [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|Chronic Traumatic Encephelopathy]] (CTE), FDDNP was used to study the extent of brain trauma in consenting, retired NFL players.

Small and colleagues performed a controlled experiment on retired NFL players and an equal number of control participants. Unfortunately the sample size was very small as only 5 players of the 19 contacted were eligible for the study. Though the sample size was small, a good range of positions were represented (linebacker, quarterback, offensive lineman, defensive lineman, and a center) and all players had played in the league at least 10 years. The players had to be at least 45 years of age and currently exhibit symptoms of cognitive and mood disruption. Control participants had to meet certain criteria as well to ensure that they were as similar as possible to the NFL players in order to eliminate any biases or confounding variables. Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), years of education, and family history of dementia were all selected as the selection criteria for control participants. All participants received intravenous injections of the FDDNP tracer and were tested over 4 weeks using PET imaging technology.
	
The injection of the FDDNP tracer was successful, and the results of the study showed significant differences between the NFL players and control participants. The NFL players had significantly higher FDDNP signals than control participants, indicating a greater amount of tau protein accumulation. The cortical regions of all the participants studied showed no significant difference, but the NFL players had FDDNP levels that were significantly higher in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, sub thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar white matter regions of the brain as compared to the control participants.&lt;ref name="Small 2013 138-144"/&gt; In addition, a positive correlation was found between the number of head injuries the players sustained and the levels of FDDNP binding. This suggests that players with a more severe history of head trauma will likely have significantly more accumulation of tau protein. This, in turn, gives rise to the suggestion that a more severe history of head trauma will result in greater deterioration of the brain, cognitive functioning, and mood regulation.

The findings of the study were consistent with previous autopsy studies of individuals with CTE. The important distinction to make, however, is that the patients in Small's study were not on the slab and walked out after testing was completed. This is monumental in the field of brain trauma and concussion research.

Based on recent new blood tests; evidence is revealing no change in blood plasma tau and serum neurofilament light concentrations following sport related concussions. However these levels did rise in more severe concussion sport related injuries. This can can potentially suggest that a new blood test be developed and help aid in identifying the severity of concussion, and assist in concussion protocols. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2018|title=New Biomarkers Study Results Reported from University of British Columbia (No change in plasma tau and serum concentrations in adolescent athletes following sport-related concussions.|url=http://link.galegroup.com.ezproxy.jccc.edu/apps/doc/A561840507/AONE?u=jcl_jccc&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=811a449a|journal=Obesity, Fitness &amp; Wellness|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery efforts==
Concussions are proven to cause loss of brain function. This can lead to physical and emotional symptoms such as attention disorders, depression, headaches, nausea, and amnesia. These symptoms can last for days or week and even after the symptoms have gone, the brain still won't be completely normal. Players with multiple concussions can have drastically worsened symptoms and exponentially increased recovery time.

Researchers at UCLA used a brain-imaging tool to identify a certain protein found in five retired NFL players. The presence and accumulation of tau proteins found in the five living players, are associated with [[Alzheimer's]] disease. Previously, this type of exam could only be performed with an autopsy. Scientists at UCLA created a chemical marker that binds to the abnormal proteins and they are able to view this with [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) scan. Researcher at UCLA, Gary Small explains, "Providing a non-invasive method for early detection is a critical first step in developing interventions to prevent symptom onset and progression in [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|CTE]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Imaging Study of Concussion-Related Abnormal Brain Proteins In Retired NFL Players|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/255241.php|publisher=Medical News Today|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-Concussive Symptoms (PCS) is an area of recovery that is often not discussed. New evidence suggest that new recovery protocols have been recommended and designed to more adequately and efficiently recover from concussions. PCS is a concussion symptom lasting longer than 14 days. Current protocols suggest that the athlete refrain from any physical activity until symptoms free. However, according to the Journal of Athletic Training "A physiological approach to prolonged recovery from sport-related concussion" suggests some aerobic activity may be beneficial to more appropriate healing from concussion, and may lessen the reoccurrence of repeated concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leddy|first=John|date=no. 3, 2017|title=A physiological approach to prolonged recovery from sport-related concussion|url=|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume= 52|pages= 299+|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been promising evidence that blood flow restriction based exercises can be used to improve Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS). "The leading theory supporting this is that human growth hormone is released in response to increased lactate production from exercise, enhancing the brain function and recovery". This exercise based program could potentially be used in conjunction with aerobic therapy to better improve concussion symptoms during the recovery process. Wu, Yi-Ning, "Stable recovery after aerobic exercise with limb blood flow restriction and cooling in individuals with post-concussion syndrome", Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics of North America, p. 437-54. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;==

[[File:EyeBlack.jpg|thumb|200px|American Football players wearing eye black.]]

'''Eye black''' is a grease or strip applied under the [[human eye|eyes]] to reduce [[light pollution#Glare|glare]]. It is often used by [[American football]], [[baseball]], and [[lacrosse]] players to mitigate the effects of bright sunlight or stadium floodlights.

It is a form of functional [[theatrical makeup|makeup]].

==Varieties==

* Traditional grease consists of [[beeswax]], [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], and [[carbon]].
* Anti-glare face strips that emulate the grease are also commonly used.

==History==
One of the earliest known instances of a player wearing eye black is baseball legend [[Babe Ruth]], who, in or around the 1930s, used the grease in an attempt to reduce sun glare. According to Paul Lukas of ''[[ESPN.com]]'', eye black caught on with [[American football]] player [[Andy Farkas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Lukas |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The evolution of eye black. It has also been manufactured, sometimes with a sports team logo printed on them |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/061127 |work=ESPN Page 2 |publisher= |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003031950/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas%2F061127 |archivedate=2008-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that the original eye black was made from the ashes of burned cork.

===2003 study===
A 2003 study by Brian DeBroff and Patricia Pahk tested whether black eye grease actually had anti-glare properties.  The subjects of the study were divided into three groups: wearers of eye black, wearers of anti-glare stickers, and wearers of [[petroleum jelly]]. The subjects' vision was tested using an [[eye chart]] while being exposed to natural sunlight.

The study concluded that eye black reduced glare of the sun and improved [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] sensitivity, whereas commercial anti-glare stickers and petroleum jelly (the control substance) were found to be ineffective.&lt;ref name="DeBroff-Pahk"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brian M. DeBroff and Patricia J. Pahk | title=The Ability of Periorbitally Applied Antiglare Products to Improve Contrast Sensitivity in Conditions of Sunlight Exposure | journal=Archives of Ophthalmology |date=July 2003 | volume=121 | issue=7 | pages=997–1001 | url=http://archopht.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/121/7/997 | pmid=12860804 | doi=10.1001/archopht.121.7.997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the study was subject to unavoidable [[Demand characteristics|demand bias]], wherein the test subjects could have unconsciously changed their responses during testing based on the fact that they knew which substance they were wearing. Also, the petroleum jelly could have introduced glare that would not occur on natural skin and the study did not test a control condition of natural skin. [[Learning bias]] is also a factor in the results due to chart repetition.&lt;ref name="DeBroff-Pahk"/&gt;

===New Hampshire study===
A study by Benjamin R. Powers at [[University of New Hampshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Benjamin R. Powers | title=Why Do Athletes Use Eye Black? | journal=University of New Hampshire Inquiry | year=2005 | url=http://www.unh.edu/inquiryjournal/05/articles/powers.htm | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908114749/http://www.unh.edu/inquiryjournal/05/articles/powers.htm | archivedate=2007-09-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which improved on DeBroff's methodology, found eye black to reduce glare from the sun in females and in those whose eye-color was not blue. The study also tested males and blue-eyed subjects. However, the results were not statistically significant (probably due to a smaller sample size of those test subjects). Some testing was also performed indoors under artificial lighting (when inclement weather prohibited outdoor testing). However, those results showed little difference and were not statistically significant. The Powers study was not a [[double-blind]] study because those in contact with the test subjects knew which substance was applied. Also, the eye tests were performed at a distance of only {{convert|1.15|metre}}.

===MythBusters test===
On an episode of ''[[MythBusters]]'', [[Adam Savage]] and [[Jamie Hyneman]] tested whether eye black reduces glare. They determined that, while eye black does not eliminate glare, it does improve an athlete's ability to differentiate between light and dark, enhancing a player's ability to track moving objects in a sunny environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/baseball-eye-black-cuts-out-glare/ |title=''MythBusters'' episode summary "Baseball Player's Eye Black Cuts Out Glare" |accessdate=2015-03-26}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Messages in eye black==

Some athletes, particularly at the college level, began a practice of writing short messages on their adhesive eye black stickers. The trend gained traction among football players in the mid-2000s, popularized by [[Reggie Bush]], who featured homages to his [[Area code 619|hometown]]; other popular messages included [[Bible]] verses, memorial tributes, and licensed university logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Lukas |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The evolution of eye black |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/061127 |work=[[ESPN]] Page 2 |publisher= |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2014-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003031950/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas%2F061127 |archivedate=2008-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The displays began to garner widespread media attention surrounding [[Tim Tebow]], who used Bible verse references. This practice was banned on April 14, 2010, when the [[NCAA]] Playing Rules Oversight Panel (PROP) approved a proposal effecting "that players are not allowed to have any symbols or messages on their eye black starting in the 2010 season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Johnson |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=PROP approves wedge-blocking proposal |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/ncaa/ncaa+news/ncaa+news+online/2010/association-wide/prop+approves+wedge-blocking+proposal_04_15_10_ncaa_news |work=The NCAA News |publisher= |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5641">The '''Case Fresno''' is the name assigned by the [[Catalonia]] media and public opinion to the [[Federation of International Roller Sports]] (FIRS) assembly held at [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[California]], on 26 November 2004. It meant that for the first time in history, an international sport team that had been accepted provisionally was later not accepted definitely. At the same time, it was the first time that a regional sport team (Catalonia) had been registered with the opposition of the state the region belonged to ([[Spain]]). The Spanish sport organizations actively lobbied against the Catalonia membership among the members of the assembly. At the Fresno assembly, the membership application was rejected (8–114). However, the [[Federació Catalana de Patinatge]] brought the case to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (TAS) at [[Lausanne]], which admitted irregularities in the assembly (notably the lack of secrecy in the vote), invalidated the vote, and forced the FIRS to repeat the vote following the FIRS statute rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tas-cas.org/fr/pdf/catalans.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051019233616/http://www.tas-cas.org/fr/pdf/catalans.PDF |archivedate=2005-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An extraordinary FIRS assembly was held in Rome on November 24, 2005, and again rejected the membership application of the Catalan federation (125–43).

After being granted a temporary membership, Catalonia played the World Championship B, at [[Macau]], ([[China]]), in October 2004, winning it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosport.es/home/pages/v4/l6/s155/sport_lng6_spo155_sto650587.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426230823/http://www.eurosport.es/home/pages/v4/l6/s155/sport_lng6_spo155_sto650587.shtml |archivedate=2005-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Catalonia qualified to play the full World Championship, where it played in the same group as Spain.

==Spain's opposition==
Some [[Catalonia|Catalan]] media have denounced the pressions by the Spanish government and sport organizations on the members of the assembly [http://catalanhockey.blogspot.com/2004/11/plot-reveals.html].

Representatives from [[Chile]] [http://usuarios.lycos.es/fresno05/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=19] or [[Italy]] (Sabatino Aracu, member of [[Forza Italia]]) [http://www.forzaitalia.org/gruppo/deputati/leggiComunicati.asp?codiceDeputato=17&amp;news_id=2341] would allegedly suffered from such pressions or receive instructions from their national governments.

The [[Czech Republic]] representative Radek Pavelec admitted that his federation had received pressures from the Spanish government [http://catalanhockey.blogspot.com/2004/11/plot-reveals.html].

In addition, a letter of the Consejo Superior de Deported (CSD, the Spanish Council for Sports) to the [[Colombia]]n federation in which the Spaniards were asking for the vote against Catalonia has been made public. In that letter the CSD stated that the recognition of [[Catalonia]] would alter the Spanish sport national unity and would create a wrong precedent.
The same letter was sent to some other South American federations [http://usuarios.lycos.es/fresno05/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=65].

The [[Germany|German]] representative admitted that she was contacted by the German MP for Sport demanding the vote against Catalonia. Literally he asked her to make sure she was coming back from Fresno with a "no" against Catalonia.

==Repetition of the vote in Rome==

On 29 November 2005, the FIRS assembly, meeting in Rome, he repeated the final vote on the admission of the Catalan Federation of Skating.

In this case the method of voting was secret and the president of the Catalan Ramon Basiana was able to defend the nomination.

The extraordinary meeting in Rome of the FIRS rejected by 125 votes to 43 for admission as a full member of the Catalan Federation of Skating

'''''Jane Blalock v. Ladies Professional Golf Association''''' was an ongoing lawsuit that took place between 1972 and 1975, following a professional [[golf]] incident in 1972. A month after winning the notable [[Dinah Shore Colgate Winner's Circle]] in 1972, American golfer [[Jane Blalock]] was allegedly observed replacing her marker incorrectly at the [[Bluegrass Invitational]] during the [[1972 LPGA Tour]].&lt;ref name="droughtcorneliius"/&gt; Blalock was fined and suspended by the [[LPGA Tour]] executive board. The suspension led to a fair degree of press coverage, with Blalock filing an anti-trust countersuit in [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia]] shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="notenoughpunish"/&gt;

In June 1973, federal judge [[Charles Allen Moye Jr.|Charles A. Moye Jr.]] ruled that "LGPA players cannot police their own members," and that Blalock's suspension "was ill-founded."&lt;ref name="antitrust"/&gt;  A court awarded Blalock damages the following year.&lt;ref name="damagesfurthertipled"/&gt; The LPGA subsequently announced plans to appeal.&lt;ref name="favordamages"/&gt; The ongoing lawsuit led to the LPGA searching for its first [[commissioner]], and after Ray Volpe was appointed to the role in July 1975,&lt;ref name="lpgavolpe"/&gt; a month later the LPGA dropped its appeal and settled all claims on the Blalock case.&lt;ref name="courtrustinfavor"/&gt;

==Background==
[[Jane Blalock]] was born in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] on September 19, 1945.&lt;ref name="all-timereocrdmade"/&gt; She began golfing at age 13, and won the New Hampshire Amateur five straight times beginning in 1965, plus the New England Amateur in 1968. Blalock attended [[Rollins College]] in [[Florida]], graduating in 1967 with a degree in [[history]]. Prior to her playing the LPGA Tour, Blalock worked as a high school history teacher.&lt;ref name="googlewinner"/&gt;

The first time Blalock played on the LPGA Tour was as an amateur at the 1964 [[Lady Carling Eastern Open]]. She finished T33.

Still an amateur, Blalock finished 5th at the 1969 [[Burdine's Invitational]].&lt;ref name="all-timereocrdmade"/&gt;

Blalock turned pro later in 1969 and went on to earn [[LPGA Tour Rookie of the Year]] honors.&lt;ref name="hofficialboublalock"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Blalock notched her first professional victory at the [[Potamkin Cadillac Classic|Lady Carling Open]].&lt;ref name="jcaptures"/&gt; On April 16, 1972, Blalock won the inaugural version of the [[Dinah Shore Colgate Winner's Circle]],&lt;ref name="receiveswin"/&gt; an event which would later be considered a [[women's major golf championships|women's major golf championship]]. One month later she won the [[Suzuki Golf Internationale]], beating [[Kathy Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="takessuzuku"/&gt;

==History of the conflict==
===Disqualification (1972)===
{{See also|1972 LPGA Tour}}
After reaching the status of "top money winner on this year's [LPGA] tour," Blalock was competing in the [[Bluegrass Invitational]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] by mid May 1972. After the second round the LPGA executive board called Blalock in to tell her she was disqualified from the tournament, contending that she signed an incorrect scorecard and also levying a $500 fine.&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; Although Blalock's scorecards had been signed and attested by fellow competitors, Tourney director Gene Mcauliff stated that Blalock "did not mark her ball properly on the 17th green and then failed to take a two-stroke penalty as required for that infraction."&lt;ref name="droughtcorneliius"/&gt;

All five members of the executive committee, Linda Craft, [[Sharon Miller]], [[Judy Rankin]], Cynthia Sullivan, and Penny Zavichas, were themselves active players.&lt;ref name="didntmakeit"/&gt; After Blalock's initial interaction with the committee at the Bluegrass Invitational, 27 LPGA players signed an [[affidavit]] demanding "that more severe action be taken against Jane Blalock,"&lt;ref name="refuseback"/&gt; specifically arguing that probation, a fine, and disqualification from the Bluegrass tournament were not enough punishment.&lt;ref name="notenoughpunish"/&gt;

===Hearings and suspension (1972)===

|style="text-align: left;"|"[The LPGA committee] told Blalock she had been observed incorrectly marking her ball on several occasions. Blalock had never before been accused of violating the rules. Despite denying the charges, she was disqualified from the tournament. Before her next event, on the advice of a friend, Blalock apologized, saying, 'If all these things you say are true, I guess I've dug my own grave and I'll just have to live with it.' LPGA president [Cynthia Sullivan] interpreted Blalock's comments as an admission of guilt. When that view was reported to the players, 29 of them signed a petition calling for the LPGA to suspend Blalock for the rest of the '72 season, which it did a few days later."

On May 20, 1972&lt;ref name="antitrust"/&gt; the LPGA executive board suspended Blalock for one year "for actions inconsistent with the code of ethics of the organization."&lt;ref name="suspensionbl"/&gt; The suspension came shortly after the announcement that Blalock wouldn't be allowed to compete in the [[Potamkin Cadillac Classic|Lady Carling Open]]. The tour also put a hold on her money earnings from the tour, at the time around $50,000.&lt;ref name="concentrahard"/&gt;

In defending their reasons for the suspension, the board stated in a press release that "the action was taken after Miss Blalock met with the executive committee on three occasions in the last 10 days. She admitted actions on the golf course which are contrary to the rules of the game."&lt;ref name="suspensionbl"/&gt; According to ''Sports Illustrated,'' the board also claimed that Blalock had "been under suspicion for over a year, that there [had] been repeated violations, that witnesses in the gallery at Louisville had observed her replacing the ball to the side of her marker on the green&lt;ref name="courtrustinfavor72"/&gt; and that Janie tearfully admitted to her guilt. Miss Blalock was denying everything."&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; LPGA executive director Bud Erickson also stated that he had requested Blalock to feign a back injury in an effort to avoid bad publicity, but she refused.&lt;ref name="refuseback"/&gt;

===Initial anti-trust lawsuit (1972)===
On June 1, 1972, Blalock filed a $5 million [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust]] [[countersuit]] against the LPGA's suspension&lt;ref name="suitresolved"/&gt; on advice of her attorneys,&lt;ref name="suspensionbl"/&gt; with the intent of "[leaving] it to the court whether she had been suspended wrongly."&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; Blalock's lawyers motioned for her be allowed to continue playing while the suit was resolved.&lt;ref name="suitresolved"/&gt; As part of their argument, Blalock's lawyers denied she had ever admitted guilt to the LPGA,&lt;ref name="notenoughpunish"/&gt; and that the described admissions had been a misinterpretation of her words.&lt;ref name="didntmakeit"/&gt; Furthermore, using the sequence of events, attorney Eugene Partain "alleged that the suspension and petitions were likely the result of other players attempting to remove a significant competitor, and that the act of suspending [Blalock] from playing in any significant tournaments was a violation of federal antitrust laws by the LPGA."&lt;ref name="notenoughpunish"/&gt;

Around June 19, Blalock met with the LGPA in [[U.S. District Court]] in [[Atlanta]] over the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; Later that month U.S. District Court Judge [[Charles Allen Moye Jr.|Charles A. Moye Jr.]] granted the motion for Blalock to continue competing in the LPGA Tour until the lawsuit was resolved,&lt;ref name="motiongranted"/&gt; in effect creating a temporary [[restraining order]] against the suspension. Moye also ruled that any tour money Blalock earned during the case would be placed in a court trust. The LPGA reacted to Moye's rulings by announcing they would file an appeal suit.&lt;ref name="courtrustinfavor72"/&gt;

===Colleagues' initial reactions (1972)===
News of the suspension and alleged rules violation drew significant press coverage, as well as mixed reactions from Blalock's colleagues. Though he said he'd never seen her move a ball against the rules himself, her former instructor [[Bob Toski]] stated that "She has a compulsion to win. I think she needs psychiatric help" and "the other players tell me this has been going on for a while." In contrast, Blalock's [[caddie]] from the Suzuki tournament contacted her with an offer to testify in her support.&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; Men's professional golfer [[Dave Hill (golfer)|Dave Hill]], who himself filed an antitrust suit in 1971 against the [[PGA Tour]],&lt;ref name="davehilef"/&gt; sent Blalock a note of encouragement. In his golf memoir ''Teed Off'', published in 1977, Hill wrote that he didn't know how Blalock continued to play well under the pressure she was enduring. The fact that Blalock did play well made Hill think she was innocent unless she was a victim of some illness.&lt;ref name="illnessshe"/&gt;

Golfer [[Sandra Palmer]] had also publicly defended Blalock as of July 8, 1972, after she and Blalock tied for lead at the [[George Washington Golf Classic]]. Stated Palmer to the press, "I've never seen her do anything [illegal], nor do I think probably that very many of the players have. I think supposedly that out of all these players who accused, only one or two have played with her." Palmer explained she didn't understand why bystanders hadn't reported the alleged infractions when they occurred, also pointing out that other players had always signed Blalock's scorecards without reporting any incidents. Stated Palmer, "if you see an infraction of the rules... you don't wait until three years later to report something. Once you've signed that card, you're as guilty as the person who committed the violation."&lt;ref name="vilationcard"/&gt;

===Probation of Sandra Palmer (1972)===
The ''[[Sarasota Journal]]'' reported on June 28, 1972 that [[Sandra Palmer]] had been "warned" by the LPGA over her statements of support for Blalock, with the LPGA explaining to Palmer that "you're entitled to your own opinion, but when it hurts our members, we feel you owe the organization an apology."&lt;ref name="statmentsdrama"/&gt; [[Bud Erickson]], executive director of the LPGA, later clarified that Palmer was also ordered "not to make any further statements of support for Miss Blalock."&lt;ref name="nosupportstatement"/&gt; The warning occurred as the tour arrived at the [[Potamkin Cadillac Classic|Lady Pepsi Golf Tournament]], where Blalock had previously won two championships.&lt;ref name="statmentsdrama"/&gt; On August 2, 1972, Palmer was put on one year's probation by the LPGA executive committee for voicing her support of Blalock.&lt;ref name="nosupportstatement"/&gt; Blalock went on to win two more times in 1972, at the [[Dallas Civitan Open]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19720911&amp;id=2XchAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pIkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4553,2391280&amp;hl=en Jane Blalock wins Dallas golf playoff]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lady Errol Classic]].&lt;ref name="ladyreerolclassic"/&gt;

===Rulings and settlements (1973–75)===
{{See also|1975 LPGA Tour#LPGA Tour settles Jane Blalock lawsuit}}
After filing the original anti-trust suit, Blalock amended the suit to include only damages from not being able to compete in the Lady Carling Tournmanent in 1972 for $4,500.&lt;ref name="favordamages"/&gt;
{|class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 0em; font-size: 90%; background:offwhite; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
|style="text-align: left;"|"In [the early 1970s] the [[LPGA]] was run by the players themselves. There was no office for the organization and no nonplaying director of the LPGA. Blalock, who denied she ever cheated and said she was the victim of older, jealous players as she began to make a mark on the tour, sued in [[United States federal courts|Federal Court]] in [[Atlanta]] to retain her playing rights and won. The court declared that players had no right to deprive a fellow competitor from an equal chance at the prize money they all were trying to earn."
|-
|style="text-align: left;"|— Gordon White for ''[[The New York Times]]'' (1987)&lt;ref name="retirementnyt"/&gt;
|}
In June 1973, Judge Charles Moye Jr. ruled that "LGPA players cannot police their own members." The ruling declared that Blalock's suspension "was ill-founded," with all remaining litigation to be focused on damages.&lt;ref name="antitrust"/&gt; In September 1973, ''[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]]'' reported that as a result of the court ruling in Blalock's favor, the LPGA and their new president [[Carol Mann]] were looking to appoint a [[commissioner]] to "[enable] the association to penalize, suspend and fine members who violate rules and regulations."&lt;ref name="commissionera"/&gt;

In August 1974, a court awarded Blalock the full $4,500 she had asked for in damages,&lt;ref name="damagesfurthertipled"/&gt; with the LPGA again announcing plans to appeal.&lt;ref name="favordamages"/&gt; Afterwards, in March 1975 Judge Charles Moye again ruled in Blalock's favor, awarding her $13,500 in damages and ordering the LPGA to pay her legal fees of $95,303. The LPGA again announced it would appeal the ruling in its entirety.&lt;ref name="damagesfurthertipled"/&gt; Ray Volpe was appointed the first LPGA Commissioner on July 8, 1975,&lt;ref name="lpgavolpe"/&gt; and a month later the LPGA announced it had dropped its appeal and settled "all claims and counter claims growing from a dispute between it and golfer Jane Blalock."&lt;ref name="courtrustinfavor"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Blalock refused to condemn her critics, including her former mentor Bob Toski, after her lawsuit was settled. She said to a reporter in 1978 "I should not judge others as they have judged me. Life is too short and there is too much sadness. So I can't clutter my mind with all that other stuff. It makes it hard to concentrate."&lt;ref name="concentrahard"/&gt; Bob Toski left the [[Senior PGA Tour]] in 1986 after he became involved in a controversy over how he was marking his ball.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H7VhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sc4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1779,6138908&amp;dq=bob+toski+seniors+tour&amp;hl=en Toski withdraws from Senior Tour]&lt;/ref&gt; Toski returned in April 1986&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FPcjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bdsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3915,2451335&amp;dq=toski+golf&amp;hl=en 28 Teams To Compete In Legends of Golf]&lt;/ref&gt; and played several more years on the Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pgatour.com/players/player.02208.bob-toski.html |title=Bob Toski – Results – Career |publisher=PGA Tour |access-date=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blalock continued playing on the LPGA Tour through 1987. When she was through playing, Blalock had 27 Tour wins to her credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=2008 LPGA Media Guide|publisher=[[LPGA Tour]] |year=1977 |pages=52 and 363}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first female golfer to earn over $100,000 in four consecutive years&lt;ref name="retirementnyt"/&gt; and the seventh overall to reach the one million dollar mark in career earnings.&lt;ref name="earningsmillion"/&gt; Between 1969 and 1980, Blalock made the cut in 299 consecutive tournaments, an all-time LPGA Tour record.&lt;ref name="all-timereocrdmade"/&gt;

In 1976, Blalock testified for the LPGA Tour in a suit against a sponsor trying to start a Women's [[Masters Tournament]].&lt;ref name="againstsponsor"/&gt; Blalock wrote a column  for the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' in 1981 complaining about the association's overuse of sex appeal in promoting the tour.&lt;ref name="sexappealnotneeded"/&gt;

With 27 LPGA Tour wins, Blalock almost qualified for the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]] under the standards in use as of 2011. However, she never won a major championship in her career nor was she ever LPGA Player of the Year or winner of the LPGA Vare Trophy.&lt;ref name="worldgolffame"/&gt; Blalock would have to be voted in by the Veterans Committee.&lt;ref name="didntmakeit"/&gt;  As of 2018, all eligible [[List of golfers with most LPGA Tour wins|golfers with 20 or more wins on the LPGA Tour]] are in the World Golf Hall of Fame except Blalock. Several golfers who primarily played the LPGA Tour, [[Hollis Stacy]] who was inducted in 2012,&lt;ref name="hollisstacy2012"&gt;[http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7247989/hollis-stacy-selected-world-golf-hall-fame Hollis Stacy selected for Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judy Rankin]] and [[Donna Caponi]] have fewer career wins than Blalock but have been selected by the Veterans Committee. Blalock said in 2001 "It's almost a relief that I don't qualify. What if every year my name came up and every year I didn't make it? I'd be thinking, 'is what happened the reason?'"&lt;ref name="didntmakeit"/&gt;

In July 2014, she was voted into the [[Legends Tour|Legends Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="qlpgahome"/&gt;

A '''jockstrap''' (also known as a jock, strap, supporter, or athletic supporter) is an [[undergarment]] for supporting the [[human male genitalia|male genitalia]] during [[cycling]], [[contact sports]] or other vigorous physical activity. A jockstrap consists of a waistband (usually [[elastomer|elastic]]) with a support pouch for the genitalia and two elastic straps affixed to the base of the pouch and to the left and right sides of the waistband at the hip. The pouch, in some varieties, may be fitted with a pocket to hold an [[abdominal guard]] (impact resistant cup, box) to protect the [[testicle]]s and the [[Human penis|penis]] from [[injury]].

==Etymology==
The word ''jockstrap'' has purportedly been in use at least since 1891, a likely contraction of "jockey strap", as the garment was first designed for bicycle-riding messengers and deliverymen, or 'bike jockeys'. The Bike Jockey Strap was the first jockstrap manufactured in America in 1874.&lt;ref name=bikehistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bikeathletic.com/History.aspx |title=Bike History|publisher=Bike Athletic |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071124113927/http://www.bikeathletic.com/History.aspx |archivedate = 2007-11-24}} (archived from [http://www.bikeathletic.com/History.aspx the original] on 2007-11-24).&lt;!-- as of May, 2009 the http://www.bikeathletic.com/ website is unavailable and is being reorganized.

[[Jockey]] meaning 'rider', primarily a race horse rider, has been in use since 1670.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Jockey |volume=15 |page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jockey itself is the diminutive form of the Scots nickname Jock (for John) as Jackie is for the English nickname Jack. The nicknames Jack and Jackie, Jock and Jockey have been used generically for 'man, fellow, boy, common man'. From the period ''c''.1650–''c.''1850, 'jock' was used as slang for penis.&lt;ref name=etym&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=j&amp;p=3|title=Jock|work=Online Etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent American slang term '[[Jock (athlete)|jock]]', meaning an athlete, is traced to 1959 and is itself derived from 'jockstrap'.&lt;ref name=etym /&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Jockstrap Ad 1941 01.jpg|thumb|Jockstrap ad, 1941]]
[[File:Vintage JayBee Jockstrap.jpg|thumb|right|150px|JayBee jockstrap]]
The jockstrap was invented in 1874 by C. F. Bennett of a [[Chicago]] sporting goods company, Sharp &amp; Smith, to provide comfort and support for bicycle jockeys working the cobblestone streets of [[Boston]]. In 1897 Bennett's newly formed Bike Web Company patented and began mass-producing the Bike Jockey Strap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Penis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bHytBAAAQBAJ|first1=Michael|last1=Kimmel|first2=Christine|last2=Milrod|first3=Amanda|last3=Kennedy|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2014|isbn=9780759123144|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bike Web Company later became known as the [[Bike Company]]. Bike was, until 2016, a leading producer of jockstraps. In that year, the company and its trademarks were purchased by Russell Athletic.

The jockstrap was also influential in early 20th-century medicine with the invention of the Heidelberg Electric Belt, a low-voltage electric powered jockstrap that claimed to cure [[kidney disorder]]s, [[insomnia]], [[erectile dysfunction]], and other ailments. Today, jockstraps are still worn mostly by adolescent and adult men for sports, weightlifting, medical purposes and for recovery from injury or [[surgery]] for such conditions as [[hematocele]], [[Inguinal hernia|groin hernia]], [[hydrocele]], or [[spermatocele]].

==Design==
[[Image:Protective cup.jpg|thumb|125px|Banana-style cup, down position]]
[[Image:TradCup.jpg|thumb|125px|Traditional cup, up position]]
Jockstraps are fairly consistent in design with variations appearing in details like width of waistband and fabrics. Some jockstraps are designed for specific sports: ''Swim jocks'', for example, have a narrow waistband, and ''hockey jocks'' sometimes have adjustable elastic straps and [[garter (stockings)|garter]] clips that hold [[hockey socks]] in place while the bulky goalie protector has genital and abdominal foam padding. ''Windproof jockstraps'' have a special layer of fabric to protect the wearer from wind and cold in winter sports. Jockstraps are made in other materials as fetish wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationaljock.com/articles/leather-jockstraps.html |title=Leather Jockstraps |website=Internationaljock.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the aforementioned "fashion jockstraps", the 2000s have seen a resurgence in jockstrap designs and brands.

Alternatives to jockstraps include the ''jock brief'', or ''support briefs'', which have the wide waistband of a jockstrap combined with a full seat and are made of an elastic supportive material. A thong style strap, sometimes called a ''[[dance belt]]'', has one narrow elastic strap attached to the bottom of the pouch, passing between the legs and attaching to the waistband at the middle of the back. A strapless garment, called a ''jock sock'' or sometimes a ''slingshot'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jockstrapcentral.com/history.php |title=A History of the Jockstrap |publisher=Jockstrap Central |date= |accessdate=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; has only an elastic waist band with an elastic pouch that holds the genitals from the front.

In [[Europe]], from the time of the [[Middle Ages]], undergarments available were limited to a loose fitting trouser-like piece of clothing called a [[braies]].  This article of clothing was stepped into and then laced or tied around the waist and legs at about mid-calf and provided no support to the male genitals. This allowed the scrotum unlimited movement under clothing and resulted in injury from carts, carriages with wooden planks for seats or the saddle as the body took all of the force of the motion. The ''suspensory'', was developed around the early 1820s as a way to lift the [[scrotum]] away from the plank seat and saddle thereby preventing injury or while in a cart, carriage or horseback riding. Today the ''suspensory'' is used primarily as a medical device after genital [[surgery]] to aid in post operative healing. [[George Armstrong Custer|General Custer’s]] suspensory can be seen in the [[Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument]] museum, near Crow Agency [[Montana]].

==Protective cup==
Optional ''cups'' offer additional protection for contact sports and are made of hard plastic or steel, perforated for ventilation.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jockstrappedstuds.com/pages/news/jock_cup_hist.htm |title=Jockstrap and Cup Historical Background |website=Web.archive.org |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2016-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821141215/http://www.jockstrappedstuds.com/pages/news/jock_cup_hist.htm |archivedate=August 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more flexible and comfortable ''soft cup'' is also offered for low contact sports. A ''flex cup'' variation features a hard exterior melded with a soft lining.

A similar piece of protective equipment in the sport of [[cricket]] is known as a ''[[Box (cricket)|box]]''. In cricket, a box is usually worn by only a batsman, a wicket-keeper, and sometimes other close-up fielders. For fielders farther from the batsman, the wearing of a box would impede their movement and running (for batsmen the benefits outweigh the disadvantages).

An abdominal guard (also called "compression cup", "box", or "L Guard") is a hard usually plastic cup that is inserted in a jockstrap to protect [[human male genitalia|male genitalia]]. Some jockstraps have a lined front pouch for this purpose. The abdominal guard is usually constructed from high density plastic with a padded edge, shaped like a hollow half-pear, and inserted into the jockstrap or jockstrap-style underwear of the batsmen and wicket-keeper. This is used to protect the genitals against impact from the ball.

Many sports require the use of an athletic cup. These include [[cricket]], [[fencing]], [[martial arts]], [[boxing]], [[lacrosse]], [[hockey]], [[baseball]], [[paintball]], [[football]] and many others.

Fashion jocks often incorporate soft-lined front pouches or they may be designed to bring the male genitalia forwards or upwards. The purpose of these modifications is to enhance the masculine appearance of the wearer. Wearers of fashion jocks may also wear abdominal guards for the same purpose.

[[Pelvic protector]]s exist to protect [[female genitalia]], though these are less widespread.

With the decline in the use of jockstraps in sports, the use of the necessary abdominal guard has also declined despite the safety implications. Some see wearing a cup as a [[taboo]] topic. Typically cups are worn in the pouch of a jockstrap which may be double-lined to hold the cup, or in [[compression shorts]] or sport-specific briefs.

Cups for some combat sports (e.g. mixed martial arts, kick boxing) have a waistband and straps attached directly to the cup designed to be worn over a regular jockstrap or briefs. Some sports such as [[boxing]] use an oversized cup and jock combined into a single item which has layered foam padding that protects the groin, kidneys and abdomen.

===Use===
Cups offer protection for contact sports. They are usually made of hard plastic or steel and perforated for ventilation. A more flexible and comfortable soft cup is also offered for low-contact sports such as soccer. A flex cup variation features a hard exterior cup with a soft cups lining.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

==Jockstraps for females==
The '''pelvic protector''' is the female equivalent of the male jockstrap. Ronald Paramore invented the pelvic protector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://femalejockstrap.com/media.htm |title=What Did The Media Say? |publisher=Femalejockstrap.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322225728/http://femalejockstrap.com/media.htm |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to protect the vagina from bruising, tearing, or traumatic penetration. The area protected includes the entire [[vulva]], including the [[clitoris]], the [[clitoral hood]] and the delicate [[labia minora]] which protrude from the vulva in some women and are therefore especially vulnerable to injury from impact and from stretching or tearing. It is also occasionally nicknamed a "jill" or "jillstrap".&lt;ref&gt; Cara Hedley {{google books|jbeLGtCWuqMC|Twenty Miles |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women wear the garment during contact sports or activities. The garment "cups" around the genitals and is usually reinforced with rigid material.

'''Kegel exercise''', also known as '''pelvic floor exercise''', consists of repeatedly contracting and relaxing the muscles that form part of the [[pelvic floor]], now sometimes colloquially referred to as the "Kegel muscles". The exercise can be performed multiple times each day, for several minutes at a time, for one to three months, to begin to have an effect.

Kegel exercises can make the pelvic floor muscles stronger. These are the muscles that hold up the bladder and help keep it from leaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-control-problems-women/kegel-exercises|title=Kegel Exercises {{!}} NIDDK|work=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003975.htm|title=Pelvic floor muscle training exercises: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercises are usually done to reduce [[Stress incontinence|urinary stress incontinence]] (especially after childbirth) and reduce [[premature ejaculation]] in men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Nicastro|first2=A|year=1996|title=A new treatment for premature ejaculation: the rehabilitation of the pelvic floor|journal=Journal of sex &amp; marital therapy|volume=22|issue=1|pages=22–6|doi=10.1080/00926239608405302|pmid=8699493|last1=La Pera|first1=G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Several tools exist to help with these exercises, although various studies debate the relative effectiveness of different tools versus traditional exercises.&lt;ref name="bjui.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjui.org/ContentFullItem.aspx?id=427&amp;LinkTypeID=1&amp;SectionType=4 |title=A randomised controlled trial of the PelvicToner Device in female stress urinary incontinence |publisher=BJUI.org |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were first described in 1948 by American gynecologist [[Arnold Kegel]].

==Health effects==
Factors such as [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], aging, being [[overweight]], and abdominal surgery such as cesarean section, often result in the weakening of the pelvic muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/pelvic-floor|title=Pelvic floor|last=Services|first=Department of Health &amp; Human|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be assessed by either digital examination of vaginal pressure or using a Kegel [[perineometer]]. Kegel exercises are useful in regaining pelvic floor muscle strength in such cases.

===Urinary health===
Pelvic floor exercises (muscle training) can be included in conservative treatment approaches for women with [[urinary incontinence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dumoulin|first=Chantale|last2=Cacciari|first2=Licia P.|last3=Hay-Smith|first3=E.

===Pelvic prolapse===
The symptoms of [[Prolapse#Pelvic floor prolapse|prolapse]] and its severity can be decreased with pelvic floor exercises.&lt;ref name="pmid22161382"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hagen S, Stark D |title=Conservative prevention and management of pelvic organ prolapse in women |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=12 |issue= 12|pages=CD003882 |year=2011 |pmid=22161382 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003882.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-control-problems-women/cystocele-prolapsed-bladder|title=Cystocele (Prolapsed Bladder) {{!}} NIDDK|work=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectiveness can be improved with feedback on how to do the exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herderschee|first1=R|last2=Hay-Smith|first2=EJ|last3=Herbison|first3=GP|last4=Roovers|first4=JP|last5=Heineman|first5=MJ|title=Feedback or biofeedback to augment pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=6 July 2011|issue=7|pages=CD009252|pmid=21735442|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
The aim of Kegel exercises is to improve [[muscle tone]] by strengthening the [[pubococcygeus muscle]]s of the [[pelvic floor]]. Kegel is a popular prescribed exercise for pregnant women to prepare the [[pelvic floor]] for physiological stresses of the later stages of [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]]. Kegel exercises are said to be good for treating [[vaginal prolapse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=September 2, 2011 |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/vaginal_prolapse/article_em.htm |title=Vaginal Prolapse |publisher=eMedicineHealth |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and preventing [[uterine prolapse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001508.htm#Prevention |title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Uterine prolapse |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in women and for treating [[prostate]] pain and swelling resulting from [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH) and [[prostatitis]] in men. Kegel exercises may be beneficial in treating [[urinary incontinence]] in both men and women.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003975.htm|title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Kegel exercises|date=2011-08-29|publisher=Nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kegel exercises may also increase sexual gratification, allowing women to complete [[pompoir]] and aid in reducing [[premature ejaculation]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"/&gt; in men. The many actions performed by Kegel muscles include holding in urine and avoiding defecation. Reproducing this type of muscle action can strengthen the Kegel muscles. The action of slowing or stopping the flow of urine may be used as a test of correct pelvic floor exercise technique.&lt;ref&gt;Kenway, M., and Goh, J. (2009). ''Inside Out: The Essential Women's Guide to Pelvic Support''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is now known that the components of levator ani (the pelvic diaphragm), namely pubococcygeus, puborectalis and ileococcygeus, contract and relax as one muscle. Hence, pelvic floor exercises involve the entire levator ani rather than pubococcygeus alone. Pelvic floor exercises may be of benefit in cases of [[fecal incontinence]] and pelvic organ prolapse conditions e.g. [[rectal prolapse]].&lt;ref name="Bø 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bø|first=K|title=Can pelvic floor muscle training prevent and treat pelvic organ prolapse?|journal=Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand|year=2006|volume=85|issue=3|pages=263–8|pmid=16553172|doi=10.1080/00016340500486800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pelvic toning devices==
[[Image:Kegel exerciser.JPG|thumb|A Kegel exerciser]]
Some devices have been marketed to women exercise their pelvic floor muscle and improve the muscle tone of the pubococcygeal or vaginal muscle.
[[File:Jade Eggs usually come in 3 different sizes.jpg|thumb|250px|Jade eggs (or Yoni eggs) have been marketed for use in vaginal weightlifting.]]
[[File:Ben Wa Balls.jpg|thumb|[[Ben wa balls]]]]

As of 2013 there was no evidence that doing pelvic floor exercise with weights worked better than doing Kegel exercises without weights; there is greater risk with weights, because a foreign object is introduced into the vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbison|first1=GP|last2=Dean|first2=N|title=Weighted vaginal cones for urinary incontinence|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 July 2013|issue=7|pages=CD002114|pmid=23836411|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bjui.org" /&gt;

Inserting foreign objects into the vagina increases the risk of infections and can lead to [[vaginosis]] or [[toxic shock syndrome]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Overuse of such Kegel exercises, with or without a device, can lead to pelvic pain and pain during sex.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/dear-gwyneth-paltrow-im-a-gyn-and-your-vaginal-jade-eggs-are-a-bad-idea/|title=Dear Gwyneth Paltrow, I’m a GYN and your vaginal jade eggs are a bad idea|last=Gunter|first=Jen|date=2017-01-17|website=Dr. Jen Gunter|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
During the latter part of the 20th century, a number of medical and pseudo-medical devices were marketed to consumers as improving sex or orgasms, increasing "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy]]", "balancing hormones", and as having other health or lifestyle benefits. There  is no evidence for any of these claims, and many of them are pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptical"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tuteur |first1=Amy |title=Vaginal weight lifting |url=http://www.skepticalob.com/2008/12/vaginal-weight-lifting.html |work=The Skeptical OB |date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref nam°e=":1"&gt;{{cite news|title=No, Gwyneth Paltrow, women should not put jade eggs in their vaginas, gynecologist says|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/01/22/no-gwyneth-paltrow-women-should-not-put-jade-eggs-in-their-vaginas-gynecologist-says/|accessdate=6 February 2017|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pavel Nedvěd.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pavel Nedvěd]] pictured in 2006 wearing a typical modern football kit]]
In [[association football]], '''kit''' (also referred to as a '''strip''' or '''uniform''') is the standard equipment and attire worn by players. The sport's [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] specify the minimum kit which a player must use, and also prohibit the use of anything that is dangerous to either the player or another participant. Individual competitions may stipulate further restrictions, such as regulating the size of [[logo#Sports|logos]] displayed on shirts and stating that, in the event of a match between teams with identical or similar colours, the away team must change to [[away colours|different coloured attire]].

Footballers generally wear identifying [[Squad number (association football)|numbers]] on the backs of their shirts. Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.

Football kit has evolved significantly since the early days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, [[Knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]] and heavy rigid leather boots. In the twentieth century, boots became lighter and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing manufacture and printing allowed shirts to be made in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available for [[fan (person)|fans]] to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.

== Equipment ==

=== Basic equipment ===
[[File:Schienbeinschützer adidas.png|thumb|upright|Shin pads are compulsory under the Laws of the Game.]]
The Laws of the Game set out the basic equipment which must be worn by all players in Law 4: The Players' Equipment. Five separate items are specified: shirt (also known as a [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]]), shorts, socks (also known as stockings), footwear and [[Shin guard|shin pads]].&lt;ref name="Laws"/&gt;  Goalkeepers are allowed to wear [[tracksuit bottoms]] instead of shorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Interpretation of the laws of the game and guidelines for referees: Law 4 – The Players' Equipment | url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |accessdate=21 December 2014 |publisher=FIFA |format=PDF |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most players wear studded [[football boot#soccer shoe|football boots]] ("soccer shoes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://visual.merriam-webster.com/sports-games/ball-sports/soccer/soccer-player.php |title=soccer player |work=Visual Dictionary Online |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idiots"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Crisfield |first=Deborah |title=The complete idiot's guide to soccer |publisher=[[Alpha Books]] |year=1999 |series=[[The Complete Idiot's Guide to...]] |page=47 |isbn=0-02-862725-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yp-zh8cSxJoC&amp;pg=PA16 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; or "cleats"&lt;ref name="idiots"/&gt; [[North American English|in North America]]), the Laws do not specify that these are required.&lt;ref name="Laws" /&gt; Shirts must have sleeves (both short and long sleeves are accepted), and [[Goalkeeper (football)|goalkeepers]] must wear shirts which are easily distinguishable from all other players and the match officials. Thermal undershorts may be worn, but must be the same colour as the shorts themselves. Shin pads must be covered entirely by the stockings, be made of rubber, plastic or a similar material, and "provide a reasonable degree of protection".&lt;ref name="Laws" /&gt; The only other restriction on equipment defined in the Laws of the Game is the requirement that a player "must not use equipment or wear anything that is dangerous to himself or another player".&lt;ref name="Laws"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/federation/81/42/36/lotg%5fen%5f55753.pdf |title=Laws of the Game 2008/2009 |chapter=Law 4 – The Players' Equipment |accessdate=1 September 2008 |publisher=FIFA |format=PDF |pages=18–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is normal for individual competitions to specify that all outfield players on a team must wear the same colours, though the Law states only "The two teams must wear colours that distinguish them from each other and also the referee and the assistant referees".&lt;ref name="Laws"/&gt; In the event of a match between teams who would normally wear identical or similar colours the away team must change to a different colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wessexleague.co.uk/rules4.htm |title=Standardised League Rules |publisher=Wessex Football League |accessdate=16 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080306052001/http://www.wessexleague.co.uk/rules4.htm |archivedate = 6 March 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this requirement a team's second-choice is often referred to as its [[away colours|"away kit" or "away colours"]], although it is not unknown, especially at international level, for teams to opt to wear their away colours even when not required to by a clash of colours, or to wear them at home. The [[England national football team|England national team]] sometimes plays in red shirts even when it is not required, as this was the strip worn when the team won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamUnif/Unif.html |title=England's Uniforms – Player Kits |publisher=England Football Online |author=Glen Isherwood|accessdate=23 January 2008|quote=England sometimes choose to wear their red at home even though they could wear their white, as against Germany in the last match played at Wembley Stadium. The Football Association wished to invoke the spirit of 1966, when, in their finest moment at Wembley, England beat West Germany in the World Cup final wearing their red shirts. |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases both teams have been forced to wear their second choice away kits; such as the match between Netherlands and Brazil in the [[1974_FIFA_World_Cup#Second_round|1974 FIFA World Cup]] where they wore white and dark blue rather than their first choice of orange and yellow, respectively; and the match between Netherlands and Spain in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group B|2014 FIFA World Cup]] where they wore dark blue and white rather than their home colors of orange and red, respectively. 

Many professional clubs also have a [[Third jersey|"third kit"]], ostensibly to be used if both their first-choice and away colours are deemed too similar to those of an opponent.&lt;ref name="HFK" /&gt; Most professional clubs have retained the same basic colour scheme for several decades,&lt;ref name="HFK" /&gt; and the colours themselves form an integral part of a club's culture.&lt;ref name="Vio"&gt;{{cite book |last=Giulianotti |first=Richard |author2=Norman Bonney |author3=Mike Hepworth  |title=Football, Violence and Social Identity |isbn=0-415-09838-6 |year=1994 |publisher= Routledge |quote=For a supporter, whether or not he lives in the city of the team, the team colours are the most important symbol of his football faith, dominating any other symbol or cultural meaning such as nation, class or political party. |page=75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams representing countries in international competition generally wear [[national colours]] in common with other sporting teams of the same nation. These are usually based on the colours of the country's national flag, although there are exceptions—[[Italy national football team|the Italian national team]], for example, wear blue as it was the colour of the [[House of Savoy]], the Australian team like most Australian sporting teams wear the [[Australian National Colours]] of green and gold, neither of which appear on the flag, and the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] wear orange, the colour of the [[House of Orange|Dutch Royal House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/newscentre/news/newsid=111184.html |title=What's in a name?

The Laws of the Game specify that all players, regardless of gender, must wear the same kit, however in September 2008 the Dutch women's team [[Rakt|FC de Rakt]] made international headlines by swapping its old strip for a new one featuring short skirts and tight-fitting shirts. This innovation, which had been requested by the team itself, was initially vetoed by the [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]], Dutch football's governing body, but this decision was reversed when it was revealed that the FC de Rakt team were wearing hot pants under their skirts, and were therefore technically in compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSLF12710320080915?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=lifestyleMolt&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Dutch women ditch shorts to play soccer in skirts |publisher=Reuters|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Victorian era ===
The first written evidence of a clothing item specifically dedicated to football comes in 1526 from the [[Great Wardrobe]] of King [[Henry VIII of England]], which included a reference to a pair of football boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1150460,00.html|first= Vivek |last=Chaudhary|title=Who's the fat bloke in the number eight shirt?|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=18 February 2004|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest evidence of coloured shirts used to identify football teams comes from early [[English public school football games]], for example an image of [[Winchester College]] football from before 1840 is entitled "The commoners have red and the college boys blue jerseys" and such colours are mentioned again in a ''[[Bell's Life in London]]'' article of 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Football|first=Morris|last=Marples|publisher=Secker and Warburgh|year=1954|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle|location=London, England|date=14 November 1858}}&lt;/ref&gt; House sporting colours are mentioned in [[Rugby football]] (rule XXI) as early as 1845: "No player may wear cap or jersey without leave from the head of his house".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/resources/Rugby%20School%20Laws%201845.pdf|title=Football Rules|publisher=rugbyfootballhistory.com|accessdate=28 April 2009|format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848 it was noted at Rugby that "considerable improvement has taken place in the last few years, in the appearance of a match... in the use of peculiar dress consisting of velvet caps and jerseys"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author="An Old Rugbaean"|title=Recollections of Rugby|publisher=Hamilton and Adams|year= 1848|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organised association football was first played in England in the 1860s, and many teams would probably play in whatever clothing they had available, with players of the same team distinguishing themselves by wearing coloured caps or sashes.&lt;ref name="HFK" /&gt; This came to be problematic though, and an 1867 handbook of the game suggested that teams should attempt "if it can be previously so arranged, to have one side with striped jerseys of one colour, say red, and the other with another, say blue. This prevents confusion and wild attempts to wrest the ball from your neighbour."&lt;ref name="Davies48"&gt;{{cite book

As the game gradually moved away from being a pursuit for wealthy amateurs to one dominated by working-class professionals, kits changed accordingly. The clubs themselves, rather than individual players, were now responsible for purchasing kit and financial concerns, along with the need for the growing numbers of spectators to easily identify the players, led to the lurid colours of earlier years being abandoned in favour of simple combinations of primary colours. In 1890 [[the Football League]], which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, so as to avoid clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available.&lt;ref name="HFK" /&gt; Initially the home team was required to change colours in the event of a clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.&lt;ref name="Enc2"&gt;{{cite book

Specialised football boots began to emerge in the professional era, taking the place of everyday shoes or work boots. Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading [[the Football Association]] to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. Boots of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard toecaps, and came high above a player's ankles.&lt;ref name="Davies55"&gt;{{cite book

=== Early 20th century ===
As the game began to spread to Europe and beyond, clubs adopted kits similar to those worn in the United Kingdom, and in some cases chose colours directly inspired by British clubs. In 1903, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] of Italy adopted a black and white strip inspired by [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottscountyfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HistoryDetail/0,,10426~1028229,00.html |publisher=Notts County F.C |title=Black &amp; White |date=21 May 2007 |accessdate=15 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907140416/http://www.nottscountyfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HistoryDetail/0%2C%2C10426~1028229%2C00.html |archivedate= 7 September 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, [[Argentina]]'s [[Club Atlético Independiente]] adopted red shirts after watching [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caindependiente.com/cms/historia.php?id=149|publisher=Club Atlético Independiente|title=Década del '10|accessdate=15 January 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080306141848/http://www.caindependiente.com/cms/historia.php?id=149 |archivedate = 6 March 2008|deadurl=yes|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Internazionale1910Scudetto.jpg|thumb|By the early 20th century, shorts had become shorter and goalkeepers wore shirts of a different colour, as seen in this photograph of [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] in 1910.]]
In 1904 [[the Football Association]] dropped its rule that players' knickerbockers must cover their knees and teams began wearing them much shorter. They became known as "knickers", and were referred to by this term until the 1960s when "shorts" became the preferred term.&lt;ref name="Davies51"&gt;{{cite book

Equipment: Bring on the Balls  | page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, almost all teams wore knickers of a contrasting colour to their shirts.&lt;ref name="HFK" /&gt; In 1909, in a bid to assist referees in identifying the goalkeeper amongst a ruck of players, the Laws of the Game were amended to state that the goalkeeper must wear a shirt of a different colour to his team-mates. Initially it was specified that goalkeepers' shirts must be either scarlet or royal blue, but when green was added as a third option in 1912 it caught on to the extent that soon almost every goalkeeper was playing in green. In this period goalkeepers generally wore a heavy woollen garment more akin to a [[Sweater|jumper]] than the shirts worn by outfield players.&lt;ref name="Davies51" /&gt;

Sporadic experiments with numbered shirts took place in the 1920s but the idea did not initially catch on.&lt;ref name="Davies156"&gt;{{cite book

The Everton players wore numbers 1–11, while the City players wore 12–22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/1930-1939.html|title=English FA Cup Finalists 1930–1939 |publisher=HistoricalFootballKits.co.uk|accessdate=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until around the time of the Second World War that numbering became standard, with teams wearing numbers 1–11. Although there were no regulations on which player should wear which number, specific numbers came to be associated with specific positions on the field of play, a prime example being the number 9 shirt which was usually reserved for the team's main [[Striker (association football)|striker]].&lt;ref name="Davies156" /&gt; In contrast to the usual practice, Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] wore numbers on their shorts rather than their shirts until 1975 for international matches, and until 1994 for domestic matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Celtic/Celtic.htm|title=Celtic|publisher=HistoricalFootballKits.co.uk|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1930s also saw great advancements in boot manufacture, with new synthetic materials and softer leathers becoming available. By 1936 players in Europe were wearing boots which weighed only a third of the weight of the rigid boots of a decade earlier, although British clubs did not adopt the new-style boots, with players such as [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]] openly pronouncing their disdain for the new footwear and claiming that it was more suited to ballet than football.&lt;ref name="Davies154"&gt;{{cite book

In the period immediately after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions.&lt;ref name="HFK" /&gt; England's [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing in red and white shirts borrowed from a local [[rugby league]] club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Oldham_Athletic/Oldham_Athletic.htm|title=Oldham Athletic

 |publisher=HistoricalKits.co.uk|accessdate=17 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with V-necks replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy natural fibres.&lt;ref name="Enc" /&gt; The first boots to be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by [[Adidas]] in 1954. Although they cost twice as much as existing styles the boots were a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with screw-in studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions.&lt;ref name="Sci" /&gt; Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war,&lt;ref name="Enc"&gt;{{cite book

The [[FC Dynamo Moscow]] team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew almost as much comment for the players' long baggy shorts as for the quality of their football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/1602679.stm|title=An historic day in Glasgow

The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which looked good under the newly adopted floodlights.&lt;ref name="HFK" /&gt; Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article2537973.ece|title=The top 50 football kits |work=The Times |location=UK|accessdate=17 January 2008|date=26 September 2007|author=Nick Szczepanik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern era ===
[[File:Maillots du PSG.png|thumb|Sponsored shirts, such as these worn in various seasons by [[Paris St Germain]], became the norm in the modern era.]]

In the 1970s clubs began to create strongly individual strips, and in 1975 [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], who had changed their traditional blue and gold colours to all white in the 1960s to mimic [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]],&lt;ref name="Morbo"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ball |first=Phil |title=Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football |isbn=0-9540134-6-8 |year=2003 |publisher=WSC Books Ltd|quote=Indeed, when Don Revie took over at Leeds in the early 1960s he changed their kit from blue and gold to all white, modelling his new charges on the Spanish giants. |page=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; became the first club to design shirts which could be sold to [[fan (person)|fans]] in the form of [[throwback uniform|replicas]]. Driven by commercial concerns, other clubs soon followed suit, adding manufacturers' [[logo#Sports|logos]] and a higher level of trim.&lt;ref name="HFK" /&gt; In 1973, German team [[Eintracht Braunschweig]] signed a deal with local alcohol producer [[Jägermeister]] to display its logo on the front of their shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=579804&amp;&amp;cc=5739|publisher=ESPN|title=The struggle for shirt sponsorship|accessdate=28 April 2009|date=7 October 2008|first=Uli|last=Hesse-Lichtenberger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon almost all major clubs had signed such deals, and the cost to companies who sponsor large teams has increased dramatically. In 2008 German club [[FC Bayern Munich]] received €25 million in sponsorship money from [[Deutsche Telekom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/media_fast/626/BULI0809.pdf|publisher=Stuttgarter Zeitung|title=Bundesliga 2008/2009 – Clubs, Vermarkter, Sponsoren|format=PDF|accessdate=10 May 2009|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419132355/http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/media_fast/626/BULI0809.pdf|archivedate=19 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Spanish clubs [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Athletic Bilbao]] refused to allow sponsors' logos to appear on their shirts as recently as 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4521573.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Barcelona eyes Beijing shirt deal |accessdate=24 January 2008|date=6 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2011 Barcelona refused paying sponsors in favour of wearing the [[UNICEF]] logo on their shirts while donating €1.5 million to the charity per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_35642.html|publisher=UNICEF|title=Futbol Club Barcelona, UNICEF team up for children in global partnership|accessdate=26 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players also began to sign sponsorship deals with individual companies. In 1974 [[Johan Cruijff]] refused to wear the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team's]] strip as its [[Adidas]] branding conflicted with his own individual contract with [[Puma AG|Puma]], and was permitted to wear a version without the Adidas branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalonline.co.uk/article/1001918.aspx|work=The Journal|title=Don't mention the boot war|author=Bruce Caldow |accessdate=24 January 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080306034629/http://www.journalonline.co.uk/article/1001918.aspx |archivedate = 6 March 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puma had also paid [[Pelé]] $120,000 to wear their boots and specifically requested that he bend down and tie his laces at the start of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] final, ensuring a close-up of the boots for a worldwide television audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/sports/2005/nov/08adi.htm|work=The Journal|title=How Adidas and Puma were born|author=Erik Kirschbaum |accessdate=24 January 2008|date=8 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s manufacturers such as [[hummel International|Hummel]] and [[Adidas]] began to design shirts with increasingly intricate designs, as new technology led to the introduction of such design elements as shadow prints and pinstripes.&lt;ref name="HFK" /&gt; Hummel's distinctive halved strip designed for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]] for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] caused a stir in the media but [[FIFA]] worried about [[moiré pattern|moiré artefacts]] in television pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hummel.dk/Company/About/Milestones/1981-1990/1986.aspx|publisher=hummel International|title=Milestones: 1986|accessdate=16 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121203913/http://www.hummel.dk/Company/About/Milestones/1981-1990/1986.aspx &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=21 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shorts became shorter than ever during the 1970s and 1980s,&lt;ref name="Davies156" /&gt; and often included the player's number on the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamInteractive/Features/FeatAdmiral.html|title=Admiral Mysteries|publisher=England Football Online|first=Glen|last=Isherwood|date=6 June 2005|accessdate=28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1991 FA Cup Final]] [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur's]] players lined up in long baggy shorts. Although, the new look was derided, clubs in Britain and elsewhere had within a short time adopted the longer shorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/1990-1999.html|title=English FA Cup Finalists 1990–1999 |publisher=HistoricalFootballKits.co.uk|accessdate=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s shirt designs became increasingly complex, with many teams sporting extremely gaudy colour schemes. Design decisions were increasingly driven by the need for the shirt to look good when worn by fans as a fashion item,&lt;ref name="HFK" /&gt; but many designs from this era have since come to be regarded as amongst the worst of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2984863.stm|title=The worst football kits of all time|author=Tom Fordyce |publisher=BBC|date=29 April 2003|accessdate=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] notoriously introduced a grey strip which had been specifically designed to look good when worn with jeans, but abandoned it halfway through a match after manager [[Alex Ferguson]] claimed that the reason why his team was losing 3–0 was that the players could not see each other on the pitch. United switched to different colours for the second half and scored one goal without reply.&lt;ref name="ESPN" /&gt; The leading leagues also introduced squad numbers, whereby each player is allocated a specific number for the duration of a season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/theknowledge/story/0,,1865353,00.html|title=What's in a number?

This led to a ruling from the [[International Football Association Board]] in 2002 that undershirts must not contain slogans or logos;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2251338.stm|title=Henry gets the message
 |publisher=BBC|date=11 September 2002|author=Stuart Roach |accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 2004 it has been a bookable offence for players to remove their shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3509153.stm|title=Fifa limits substitutions |publisher=BBC|date=28 February 2004|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ManUKits.jpg|thumb|Manchester United replica strips on display.]]

The market for replica shirts has grown enormously, with the revenue generated for leading clubs and the frequency with which they change designs coming under increased scrutiny, especially in the United Kingdom, where the market for replicas is worth in excess of £200m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/your_money/413598.stm|title=Clubs rapped over kit sales |publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 January 2008|date=6 August 1999|quote=The cost of replica kit – and the number of times new versions come on the market – has long been a bone of contention for football fans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several clubs have been accused of [[price fixing]], and in 2003 [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] were fined £1.65m by the [[Office of Fair Trading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3116353.stm|title=Man Utd fined for price fixing|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 January 2008|date=1 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high prices charged for replicas have also led to many fans buying [[Counterfeit_consumer_goods#Apparel_and_accessories|fake shirts]] which are imported from countries such as [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4768454.stm|title=The Fake Football Shirt Sting |publisher=BBC|author=Darragh MacIntyre |accessdate=14 January 2008|date=3 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The chance for fans to purchase a shirt bearing the name and number of a star player can lead to significant revenue for a club. In the first six months after [[David Beckham]]'s transfer to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] the club sold more than one million shirts bearing his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/footballNews/idUKL1289419220070712|title=Beckham sells 250,000 Galaxy shirts before he gets to LA |publisher=Reuters UK|accessdate=14 January 2008|date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A market has also developed for shirts worn by players during significant matches, which are sold as collector's items. The shirt worn by [[Pelé]] in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] Final sold at auction for over £150,000 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1896673.stm|title=Record price for Pele's shirt|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 January 2008|date=22 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of advances in kit design have taken place since 2000, with varying degrees of success. In 2002 the [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon national team]] competed in the [[African Cup of Nations]] in Mali wearing shirts with no sleeves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/cup_of_nations/1775234.stm|title=Indomitable fashions
 |publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 January 2008|date=22 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[FIFA]] later ruled that such garments were not considered to be shirts and therefore were not permitted under the Laws of the Game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/1862872.stm|title=Fifa bans Cameroon shirts
 |publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 January 2008|date=9 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers [[Puma AG]] initially added "invisible" black sleeves to comply with the ruling, but later supplied the team with new one-piece [[sleeveless shirt|singlet]]-style tops.&lt;ref name="ESPN" /&gt; FIFA ordered the team not to wear the tops but the ruling was disregarded, with the result that the Cameroon team was docked six points in its qualifying campaign for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/04/17/1089385.htm|title=Cameroon docked six World Cup points for controversial kit|publisher=ABC News Australia|date=17 April 2004|accessdate=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a decision later reversed after an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/3735765.stm|title=Fifa lifts Cameroon sanction

|date=21 May 2004|accessdate=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More successful were the skin-tight shirts designed for the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]] by manufacturers [[Kappa (company)|Kappa]], a style subsequently emulated by other national teams and club sides.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=336980&amp;root=extratime&amp;cc=5739|title=10 of the worst...football kits

A brief fashion for men wearing [[Snood (headgear)|snood-scarf]] neckwarmers ended in 2011 when the IFAB banned them as potentially dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/04/fears-snoods-fifa-safety-concerns|title=Fears for snoods' future after Fifa raises safety concerns|last=Press Association|date=4 February 2011|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 July 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Agencies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/05/snoods-banned-fifa-goalline-technology |title=Snoods banned but Fifa to continue goalline technology testing |work=The Guardian |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ban on women wearing the [[hijab]] was introduced by the IFAB in 2007, but lifted in 2012 after pressure from [[Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein|Prince Ali of Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2012/07/05/fifa-lifts-hijab-ban.html|title=Hijabs approved for soccer players by FIFA|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/story/_/id/8132532/fifa-oks-islamic-hijab-women|title=FIFA OKs Islamic hijab for women – ESPN|author=Associated Press|date=5 July 2012|work=ESPN|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with [[Islamic scarf controversy in France|French views]], the [[French Football Federation]] said it would maintain its ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/07/06/france-soccer-federation-outlaws-hijab-despite-fifa-ruling/|title=France soccer federation outlaws hijab, despite FIFA ruling|author=Agence France-Presse|date=6 July 2012|work=National Post|accessdate=6 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130129160606/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/07/06/france-soccer-federation-outlaws-hijab-despite-fifa-ruling/|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Life-Be_In_It.gif|right|Life. Be In it.]]

'''Life. Be in it.''' started as an [[Australian]] government program and [[advertising]] campaign encouraging people to be more active and participate in recreational sports or other physical activities.

The program began in 1975 with the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian state government]], the brainchild of [[Brian Dixon]], former [[Australian rules football]]er and then Minister for Youth, Sport and Recreation.  One of their early programs was to bring over [[Pat Farrington]], a co-founder of the [[New Games]], supplying her with five vans and 25 volunteers to drive around rural townships in Victoria, teaching people how to play games ([[New Games Book]]: p22)

In 1977 the federal government expanded the program nationally. The campaign also aired in the United States on local television stations during the 1970s and 1980s.

The [[Television commercial|television advertisements]] for the program are cartoons featuring people doing a wide range of activities, with a catchy tune "Be in it today, live more of your life".  The main character is Norm, a middle aged man with a prominent [[beer belly]], meant to represent a "normal" Australian [[bloke]].  The idea for Norm and the advertising came from [[Phillip Adams]] and [[Alex Stitt]]; Stitt drew all the cartoons. In the original run of television advertisements, Norm was voiced by [[Max Gillies]]. In the 2000 revival, the voice was provided by Dr Colin Benjamin.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

The campaign was an enormous success in terms of recognition, by 1979 about 83% and by 1982 about 94%.  Recognition remains high at 85%.{{Dubious|date=January 2018}}{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

Federal funding ended in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifebeinit.org/standard.php?id%3D879 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224094218/http://www.lifebeinit.org/standard.php?id=879 |archivedate=2011-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; redirected towards elite programs. The program became an Australia company, and continued for a time working with other groups like the [[National Heart Foundation of Australia]], before going into hibernation. The  brand is now under the custodianship of Life. Be in it. International Pty Ltd and is managed in each state by associations or companies. Some are given government grants to run specific programs but none are government programs.

The program continues to be active throughout Australia and continues to involve Australians in activities in every State and Territory. Programs include Life Games, Corporate Cup, Walking activities etc. and in South Australia and Victoria, the 'Life. Be in it' Sport for All Centres provide indoor social sporting competitions for children and adults. {{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}The original concept of 'Life, be in it' was created by Dr John Cooper and Oscar Scherl and was presented to Adam's Packer (Melbourne Advertising Agency) in the early 1970's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Adams|first=Paul C.|title=Place and Extended Agency|date=2017-03-30|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190457204.003.0022|work=Distributed Agency|pages=213–220|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190457204|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original theme music for the campaign was created by [[Peter Best (composer)|Peter Best]].{{ref|http://www.dhub.org/object/12019,fame}}

{{Main|Running}}
[[File:100m women Golden League 2007 in Zurich.jpg|thumb|The finish of a women's 100&amp;nbsp;m race]]
Running is defined in [[sport]]ing terms as a [[gait]] in which at some point all feet are off the ground at the same time. This is in contrast to [[walking]], where one foot is always in contact with the ground. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from [[jogging]] to [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]]. Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas.  The [[Ancient_Olympic_Games#Origins|origins of the Olympics]] are shrouded in myth, though the first recorded game took place in 776 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgkzWTugSj0C&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=first+recorded+victor+of+the+stade-race+in+776&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1MYlTNDBDJCNOO3WrPAC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20recorded%20victor%20of%20the%20stade-race%20in%20776&amp;f=false |title=The Ancient Olympics - Google Books |publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=2010-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gaelic Ireland]] the [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]], which featured footraces, are attested from the 6th century CE; medieval chroniclers gave founding dates as early as 1829 BCE.

This is a '''list of [[clichés]]''' related to '''sports'''

==Clichés==
===Sports clichés used in business===

According to Don R. Powell, licensed psychologist and president of the American Institute for Preventive Medicine, sports clichés are used in about 50 percent of corporate boardrooms. They provide a [[shorthand]] to quickly communicate ideas. According to Powell, "We have a love/hate relationship with cliches. Although we complain about them, we are enamored with them. That's because they always seem to fit."&lt;ref name="KUSI"/&gt;

* "It was a slam dunk."
* "It's gut-check time."&lt;ref name="KUSI"/&gt;
* "Keep your eye on the ball."&lt;ref name =fd&gt;{{cite web|title=keep your eye on the ball|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/keep+eye+on+the+ball|work=keep eye on the ball|publisher=Farlex|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Gretchen|title=Keeping Your Eye on the Ball|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/28/keeping-your-eye-on-the-ball/|accessdate=26 December 2012|newspaper=NY Times|date=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Monday-Morning Quarterback"
* "That was a hole in one."
* "They don't pull any punches."&lt;ref name="KUSI"/&gt;
* "They dropped the ball."&lt;ref name="KUSI"/&gt;
* "They always step up to the plate."&lt;ref name="KUSI"/&gt;
* "They talk a good game."&lt;ref name="KUSI"/&gt;
* "They're a team player."&lt;ref name="KUSI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kusi.com/business/5418346.html |title=Sports Cliches Go from Locker Room to Boardroom |accessdate=2007-03-14 |publisher=KUSI News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927065504/http://www.kusi.com/business/5418346.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "They're in a league of their own."&lt;ref name="KUSI"/&gt;
* "They want to play hardball."&lt;ref name="KUSI"/&gt;
* "The ball's in your court."&lt;ref name="KUSI"/&gt;
* "They answered the bell."&lt;ref name="KUSI"/&gt;
* "We knocked it out of the park."
* "Take one for the team"
* "Offense sells tickets, defense wins championships"

===Sports clichés used in sports announcing===
* "A [[2–0 lead is the worst lead]]"
* "Alligator arms"&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/mccarthy/2006-12-21-mccarthy-cliches_x.htm |title=Sportscasters: Ditch the cliches |accessdate=2007-03-14 |publisher=USA Today | date=2006-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "They have to have a great game for their team to win."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;
* "They have to get on the same page."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;
* "The media are blowing this out of proportion."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;
* "That will come back to haunt them."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;
* "I'd like to thank my Lord and savior."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;
* "Throw under the bus."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;
* "D-Line or O-Line."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;
* "A lot of open looks at the basket."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;
* "It doesn't get any better than this."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;
* "He's a warrior."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;
* "Defense wins championships."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;
* "[[The best defense is a good offense]]."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;
* "Midfield maestro" is a term used in [[association football]] to describe a [[midfield]] player who excels in the technical and creative aspects of midfield play and who often create goalscoring opportunities for the attackers, while at the same time controlling the tempo of the match and raising the game of the other members of the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Bellwood |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1217443/THE-LIST-Footballs-best-midfield-maestros--The-10.html |title=THE LIST: Football's best midfield maestros - The top 10 &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Charity Stripe"
* "Goals are not deserved, goals are made"
* "On any given Sunday . . ."
* "Play one game at a time"
* "There is no 'I' in 'team'"
* "There ain't no 'U' either'" - as a retort to "There is no 'I' in 'team'"

===Sports film clichés===
* A down and out coach is offered one last shot.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14468942/page/2/ |title=The enduring, lovable sports-film clichés |accessdate=2007-03-14 |publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The coach can't get along with his star player.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;
* Someone doubts the protagonist's abilities, and is made to believe in them.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;
* The players overcome race relations or gang violence, and are brought together by being a team.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;
* The opposing team is larger, better dressed, better equipped yet end up defeated by the protagonist's team.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;
* A death or injury provides the main character with the extra incentive to win.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;
* The main character is considered too old to win, yet does.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;
* An emotional speech inspires the protagonists.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;
* Near the end of the movie it will seem that the protagonist's team has no chance of winning, but they quickly bounce back with little time left.
*The protagonist's team makes a valiant comeback effort only to fall just short at the last second (Puck hits the post, shot rims out, etc.).  This is immediately followed by a dramatic montage with tear soaked hugs of players and coaches who are genuinely better off for the experience.
*After a supreme achievement on the sports field/court/diamond, the achiever will, for no apparent reason, extend his arm and use his forefinger to point, for an extended period of time, to a team-mate, coach or even someone in the crowd.  In many cases, the person being pointed to will, inexplicably, return the gesture.

==Criticism==

According to Michael McCarthy, a ''[[USA Today]]'' sports television writer, sports announcers overuse clichés during their broadcasts.&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt; Sports critic Bill Mayo disagrees, saying that sports clichés are used "just the right amount," and "it is what it is."

Former [[New York Giants]] [[quarterback]]-turned [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] broadcaster [[Phil Simms]] devotes a large portion of his 2004 book ''Sunday Morning Quarterback'' to examining football clichés such as "winning the turnover battle", "halftime adjustments", and "managing the game."

[[File:Melbourne Geelong Football.jpg|thumb|250px|An 1881 [[Australian rules football]] match between [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] and [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]. Both clubs were founded in 1859 and currently compete in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), making them the world's oldest football clubs that are now professional.]]

The history of the formation of the '''oldest football clubs''' is of interest to sport historians in tracing the origins of the modern codes of [[football]] from casual pastime to [[oldest football competitions|early organised competition]] and mainstream sport. The identity of the first or oldest football clubs in the world, or even in a particular country, is often disputed or claimed by several clubs, across several codes of football.

Late{{what|date=August 2018}} [[rugby football|rugby]] clubs also referred to themselves, or continue to refer to themselves, as simply a "football club", or as a "rugby football club". "[[Sports club|Club]]" has always meant an independent entity and, during the historical period in question, very few [[high school]] or university ''teams'' were independent of the educational institutions concerned. Consequently, school and university football teams were seldom referred to as "clubs". That has always been the case, for example, in [[American football]], which has always had ties to [[college sport]] in general. Conversely, however, the ''oldest'' still-existing "football club" with a well-documented, continuous history is [[Dublin University Football Club]], a rugby union club founded in 1854 at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], [[Ireland (country of the United Kingdom)|Ireland]], although there exists some record of [[Guy's Hospital Football Club]] being founded in 1843.

While the first clubs emerged in Britain, possibly, as early as the fifteenth century, these are poorly-documented and defunct. For example, the records of the Brewers' Company of London between 1421 and 1423 mention the hiring out of their hall "by the "football players" for "20 pence", under the heading "Trades and Fraternities".&lt;ref&gt;Magoun, Francis Peabody (1929) "Football in Medieval England and Middle-English Literature." ''The American Historical Review'', v.35, no. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The listing of football players as a "fraternity" or a group of players meeting socially under this identity is the earliest allusion to what might be considered a football club.&lt;ref&gt;M. Marples, 1954, ''A History of Football'', Secker &amp; Warburg, London, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Other early sporting bodies dedicated to playing football include "[[The Gymnastic Society]]" of London which met ''regularly'' during the second half of the eighteenth century to pursue two sports:  football and [[wrestling]]&lt;ref&gt;Football The First Hundred Years: The Untold Story by Adrian Harvey, Routledge 2005, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;  The club played its matches – for example between London-based natives of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]] – at the [[Kennington]] Common from well before 1789 until about 1800.

The [[Foot-Ball Club (Edinburgh)|Foot-Ball Club]] (active 1824–41) of [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, is the first documented club dedicated to football, and the first to describe itself as a football club.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope, ''Accounts and papers of the football club kept by John Hope, WS, and some Hope Correspondence 1787–1886'' (National Archives of Scotland, GD253/183)&lt;/ref&gt; The only surviving club rules forbade tripping, but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/071112.asp The Foot-Ball Club in Edinburgh, 1824–1841 – The National Archives of Scotland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other documents describe a game involving 39 players and "such kicking of shins and such tumbling".
{{wikisource|Rules of Surrey Football Club (1849)}}
Other early clubs include the Great Leicestershire Cricket and Football Club present in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Football The First Hundred Years: The Untold Story by Adrian Harvey, Routledge 2005, page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas Day 1841, an early documented match between two self-described "football clubs" took place.  The Body-guard Club (of Rochdale) lost to the Fear-nought Club after using an ineligible player as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;Football The First Hundred Years: The Untold Story by Adrian Harvey, Routledge 2005, page 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roch1&gt;{{cite journal |work=Bell's Life in London |date=1841-12-12 |page=4 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bodyguard_vs_Fearnoughts_1841.png |title=Foot-ball}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roch2&gt;{{cite journal |work=Bell's Life in London |date=1842-01-02 |page=4 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bodyguard_vs_Fearnoughts_Report_1842.png |title=Foot-ball}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete rules used in this game are unknown, but they specified twelve players on each side,&lt;ref name=roch1/&gt; with each team providing its own umpire, and the game being started by the firing of a pistol.&lt;ref name=roch2/&gt;

A club for playing "cricket, quoits and football" was established in [[Newcastle on Tyne]] in or before 1848.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 June 1848.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Surrey Football Club was established in 1849 and published the first non-school football list of rules (which were probably based upon the eighteenth century Gymnastic Society cited above&lt;ref&gt;''Football The First Hundred Years: The Untold Story by Adrian Harvey'', Routledge (2005), pages 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Windsor Home Park F.C.]] was in existence as early as 1854,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Windsor and Eton Express |date=1854-10-07 |page=1 |title=W. Runicles: Carver, Gilder and Picture Frame Maker [advertisement]}}. A newspaper advertisement for W. Runicles, of Eton High Street, boasts of patronage by "H.R.H. The Prince of Wales, the Young Gentlemen of Eton College, and the Members of the Home Park Football Club".&lt;/ref&gt; and would go on to compete in early editions of the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fchd|id=WINDSOHP|name=Windsor Home Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuous clubs===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Firstfootballgame.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Drawing from the [[1869 college football season|first football game played]] between Rutgers and Princeton.]] --&gt;
[[Cambridge University A.F.C.|Cambridge University Association Football Club]] has been described by the university as the oldest club now playing [[association football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/newsletter/2006/2006newsletter_july_august.pdf |title=Cambridge University Newsletter July/August 2006 |date=July 2006 |page=4 |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbccambridge&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cambridgeshire/content/articles/2006/06/09/cambridge_football_rules_parkers_piece_feature.shtml |publisher=BBC Cambridgeshire |title=Cambridge... the birthplace of football?! |date=13 June 2006 |accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, : "[[Shrewsbury School|Salopians]] formed a club of their own in the late 1830s/early 1840s but that was presumably absorbed by the Cambridge University Football Club that they were so influential in creating in 1846".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adrian |last=Harvey |title=Football: The first hundred years |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Charles Astor Bristed]], in the early 1840s at Cambridge, there were games played between clubs from colleges and houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles Astor |last=Bristed |year=1852 |title=Five Years in an English University |page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge rules dates from 1848 and football is documented as being played on the original club ground, [[Parkers Piece]], as early as 1838.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuafc.org/Pages/History.html History of the Cambridge University AFC on official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811080448/http://www.cuafc.org/Pages/History.html |date=11 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest existing evidence of the Cambridge University Football Club comes from "[[Cambridge rules|The Laws of the University Football Club]]" dated 1856, and held at Shrewsbury School.&lt;ref name=bbccambridge/&gt;

It has been claimed that the present-day [[Barnes Rugby Football Club]], from [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] in London, is a continuation of the nineteenth-century [[Barnes Football Club]], and moreover that the latter club was formed in 1839 and is thus the oldest club to have played football for its entire history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/sport/2005/11/02/srinve02.xml | title=My assumptions about 'oldest' were confounded by Barnes | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London | first=John | last=Inverdale | date=2 November 2005 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2018, Barnes RFC's website claims only that the club was established in the 1920s, while alluding to "possibilities" that its history stretches back to 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Barnes RFC History |url=http://www.barnesrfc.org/a/barnes-rfc-history-28772.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence it is argued, and supported by the ''Guinness Book of Records'', that [[Guy's Hospital Football Club]], founded by staff at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London in 1843, is the oldest club. While a rugby club still exists at Guy's Hospital, the connection between the present club and the one formed in 1843 is still disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gktgazette.com/2004/mar/features.asp#2 | title=GKT Gazette – March 2004 – A history of rugby | publisher=Guy's, King's &amp; St.Thomas's Hospitals Medical &amp; Dental Schools Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest football club with the best-documented, continuous history is the [[Dublin University Football Club]], founded in 1854 at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Ireland. The club plays [[rugby union]].

[[Sheffield F.C.]] in [[Sheffield, England]], is the world's oldest surviving ''independent'' football club – that is, the oldest club not associated with an institution such as a school, hospital or university. It was founded in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottscountyfc.co.uk/club/history/ "Club history" on Notts County official site]&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield F.C. initially played [[Sheffield rules]], a code of its own devising, although the club's rules influenced those of the England [[The Football Association|Football Association]] (FA (1863) including handball, free kicks, corners and throw ins. While the international governing body of association football, [[FIFA]] and the FA recognise [[Sheffield F.C.]] as the "world's oldest football club",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=621801.html "Sheffield FC: 150 years of history"] at [[FIFA]], 24 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the club joined the FA in 1863, it continued to use the Sheffield rules.

[[Liverpool St Helens F.C.|Liverpool Football Club]] (not to be confused with [[Liverpool F.C.]] of the Premier League), later known as Liverpool St Helens F.C. were formed in 1857, which claims to be the oldest open rugby club in the world.  The club adopted the Rugby Union rules in 1872, never playing association rules.

==Rest of the world==
===Australia===
In 1858 in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], members of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] formed a loosely organised football team, and played against other local football enthusiasts over the winter and spring of that year. The [[Melbourne Football Club]] was officially founded the following year on 17 May, and three days later, four members codified the first laws of [[Australian rules football]]. The [[Geelong Football Club]] was formed shortly afterwards, and over the next decade, many more Australian rules football clubs were formed in Victoria. Melbourne and Geelong were founding members of the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), making them the world's oldest football clubs that are now professional.

===South America===
[[Lima Cricket and Football Club]] claims to be the oldest football-practicing club in Peru and the Americas, having been founded in 1859 by the city's British community.{{sfn|Higgins|2005|p=130}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eli Schmerler and Carlos Manuel Nieto Tarazona |title=Peru - Foundation Dates of Clubs |publisher=RSSSF |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/perufound.html |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club]] claims to be the oldest club still in existence in Argentina. According to the club's website, the club was founded before 8 December 1864 as a [[cricket]] institution.&lt;ref name=bacrc&gt;[http://www.bacrc.com/historia.php "Historia del Club" at BACRC official website]&lt;/ref&gt; The date of foundation has been recognized by the Buenos Aires Rugby Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urba.org.ar/clubes/guia-de-clubes/club/19/BUENOS-AIRES-CRICKET-&amp;-RUGBY-CLUB/ Buenos Aires CRC on "Guía de Clubes", URBA website]&lt;/ref&gt; It is however believed that the club was founded in 1831, with existing documentary evidence about a [[cricket]] match played by Buenos Aires that same year.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia de Fútbol de AFA: Orígenes 1891/1899'', by Carlos Yametti.

[[Club Atlético del Rosario]] was officially established in 1867 as a [[cricket]] institution. The club soon added association football, being the first club from [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] playing in the [[Argentine Primera División|Primera División]], the top division of Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historiayfutbol.obolog.com/argentina-1ra-division-1894-161838 "Argentina: Primera División 1894" at Historia y Futbol]&lt;/ref&gt; In rugby union, Rosario AC played the first inter-clubs match in the country on 28 June 1886, when the team faced [[Buenos Aires Football Club (1886)|Buenos Aires Football Club]].&lt;ref name=cihf&gt;[http://www.cihf.org.ar/trabajos/RosarioAthleticcampeon.pdf "Cuando el Rosario Athletic salió campeón... de fútbol", CIHF Argentina] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234042/http://www.cihf.org.ar/trabajos/RosarioAthleticcampeon.pdf |date=18 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacrc.com/historia.php "Historia del Club", Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[São Paulo Athletic Club]] was founded on 13 May 1888 by English immigrants, and was the first football club in Brazil. Although association football is not practised anymore, SPAC still hosts rugby union.

[[Santiago Wanderers]] was founded on 15 August 1892 by Irish community and was the first football club in Chile.

===North America===
Although football variants have been played in [[North America]] since the 1820s, the claim of oldest continuous football club in North America is still a matter of debate. 

In terms of [[gridiron football]] the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] can trace their roots back to the [[Hamilton Tigers (football)|Hamilton Football Club]] (nicknamed the "Tigers") which formed in 1869, then later merged with the [[Hamilton Wildcats (Canadian football)|Hamilton Wildcats]] in 1950 to form the current franchise. Their rivals to the north, the [[Toronto Argonauts]], were founded four years later in 1873 and have a mostly unchanged franchise history. Both clubs began as [[rugby football]] clubs and only later adapted to the [[gridiron football|gridiron-style]] of play which would become known as [[Canadian football]]. The oldest continuous rugby club in North America which still plays rugby is the [[McGill University]] Rugby Football Club which was established in 1863, although their first recorded game was not until 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcgillrfc.com/Team/history.html "Team history" on McGill RFC website]&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest independent (non-university) rugby club is the [[Westmount Rugby Club]] of [[Montreal]], which formed in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;[http://westmountrugby.com/newsnouvelles/history-histoire/ History of Westmount RC]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, [[Rutgers University]] and [[Princeton University]] competed in the [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|first intercollegiate football game]]. According to [[U.S. Soccer]], the rules of this game resembled rugby and association football more closely than gridiron football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Soccer Timeline |url=https://www.ussoccer.com/about/history/timeline |website=www.ussoccer.com |publisher=[[United States Soccer Federation]] |accessdate=23 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clubs evolved into the [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers Scarlet Knights]] and [[Princeton Tigers football]] teams which have existed continuously since then.

In the United States, gridiron-based variants of the game did not distinguish themselves from existing codes until 1871, when [[Harvard University]] began playing a variation known as the "Boston Game." This allowed a player to pick up the ball and run with it if he were chased and it quickly spread, with innovations added by [[Yale University]] student [[Walter Camp]]. The oldest existing non-university semiprofessional football club is the [[Watertown Red &amp; Black]], which was founded in 1896. The [[Arizona Cardinals]], formed in [[Chicago]] in 1898, are the oldest team in the [[National Football League]].

===Continental Europe===
The first football club in France was established in Paris in 1863 by English expatriates, as the following excerpt from a contemporary newspaper shows: "A number of English gentlemen living in Paris have lately organised a football club.... The football contests take place in the Bois de Boulogne, by permission of the authorities and surprise the French amazingly."&lt;ref&gt;''The Scotsman Newspaper'', 22 December 1863, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Le Havre AC]] was founded as an athletics and rugby club in 1872, making it the oldest surviving football club registered in France and continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernandez|first1=Anthony|title=Avec Louvel, "Le Havre est devenu un club de Ligue 2" selon les supporters|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2009/05/15/avec-louvel-le-havre-est-devenu-un-club-de-ligue-2-selon-les-supporters_1193671_3242.html|accessdate=20 September 2015|website=Le Monde.fr|publisher=Groupe Le Monde|date=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began playing association football on a regular basis in 1894. Technically [[AS Strasbourg]] could be considered the first French association football team, being established in 1890; they were however a German team at the time.

[[Dresden English Football Club]] was founded on 18 March 1874 and was the first association football club in Germany, and likely the first outside Great Britain. In 1874, over 70 members participated, primarily Englishmen working in Dresden, watched by hundreds of spectators. Another German club, [[TSV 1860 München|1860 Munich]] did not play football until 1899, although it has its origins in a gymnastics and fitness club formed in 1848 and reestablished in the year indicated by its name.

The Danish [[Kjøbenhavns Boldklub]] is the oldest football club on continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=En kort version af vores klubs historie|url=http://www.kb-boldklub.dk/om-kb/historie/|website=kb-boldklub.dk|publisher=Kjøbenhavns Boldklub|accessdate=20 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702013047/http://www.kb-boldklub.dk/om-kb/historie/|archivedate=2 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was formed in 1876 and association football was first played two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie-Louise|title=Kjøbenhavns Boldklub|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Livsstil%2c_sport_og_fritid/Sport/Fodbold_-_Danmark/Kj%C3%B8benhavns_Boldklub|website=Denstoredanske.dk|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pepassemblyatschool.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A group of students cheering and clapping at their high school pep assembly.]]
A '''pep rally''' or '''pep assembly''' is a gathering of people, typically students of [[middle school]], [[high school]], and [[university|college]] age, before a [[sports]] event. The purpose of such a gathering is to encourage [[school spirit]] and to support members of the [[team]]. It is generally seen as an [[United States|American]] phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/daniel-m-cooke/uk-vs-usa-school-pride_b_2696346.html|title=UK vs. USA - School Pride|date=2013-02-19|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a pep rally, cheerleaders lead in boisterous chants and dance moves intended to get the student body excited. Games between competing classes with small prizes may be held. The school's [[School band|band]] often play upbeat music in between demonstrations, and the [[drumline]] may play. The school's choir may sing "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" to the crowd. In the case of a [[homecoming]] game, the Homecoming "court" may be chosen and announced.

This is also a time for the team captains to let the school know how their team are doing this season. Most schools have pep rallies to honor future and past events.

[[College basketball]] teams celebrate the opening of the season with [[Midnight Madness (basketball)|Midnight Madness]], an event similar to a pep rally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="72841">'''Politics and sports''' or '''sports diplomacy''' describes the use of sport as a means to influence diplomatic, social, and political relations. Sports diplomacy may transcend cultural differences and bring people together.

The use of sports and politics has had both positive and negative implications over history. Sports competitions or activities have had the intention to bring about change in certain cases. Nationalistic fervour is sometimes linked to victories or losses to some sport on sports fields.&lt;ref name="ipatrix"&gt;[http://www.ipatrix.com/873/separation-of-politics-and-sports/ Can sports and politics ever be separated?]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Poster-Joe-Louis.jpg|thumb|upright|right|United States [[World War II]] recruiting poster featuring boxer [[Joe Louis]].]] --&gt;

While the [[Olympics]] is often the biggest political example of using sports for diplomatic means, [[cricket]] and [[association football]], as well as other sports in the global arena, have also been used in this regard. In the case of [[Apartheid]], sport was used to isolate [[South Africa]] and bring about a major overhaul in the country's social structure. While ethnicity and race can cause division, sports can also help blend differences.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, Stephen and Douglas Hartmann. "Ethnicity and Race: Making Identities in a Changing World." p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, numerous athletes have sought political office, some of them unsuccessfully, on either the national level or the sub-national level.

The most infamous declaration of politics and sport was the [[Football War]] between [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]]. Though the build-up to the war had to do with more socio-economic issues like immigration and land reform, the impetus for war was an inflammation of tensions set off by rioters during the second North American qualifying round for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. Disturbances broke out during the first game in [[Tegucigalpa]], but the second leg saw the situation get considerably worse in [[San Salvador]]. Honduran fans were roughed up, the Honduran flag and national anthem were insulted, and the emotions of both nations became considerably agitated. In retaliation, violence against Salvadoran residents in Honduras, including several [[Vice Consul]]s, increased. An unknown number of Salvadorans were killed or brutalized, and tens of thousands began fleeing the country. The press of both nations contributed to a growing climate of near-hysteria, and on June 27, 1969, twelve days after the second-leg game, Honduras broke diplomatic relations with El Salvador. On July 14, 1969, the Salvadoran army launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] negotiated a cease-fire which took effect on July 20, with the Salvadoran troops withdrawn in early August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/sierra/soccer1969.htm|title=Armed Conflict Year Index|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel national football team|Israel]] was one of the founding members of the [[Asian Football Confederation]] following its own independence in 1948 (prior to that it played under the banner of "Palestine/[[Eretz Yisrael]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfootballfacts.com/Site-Map-Israel-Football-Facts-and-Stats.html|title=Site-Map-Israel-Football-Facts---Stats|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[1974 Asian Games]] in Iran (and a tense loss to Iran&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-afc.com/en/features-and-interviews/31318-bayati-recalls-irans-1968-afc-asian-cup-triumph Bayati recalls Iran's tense win over Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;), Kuwait and other Arab states refused to play them. Following this, they were expelled from the confederation and spent a few years trying to qualify from such continental bodies as the [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]] before joining [[UEFA]].&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/worldcup2010 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=James | last=Montague | title=Time is right for Israel to return to its Asian roots | date=February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2004 AFC Asian Cup]] held in China made headlines due to events that took place during the final between [[China national football team|China]] and [[Japan national football team|Japan]], apparently due to [[China-Japan relations|historical relations]] dating back to World War II (see [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Nanjing Massacre]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3541380.stm | work=BBC News | title=Chinese riot after Japan victory | date=August 7, 2004 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Japanese national anthem was being played, the home fans expressed their [[anti-Japanese sentiment]] by drowning out the national anthem with their chants. The Chinese home fans also continually booed the players, visiting fans and officials as they watched Japan defeat China 3–1. After the match, some Chinese fans rioted outside the [[Beijing Worker's Stadium]].

Once again, on September 6, 2008, [[Armenia]] and Turkey faced each other in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualification match in [[Yerevan]]. In an unprecedented step, Turkish President [[Abdullah Gül]] was [[Armenia-Turkey relations|invited to watch]] the match, where he and his Armenia counterpart, [[Serzh Sargsyan]], sat together, albeit behind bullet-proof glass. However, the [[Turkish national anthem]] was almost drowned out by booing from 35,000 Armenian fans, showing there is still a lot of mistrust between the two countries. However, the gesture "between the presidents showed that they believed 'football diplomacy' had achieved the most important result." This was a first for the two countries divided by the legacy of the 20th century's first [[Armenian genocide|genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4698951.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Turkey and Armenia start to mend old emnities (''sic'') via World Cup football match | date=September 7, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Sadie | last=Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1839199,00.html | work=Time | title=Can Soccer Heal Turkey-Armenia Rift? | date=September 5, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Andrew | last=Purvis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/07/content_9819181.htm|title=Turkey-Armenia soccer diplomacy brings opportunity to help thaw frozen ties_English_Xinhua|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=152384 President Gül says Turkey-Armenia soccer match will generate important opportunities]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L4494093.htm|title=Humanitarian - Thomson Reuters Foundation News|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[France national football team|France]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] met in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification play-off, where the winner of the two-legged tie progressed through to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Africa]]. After a 1–1 aggregate draw, the match went into extra time at France's National Stadium. The winning goal came from France's [[William Gallas]], but in the build-up, [[Thierry Henry]] twice handled the ball, before passing to Gallas to score. It was seen as a "[[Hand of Frog]]" goal, in reference to the similar "[[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup quarter-final)#.22Hand of God.22 goal|Hand of God]]" goal in the match between Argentina and England. It the became an [[international incident]] with Irish [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]] demanding a replay and the French President telling him to "stick to politics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/fifa-cool-on-irish-replay-calls/story-e6frf9if-1225799989020 Political stoush erupts over Hand of Frog | Herald Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; The replay was not given.

In 2010 [[Iran-Arab relations#United Arab Emirates|relations between Iran and the UAE]] took a turn for the worse when the [[Football Federation Islamic Republic of Iran]] sent a letter to the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] complaining about the misuse of the ''[[Persian Gulf]]'' name. "The move was made after the UAE misrepresented the name ''[[Persian Gulf naming dispute|Persian Gulf]]'' during a match between Iran's Sepahan and the UAE's Al Ain. The Emirate television displayed various banners showing a fictitious name for the Persian Gulf during the match between Iran's Sepahan and the UAE's Al Ain. The AFC must take serious measures to deal with UAE actions of the sort", Taj added. "The UAE side must be fined for showing a fictitious name for the Persian Gulf during the live broadcast of the match."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=125379&amp;sectionid=351020101 No Operation]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to official comments from the UAE in regards to comparing the three disputed islands of [[Greater Tunb]], the [[Lesser Tunb]] and [[Abu Musa]], held by Iran, to the [[occupation of Palestine]], calls were made for a downgrade of ties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=135944&amp;language=en Al-ManarTV:: Iran Set to Limit Ties with UAE over “Occupation”‌ Claims 03/05/2010]&lt;/ref&gt; This also comes after the [[Islamic Solidarity Games]], to be held in Iran, were canceled over the dispute of the ''Persian Gulf'' label.

===Club football===
In Germany, the occasional matchup between [[FC St. Pauli]] and [[F.C. Hansa Rostock]] is known as the "Political Derby" (German: ''Politisches Derby''). Though not a local derby, these teams' supporters represent opposite sides of Germany's political spectrum.{{which|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesligatalk.com/the-political-derby-radical-left-3-2-hard-right/323 |title=The Political Derby: Radical Left 3-2 Hard Right &amp;#124; World Soccer Talk &amp;#124; Page 323 |publisher=Bundesligatalk.com |date=2009-03-06 |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbysieg.com/hansa-rostock-und-sankt-pauli-ein-politisches-derby/ |title=Hansa Rostock und Sankt Pauli ein politisches Derby |publisher=Derbysieg |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista]] is well known as a leader of a political movement called [[Corinthians Democracy]] (Portuguese: Democracia Corinthiana) and became a symbol against the military dictatorship happening at the time in the country in the 1980s. Claiming for an electoral democracy, every decision made by the club was done by voting by the squad players with the consent of the board of directors. Footballer [[Sócrates]] is considered one of the leaders of the movement,this movement is reemerging as the political party, the [[CORINTHIAN NATIONAL PARTY]] (Portuguese: Partido Nacional Corinthiano - PNC), in which its leader and President is Juan Antonio Moreno Grangeiro.

In Israel, [[Beitar Jerusalem]] are infamously known for their [[Jewish nationalism]], particularly against the first [[Arab-Israeli]] team to win the national cup, [[Bnei Sakhnin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ar/originals/2013/12/israel-sports-racism-soccer-beitar-jerusalem-bnei-sakhnin.html#|title=Knesset member tries to shut out Arab-Israeli soccer club - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; conversely [[Maccabi Haifa]] is known for its cross-community support, particularly in its support by Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/26/israelandthepalestinians.sport|title=How racism is holding back Arab footballers|author=James Montague|work=the Guardian|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the women's game, [[Hapoel Petah Tikva]] have recruited Arab players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/sports/1.587049|title=Israeli Soccer Team Breaks New Ground: Recruits Arab Women|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, the [[Old Firm]] rivalry between Glasgow-based clubs [[Celtic F.C.]] and [[Rangers F.C.]] is politically tinged along sectarian lines with [[Roman Catholic]]s in Scotland and Ireland supporting the former and [[Protestant]], mainly [[Presbyterian]]s, supporting the latter. It is arguably elevated by the [[Northern Ireland conflict]].

[[Athletic Bilbao]] are famous for the ''[[cantera]]'' policy of signing only [[Basque people|Basque]] players. Along with fellow Basque side [[Real Sociedad]], Bilbao raised the still banned [[Ikurriña|Basque flag]] in a game shortly after the death of General [[Francisco Franco]].

In France, [[SC Bastia]] fans display various symbols of [[Corsican nationalism]] at [[Stade Armand Cesari]], like [[Dio vi Salvi Regina]] and the "Testa di Moro" on the club crest; during [[2015 Coupe de la Ligue Final]] held in the [[Stade de France]] 30.000 Corsicans sang chants in their own dialect, similar to Sardinian dialect. 
[[Stade Rennais]] fans of Roazhon Celtic Kop display and are inspired by [[Breton Nationalism]] : [[Bro Gozh ma Zadoù]] is played before every match.

==Bandy==
Norway declined to take part in the [[1957 Bandy World Championship]] because the Soviet Union was invited, due to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]] the year before. The country made a similar protest for the [[1969 Bandy World Championship]] because of the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] that year, handing over the hosting of the 1969 event to Sweden.

Ukraine declined to take part in the [[2015 Bandy World Championship]] hosted by Russia because of the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian annexation of Crimea]] the year before, since Ukraine still considers Crimea as part of its territory.

==Boxing==
[[List of heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight champion]] [[Max Schmeling]] had been lauded by the [[Nazi Party]] as a heroic symbol of German destiny and [[Aryan]] supremacy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A politically charged [[boxing]] match with [[Joe Louis]] was preceded nationalistic symbolism and imagery.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Schmeling defeated Louis, for the latter's first professional defeat in 1936. [[Langston Hughes]] recalled the national reaction to Louis' defeat.
{{Centered pull quote|I walked down Seventh Avenue and saw grown men weeping like children, and women sitting in the curbs with their head in their hands. All across the country that night when the news came out that Joe was knocked out, people cried. – Langston Hughes&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Langston (2002). Joseph McLaren. ed. ''Autobiography: The Collected Works of Langston Hughes'', Vol. 14. University of Missouri Press. p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schmeling was, however, welcomed home with a jubilant reaction. Hitler sent his wife flowers with the message: "For the wonderful victory of your husband, our greatest German boxer, I must congratulate you with all my heart." Schmeling responded to the accolades saying: "At this moment I have to tell Germany, I have to report to the Führer in particular, that the thoughts of all my countrymen were with me in this fight; that the Führer and his faithful people were thinking of me. This thought gave me the strength to succeed in this fight. It gave me the courage and the endurance to win this victory for Germany's colours."&lt;ref name="bookreview"&gt;David Margolick, "Beyond Glory."&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling|rematch]] was scheduled later in New York City. In the build-up to the event U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] offered his support: "Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat Germany." Schmeling's hotel was picketed by American protestors after an accompanying Nazi Party publicist declared that a black man could not defeat Schmeling and that when he won, his prize money would be used to build German tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Dettloff, William. "The Louis-Schmeling Fights: Prelude to War."&lt;/ref&gt; Louis won the rematch in a first round knock out and he became the focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to World War II. Louis later recalled the pressure on him before the fight: "I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I had my own personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending me."&lt;ref name="bookreview"/&gt;

Decades later, [[Muhammad Ali]] took up political causes in his refusal to be [[conscription|drafted]] for the [[Vietnam War]] amid the [[Civil Rights Movement]] during the presidency of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

After earning the championship, Clay converted his religion to Islam, which instigated conflict with his boxing career. He also abandoned his name that was given to his slave ancestors and adopted Muhammad Ali. On April 28, 1967, he refused to serve in the Army during the Vietnam War, stating religious reasons that it goes against the Qur'an's teaching.
{{Centered pull quote|I ain't got no quarrel with those Vietcong...no Vietcong ever called me nigger. - Muhammad Ali}}
He then became an icon of not only the civil rights struggle, but also the anti-Vietnam War movement.
However he was convicted of draft evasion, sentenced to five years in prison, fined $10,000 and stripped of his championship. It was not until a lawsuit in 1970 that Ali redeemed his title.
He would continue in historical boxing matches now known as [[Rumble in the Jungle]] in 1974 and [[Thrilla in Manila]] in 1975, defeating George Foreman and Joe Frazier, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/sport/muhammad_ali.html|title=Muhammad Ali Biography|work=Biography Online|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chess==

[[Chess]], which is a recognized sport of the [[International Olympic Committee]], has a history of being linked to political issues.  This was particularly true of the [[World Chess Championship 1972|1972 World Championship match]] between the American [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Boris Spassky]] of the Soviet Union. The match took place during the [[Cold War]] and the pressure was mounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3669446/How-Bobby-Fischer-and-Boris-Spassky-became-pawns.html|title=How Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky became pawns|date=22 November 2007|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==
{{further|Cricket Diplomacy}}

In 1969, the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] refused to allow [[Basil D'Oliveira]] to play for [[England cricket team|England]] against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] for fear of upseting the [[apartheid]] regime. D'Oliveira was a [[coloured]] born in South Africa and refused permission to play for the South African team by the government, instead he played for England. D'Oliveria was one of the more likely players to be selected following his performance against Australia in the previous year's [[The Ashes|Ashes]]. However, he was not selected; it was suspected at the time{{by whom|date=June 2012}} that this was capitulation towards the [[apartheid]] regime.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Cricket has also had a hand to play in sporting diplomacy. Following the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], and Soviet pressure on India to deflect the tension they faced, in 1987 Pakistan's president at the time, General [[Zia ul-Haq]], attended a test match between India and Pakistan in Jaipur – a visit that apparently helped cool a flare-up in tensions. Furthermore, following a fifteen-year lull in test matches, cricket tours between India and Pakistan were revived in 2004 in the wake of diplomatic initiatives to bury half a century of mutual hostility. Both sides relaxed their tough visa regulations for each other, allowing thousands of fans to travel across the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110004862|title=Life|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/03/10/business/singh.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to replicate the cricket diplomacy of the past General [[Pervez Musharraf]] came to India in 2005 ostensibly for a cricket match. The trip, however, quickly took on the air of a summit as the sides were urged "to seize a historic chance to end their dispute over Kashmir."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/17/content_434859.htm Musharraf visits India amid cricket diplomacy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/19/content_435617.htm|title=India, Pakistan cricket diplomacy no game it's real|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often this rivalry has been tinged with a religious-political bent to it. A Pakistani fan in [[Karachi]] ran onto the pitch to attack the Indian [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], and fans threw stones at the Indian players during the match in Karachi. In 2000 right-wing Hindus dug up the cricket pitch in New Delhi to protest against the Pakistani team's visit.&lt;ref name="update.unu.edu"&gt;[http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm UNU Update: Cricket Diplomacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821122824/http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm |date=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Kargil conflict]], and at various other times, there have also been calls to suspend cricketing ties between the two countries.&lt;ref name="ipatrix"/&gt;

In reference to immigrants from the Caribbean and South Asia, British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] member [[Norman Tebbit]] once a "[[cricket test]]" could adjudge a persons loyalty to England by determining whether or not they supported the England and Wales cricket team ahead of those from their own countries of origin.

In 2008, the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] cancelled [[Zimbabwe cricket team|Zimbabwe]]'s 2009 tour of England and suspended all bilateral relations between the two states in response to the situation regarding the [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|2008 Zimbabwean presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England cut Zimbabwe cricket ties |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7471238.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MPs [[Jack Straw]] and [[Tessa Jowell]] wrote to the [[International Cricket Council]] asking then to ban Zimbabwe from international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/other_international/zimbabwe/4170262.stm | work=BBC News | title=Zimbabwe is facing new ban threat | date=August 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China have also gotten in on the cricket diplomacy act. [[Cross-Strait relations]] have once again been the impetus for doing so. During the buildup to the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]], [[Antigua]] received a $55 million grant to build the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]], while Jamaica received $30 million for a new [[Greenfield Stadium (Trelawny)|Trelawny]] stadium. [[St. Lucia]] have also got both a cricket and a football stadium courtesy of China. China spent a remarkable $132 million on cricket facilities in the West Indies over the past few years, a massive amount compared to the [[International Cricket Council]]'s paltry 10-year budget of $70 million to promote cricket ''globally''. It is said that the motive for China's generosity is because "Most of the remaining countries that recognize Taiwan are located in the Caribbean and Latin America." The diplomacy paid off in the end as [[Grenada]] and [[Dominica]] derecognized Taiwan as an independent country. Further, "Of the remaining 24 countries that recognize Taiwan, four are in the Caribbean and two of these play cricket." Grenada previously had a stadium built by Taiwan, but saw it flattened by a hurricane. To join the action, China quickly came in to erect another stadium. Consequently, Taiwan took Grenada to a New York City court to force the latter to return the original loan.

Put on the back foot, a beleaguered Taiwan also used the World Cup to shore up its position among its shrinking West Indian support base. It doled out $21 million to [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] and $12 million to the even smaller [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] for cricket grounds. China's aggressive ambitions have benefited the [[Caribbean Islands]] as "Strategic analysts say China is laying out more money than is needed to just isolate Taiwan. China, which has built large embassies in each of the islands, now has a bigger diplomatic presence in the Caribbean than the United States, the superpower next door." And that "Mainland China's long-term strategy coincides with its foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=2980988&amp;page=1|title=China Outplays Taiwan in Cricket Diplomacy|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of [[Saeed Anwar]]'s daughter he took to a more [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamental Islam]] and started growing a beard. He was then said to have been the turning point in the [[Islamisation]] of the Pakistani cricket team,&lt;ref name="cricinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/219991.html|title=Finding Faith|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also a reason for [[Yousuf Youhana]]'s conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2005/sep/17youhana.htm|title=Youhana embraces Islam|date=17 September 2005|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]] a more visible trend of religion was seen in the Pakistan team with many players having become more devout to the point of either leading prayers or growing beards as a symbol of being a "good Muslim" (with the notable exception of [[Shoaib Akhtar]] and [[Danish Kaneria]] (the latter being the only [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hindu]] on the team)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakpassion.net/ppforum/showthread.php?t=77299|title=PakPassion.net - Pakistan Cricket Forum|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even post-match interviews were preceded by Islamic salutations such as ''Bismillah ur Rehman rahim''.&lt;ref name="cricinfo"/&gt; Most famously, after the loss to [[India versus Pakistan cricket rivalry|arch-rival India]] at the 2007 [[ICC World Twenty20]] [[Shoaib Malik]] came under fire for apologising "I want to thank everyone back home in Pakistan and Muslims all over the world. Thank you very much and I’m sorry that we didn’t win, but we did give our 100 per cent" for the defeat, which was particularly ironic considering [[Irfan Pathan]], a [[Islam in India|Muslim]] was named [[Man of the Match]] for his performance in India's win,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?235722|title='Indian Media Exploited Shoaib Remark'|work=outlookindia.com/|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shah Rukh Khan]] was in the stands cheering on India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pratyush.instablogs.com/entry/shoaibs-remark-shows-pakistani-cricket-team-a-victim-of-pan-islamic-influenza/ Instablogs - Mobile - Shoaib's remark shows Pakistani team a victim of pan-Islamic influenza]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2007 World Cup and the loss to Ireland (an unranked cricket team), the religious influence was criticised for taking a toll on the team. The Islamisation of such a Western sport in Pakistan was seen as symbolic of the growing influence of religion in every field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statestimes.com/2010/2010/03/16/islamisation-of-pakistan-cricket%E2%80%8F/ Islamisation of Pakistan cricket]&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, this trend was attributed to dating back to the tenure of the military government of General Zia-ul Haq where the focus of the youth was shifted from Pakistan as a nation-state and cultural-religious pluralism to Islam as a transnational [[Politics of identity|identity]], greater attention to conservative Islamic ritualism, and a perception of a global conspiracy against Muslims and admiration for militancy. A need was also seen to reorient sportsmen towards professionalism, discipline and rules and regulations. It was said that the focus of education and socialisation needed to return to a Pakistan that could not afford to be at war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010%5C02%5C07%5Cstory_7-2-2010_pg3_2|title=DailyTimes - Your Right To Know|author=|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Going as far back as the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]], [[Adolf Hitler]] used this as a stage to promote [[Nazism and race|Aryan nationalism]] for Germany with his ideological belief of racial supremacy.&lt;ref name="Bachrach"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bachrach|first=Susan D.|title=The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936|isbn=978-0-316-07087-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympics were used as a method of hardening the German spirit and instilling unity among German youth.

While Germany did top the medal table, the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] depiction of [[List of African ethnic groups|ethnic Africans]] as inferior was dispelled by [[Jesse Owens]]' [[gold medal]]s in the [[100 metres|100m]], [[200 metres|200m]], 4 × 100 m [[Relay race|relay]] and [[long jump]] events.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, Judith Pinkerton. ''Jesse Owens: Track and Field Legend''.&lt;/ref&gt; There were questions as to whether Hitler acknowledged Owens' victories. On the first day of competition, Hitler left the stadium after only shaking hands with the German victors. An Olympic committee member then insisted that Hitler either greet every medalist or none at all; he chose the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde Flippo, The 1936 Berlin Olympics: Hitler and Jesse Owens&lt;/ref&gt; At the games he was visited by [[Adi Dassler]], the founder of [[Adidas]], who offered new shoes to Owens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2005/nov/08adi.htm|title=How Adidas and Puma were born|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once again, in 1968, the global stage of the Olympics was used to show the world the plight of the [[African-American]] struggle during the [[civil rights movement]] in their home country. The famous [[Black Power]] [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|salute]] was performed by [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] during the medal ceremony in [[Mexico City]]. [[Věra Čáslavská]], in protest to the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the controversial decision by the judges on the [[Balance Beam]] and [[Floor (gymnastics)|Floor]], turned her head down and away from the [[Soviet]] flag whilst the anthem played during the medal ceremony. She returned home as a heroine of the Czechoslovak people, but was made an outcast by the Soviet dominated government.

In 1972, some members of the [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Israeli Olympic team]] were killed in an attack by Palestinian [[Black September (group)|Black September]] gunmen that started at the Olympic village and eventually resulted in the deaths of 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team.

The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] led to a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] of the [[1980 Moscow Olympics]] by a numerous Western states and their allies in protest of Russian actions. In the [[1984 Los Angeles Olympics]] the [[Soviet Bloc]] led a [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|retaliatory boycott]] of the games in response to the American-led Moscow games boycott.

Following the [[Wrestling at the Olympics|cancellation of wrestling]] at the Olympics in the 2010s, traditional political rivals Iran, Russia and the United States joined forces to annul the measure. The U.S. hosted a publicity event in New York City with athletes from all three countries to campaign for its reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/americas/2013/05/201351643459549559.html|title=Global rivals unite to save Olympic wrestling|author=|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Table tennis==
{{Main| Ping Pong Diplomacy}}
In the 1970s an exchange of table tennis players from the United States and the People's Republic of China led to a thaw in [[Sino-American relations]] that eventually led to U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[rapprochement]] with China.
It all began when the Chinese table tennis team invited their U.S. counterparts to their country on an all-expense paid trip during the [[1971 World Table Tennis Championships]] in Japan. ''[[Time magazine]]'' termed it: "The ping heard ‘round the world.'" On April 10, 1971, the team, and accompanying journalists, became the first U.S. sports delegation to enter and break the information blockade since 1949. Although the U.S. team was defeated by their hosts, in return to Premier [[Chou En-lai]]'s invitation to more U.S. journalists, the United States government announced that it would lift its 20-year embargo on trade with China.
A reporter for ''Time'' noted that table tennis was "an apt metaphor for the relations between Washington and Peking" and that both state motioned a willingness to adapt to the new initiative. However, it was not until July 15, that Nixon would finally be the first U.S. president to pay a visit to China. Thirty-six years later, a three-day "Ping-Ping Diplomacy" event was held at the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum]] during the week of June 9, 2008. The original members of the U.S. and Chinese teams from 1971 were present to participate at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/china/peopleevents/pande07.html|title=American Experience|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tennis==
In 2008, Israeil tennists [[Shahar Pe'er]], [[Tzipi Obziler]], [[Andy Ram]] and [[Yoni Erlich]] were supposed to feature in [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournaments in Doha and Dubai, respectively, despite bans on Israeli passport holders from entering both countries.&lt;ref name="israel"/&gt; Peer was refused a visa to Dubai the following year following the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] with the organisers saying "We do not wish to politicise sport but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the whole region and not alienate or put at risk the players or the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have in the United Arab Emirates." The WTA chief executive [[Larry Scott (sports administrator)|Larry Scott]] later reacted saying some "sanctions" would be issued on Dubai. She also faced protests following the war during a tournament in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/7891164.stm | work=BBC News | title=Dubai faces censure over Peer ban | date=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2010 US Open (tennis)|2010 US Open]] tennis tournament India's [[Rohan Bopanna]] and Pakistan's [[Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi]] reached the men's doubles finals, eliciting responses from political leaders in both countries. Supporters from both countries, including the respective United Nations ambassadors, sat in the stands together. Rashid Malik, Pakistan's [[Davis Cup]] coach, said "The success of their team so far has been a big encouragement for both countries, it will only have a peaceful and positive impact on their people." [[Manohar Singh Gill]], India's sports minister, asked "I have one question for everyone. If Bopanna and Qureshi can play together, why cannot India and Pakistan?"

The two were also involved in another campaign promoted by the Monaco-based ''Peace and Sport'' when they wore sweat shirts with slogans reading "Stop War, Start Tennis." They refer to themselves as the "Indo-Pak Express." Such a high-profile collaboration meant this was read as a "unique" partnership. Qureshi said "It just feels like us doing well on the bigger level is getting the message across throughout the world – if me and Rohan can get along so well there's no reason the Indians and Pakistanis can't get along with each other. If even two or three per cent of people say, 'If they can get along why can't we?' that's what we're trying to do. "They're all mixed together sitting in the crowd. You can't tell who is Pakistani and who is Indian. That's the beauty about sports. Before our pairing you would never see that in any sports, fighting for one cause. It's really good to be part of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/09/20109920244518342.html|title=Indo-Pak pair in tennis diplomacy|author=|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their finals defeat, Qureshi spoke to the crowd to "say something on behalf of all Pakistanis, [that] every time I come here, there's a wrong perception about the people of Pakistan. They are very friendly, very loving people. We want peace in this world as much as you guys." He then made a political appeal to the controversial "[[Ground Zero mosque]]" saying "For me, as a Muslim, that's what makes America the greatest country in the world - freedom of religion, freedom of speech. If the mosque is built, I think it's a huge gesture to all the Muslim community out there in the world. I would really appreciate it." Indian and Pakistani fans filled the stadium for the final as the two U.N. ambassadors again sat together in the President's Box. Pakistan's ambassador Abdullah Hussain Haroon said "They've proven that when Indians and Pakistanis get together we can raise fire. I think on a people-to-people basis, they're setting an example that the politicians should follow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2010/09/11/2010-09-11_aisamulhaq_qureshi_delivers_message_of_peace_at_us_open_after_indopak_express_su.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi delivers message of peace at U.S. Open after Indo-Pak Express suffers defeat | first=Stefan | last=Bondy | date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{Main|Sporting boycott of South Africa}}
Most famously, the sporting boycott of [[apartheid South Africa|South Africa during Apartheid]] was said to have played a crucial role in forcing South Africa to open up their society and to end a global isolation.  South Africa was excluded from the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], and many sports' governing bodies expelled or suspended membership of South African affiliates.  It was said that the "international boycott of apartheid sport has been a powerful means for sensitising world opinion against apartheid and in mobilising millions of people for action against that despicable system." This boycott "in some cases helped change official policies."

The South African [[Table Tennis]] Board (SATTB), a body founded in contravention to the white South African table tennis board, was replaced for the latter by the [[International Table Tennis Federation]]. While the SATTB team was able to participate in the world championships held in [[Stockholm]] in 1957, team members were immediately refused passports by the government. It ruled that no black could compete internationally except through the white sports body.

Started in 1980, the United Nations "Register of Sports Contacts with South Africa" – a record of sports exchanges with South Africa and a list of sportsmen who have participated in sports events in South Africa – prove to be an effective instrument to discourage collaboration with apartheid sport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/boycotts/indsport.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802160811/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/boycotts/indsport.html |date=August 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/abdul-2.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706195754/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/abdul-2.html |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s South Africa was also expelled from most international sports bodies. The [[International Olympic Committee]] even adopted a declaration against "apartheid in sport" on June 21, 1988, for the total isolation of apartheid sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scnc.ukzn.ac.za/doc/SPORT/SPORTRAM.htm|title=SPORTS AND THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jch.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/38/3/477|title=Hitting Apartheid for Six?

The country's hosting and winning of the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] was a powerful boost to post-apartheid South Africa's return to the international sporting scene.&lt;ref name="update.unu.edu"/&gt; The [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa also drew similar parallels and questions as to whether race could be overcome,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.aljazeera.net/africa/2010/06/07/freshly-ground-south-africa-0 Freshly ground South Africa | Al Jazeera Blogs]&lt;/ref&gt; this was especially true following the death of [[Eugene Terreblanche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8602347.stm | work=BBC News | title=South African Terreblanche killed | date=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans of [[NASCAR]] are generally considered by the [[media of the United States]] to fall within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] base as an "almost exclusively white, conservative racing crowd", the "white, middle-aged, working-class Southern men" who were coveted in the first decades of 21st century during electoral campaigns. [[Joe Gibbs]], a NASCAR [[Joe Gibbs Racing|team owner]], spoke at the [[2008 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/opinion/09/26/s.e.cupp.book/index.html NASCAR.COM - Politics once again puts NASCAR fans center stage] Sept 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 90 percent of political contributions from those affiliated with NASCAR go to Republican candidates.

A study of elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the overall results. A study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5 percent, while a loss had the opposite effect. The study looked at [[NCAA]] football games from 1946 to 2008. In addition, the study found that colleges with higher attendance rates had a larger effect on the results, up to 3%. The effects are increased even further if the game is an [[upset (sports)|upset]], that is, if the team expected to win does not. Other studies have confirmed these results for other sports, such as [[baseball]] and [[basketball]]. The study authors concluded that the win made voters feel better about society, boosting votes for the incumbent, while losses made voters feel worse, sending votes to the challenger. There was some speculation that the result of certain games could even decide the [[2012 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Ohio State's Football Team Decide Who Wins the White House? |author1=Tyler Cowen |author2=Kevin Grier |work=[[Slate.com]] |date=October 24, 2012 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/how_the_presidential_race_between_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_could_be.html |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States elections, 2010]], at least five former athletes ran on Republican tickets for political office. [[Chris Dudley]] took part in his first political race for [[Governor of Oregon]] after playing for the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. He also helped persuade former [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' [[Jon Runyan]] to run for New Jersey's 3rd congressional district against a first-term Democrat [[John Adler]]. [[Shawn Bradley]] of the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] ran for a seat in Utah's legislature; [[Keith Fimian]], who played for the [[Cleveland Browns]], sought a House seat from Virginia; and former [[Washington Redskins]]' [[Clint Didier]] sought a Republican nomination for Senate in Washington state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-17/professional-athletes-become-republican-hopefuls-in-strategy-for-november.html | work=Bloomberg | title=NFL, NBA Provide Recruiting Ground for Republicans in November | date=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Runyan won his election.

&lt;!--The President also throws the ceremonial first pitch every year in baseball--&gt;Baseball players union boss [[Don Fehr]] contributed to the presidential primaries for [[George W.

Former Buffalo Bills quarterback [[Jack Kemp]] was a nine term congressman who chaired the House Republican Leadership Conference and served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President George H. W. Bush. Kemp was the 1996 Republican candidate for Vice President. 
[[Bill Bradley]], who played basketball for the New York Knicks, served three terms in the U.S. Senate representing New Jersey.

Olympic gold medalist [[Carl Lewis]] planned to run for office from [[New Jersey]], though his attempt was blocked and he awaited an appeal hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-27/carl-lewis-files-federal-lawsuit-after-official-halts-bid-for-n-j-senate.html | work=Bloomberg | first1=David | last1=Voreacos | first2=Esme E. | last2=Deprez | title=Olympian Carl Lewis Sues After New Jersey Official Halts State Senate Bid | date=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[US State Department]] initiated a sports exchange programme entitled ''[[SportsUnited]]'' to encourage dialogue between children from the ages of 7–17.

Another programme encourages U.S. athletes to travel to and learn about foreign cultures and the challenges young people face in other countries.

===North Korea===

====World Cup====

North Korea's relationships with the international community, especially [[South Korea]], have sometimes been shaped by sports diplomacy. In the [[1966 World Cup]], North Korea defeated the heavily favored Italian team.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Jon. "Chollima Upset Italy." ESPNFC.com. ESPN, 19 July 2012. Web. 13 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Jong-il]] believed that successful athletics increases the strength of a country, promoted its ideology, brought a country great honor and increased its international reputation.&lt;ref name="Kim 1986"&gt;Kim, Jung Il. On Popularizing Physical Training and Sport and Developing Sporting Skills Rapidly: Talk to the Officials in the Field of Physical Training and Sport, May 19, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, this victory has become propaganda used by the North Korean regime to present a reputable country to not only their citizens, but also to the international community as a whole. Although North Korea has not had much success since this victory, North Korea participated in the [[2010 World Cup]]. In addition, North Korea was surrounded by controversy during [[2006 World Cup]] qualifying. Fan violence in Pyongyang after a match with Iran led to North Korea playing a home game in [[Thailand]] without any fans.&lt;ref&gt;"North Korea Football Violence Erupts." BBC News. BBC, 30 Mar. 2005. Web. 13 Apr. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt;

====1988 Seoul Olympics====

The years leading up to, during, and after the [[1988 Seoul Olympics]] played a major role in the development of North Korea. In 1981, [[Seoul]] was selected as the host of the 1988 Olympics. Although at first, North Korea did not consider that Seoul being selected as Olympic host was a major issue, it quickly realized that South Korea hosting the Olympics would highlight the growing economic imbalances between North and South Korea.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, Charles K 1992"&gt;Armstrong, Charles K. ''Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, 1950–1992''. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This realization led to a large devotion of time and effort in an attempt to convince the [[International Olympic Committee]] to split the Olympic Games between Seoul and [[Pyongyang]]. During these discussions, the IOC considered some concessions, only to be rejected by the North Korean regime. This can be seen as a great missed opportunity for North Korea to gain from the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="Radchenko, Sergey 2012"&gt;Radchenko, Sergey. "It's Not Enough to Win: The Seoul Olympics and the Roots of North Korea's Isolation." The International Journal of the History of Sport 29.9 (2012): 1243-262. Taylor &amp; Francis Group. Web. 12 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, North Korea's major allies were China, the [[USSR]], and [[Cuba]]. While [[Fidel Castro]] and Cuba staunchly defended North Korea, both the USSR and China agreed to participate in the games. This major decision strained relationships that were vital to the North Korean economic system.&lt;ref name="Radchenko, Sergey 2012"/&gt; Throughout the history of North Korea, North Korea relied heavily on the [[foreign aid]]. The countries that gave the most aid were the USSR and China. For that reason, the strained relationships had a major effect on North Korea. This played a major role in the North Korean isolationist policies of the 1990s. In addition, as a result of the undeniable success of the Seoul Games, the growing gap between these two nations was further put on display.

As a result of the failed negotiations North Korea engaged in several acts of [[terrorism]]. In 1987, in an attempt to destabilize the Olympic Games and instill fear in the international community, a South Korean commercial flight, [[Korean Air Flight 858]] was bombed killing 115 passengers on board.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, Charles K 1992"/&gt; This event did not fulfill its intended purpose and instead further weakened North Korea's international reputation.

====World Festival of Youth and Students====

North Korea, following its unsuccessful effort to sabotage the Seoul Olympics decided to hold the [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in 1989. Coming one year after the most successful Olympics in years, there was large pressure on the North Korean regime to hold a similarly successful event. Although this event brought in 177 countries, the greatest number in its history, it was never seen as a true alternative to the Olympics and did not gain the international visibility that the North Korean government had hoped for.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, Charles K 1992"/&gt; In addition, the cost of the event was a staggering 4 billion dollars and helped further push North Korea into the financial distress that was so prevalent during the 1990s.

====Arirang Festival====

The [[Arirang Festival]], starting in the early 2000s takes place in the [[Rungrado 1st of May Stadium]], the largest stadium in the world holding approximately 150,000 people. Participation in this event is mandatory and the performances are extravagant and impressively choreographed.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"&gt;Merkel, Udo. "The Politics of Sport and Identity in North Korea." The International Journal of the History of Sport 31.3 (2014): 376-90. Taylor &amp; Francis Group. Web. 12 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arirang Festival can be broken up into three different parts. The first is a floor show, where thousands of athletes, gymnasts and dancers demonstrate their athletic abilities. The second section uses thousands of North Koreans to create a human mosaic depicting vibrant images of North Korea and North Korean achievements. Finally, the third section is the music that links the performance.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"/&gt; Together, these elements present to the international community North Korea's best athletes through a mix of athletics and art. The Arirang Festival draws international tourists and journalists and intends to present a thriving economic nation to the world. Many of the acts in the festival focus on the theme of reunification. Children chant "how much longer do we have to be divided due to foreign forces". The 2014 and 2015 Arirang Festivals were canceled and it is unknown if it will return.

====Recent relations with South Korea====

North Korea and South Korea marched together for the [[2000 Sydney Olympics]], [[2004 Athens Olympics]] and [[2006 Turin Olympics]]. Plans to walk together for the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] fell through when principles regarding selection of athletes could not be agreed upon. After the 2008 Beijing Olympics tensions have increased between these two nations.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"/&gt;

Many inter-Korean sporting events were held in the 2000s. These events were referred to as unification matches.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"/&gt;

====Internal use of sports politics====

The North Korean leaders understood the importance of sports not only in the international community, but also internally. The major ideology in North Korea, [[Juche]], has been solidified through the Communist Party's use of sports.&lt;ref name="Kim 1986"/&gt; The North Korea regime believed that by supporting the increases in sport, the North Korean people would overall be more fit. This would allow the people to be more useful in the revolutionary struggle. For this reason, it was important to start athletics young. In fact, training in physical sport was mandatory during schooling. In the 2000s, major sporting events were being broadcast throughout North Korea, and these events are still being used as propaganda tools. Sports have played a vital role in maintaining the power of the ruling class, while at the same time offering opportunities to interact with the international community.

===Brazil===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

====Corinthian Democracy====

The most famous incident in Brazilian soccer and politics is [[Corinthians Democracy]]. In 1982, [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], a club in [[São Paulo]], held election of the club. Unlike other club elections, the presidency of the club was considered as the “third most important position in the country, after the governorship of Sao Paulo and the presidency of the Republic.”&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, Matthew. "Playing Soccer in Brazil: Socrates, Corinthians, and Democracy." The Wilson Quarterly (1976-) 13, no. 2 (1989): 119-23. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40257497.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertisements through televisions, radio, music etc., that added up to around 500,000 U.S. dollars were used. There were two opposing sides, “Corinthian Democracy” and “Order and Truth”, that contested for the place. “Corinthian Democracy” aimed for political liberation within the club and “Order and Truth” remained in the old system, the oligarchy. [[Sócrates]], the former soccer player, made a statement that he would stay in Corinthians if free election amendment passes. Corinthian Democracy was defeated after the free-elections campaign’s defeat and Socrates went to Florence as a result. 

====World Cup in 1970====

After Brazil won the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in 1970, General [[Emílio Garrastazu Médici|Emílio Médici]]’s government declared a national holiday, rewarding each player with the equivalent amount of 18,500 U.S. dollars, tax-free. Medici declared “I identify this victory, achieved in the fraternity of sport, with the ascension of faith in our struggle for national development.”&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, Matthew. "Playing Soccer in Brazil: Socrates, Corinthians, and Democracy." The Wilson Quarterly (1976-) 13, no. 2 (1989): 119-23. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40257497.&lt;/ref&gt;. Opinion Poll in 1970 stated that “90 percent of Brazil’s lower classes identified soccer with the nation.”&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, Matthew. "Playing Soccer in Brazil: Socrates, Corinthians, and Democracy." The Wilson Quarterly (1976-) 13, no. 2 (1989): 119-23. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40257497.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the victory in 1970, [[Cláudio Coutinho]] who was the manager of the national team was given a mission to modernize the Brazilian playing style. Instead of individual skills, teamwork and discipline were emphasized as Medici’s government made efforts to modernize the Brazilian economy.

====Protests over 2014 World Cup Spending====

In the summer of 2013 as Brazil prepared to host the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], protests about an increase in the cost of public transportation broke out.&lt;ref&gt;Young, James. "How Soccer Culture Made Its Way Into Brazils Political Crisis." Remezcla. 2016, Retrieved March 7 2018, http://remezcla.com/features/sports/soccer-brazil-political-crisis/.&lt;/ref&gt; Although started with a small cause, the protests soon expanded to discontents over government’s spending on social welfare. Protestors requested, “hospitals and schools abiding by FIFA standards.”&lt;ref&gt;Fellay, Sarah. “Saved by the Goalkeeper: Soccer and Elections.” Harvard International Review, vol. 36, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–35., www.jstor.org/stable/43649245, Retrieved 6 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; This request was a “reference to FIFA’s high standards of stadium quality” when the country only spends 5 percent of GDP on education in comparison. However, [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima]], former soccer player for Brazil, stated that “World Cups aren’t made with hospitals”&lt;ref&gt;Fellay, Sarah. “Saved by the Goalkeeper: Soccer and Elections.” Harvard International Review, vol. 36, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–35., www.jstor.org/stable/43649245, Retrieved 6 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;, referring to a disconnect between soccer stadium and spending on social welfare. This tension led up to a spending of US$850 million on security for the World Cup, which was five times higher than the amount spent by South Africa. 

After the official matches began, political activities, such as protests, reduced until the semi-finals. Brazil, considered as a strong candidate to win the World Cup, lost to Germany [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)|7-1]].  As Sarah Fellay referred, huge defeat against Germany sparked “a flood of protests across the country.”&lt;ref&gt;Fellay, Sarah. “Saved by the Goalkeeper: Soccer and Elections.” Harvard International Review, vol. 36, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–35., www.jstor.org/stable/43649245, Retrieved 6 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; Through social media and other online formats, Brazilians started to denounce the government publicly, referring to past protests. Não vai ter Copa (there will be no cup), which was a slogan to denounce government’s spending on the World Cup, started to recur on social media. As a result, President [[Dilma Rousseff|Rousseff]]’s approval ratings fell.
 
====Corruption====

[[Brazilian Football Confederation]], the CBF, has been accused of being under the influence of corruption. U.S. Justice Department investigated CBF former presidents for their corruption. In December 2017, [[José Maria Marin]], former CBF president, was found guilty of taking US$6.5 million in bribes.&lt;ref&gt;Laughland, Oliver. “Fifa Trial: Two Ex-Soccer Officials Found Guilty on Multiple Charges of Corruption.” The Guardian, Guardian News and Media, 22 Dec. 2017, Retrieved April 4 2018. www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/22/fifa-trial-two-ex-officials-found-guilty-on-multiple-charges-of-corruption.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Polo Del Nero|Marco Polo del Nero]], also a former president of CBF, is currently under provisional suspension since December 2017 by FIFA due to investigations on his bribery.&lt;ref&gt;“Provisional Suspension of Football Official Marco Polo Del Nero Extended for 45 Days by Independent Ethics Committee .” FIFA.com, 14 Mar. 2018, Retrieved 3 April 8 2018, www.fifa.com/governance/news/y=2018/m=3/news=provisional-suspension-of-football-official-marco-polo-del-nero-extended-for-45-.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arena Corinthians]], where the opening match of 2014 World Cup was held, was referred in an investigation of [[Petrobras]] corruption of “money-laundering operation.” Also, in the construction of [[Arena das Dunas]] stadium in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], Brazilian investigators found “a total of US$23.4 million was used as a source of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;Paraguassu, Lisandra. “Brazil Police Arrest Former Minister in World Cup Stadium Probe.” Reuters, Thomson Reuters, 6 June 2017, Retrieved April 3 2018, www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption/brazil-police-arrest-former-minister-in-world-cup-stadium-probe-idUSKBN18X129.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3520">{{Nihongo|'''Radio calisthenics'''|ラジオ体操|rajio taisō|extra=literally, "radio exercises"}} are warm-up [[calisthenics]] performed to music and guidance from radio broadcasts. They are popular in [[Japan]] and parts of Mainland [[China]] and  [[Taiwan]]. 
[[File:Rajiotaiso2013park.ogv|thumb|(video) Two men do rajio taisō in a park.]]

==Japan==
In Japan, radio calisthenics are broadcast to music on public [[NHK]] [[radio]] early in the [[morning]]. Rajio taisō were introduced to Japan in 1928 as a commemoration of the coronation of Emperor [[Hirohito]].&lt;ref name="Fukue"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090722i1.html| title = Wake up, hike out, tune in, move it | last = Fukue | first = Natsuko | publisher = Japan Times| date = 2009-07-22 | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for radio broadcast [[calisthenics]] came from the US, where during the 1920s the [[MetLife|Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.]] sponsored 15-minute radio calisthenics in major cities in the US. Visiting employees of the Japanese postal insurance division brought samples of the exercises from the US back to Japan.&lt;ref name="Fukue"/&gt; The exercises were widely used to improve the health of Japanese soldiers both at home and abroad during the 1930s and 1940s. The exercises were introduced to several other pacific nations, including Taiwan, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Indonesia]] during Japan's colonization period.

After Japan's defeat in 1945, the broadcasts were banned by the occupying powers as being too militaristic in nature. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7KkQB10-Kw&amp;t=1071| title = Begin Japanology: Radio Callisthenics | publisher = NHK| date = 2015-06-25 | accessdate = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several rewrites to the exercise routine, it was reintroduced by NHK radio in 1951 with the support of the education ministry, health ministry, the Japan Gymnastic Association and the Japan Recreation Association.&lt;ref name="Fukue"/&gt;

==China==

China also has such calisthenics. They have been mandatory since 2011.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Originally they were introduced by [[Mao Zedong]] in 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnakWocA3sc |accessdate = 2013-05-01 | title=Chairman Mao's 4 Minute Workout}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the broadcasts now are run by the General Administration of Sport China.

==Current status==
Radio taisō is still used at schools as a warm up for physical education classes, during [[Sports day#Japan|sports day]] activities, and by some companies as a way of building morale and a sense of group unity, as well as to raise energy levels and encourage good health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://spice.stanford.edu/publications/10064/ | title = Japanese Radio Exercises | origyear = 1977| year = 1996 | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1117">In sports a national '''representative side''' or team is one that plays under the national name.  The phrase is often used to indicate that the team is not the official main national team.  Such unofficial or subsidiary teams are usually legitimate but rarely exist for longer than a single game or competition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17603">The '''reserve clause''', in [[North American]] [[professional sports]], was part of a player contract which stated the rights to players were retained by the team upon the contract's expiration. Players under these contracts were not free to enter into another contract with another team. Once signed to a contract, players could, at the team's whim, be reassigned, traded, sold, or released.

The only negotiating leverage of most players was to hold out at contract time and to refuse to play unless their conditions were met. Players were bound to negotiate a new contract to play another year for the same team or to ask to be released or traded.

They had no freedom to change teams unless they were given an unconditional release. In the days of the reserve clause, that was the only way a player could be a free agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reserve Clause|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/reserve_clause|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once common in sports, the clause was abolished in [[baseball]] in 1975. The reserve clause system has, for the most part, been replaced by [[free agency]].

==History and baseball==
In the late 19th century, [[baseball]] in America became popular enough that its major teams began to be businesses worth considerable amounts of money, and the players began to be paid sums that were well above the wages earned by common workers.  To keep player salary demands in check, team owners promulgated a standardized contract for the players, in which the major variable was salary. The players unsuccessfully tried to fight the growing ''reserve system'' by forming a union, the Brotherhood, and founding their own [[Players' League]] in 1890, but the PL lasted just one season. For the next 80 years, the ''reserve system'' ruled the game.  In this era, all player contracts were for one year. There were no long-term contracts as there are today, because the reserve clause negated the need for them.

The Reserve Clause's inception was in 1879, when it was proposed as an unofficial rule known as "the Five Man Rule." It would allow teams to reserve players for each season, unless a player opted out of his contract and did not play in the league for a year. While the rule was not secret, teams started to sign other teams' "reserved players", thus encroaching the rule. These controversies caused the [[National League]] to instate the rule officially on December 6, 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Morris|first= Peter|authorlink= |title= A Game of Inches: the Stories behind the Innovations That Shaped Baseball|url= |chapter= The Reserve Clause|year= 2010|publisher= Ivan R. Dee|location= Chicago|isbn= 1-56663705-8|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams realized that if players were free to go from team to team then salaries would escalate dramatically. Therefore, they seldom granted players (at least valuable ones) a release, but retained their rights, or traded them to other teams for the rights to other players, or sold them outright for cash. Players thus had a choice only of signing for what their team offered them, or "holding out" (refusing to play, and therefore, not being paid).

Under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890, two or more non-affiliated companies in any other interstate business were prohibited from colluding with each other to fix prices or establish schedules or rates. Enforcement of the Act reached its apotheosis in 1910 when the Supreme Court affirmed the government's order to dissolve the Standard Oil conglomerate. Yet it was argued that to keep baseball (the only large-scale professional sport in America during the 1920s) prosperous, granting it immunity from the Sherman Act was in the best interests of the game and the nation.

Thus, the [[United States Supreme Court]] had held in 1922 in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]'' (259 U.S. 200) that baseball was an "amusement", and that organizing a schedule of games between independently owned and operated clubs operating in various states, and engaging in activities incidental thereto, did not constitute "[[interstate commerce]]" and therefore [[antitrust]] laws did not apply to such activity, a ruling that, as of now, has never been overturned, despite efforts to do in [[Toolson v. New York Yankees]] and [[Flood v. Kuhn]].

This pass on "[[trust-busting]]" essentially codified the reserve clause for many years, and gave what came to be known as Major League Baseball unprecedented power over both players and the independent organizations of the [[National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues]] (NAPBL). MLB could dictate not only how and where professional players could move between major league clubs, but as they took the opportunity of the [[Great Depression]] to establish systems of [[farm team]]s of players wholly owned by the parent clubs placed on 'independent' teams from the NA leagues around the country, they developed a way of expanding control of contracts of virtually the entire pool of professional baseball players.

When other team sports, particularly [[ice hockey]], [[American football|football]], and [[basketball]] developed professional [[sports league|leagues]], their owners essentially emulated baseball's reserve clause.  This system stood almost unchallenged, other than by the occasional holdout, for many years.

In October 1969, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] outfielder [[Curt Flood]]  unsuccessfully challenged his trade to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].  Flood sacrificed the remainder of his playing career to pursue this litigation.  Flood's case established that the reserve clause was a legitimate basis for negotiation in [[collective bargaining]] between players and owners,{{how|date=August 2017}} and that the historic baseball antitrust exemption was valid for baseball only and not applicable to any other sport.  [[Curt Flood]] unsuccessfully challenged the reserve clause in court in 1970, but [[Marvin Miller]] helped overturn it five years later in the [[Seitz decision]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flynn|first=Neal|authorlink= |title= Baseball's Reserve System: The Case and Trial of Curt Flood Vs. Major League Baseball|url= |accessdate= |year= 2006|publisher= Walnut Park Group Inc.|location= |isbn= 0-97765780-9|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Removing the reserve clause from player contracts became the primary goal of negotiations between the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] and the owners. The reserve clause was struck down in [[1975 in baseball|1975]] when arbitrator [[Seitz decision|Peter Seitz]] ruled that since pitchers [[Andy Messersmith]] and [[Dave McNally]] had played for one season without a contract, they could become free agents. This decision essentially dismantled the reserve clause and opened the door to widespread free agency within North American professional baseball.

Other sports soon followed suit.

==NFL==
On June 18, 1921, the NFL ratified its first constitution.&lt;ref name="Willis, 2010, p. 136."&gt;Willis, 2010, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The reserve clause ratified in the constitution was similar to that of baseball's at the time. The reserve clause stipulated that a team had the first opportunity to sign a player after the length of the contract had expired. If the team chose not to offer a contract, then the player could try to sign with a team of his choosing.&lt;ref name="Willis, 2010, p. 137."&gt;Willis, 2010, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, the reserve clause bound the player "...to his employer in perpetuity".&lt;ref name="Algeo, 2006, p. 150."&gt;Algeo, 2006, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The reserve clause had been abolished in the NFL constitution in 1948 when the option clause was created.
&lt;ref name="Lyons, 2010, p. 186."&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The option clause stated that a team may choose to automatically keep a player on their team for another year, at the same pay, after his contract had expired.&lt;ref name=RUCK293&gt;Ruck; Paterson and Weber, 2010, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyons, 2010, p. 176."&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The term, option clause, was not used by the print media and it was instead referred to as the reserve clause.&lt;ref name="Lyons, 2010, p. 176."&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in the NFL's attempt to gain antitrust exemption from Congress in 1957, [[Bert Bell]] still referred to the clause as the option clause (and also as the "option and reserve clause").&lt;ref name="Lyons, 2010, p. 261."&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades later, [[National Football League|NFL]] players' mobility was limited by the so-called "[[Pete Rozelle|Rozelle Rule]]", named for the commissioner who first implemented it, which allowed the commissioner to "compensate" any team who lost a free agent to another team by taking something of equivalent value, usually [[sports draft|draft]] picks, from the team that had signed the free agent and giving it to the team the player had left.  Fear of losing several future high draft picks greatly limited free agency as no team wanted to sign a veteran player only to learn that it would lose, for example, its next two first-round draft picks.  The Rozelle Rule was eventually replaced by "Plan B", which allowed a team to name a thirty-seven man roster the reserve clause would apply to, and all players not included on this list were free agents.  Obviously, few top-echelon players were left off this thirty-seven man roster unless they happened to be injured.  Courts eventually ruled this plan to be an antitrust violation, and something resembling true free agency came to pro football.  Now, exclusive rights to a player are only for the first three years after his selection in the college draft.  At the end of the first three years, a player can be a "restricted free agent", allowing his former team to match any offer made to him by another.  After four years in the NFL all contracts end with the player becoming an unrestricted free agent without reserve.

There is a [[franchise tag]] option that is similar to the reserve clause; however, teams can only tag one player each year, although they can tag the same player for consecutive years.  Franchised players are eligible to receive at least 120% of their previous year's salary, and players tagged "non-exclusive" can accept offers from other teams; if the original team does not match the offer, they receive draft picks as compensation.  In recent years, many teams have opted not to exercise their right to designate the franchise tag.

==NBA==
The [[National Basketball Association]] went through several phases of compensation and other arcane provisions before reaching almost unrestricted free agency. The first player in that league—and the first American major-league athlete—to challenge the reserve clause was [[Rick Barry]]. In 1969, he wanted to leave the [[San Francisco Warriors]] after his second season to play for the [[Oakland Oaks (ABA)|Oakland Oaks]], who were coached by his father-in-law, [[Bruce Hale]]. After a court upheld it,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} Barry sat out a season before joining the Oaks.&lt;ref name="Slate Rick Barry article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hollander|first=Dave|title=Big Jerk, Bigger Hero|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2013/11/rick_barry_free_agency_one_of_the_biggest_jerks_in_basketball_history_is.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=November 24, 2013|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NHL==
The reserve clause was the basis for the NHL's injunction against the large number of players who had signed with the rival [[World Hockey Association]] in 1972, with all but one—against [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] star [[Bobby Hull]]—ultimately thrown out by lower courts. The appellate court, however, sided strongly with the WHA and Hull, calling the NHL's business practices monopolistic, conspiratorial, and illegal. While the reserve clause was not explicitly struck down, the court did effectively block any further injunctions based on the reserve clause, rendering it useless. (The WHA, meanwhile, voted at its founding to abolish the reserve clause.) The end of the reserve clause in hockey remains a significant part of the WHA's legacy, as it ultimately resulted in the evolution of the NHL's modern free agency system.

The highly contentious negotiations between [[National Hockey League]] owners and players that led to a [[2004–05 NHL lockout|lockout]], wiping out the entire [[2004–05 NHL season]], were in part about free agency; the previous system precluded unrestricted free agency before the player reached 31 years of age. Most younger hockey free agents were restricted free agents whose teams could retain them by matching an offer from another club or making a "qualifying offer", which usually consisted of a ten percent raise above the pay in the former contract. Following the 2004-05 lockout, owners eventually agreed to phase in a much lower age for unrestricted free agency (27 years of age or 7 years in the NHL, whichever comes first) in exchange for the players meeting owners' principal demand in the new [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement]]&amp;mdash;an overall [[salary cap]]. Nevertheless, the league demanded the re-imposition of the 31-year-old threshold for free agency in the [[2012–13 NHL lockout|most recent lockout]], but when union responded by threatening to disclaim interest and file antitrust suits against the league, the owners backed down.

==Major League Soccer==
Major League Soccer ([[MLS]]) is a professional [[association football|soccer]] league representing the sport's highest level in both the [[United States soccer league system|United States]] and [[Canadian soccer league system|Canada]].&lt;ref name=fraser&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Fraser v. Major League Soccer |vol=01 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1296 |court=1st Cir. |date=2002 |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-1st-circuit/1441684.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLS constitutes one of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports leagues]] of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/haydons-soccer-pitch/2013/mar/27/mls-most-diverse-americas-big-five-team-sports/|title=MLS is most diverse of America's big five team sports|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other four "major" leagues of North American professional sport, MLS still retains a reserve clause in every player's contract. For Major League Soccer, this was initially to prevent [[MLS#Teams|clubs]] from competing with each other for player contracts, an aspect of single-entity designed to protect it from antitrust lawsuits.&lt;ref name="NY Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/25/stoppage-time-an-mls-strike-over-free-agency-a-possibility/|title=Stoppage time: MLS players may strike over free agency|work=New York Post|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLS is a single entity in which each team is owned and controlled by the league's investors.&lt;ref name="findlaw"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Fraser v.

The league takes an additional step, imposing the reserve clause for players indefinitely, making player rights a commodity within the team structure for long after the player has left the league.&lt;ref name="US National Soccer Players Union"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/2013/05/corner-the-reserve-clause.html|title=The Reserve Clause in Soccer|work=Labor Union|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2322">The '''short course prevention factor''' ('''SCPF''') is a multiplicative factor or [[coefficient]] used in the sport of [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], specifically [[road running]], to ensure that the measured length of a course is at least as long as the desired length of the course. The [[International Association of Athletics Federations]], the international [[sport governing body|governing body]] for athletics, as well as [[USA Track &amp; Field]], the national governing body for the [[United States]], specify the numerical factor of the SCPF to be 1.001. The SCPF has important implications when verifying [[world record]] performances.

However, just because the SCPF has been added to the measurement calculation, that does not mean that a 10k course is 10,010 meters in length.  The SCPF is designed to make sure that, in spite of wobble of the bicycle used for measuring, or small curves to avoid potholes or other obstructions, the course will still be at least as long as the advertised distance.  All certified 10k courses should be longer than 10,000 meters, but will normally be less than 10,010 meters,{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} depending on the measurer, and obstructions/hazards present during measurement.

The SCPF applies to courses measured by a bicycle and does not apply to measurements made with a steel tape or with an electronic measuring device.

'''Sports economics''' is a discipline of [[economics]] focused on its relationship to [[sports]]. It covers both the ways in which economists can study the distinctive institutions of sports, and the ways in which sports can allow economists to research many topics, including [[discrimination]] and [[antitrust law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195387773.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195387773 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Sports Economics |date=2012-04-13 |publisher=Oxford University Press |language=en |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195387773.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical foundations of the discipline are heavily based on [[microeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.studyingeconomics.ac.uk/module-options/sports-economics/ |title=Sports Economics  |website=Studying Economics |language=en |access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, about 100 to 120 college professors taught sports economics courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/2006-07-27-sports-econ-usat_x.htm |title=Batter up!

[[File:Brooke Sweat and Jennifer Fopma at Hermosa Beach 2012 (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|US women's [[beach volleyball]] team has cited several advantages to bikini uniforms, such as comfort while playing on sand during hot weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ijr.com/2016/08/670528-heres-why-the-usa-womens-volleyball-team-refuses-to-stop-wearing-bikinis/|title=Here's Why the USA Women’s Volleyball Team Refuses to Stop Wearing Bikinis|date=August 11, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photo shows US beach volleyball players [[Jennifer Fopma]] and [[Brooke Sweat]] in their uniforms.]]

'''Sportswear''' or '''activewear''' is [[clothing#Sport and activity|clothing]], including [[footwear#Shoes|footwear]], worn for [[sport]] or [[physical exercise]]. Or it can be a crop top.

Sport-specific clothing is worn for most sports and physical  exercise, for practical, comfort or safety reasons.

Typical sport-specific garments include [[tracksuit]]s, [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s and [[polo shirt]]s. Specialized garments include [[swimsuit#Competitive swimwear|swimsuits]] (for [[human swimming|swimming]]), [[wet suit]]s (for [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[ski suit]]s (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Sports footwear include [[athletic shoe|trainers]], [[football boot]]s, [[riding boot]]s, and [[ice skate]]s. Sportswear also includes [[bikini]] and some [[crop tops]] and
[[undergarments]], such as the [[jockstrap]] and [[sports bra]]. Sportswear is also at times worn as [[casual attire|casual]] [[fashion]] clothing.

For most sports the athletes wear a combination of different items of clothing, e.g. [[sport shoe]]s, [[trousers|pants]] and [[shirt]]s. In some sports, protective gear may need to be worn, such as [[helmet]]s or [[American football]] body armour.

Sports fabrics are technical materials which help to keep the wearer comfortable during exercise. The type of fabric required will depend upon the intensity of the exercise and the activity. [[Yoga pants|Yoga clothing]] should use fabrics with good stretch ability for easy movement which will likely require the fabric to be of a knitted construction. Apparel for long distance running will keep the wearer in good comfort if it has excellent moisture wicking properties to enable sweat to transfer from the inside to the outside for the garment. Performance clothing for outdoor sports in the winter or snow sports ought to use breathable fabrics with very good insulating properties.

==Functional considerations==
[[File:Messi FC BARCELONA - ARSENAL 8 MAR 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Male football players of opposite teams wearing different colour outfits, while the referee is in white T-shirt.]]

Sportswear is typically designed to be lightweight so as not to encumber the wearer. The best athletic wear for some forms of exercise, for example [[cycling]], should not create drag or be too bulky.

On the other hand, sportswear should be loose enough so as not to restrict movement. Some sports have specific style requirements, for example the [[keikogi]] used in [[karate]]. Various physically dangerous sports require protective gear, e.g. for fencing, American football, or ice hockey.

Standardized sportswear may also function as a uniform. In team sports the opposing sides are usually identified by the colors of their clothing, while individual team members can be recognized by a back number on a shirt.

In some sports, specific items of clothing are worn to differentiate roles within a team. For example, in [[volleyball]], the [[volleyball#libero|libero]] (a specialist in defensive play) wears a different colour to that of their teammates. In sports such as [[soccer]] and [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] codes, a contrasting colour or pattern is worn by the goalkeeper. In other sports, clothing may indicate the current status or past achievements of a participant. In cycling disciplines, the [[rainbow jersey]] indicates the current world champion, and in major road cycling races, [[cycling jersey|jersey]]s of particular colours are worn by the race leader and leaders of auxiliary classifications.

[[Spandex]] is the preferred material for [[form-fitting]] sportswear, such as used in wrestling, [[track &amp; field]], dance, gymnastics, [[speed skating]], and [[Human swimming|swimming]].

Sportswear is commonly used as a means for the promotion of sponsors of a sportsperson or team. In some sports, there are regulations limiting the size or design of sponsorship brand names and logos on items of clothing.

==Thermal properties==
Sportswear design must consider the [[thermal insulation]] needs of the wearer. In hot situations, sportswear should allow the wearer to stay cool; while in cold situations, sportswear should help the wearer to stay warm.

Sportswear should also be able to transfer sweat away from the skin, using, for example, moisture transferring fabric. [[Spandex]] is a popular material used as base layers to soak up sweat. For example, in activities such as [[skiing]] and [[mountain climbing]] this is achieved by using layering: moisture transferring (wicking) materials are worn next to the skin, followed by an insulating layer, and then wind and water resistant shell garments.

==Moisture-wicking fabrics==
[[File:MoistureTransferringFabric.jpg|thumb|left|Moisture transferring fabric]]
Moisture-wicking fabrics are a class of hi-tech fabrics that provide moisture control for an athlete's skin. They move perspiration away from the body to the fabric's outer surface where it can evaporate. These fabrics typically are soft, lightweight, and stretchy—in other words, they are perfectly suited for making activewear. Moisture-wicking means that the fabric is absorbent and this can leave a barrier of wet fabric on your skin. Drywicking is the newest variation of moisture wicking. It is a smart two tier fabric that breaks the surface tension of sweat and propels it through the hydrophobic layer into a natural wicking outer layer like cotton where it is assisted by evaporative cooling leaving your skin absolutely dry. Besides the fact that your body can perform better, it will chemically free prevent odors because a bacteria microclimate cannot grow on dry skin. This broad category of fabrics is used to make garments like T-shirts, sports bras, running and cycling jerseys, socks, tracksuits, and polo-style shirts for any physical activity where the goal is to keep your skin as cool and dry as possible. Moisture-wicking fabrics are used to make apparel for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, mountain biking, snow skiing, and mountain climbing. Due to the popularity of garments made from these fabrics, more variations are being introduced to the market.

==Golf attire==
Golf has a long tradition of specialized attire—attire that reflects the tradition of Scottish aristocrats taking in fresh air while walking around the golf course, swinging their golf clubs, and exercising in a refined, genteel sort of way.  Golf attire though, is also being influenced by modern fabrics and trends that stress function and durability.  Golfers, like athletes in other sports, are athletes first, and public figures second.  Athletes in all sports are showing a preference for moisture-wicking fabrics, crisp details, and modern fashionable colors.

==Sales trends for activewear==
[[File:Keeping Fit and Connected (6635665267) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A woman wearing [[sports bra]] and [[boyshorts]], which were conventionally women's sportswear but are now also worn as [[Casual attire|casuals]] or [[athleisure]] by women in the West.]]

As activewear becomes more fashionable and more popular with consumers, sales have increased.  Total U.S. sales of men's and women's activewear rose by 3.2% in the 12 months ending in March 2011 compared with the previous period, to $48.6 billion, according to consumer tracking firm NPD Group Inc.&lt;ref name=crainsnewyork1&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasquarelli|first=Adrianne|title=Activewear makes it onto the runway|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110710/SUB/307109990|work=Crain's New York Business|accessdate=26 October 2013|date=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all of 2011, activewear sales increased 6.7% from 2010, compared with women's apparel gains in 2011 of 3.1%, also according to NPD Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.southbendtribune.com/2012-10-15/business/34479799_1_lululemon-athletica-sales-associates-chicago-marathon |title=Activewear sales up - South Bend Tribune |publisher=Articles.southbendtribune.com |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts attribute the growth in sales to an intrinsic change in the way activewear is designed.  “Historically, what had been available to women were items based on a men's item that were just made smaller and turned a flattering color like pink,” said Scott Key, senior vice president and general manager of Athleta. “Women athletes expected more.” 
&lt;ref name="crainsnewyork1"/&gt;  Designers have recognized this "crossover" between exercise and fashion as a major opportunity for growth. It also syncs nicely with the overall trend in American fashion towards a more casual style of dress. The trend has been so popular that it has spawned a new category of casual clothing, [[athleisure]].  [[Rebecca Minkoff]] is one of the fashion designers who has an entire collection designed around the athleisure concept.

== Protective wear ==

Sportswear also includes the variety of protective gear required for contact sports such as lacrosse, boxing and ice hockey. Different types of protective equipment are needed depending on the type of sport and position. The types of gears include the following: head gear, gum shields, shin pads, shoulder pads, and joint supports.

=== Head gear ===
[[File:Tendulkar batting against Australia, October 2010 (1), cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Sachin Tendulkar]] wears traditional [[cricket whites]], together with [[pads]] to protect his legs. Both he and the short leg fielder wear [[cricket helmet]]s for protection.]]

Head gear is required for most sports with high risk of head injuries such as [[American football]], [[Bobsleigh|bobsledding]] and [[cycling]]. Injuries related to the head have the potential to cause serious damage to the spine and may be life-threatening.&lt;ref name="nsmi2"&gt;Protective wear during sport - sports injury prevention. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from Sports Medicine Information, http://www.nsmi.org.uk/articles/injury-prevention/protective-wear.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although sports like rugby and boxing do not require participants to wear head protection, trainers or referees may choose to depending on the player’s history of head related injuries.&lt;ref name="nsmi2" /&gt; Certain positions of some sports may require different type of protections. For example, goaltenders for ice hockey wear different types of face masks compared to other positions.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Helmets: How they work and what standards do. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from http://www.helmets.org/general.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They also have thick gloves with arm pads and shin guards to protect them from the high impact of pucks. In baseball, catchers and batters wear head gear for protection against the high velocity pitches. Head gear of different kinds must meet the standards of protection set by various organizations. [[Helmet]]s for American football must be regulated by the National Football League or the National Collegiate Athletics Association. Although new rules of safe play have been in effect, players are still in danger of brain damage due to repeated blows to the head.&lt;ref name="nsmi2" /&gt; Football players are more likely to develop brain related disorders during or after their careers compared to other sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/health/study-focuses-on-repeated-hits-not-concussions.html|title=Study Focuses on Repeated Hits, Not Concussions|last=Carey|first=Benedict|date=2016-03-31|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eye and face shields ===
Sports of all types may require eye or face protection depending on the players’ need. Face masks come in different forms for different types of sports. In lacrosse and American football, the masks are metal rods attached to the helmet to cover the face.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; While optional, face masks that might be seen in basketball or rugby are plastic masks that are usually molded to fit the players’ face.&lt;ref&gt;Protective eyewear for young athletes - 2013 (2013). American Academy of Ophthalmology. Retrieved from http://www.aao.org/clinical-statement/protective-eyewear-young-athletes--november-2003&lt;/ref&gt; Such masks are worn to minimize additional damage to an already injured part of the face.

Eye protection is an additional support provided by sports goggles. Goggles may be worn in lieu of glasses or contacts. Goggles are reliable in the fact that they do not move around while the player is in motion and they protect the eye from foreign objects.&lt;ref&gt;Sports and your eyes. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from National Eye Institute, https://nei.nih.gov/sports&lt;/ref&gt; For swimmers and divers, goggles keep the water away from their eyes, thus improving visibility.

=== Mouth guards ===
Mouth guards are used in many sports including but not limited to: [[rugby football|rugby]], lacrosse, boxing, water polo, ice hockey, American football, basketball, field hockey, and various martial arts.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Mouth guards reduce the risk of sport related dental injuries. Contact or some team sports have a risk of causing injuries related with the mouth, [[jaw]], teeth and oral soft [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Wearing mouth guards are not required in any sports but the players are recommended to.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Mouthguards. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from American Dental Association, http://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/mouthguards&lt;/ref&gt;

== Snow gear and ski apparel ==
[[File:Vonn-lindsey 15-12-07 - 007.jpg|thumb|left|Professional USA ski racer [[Lindsey Vonn]] dressed for a race.]]
Different types of attire are needed for extreme weather conditions like snow. Thicker coats or jackets, gloves and boots are necessities in the cold. Winter sports such as snowboarding and skiing require the riders and skiers to be properly geared in the snow. Snow jackets differ from casual coats such that they may be packed with extra insulation and thicker coating materials.&lt;ref name="berry2" /&gt; The insulation is usually made with down, which is the layer of fine feathers from geese or ducks.&lt;ref name="berry2"&gt;Berry, G. (2011, December 28). A guide to insulated winter jackets that are not made with down. Retrieved March 17, 2016, from One Green Planet, http://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/a-guide-to-insulated-winter-jackets-that-are-not-made-with-down/&lt;/ref&gt; These feathers are naturally insulated to keep the birds warm in the harsh winter weathers. The feathers trap air inside and keep the body heat from flowing out.&lt;ref name="berry2" /&gt; Down is also considered to be the highest quality of insulation for jackets. It is light and compressible. Alternative types of insulation are being invented including: synthetic microfibers and polyester-based insulation.&lt;ref name="berry2" /&gt; These materials perform as well as down if not better and are becoming popular in the markets with the help of major brands using such materials for their equipment.

Winter gear must also be flexible so that it may offer a wide range of movement. An ideal jacket would have enough insulation to be warm but light, it should be made with material that are not restricting.&lt;ref name="porter2"&gt;Porter, J. (2016). How to choose the best ski jacket. Retrieved March 31, 2016, from http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Ski-Jacket-Reviews/Buying-Advice&lt;/ref&gt; Jackets with down will be light and warm but they tend to be more expensive. Also down jackets usually are not water-resistant. Synthetic insulated jackets, however, are water-resistant and cheaper than down but lose their insulating factors and are heavier.&lt;ref name="porter2" /&gt;

In the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], the variety of equipment used contain materials such as aluminum, fiberglass, mineral-based fibers and specialty steel alloys. Skis and snowboards are made up of carbon-fiber, aluminum, titanium and boron-fiber with tungsten alloys. Boots are made with ceramic fibers and steel.&lt;ref&gt;Olympics 2014: Let the Science Begin!

'''Blood flow restriction training''' abbreviated '''BFR training''') or Occlusion Training is an exercise approach whereby resistance exercise or aerobic exercise is performed whilst a tourniquet is applied to proximal aspect of the muscle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=Brendan R.|last2=Loenneke|first2=Jeremy P.|last3=Slattery|first3=Katie M.|last4=Dascombe|first4=Ben J.|date=March 2015|title=Exercise with blood flow restriction: an updated evidence-based approach for enhanced muscular development|journal=Sports Medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)|volume=45|issue=3|pages=313–325|doi=10.1007/s40279-014-0288-1|issn=1179-2035|pmid=25430600|url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/33345/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this novel training method, limb blood flow is restricted via a cuff throughout the contraction cycle and rest period.

==Application==
Many practitioners are using a range of equipment as well as BFR protocols that do not match usage within published literature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patterson|first=Stephen D.|last2=Brandner|first2=Christopher R.|date=February 2017|title=The role of blood flow restriction training for applied practitioners: A questionnaire-based survey|journal=Journal of Sports Sciences|volume=36|issue=2|pages=123–130|doi=10.1080/02640414.2017.1284341|pmid=28143359|issn=0264-0414}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The current approaches that focus on applying BFR during exercise consist of automatic pneumatic tourniquet systems or handheld manual blood pressure cuffs, and more recently elastic wraps, at a range of different pressures and durations.  Research demonstrating the influence of thigh circumference and cuff width &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loenneke|first=Jeremy P.|last2=Fahs|first2=Christopher A.|last3=Rossow|first3=Lindy M.|last4=Sherk|first4=Vanessa D.|last5=Thiebaud|first5=Robert S.|last6=Abe|first6=Takashi|last7=Bemben|first7=Debra A.|last8=Bemben|first8=Michael G.|date=2011-12-06|title=Effects of cuff width on arterial occlusion: implications for blood flow restricted exercise|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=112|issue=8|pages=2903–2912|doi=10.1007/s00421-011-2266-8|pmid=22143843|pmc=4133131|issn=1439-6319}}&lt;/ref&gt; on occlusion pressure has accentuated a likely need for an individualised approach to BFR, particularly with regard to the setting of the restriction pressure. More recently, a technique to calculate and prescribe the occlusive stimulus as a percentage of total limb occlusion pressure is just one example of efforts to account for the above factors and provide an individualised approach to prescribing BFR training that is relatively quick and inexpensive. While the relationship between BFR pressure and the underlying tissue compression during exercise is not yet fully understood, BFR training using 40%–80% of limb occlusion pressure is safe and effective when supervised by experienced practitioners &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soligon|first=SD|last2=Lixandrão|first2=ME|last3=Biazon|first3=TMPC|last4=Angleri|first4=V|last5=Roschel|first5=H|last6=Libardi|first6=CA|date=September 2018|title=Lower occlusion pressure during resistance exercise with blood-flow restriction promotes lower pain and perception of exercise compared to higher occlusion pressure when the total training volume is equalized|journal=Physiology International|volume=105|issue=3|pages=276–284|doi=10.1556/2060.105.2018.3.18|pmid=30269562|issn=2498-602X}}&lt;/ref&gt; ; therefore, lower pressures may provide less risk without the need for higher pressure.

In sport, a '''whitewash''' is a game or series in which the losing person or team fails to score. A whitewash may be in a single game where the loser fails to score any points or goals, or in a series where the loser fails to win a game.  In [[North American English|North America]] the two are differentiated, with the former called a [[shutout]] and the latter a '''sweep'''.

It is not typically used for games such as [[soccer|football]] where a failure to score is very common; the winning team's [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] is said to keep a [[clean sheet]] if they do not concede a goal.

==Usage by sport==
===Cricket===
In [[cricket]], a whitewash is when a team wins all the matches played in a series of at least 3 matches.

Examples include;

* [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]'s 5–0 defeat of [[England cricket team|England]] to win the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1920–21|1920-21 Ashes series]].
* [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]]' consecutive 5–0 defeats of [[England cricket team|England]] in [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1984|1984]] and [[English cricket team in the West Indies in 1985-86|1985-86]]. These two [[Wisden Trophy]] results are also commonly labelled '''blackwashes''' because of the dark skin of the West Indies players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/jamaica/sports1.shtml |title=Blackwash |work=I love Jamaica |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]'s 5–0 defeat of the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 2000–01 to win the [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 2000–01|Frank Worrell Trophy]]
* [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]'s 5–0 defeat of [[England cricket team|England]] to win the [[2006–07 Ashes series]].
* [[England cricket team|England]]'s 4–0 defeat of [[Indian cricket team|India]] to win the [[Pataudi Trophy]] during India's tour of England in 2011.
* [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]'s 4–0 defeat of [[Indian cricket team|India]] to win the 2011–12 [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]].
* [[Indian cricket team|India]]'s 4–0 defeat of [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] to win the 2012–13 [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]].
* [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]'s 5–0 defeat of [[England cricket team|England]] to win the [[2013–14 Ashes series]].

===Rugby union===
The term whitewash is also used in [[rugby union]] when one team loses every match in a particular series. The team that comes last in the [[Six Nations Championship]] has the ignominy of being awarded the [[Wooden spoon (award)#Rugby union|wooden spoon]], even if they have not suffered a complete whitewash.

===Tennis===
In [[ATP (tennis)|ATP]] and [[WTA (tennis)|WTA]] tennis, the term ''whitewash'' is used when a player fails to win a game in a match (6–0, 6–0, 6–0; or 6–0, 6–0), also called a triple- or double-bagel respectively. Double bagels are more common.
