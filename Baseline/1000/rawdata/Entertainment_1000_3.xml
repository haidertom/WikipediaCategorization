[[File:Anvil firing launch.jpg|thumb|An anvil being fired]]
'''Anvil firing''' (also known in the USA as an ''anvil launching'' or an ''anvil shooting''&lt;ref&gt;“Anvil Shooting,” Tennessee Folk Series, Tennessee Arts Commission, The National Education Association and the Public Broadcasting System Radio Series, 1977-79.&lt;/ref&gt;) in the USA is the practice of firing an [[anvil]] into the air with [[gunpowder]]. In the UK this is where black powder is filled onto the top of the Anvil and ignited. If the Anvil did not shatter it was deemed safe to use. 

[[File:Anvil firing prep.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A prepared anvil. Gun powder is in a chamber between the anvils and [[visco fuse]] ]]
Typically, two anvils are used: one as a base (placed upside down), and another one (also known as the "flier") as the [[projectile]] (placed right-side up, atop the base).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Angie |editor1-last=Cheek |editor2-first=Lacy Hunter |editor2-last=Nix |others=Foxfire Fund |title= The Foxfire 40th anniversary book : faith, family, and the land |url= |year=2006 |publisher= Anchor Books|location= |language= |isbn=978-0-307-27551-6 |oclc= 65538811 |pages=193–196 |chapter=Anvil Shooting |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=PohdYKIXMrYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=%22Anvil+shooting%22+Foxfire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OIcxTdEaEv&amp;sig=HMCzEHqZiOd9LsxJiPel-3T_hXo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FyanTMaZM4nJnAfJp8jZDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively, a single anvil can be fired from a [[Rock (geology)|stone]] base. The space formed by the anvil's concave base is filled with [[black powder]] (not modern [[double-base powder|gunpowder]]s, which have much higher energy densities) and a [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] is made to project out. The fuse is lit, and the resulting [[deflagration]] (the rapid [[combustion]] of the powder rather than [[detonation]]) sends the projectile anvil several feet into the air.

An alternative method is to place the bottom anvil upside down, and fill the hardy hole with black powder. A torus or [[washer (hardware)|washer]], often made from a [[playing card]], is placed over the hole, with a space for a fuse or powder trail. The top anvil is placed upside down, face to face with the bottom anvil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=A Tennessee folklore sampler : selections from the Tennessee folklore society bulletin, 1935-2009 |url= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year= |month= |origyear= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=131 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anvil firing was once commonly performed in the [[Southern United States]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} as a substitute for [[fireworks]] during celebrations. One such noteworthy celebration was held on the day the state of [[Texas]] voted to [[Secession|secede]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. On February 23, 1861, [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] and prominent [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] supporter, [[Thomas Lopton Campbell Jr.]], was held captive and forced to "fire the anvils" in the streets of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |chapter=ch. 9, "Boom Of Anvils"
  |publisher=Enid  |location=Oklahoma
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anvils were also traditionally fired on [[St Clement's Day|St. Clement's Day]], honoring [[Pope Clement I]], the [[patron saint]] of [[blacksmiths]] and metalworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.okehamptonpeople.co.uk/news/Blacksmiths-celebrate-St-Clement-s-Day-Sticklepath-s-Finch-Foundry-November-21st/story-4537589-detail/story.html |title=Blacksmiths celebrate St Clement's Day at Sticklepath's Finch Foundry - November 21st |last1=Short |first1=Walter |date=17 November 2009 |work= |publisher=okehamptonpeople |accessdate=1 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416031024/http://www.okehamptonpeople.co.uk/news/Blacksmiths-celebrate-St-Clement-s-Day-Sticklepath-s-Finch-Foundry-November-21st/story-4537589-detail/story.html |archivedate=16 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although its practice has lessened in recent years,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} enthusiasts still participate in anvil launching events and competitions. On September 5, 2011, [[The Science Channel]] premiered ''[[Flying Anvils]]'', a reality television series about anvil firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv/flying-anvils/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128105332/http://science.discovery.com/tv/flying-anvils/ |archivedate=2013-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers==
Individuals may be crushed by a falling anvil. The black powder can also prematurely ignite when the top anvil is placed, which can cause black marks on any nearby individuals.

As in any case where an [[explosive]] is confined on all sides by [[metal]], [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] presents a hazard. If a damaged or structurally weak anvil is used, the anvil base may shatter upon [[Combustion|ignition]].

==Physics and chemistry==
The technique depends on the fact that [[black powder]] is a [[low explosive]], which burns more rapidly when under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gurstelle|first1= William |authorlink1= William Gurstelle|title= Absinthe &amp; flamethrowers : projects and ruminations on the art of living dangerously |url= |year= 2009 |publisher= Chicago Review Press|location= Chicago |isbn= 978-1-55652-822-4|oclc= 273817829 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical uses==
A 21 anvil salute replaced the traditional 21 gun salute on [[Victoria Day]] 1860 in [[New Westminster, British Columbia]], after the town's cannon and status as capital of British Columbia was taken away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.genesreunited.co.uk/boards.asp?wci=thread&amp;tk=1222899 |title=The Anvil Salute |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher=Genes Reunited |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 1864 during the Civil War, the commander of the [[Iowa]] Home Guard militia in [[Davis County, Iowa]], having no artillery piece at his disposal, ordered a local citizen to fire an anvil in the county seat at Bloomfield to alert militiamen in outlying townships in response to intelligence received of the presence of Confederate bushwhackers in Davis County. This was in response to a report of two suspected Confederate guerrillas at a residence in the neighborhood where they had demanded money and food and had terrorized the occupants, Mr. and Mrs. Gore. The private citizen who carried out the order to fire the anvil was seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;Report of Lieutenant Colonel S.A. Moore, Iowa Home Guard, January 1, 1865 in A History of Davis County Iowa, 1886, pp 556–566.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''BattleBots''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[robot combat]] [[television]] series.  Competitors design and operate remote-controlled armed and armored machines designed to fight in an arena combat elimination [[tournament]].  For five seasons, ''BattleBots'' aired on the American [[Comedy Central]] and was hosted by [[Bil Dwyer]], [[Sean Salisbury]], and [[Tim Green]]. Comedy Central's first season premiered on August 23, 2000, and its fifth and last season ended on December 21, 2002.

A six-episode revival series premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on June 21, 2015, to generally favorable reviews and ratings.  Additionally, ABC renewed ''BattleBots'' for a seventh season, which premiered on June 23, 2016. 

Though not officially cancelled, ''BattleBots'' was removed from the ABC website's list of current reality shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC Reality shows|url=http://abc.go.com/shows?category=reality|website=ABC|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, [[Discovery Channel]] and [[Science (TV network)|Science]] picked up the show for its eighth season, which began airing on May 11, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='BattleBots' Revived on Discovery and Science Channels (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/battlebots-revived-discovery-science-channels-1081917|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=7 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==
''BattleBots'' is an offshoot of the original American version of ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'', the brainchild of Marc Thorpe. Robot Wars had financial backing from Sm:)e communications, a New York record company. The Thorpe/Sm:)e partnership broke up in 1997, starting many years of legal wrangling between Thorpe and [[Profile Records]] (the former Sm:)e communications). Profile licensed ''Robot Wars'' to a UK production company and ''Robot Wars'' ran for seven years as a popular television program in the UK, before being revived for 2016.

The robot builders left behind in San Francisco formed BattleBots, Inc. and began a series of competitions. The first was held in Long Beach, California in August 1999 and [[webcast|streamed online]], attracting 40,000 streams. Lenny Stucker, a television producer known for his work on telecasts of [[professional boxing]], was in attendance, and showed interest in being involved with ''BattleBots''—believing the concept of [[robot combat]] was "hip" and having shown an interest in technology. Stucker made changes to the competition's format and presentation to make it more suitable for television, including elements reminiscent of boxing (such as a red and blue corner) and shifting to a single-elimination format. The creators tried selling the competition as a television series to networks such as [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[HBO]], and [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]]—but they failed to understand the concept of the program or take it seriously. A second event was held as a [[pay-per-view]] in [[Las Vegas]] in 1999; the PPV was in turn, used as a [[Television pilot|pilot]] to pitch the show again, with a higher rate of success.&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Robot Wars: An oral history of the birth and death of BattleBots|url=https://www.sbnation.com/longform/2013/6/18/4438250/battlebots-robot-wars-combat-oral-history|website=SBNation|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the networks interested was [[Comedy Central]], who would ultimately pick up the program. [[Debbie Liebling]], the network's Senior Vice President of original programming and development, felt that the concept would appeal to the network's young adult demographic, explaining that "it was really funny, and really nerdy. The Internet was not a big thing yet, so the nerd culture wasn't so celebrated. It was sports for the nerdy person, I guess."&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt; Co-creator Greg Munson viewed the deal as a double-edged sword; it gave ''BattleBots'' an outlet and a larger budget, but the network insisted on the addition of comedic aspects to ''BattleBots'' as a program, such as [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] involving contestants. However, the competition itself was not affected by this mandate; Liebling described the final product as being "a parody of a sports show without being a parody". Munson lamented that the network had also ignored his suggestion for the co-host role to be filled by "attractive geek girls" with sufficient knowledge to speak with builders, having elected to "[keep] throwing bigger and better hot babes at it", such as [[Carmen Electra]].&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt;

Despite this, viewership and awareness of ''BattleBots'' grew progressively over time; contestants Christian Carlberg and Lisa Winter would be invited to appear on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''BattleBots'' beat ''[[South Park]]'' as Comedy Central's highest-rated program for a period during season 3, competitor interest grew, and licensing deals also emerged.&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt; The success of ''BattleBots'', however, resulted in competition from other broadcasters; [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] introduced a competing program, ''[[Robotica]]'', while other channels imported episodes of the British ''Robot Wars'' series.&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt; By 2002, the program had begun to face further difficulties; Munson felt that the bouts had become "homogenized" because the participants had "perfected" the sport of robot fighting, leading to a lack of innovation in robot designs and strategies.&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt; Furthermore, ''BattleBots'' had sued [[Anheuser-Busch]] and its advertising agency for producing and airing a [[Super Bowl commercial|commercial]] during [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] that parodied the program and featured a robot greatly resembling one from ''BattleBots'' (this lawsuit, however, would be dismissed in 2004, after a judge ruled that the ad was a [[parody]] protected by [[fair use]]).&lt;ref name=lat-battlebotslawsuit&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawsuit Over Bud Light Ad Dismissed|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/13/business/fi-bots13|accessdate=29 June 2015|agency=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2002, Comedy Central cancelled ''BattleBots'' after its fifth season, ''BattleBots 5.0''. [[Viacom]] would acquire full control of the network in April 2003;&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnmoney-viacombuyscc&gt;{{cite web|title=Viacom buys Comedy Central|url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/04/22/news/companies/viacom/|website=CNNMoney|publisher=CNN|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stucker believed that Comedy Central had become "tired" of the program, and Roski stated that Viacom had wanted to shift Comedy Central back towards traditional comedy programming.&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt;

In December 2014, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] announced that it had picked up a six-episode revival of ''BattleBots'', produced by [[Whalerock Industries]], to premiere in June 2015.

==Gameplay==

===Weight classes===
Robots at BattleBots tournaments were separated into four weight classes in seasons 1-5. The weight limits increased slightly over time. At the final tournaments the classes were:

*Lightweight – 60 pounds (27 kilograms)
*Middleweight – 120 pounds (54 kilograms)
*Heavyweight – 220 pounds (100 kilograms)
*Superheavyweight – 340 pounds (154 kilograms)

"Walking" robots ("StompBots") propelled by means other than wheels were initially given a 50% weight bonus. The rules changed following the victory of a heavyweight StompBot (Son of Whyachi) at BattleBots 3.0. For BattleBots 4.0 and beyond only a 20% weight bonus was given to walkers and the technical rules specified that walking mechanisms not use [[cam]] operated walking mechanisms as they were functionally too similar to wheel operation.  Since the rules change, walking robots have entered the competition, but none has achieved any success beyond preliminary rounds.

Starting in season 6, there are no longer separate weight classes while the weight limit for heavyweights was increased from 220-pounds to 250-pounds.

===Matches===
Matches are three minutes long. During a match, two robots do their best to destroy each other using whatever means available.  The match begins by a series of lights that flash from yellow to green.  The original Comedy Central version used a standard Christmas tree as seen in the sport of [[drag racing]]; the ABC revival uses just one box of lights that flash yellow three times, and then flash green.

There are only two events that cause the match to be paused and people enter the BattleBox. One is the event that the robots are stuck together and cannot separate or that both have simultaneously become immobilized. The other scenario is that one or both 'bots have caught on fire. In that case, the people entering the BattleBox are equipped with a fire extinguisher.

If a robot is unable to move for ten seconds, because it is too badly damaged or it is stuck on the arena hazards, it is declared knocked out.  In the Comedy Central version, the driver could also call a "tap-out" to forfeit the match if his or her robot is about to be destroyed. This ends the match ten seconds later; the opposing driver is "asked" (but not instructed) not to attack during the ten-second count.

If both robots survive the three minutes, three judges distribute a total of 45 points (15 points a judge, 5 points per judge per category) over three categories. The robot with the higher score wins.  The judging categories are Aggression, Strategy, and Damage. In Season 6 (June/July 2015), the judging categories were Aggression, Damage, Strategy, and Control. A robot who hangs back safely from its opponent will not get many Aggression points; one in there fighting the whole time, however, will.  The Strategy category is about how well a robot exploits its opponent's weaknesses, protects its own, and handles the hazards. A robot driving over the kill saws will lose points here, unless it had good reason to do so, while a robot that is able to attack its opponent's weak areas will gain points.  The Damage category is for how much damage the bot can deal to its opponent while remaining intact itself.

The winner moves on; the loser is eliminated from the tournament.

At the end of the tournament, a series of 'rumbles' or 'melee rounds' is typically held in each weight class, allowing robots that survived the main tournament to fight in a 'free for all' in a 5-minute match. Occasionally there are too many robots for one rumble, and multiple rumbles are held with the top surviving bots competing in a final event.
During the Season 5 Heavyweight rumble (the first rumble of that competition), a sheared-off robot part went through the Lexan arena roof and fell (harmlessly) into the audience. Because of this, the rest of the rumbles were canceled due to safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;RobotCombat.com http://www.robotcombat.com/nightmare_sf02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arena===
The BattleBox is a 48' x 48' square arena designed to protect the drivers, officials, and audience from flying shrapnel and charging bots. It was originally designed by Pete Lampertson.  For the 2015 season, Pete is still overseeing the box with the help of Matt Neubauer.  It has a steel floor and steel-framed walls and roof paneled with thick, bulletproof polycarbonate plastic.  The teams bring their robots in through doorways, which are sealed after all humans have exited.  The drivers control their machines from outside the sealed arena.

Arena hazards are intended to make fights more interesting and unpredictable, and to reward drivers who can avoid the hazards while pushing or carrying their opponent into them. Hazards from the first five seasons include (and where noted, omitted for the later ABC/Discovery/Science Channel-shown seasons):

*'''Pulverizers''': Originally pneumatic powered standard sledgehammers that did minimal damage, the Pulverizers were first upgraded to 50 pound aluminum mallets for season 2, and were again upgraded to 150 pound mallets for season 3 and beyond, now with one near each corner. The pulverizers were capable of causing serious damage to the lighter weight class robots.
*'''Spike Strips''':  The lower walls of the arena are lined with inward pointing 6-inch long sharpened steel spikes. Pushing an opponent hard into a wall can sometimes lodge it into the spikes, immobilizing it.
*'''Spinners''': Large, rapidly spinning discs embedded in the arena floor, Not intended to damage a robot, but rather to interfere with navigation.  The spinners could fling lighter class robots across the arena, but the impact on heavier robots was minimal. Omitted for the ABC/Discovery/Science Channel-shown seasons. 
*'''Kill Saws''': Spinning [[circular saw]] blades comprising eight twin-blade hazards, that rise out of slots in the arena floor that were originally under the control of "Pulverizer Pete".  These carbide-tipped saw blades can damage a robot's tires or chassis. In later seasons, red 'throwing blades' were added to increase the chance of a bot being thrown across the arena.
*'''Pistons''': Introduced in Season 3, the Pistons are steel columns that raise and lower from the floor without warning.  They can stop a charging robot or tip a slow moving robot onto its side. The Pistons were removed for Seasons 4 and 5, and likewise omitted for the ABC/Discovery/Science Channel-shown seasons.
*'''Ramrods''': Sharpened steel spikes that rise up out of the arena floor in groups of six, serving either to lift a robot off the ground or damage vulnerable portions of the undercarriage. Omitted for the ABC/Discovery/Science Channel-shown seasons. 
*'''Hell Raisers''': A pneumatic ram that can tilt up specific sections of the arena floor. The 15 degree tilt may become a launching ramp, or may abruptly block passage. The Hell Raisers were removed for Season 5 onwards, to allow more uncluttered room for the robots.
*'''Screws''': Introduced for season 3, these devices were a modification to the static spike strips.  The screws were continually rotating [[auger (drill)|auger]]s placed horizontally along the edges of the arena floor.  The Screws were intended to scrape up a bot, and possibly drag it closer to the Pulverizers due to the corkscrew design.  Much like the Spinners, the Screws had a greater effect on the lighter weight classes—although their impact on all weight classes was small. For Season 5 onwards, the screws were upgraded with biting 'teeth' to better catch onto robots. Their rotation was also modified  so that instead of 'pushing' in one direction, they converged in a corner from opposite directions and created a 'V' that could damage or turn over robots.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9205">The '''blow book''', better known as a '''magic coloring book''' in modern variations, is a classic [[magic trick]] that has been performed for hundreds of years. It was most popular from the [[16th]] to the [[19th]] century, when variations of the concept were a staple of the [[publishing|book publishing]] trade. It has been referred to as the oldest example of a manufactured [[Theatrical property|prop]] used for magic. It remains a common trick today, albeit mostly performed for children, preferably at birthday parties or other events due to the visual nature of the illusion.

==Effect==
The magician presents a book and [[Shuffling|riffles]] through it, showing a number of images in black and white. The book is then closed and a [[Card flourish|flourish]] is performed, normally involving [[audience participation]], originally having an audience member blow on the outside of the book. The magician picks up the book and riffles it again, revealing that the images are now colored, or have changed completely into different images depending on the nature of the book.

==History==
The blow book is one of the oldest magic tricks. It has a history that is well-documented in historical sources,{{sfn|Jay|2014|p=9}} because the trick is based on a device that was only really practical after the widespread introduction of the [[printing press]] in 1450, which created a market for inexpensive paper and binding that the trick relies upon.

The earliest known mention of the concept was by [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in 1550, who described the trick by mentioning "conjurors show different and always unlike pictures in one and the same book".{{sfn|Buchan|2013|p=61}} Another early mention is by [[Reginald Scot]] in his book ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', published in 1584. This work examined witchcraft and revealed the tricks involved, ultimately concluding that witchcraft was not real.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clements.umich.edu/exhibits/online/bannedbooks/entry2.html "Reginald Scot, The Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584)"] Clements Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Almond, [http://www.ibtauris.com/Books/Humanities/Religion%20%20beliefs/Englands%20First%20Demonologist%20Reginald%20Scot%20and%20The%20Discoverie%20of%20Witchcraft.aspx "England's First Demonologist: Reginald Scot and 'The Discoverie of Witchcraft'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114907/http://www.ibtauris.com/Books/Humanities/Religion%20%20beliefs/Englands%20First%20Demonologist%20Reginald%20Scot%20and%20The%20Discoverie%20of%20Witchcraft.aspx |date=August 26, 2014 }}, I.B.Tauris, 2011, inside cover&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this discussion he mentions the use of blow books, and goes on to describe how to prepare a book that the magician would then "whew you everie leafe to be painted with birds, then with beasts, then with serpents, then with angels, etc."{{sfn|Scot|1584|p=283}} He realized that the preparation might be beyond the capabilities of many would-be magicians, and directs his readers to "buie for a small value the like booke, at the shop of W. Brome in Powles churchyard", the earliest known example of a magic prop for sale. William Broome of St. Paul's in London was active between 1577 and 1591.{{sfn|Stafford &amp; Terpak|2001|p=253}} A similar description of the blow book was published in French the same year by Jean Prévost.{{sfn|Jay|2014|p=10}}

The blow book is mentioned in ''[[Hocus Pocus Junior]]'', the earliest known collection of magic tricks in the [[English language]], published in London in 1635. In this text the concept is called a "iugling booke" ("juggling book") or "booke for Waggery". It contains a complete description of how to prepare a blow book. The author suggests presenting the book by saying "this booke is not painted thus as some of you may suppose, but it is of such a property, that whosoever bloweth on it, it wil give the representation of whatsoever he is naturally addicted unto". He further mentions that in order for the trick to work, one must use a "bold and audacious countenance, for that must be the grace of all your trickes". Many of the tricks in the book feature the magician or an audience member blowing on the prop; this was a common fixture of the trade.{{sfn|Unknown|1635|loc=Iugling booke}} The trick continues to appear in many books on magic through time, often with references to where to buy copies; in ''The Whole Art of Legerdemain'' of 1748 it's mentioned that "the blowing Books ... may have them at my Shop on little Tower-hill".{{sfn|Stafford &amp; Terpak|2001|p=253}}

None of these very early examples of blow books are known to exist today. The earliest surviving examples are a Belgian version from the 16th century,{{sfn|Jay|2014|p=15}} and French and Italian books from the second half of the 18th century.{{sfn|Stafford &amp; Terpak|2001|p=253}} By the 19th century prices on printed materials had dropped so much that the trick was quite well known, and it was not uncommon for magicians of the period to hand them out after their performances.{{sfn|Jay|2014|p=12}} [[Quaker Oats]] even gave out a version in their cereal.&lt;ref&gt;The Print Collector's Newsletter, 1995, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic concept has never gone out of print for long, and modern examples remain widespread today, along with descriptions on how to make your own. Modern versions are typically in the form of children's [[coloring book]]s and remain popular, even appearing on [[The Wiggles]].{{sfn|Kaufman|2010|pp= 220-223}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwCdRbJEJmU The Wiggles - Magic: Coloring Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanical resemblance of the blow book to the early animation concept known as a [[flip book]] has been a subject of some consideration in animation circles. Whether the blow book inspired the flip book remains an unanswered question.{{sfn|Stafford &amp; Terpak|2001|p=253}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013|p=61}}

==Description==
The most basic version of the blow book is based on alternating pages being different widths. The book is assembled by alternating the different pages, wide, narrow, wide, narrow (etc.), and then binding them together. Images of one type, black and white for instance, are drawn on every set of facing pages with narrow on the left and wide on the right. The alternate set of images, color in this example, are drawn on the alternate sets of pages with the wide page on the left and narrow on the right. The result is a series of alternating images on sets of facing pages.{{sfn|Unknown|1635|loc=Iugling booke}}

To perform the trick, the book is held by the binding in one hand and riffled with the other; for [[right handed]] magicians this will normally mean the binding is in the left hand and the riffling is performed with the right hand. By carefully grasping the right side close to the edge, the fingers or thumb are only touching the wider pages, so when the book is riffled two pages flip each time, the wider page under the thumb, and the narrower one on top of it. This way the audience is always seeing the face side of a wide page and the back of a narrow one. To complete the trick, the book is simply riffled with the right hand inverted, or more commonly, by rotating the entire book around its transverse (horizontal) axis while the audience is directed elsewhere. This causes the upper side of the narrow pages to display along with the back of the wider ones. Images drawn on alternating pages are thus shown or hidden depending on where the thumb is placed.{{sfn|Kaufman|2010|pp= 220&amp;ndash;223}}

More complex versions of the same basic concept can be used to have multiple sets of pages with different images. In these cases the pages are wider or narrower in a pattern along the entire length of the outer edge, creating a number of "hot spots" where the book can be riffled to cause different pages to appear. ''Hocus Pocus'' creates a similar concept by using small pieces of paper pasted to the pages to create the same effect, allowing the magician to grasp the tabs while they riffle. This version allows any number of pages per flip, the ''Pocus'' version using sets of eight pages.{{sfn|Unknown|1635|loc=Iugling booke}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">'''Bourgeois tragedy''' (German: ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'') is a form of [[tragedy]] that developed in 18th-century Europe. It is a fruit of the [[the Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeois|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterized by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens.

==In England and France==
There are a few examples of tragic plays with middle-class protagonists from 17th century England (see [[domestic tragedy]]), but only in the 18th century did the general attitude change. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play: [[George Lillo]]'s ''[[The London Merchant]]; or, [[the History of George Barnwell]]'', which was first performed in 1731. In France, the first ''tragédie bourgeoise'' was ''Sylvie'' by [[Paul Landois]], which came out in 1741. Years later came two plays by [[Denis Diderot]]: ''Le fils naturel'' was first staged in 1757 and ''Le père de famille'' in the following year; while these plays were not strictly tragedies, they treat bourgeois lives in a serious manner atypical of contemporary comedy and provided models for more genuinely tragic works.

==Heroes in classical tragedy==
While ordinary people had always been the subject of [[comedy|comedies]], classical and neo-classical theorists asserted that tragic heroes should always be men of noble rank. [[Aristotle]] articulates this idea in ''ars poetica'' (''The Poetics'') and it figures prominently in later ancient writings on drama and poetics. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century critics, including the influential German [[Martin Opitz]], perpetuated the theory that only members of the higher classes were capable of suffering harm serious enough to deserve dramatic reenactment. This rule was followed throughout Europe for centuries: usually, princes and members of the nobility, such as [[Andreas Gryphius]]' Carolus Stuardus (i.e. King [[Charles I of England]]), [[Jean Racine]]'s [[Phèdre]] (the wife of [[Theseus]], a mythical king of [[Athens]]) or [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[King Lear]], serve as tragic protagonists.

==In Germany==
In Germany, where the new genre was called ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'', it was especially successful.  Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany. However, [[Christian Leberecht Martini]]'s drama ''Rhynsolt und Sapphira'' is slightly older. Lessing's ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'' of 1771 is a classic example of the German Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. Lessing also offered a thorough theoretic justification for his disregard of the old rules in his ''Hamburgische Dramaturgie''. Other important examples of German Bürgerliche Trauerspiele are ''Die Soldaten'' by [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]] (1776) and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Kabale und Liebe]]'' (1784). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/503446347|title=Exemplarity and mediocrity : the art of the average from bourgeois tragedy to realism|last=1968-|first=Fleming, Paul,|date=2009|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804769983|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=503446347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
Bourgeois tragedies tend to propagate the values of the bourgeois class to which their heroes belong. Their ideal is the virtuous citizen, who is excluded from state affairs and whose intentions are focused on his private life and the life of his family. Values like virtue, humanity, individuality and true feelings are cherished in bourgeois tragedies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10678">[[File:Buttered cat.png|thumb|A cartoon illustration of the [[thought experiment]]]]

The '''buttered cat paradox''' is a common joke based on the [[tongue-in-cheek]] combination of two [[adage]]s:

* [[Cat righting reflex|Cats always land on their feet]].
* Buttered toast always lands [[Buttered toast phenomenon|buttered side down]].

The [[paradox]] arises when one considers what would happen if one attached a piece of buttered toast (butter side up) to the back of a cat, then dropped the cat from a large height. The buttered cat paradox, submitted by artist [[John Frazee]] of [[Kingston, New York]], won a 1993 ''[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]]'' magazine competition about paradoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Scot |date=July 1993 |title=I have a theory... |magazine=Omni |url=http://www.housevampyr.com/training/library/books/omni/OMNI_1993_07.pdf |page=96 |volume=15 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verley |first=Jason C. |date=November 2001 |title=Letters: More on Alternate Theories |magazine=APS News |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200111/letters.cfm |volume=10 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic premise, stating the conditions of the cat and bread and posed as a question, was presented in a routine by comic and juggler [[Michael Davis (juggler)|Michael Davis]], appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]'', July 22, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq0YjR11bx8 ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'', July 22, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thought experiments ==
Some people jokingly maintain that the experiment will produce an [[anti-gravity]] effect.  They propose that as the cat falls towards the ground, it will slow down and start to rotate, eventually reaching a [[steady state]] of hovering a short distance from the ground while rotating at high speed as both the buttered side of the toast and the cat’s feet attempt to land on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/fmd/newsletter/Newsletter_No14.pdf |title=UoWaikato newsletter |format=PDF |date=August 2003 |publisher=University of Waikato |accessdate=2012-06-20 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In humor ==
The faux paradox has captured the imagination of science-oriented [[humorist]]s.  In May 1992, the [[Internet Oracle|Usenet Oracle]] Digest #441 included a question from a supplicant asking about the paradox.&lt;ref name=oracle&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Internet Oracle|Usenet Oracle]] |url=http://internetoracle.org/digest.cgi?N=441#441-07 |title=Usenet Oracularities #441 |date=1992-05-04 |editor-first1=Steve |editor-last=Kinzler |editor-link=Steve Kinzler |author=Usenet Oracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Testing the theory is the main theme in an episode of the [[comic book]] strip ''[[Jack B. Quick]]'', the title character seeks to test this theory, leading to the cat hovering above the ground, with the cat's wagging tail providing propulsion.  The March 31, 2005, strip of the [[webcomic]] ''[[Bunny (webcomic)|Bunny]]'' also explored the idea in the guise of a plan for a "Perpetual Motion MoggieToast 5k Power Generator", based on [[Sod's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunny-comic.com/211.html |title=Feline cunning and sods law |work=[[Bunny (webcomic)]] |first=Huw "Lem" |last=Davies |number=211 |date=2005-03-31 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Science Askew'', Donald E. Simanek comments on this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="SimanekHolden2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simanek |first1=Donald E. |last2=Holden |first2=John C. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Science Askew: A Light-hearted Look at the Scientific World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldX0FkgurzoC&amp;pg=PA201 |accessdate=2010-06-30 |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-7503-0714-7 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea appeared on the British [[panel game]] ''[[QI]]'', where the idea was discussed. As well as talking about the idea, they also brought up other questions regarding the paradox. These included:
*"Would it still work if you used [[margarine]]?",
*"Would it still work if you used [[I Can't Believe It's Not Butter]]?", and
*"What if the toast was covered in something that was not butter, but the cat thought it was butter?" (the idea being that it would act like a [[placebo]]).&lt;ref name="QI"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Hypothetical |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/episodes/8/8/ |series=QI |serieslink=QI |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |location=London |airdate=2010-11-05 |seriesno=H |number=8 |first1=Sandi |last1=Toksvig |first2=Johnny |last2=Vegas |first3=John |last3=Lloyd |last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paradox also appeared in the episode "Gravitational Anarchy" of the scientific podcast ''[[Radiolab]]''.&lt;ref name="Radiolab"&gt;{{cite episode |url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/102525-vertigo/ |title=Gravitational Anarchy |series=[[Radiolab]] |network=[[NPR]] |time=20:48 |date=2010-11-29 |accessdate=2015-01-11 |first1=Robert |last1=Krulwich |authorlink1=Robert Krulwich |first2=Jad |last2=Abumrad |authorlink2=Jad Abumrad |first3=David (guest) |last3=Quammen |authorlink3=David Quammen |first4=Neil (guest) |last4=deGrasse Tyson |authorlink4=Neil deGrasse Tyson |last-author-amp=yes}} [https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/wnycs-radiolab/id152249110 Alternate link] via [[iTunes]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a humoristic explainer animation&lt;ref name="The Cat and Jelly Toast Experiment"&gt;{{cite web |author=[http://www.barqvideo.com barqvideo] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7Is22CmY_Y |title=The Cat and Jelly Toast Experiment aka the Buttered Cat Paradox explainer |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was put together by the animated production company Barq, based on an extracted audio clip from the ''Radiolab'' episode.

It also appeared in a comics series called ''[[Kid Paddle]]'' where Kid tells the story to his gullible friend Horace while at the dinner table. The comic is fairly popular in France and Belgium.

== In reality ==
In reality, cats possess the ability to turn themselves right side up in mid-air if they should fall upside-down, known as the [[cat righting reflex]]. This enables them to land on their feet if dropped from sufficient height, about {{Convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/ |title=How does a Cat always land on its feet? |first=Huy D. |last=Nguyen |date=1998 |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Medical Engineering |accessdate=2014-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010410235503/http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/ |archivedate=2001-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toast, being an inanimate object, lacks both the ability and the desire to right itself. A study at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] involving dropping 100 slices under laboratory conditions established that toast typically lands on the floor butter-side-down as a result of the manner in which it is typically dropped from a table, and the aerodynamic drag caused by the air pockets within the bread. The toast is typically butter-side-up when dropped. As it falls, it rotates; given the typical speed of rotation and the typical height of a table, a slice of toast that began butter-side-up on the table will land butter-side-down on the floor in 81% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/-rav--r-manchester-boffins-5842879 |title=(-Rav)/ t = R: Manchester boffins find formula for why toast lands butter side down |first=Chris |last=Slater|newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2017-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional character, [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]] who appears in numerous cartoon shorts as well as [[Harvey Comics]] publication, has appeared in five films since his inception, most of which were either released in television or straight-to-video while only one was released theatrically, most are unrelated to each other.

Like in the comics and animated shorts, the films feature Casper, a ghost of a dead child, who refuses to frighten other people and would like nothing more than to be friends with them; however, his appearance would often get him shunned and petrified by whoever he encounters, but along the way, he would find and befriend a certain someone he could identify himself with, and would often help that someone in need.

The character's first appearance in cinemas were in three [[Short film|animated shorts]] in the mid to late 1940s from ''[[Noveltoons]]'', and were released by [[Paramount Pictures]] and produced by [[Famous Studios|Paramount Pictures' Famous Studios]], then started a series of theatrical shorts from 1950 to 1959, right before Harvey Comics ended up buying the rights to the character.

After having numerous ''Casper'' cartoons released on home video by [[Universal Studios]], a deal was made by them to have a live-action feature, mix with computer animation produced by [[Amblin Entertainment]] entitled ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]'' (1995) with executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] hiring [[Brad Silberling]] to direct the film in his first directing debut. The film became a commercial success but was met with mixed reviews from critics. In the late 1990s, [[Harvey Comics|The Harvey Entertainment Company]] and [[Saban Entertainment]] brought the ''Casper'' movie rights and produced two [[direct-to-video]] films released by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] with ''[[Casper: A Spirited Beginning]]'' (1997) and its sequel, ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998). Both films are highly regarded as prequels to the 1995 film, but completely contradicted to what was presented in the theatrical film and don't appear to be in the same continuity. 

In the early 2000s, Harvey Entertainment returned once more along with [[Rainmaker Entertainment|Mainframe Entertainment]] (replacing Saban Entertainment) with a film released by [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]] entitled ''[[Casper's Haunted Christmas]]'' (2000). Unlike the previous three films, this was completely done in [[computer animation]]. This was also the last ''Casper'' film to be involved with Universal. In the mid-2000s, was the second computer animated film made for television produced by [[MoonScoop Group|Moonscoop]] and released by [[Classic Media]] titled ''[[Casper's Scare School]]'' (2006). The film eventually had its own [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series [[Casper's Scare School (TV series)|with the same title]] airing in [[Cartoon Network]], released in 2009.

==Early Animated short films==

===Paramount cartoon shorts===
{{main article|Casper the Friendly Ghost filmography}}
Paramount Pictures' Famous Studios had produced three theatrical shorts featuring Casper the Friendly Ghost from the ''Noveltoon'' series with ''[[The Friendly Ghost]]'' in 1945, ''[[There's Good Boos To-Night]]'' in 1948 and ''[[A Haunting We Will Go (1949 film)|A Haunting We Will Go]]'' in 1949. Paramount would later produce a series of theatricals shorts of Casper the Friendly Ghost from 1950 to 1959.

==Theatrical Film==

===''Casper'' (1995)===
{{Main article|Casper (film)}}

With Steven Spielberg as executive producer of the film, he hired Brad Silberling to direct, making it Brad's first feature film as a director. The film stars [[Christina Ricci]] and [[Bill Pullman]], with [[Malachi Pearson]] voicing in the [[title role]]. This film was set in [[Friendship, Maine]] and makes extensive use of computer-generated imagery to make the ghosts such as Casper and his uncles the [[Ghostly Trio]] come to life and have them interacted with the live actors. This was also the first film to feature a CGI character in a lead role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~a5x9a/AnimationTimeline.html|title=History of Animation|publisher=Computer Science|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film gave Casper a back-story and is the only time that explains his death. In the film, Casper was a twelve-year-old boy living in Whipstaff Manor with his inventor father J.T. McFadden until he died from pneumonia after playing out in the cold until it was past nightfall. This was also the only film to have Casper on screen in his human form. The film opened at #1 over the Memorial Day weekend, grossing $16,840,385 over its first three days from 2,714 theaters, averaging $6,205 per theater. Over four days it grossed $22,091,975, averaging $8,140 per theater. It stayed at #1 in its second weekend, grossing another $13,409,610, and boosting its 10-day cume to $38,921,225.

===Cancelled sequel===
Following the release of ''Casper'', [[Simon Wells]] co-wrote a screenplay for ''Casper 2'', in which he was set to direct. However, in July 2000, it was reported that Universal Pictures had cancelled the sequel due to the disappointing sales from the direct-to-video ''Casper'' films and the hesitation of Christina Ricci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Paul|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/wells-sets-time-with-wb-d-works-1117783662/|title=Wells sets 'Time' with WB, D'Works|publisher=''Variety''|date=July 12, 2000|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mink|first=Sammy|url=http://www.tracking-board.com/tb-exclusive-casper-the-friendly-ghost-set-to-fly-back-into-production/|title={TB EXCLUSIVE} CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST SET TO FLY BACK INTO PRODUCTION!|publisher=The Tracking Board|date=March 10, 2014|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saban Entertainment Direct-to-Video films (1997-1998)==
[[File:Casper A Spirited Beginning Casper Meets Wendy.jpg|thumbnail|200px|2 movie-set of the Direct-to-Video films from Saban Entertainment distubuted by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]
===''Casper: A Spirited Beginning'' (1997)===
{{Main article|Casper: A Spirited Beginning}}

In 1997, The Harvey Entertainment Company and Saban Entertainment produced the direct-to-video film released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. The film was directed as a prequel to the 1995 film explaining how Casper became a ghost, but it completely ignored the storyline of 1995 film, with Casper dying on present day, no mention of Whipstaff Manor or his father J.T. McFadden and the Ghostly Trio not being directly related to him. While it being a direct-to-video film, the film has a list of an all star cast, such as [[Steve Guttenberg]], [[Lori Loughlin]], [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[Michael McKean]], [[James Earl Jones]], and [[Pauly Shore]].

===''Casper Meets Wendy'' (1998)===
{{Main article|Casper Meets Wendy}}

After release of ''Casper: A Spirited Beginning'', in 1998 Saban Entertainment returned once more with its sequel while being the second prequel to the 1995 feature film ''Casper''. The film's director [[Sean McNamara (director)|Sean McNamara]], who also directed ''Casper: A Spirited Beginning'', reintroduced a character who was in the ''Casper'' comics and cartoon known as [[Wendy the Good Little Witch]]. The role of Wendy was given to [[Hilary Duff]] in her first feature when she was 11-years-old. The film won the Children’s Programming - Electronic Visual Effects award with Hilary Duff being nominated for a Young Artist Award.

==Animated films==

===Direct-to-video film===

====''Casper's Haunted Christmas'' (2000)====
{{Main article|Casper's Haunted Christmas}}

In 2000, The Harvey Entertainment Company returned once with Mainframe Entertainment to produce a film released by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. The film was all done in computer animation, as opposed to its live-action predecessors. The film was set in Christmas time with Casper and his uncles; the Ghostly Trio being forced by Kibosh to have Casper purposely scare someone on Christmas Eve or else he and his uncles will be sentence to The Dark for all eternity. The film also features Casper's cousin's [[Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost]] and Spooky's girlfriend Poil. [[Brendan Ryan Barrett]] who portrayed Casper's best friend, Chris Carson from ''Casper: A Spirited Beginning'' got to voice the titular character himself in the film.

===Television film===

====''Casper's Scare School'' (2006)====
{{Main article|Casper's Scare School}}

In 2006, Moonscoop produced a made for television animated film released by Classic Media. The film which features Casper being sentenced to a school that will teach him how to scare others. In 2009, the film eventually had a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] animated series with the same title airing in Cartoon Network.

==Future==
With [[Universal Pictures]] now owning the rights to Casper, there are plans to reboot the character in live-action again, and have him return to the big screen as Steven Spielberg had mentioned that Casper will not return in the small screen like the last four movies. In 2012, [[DreamWorks Animation]] acquired the rights to the character from Classic Media as well as all the other Harvey Comics characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityam.com/article/dreamworks-buys-studio-owner-casper-and-lassie-155m|title=Dreamworks buys studio owner of Casper and Lassie for $155m|first=James|last=Titcomb|date=24 July 2012|publisher=CityAM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/dreamworks-acquired-classic-media-will-reboot-our-childhoods/|title=DreamWorks Acquired Classic Media, Will Reboot Our Childhoods|date=27 July 2012|publisher=Uproxx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2016, [[NBCUniversal]] bought DWA, so Universal's involvement with the ''Casper'' series could continue either with DreamWorks Animation or [[Illumination Entertainment]] rebooting the series.

[[Ben Stein]] has made a cameo appearance in all three of the live-action films. In ''Casper'' he portrayed a lawyer to the late father of the film's antagonist Carrigan Crittenden presenting the will her father gave her to Whipstaff. In ''Casper: A Spirited Beginning'' he portrayed a Grocer whom Casper innocently approached causing him to run in fear. In ''Casper Meets Wendy'' he portrayed a guest at the dance party where there was a scene with him talking to the human whom Fatso processed, and another scene where he asked one of the witches in disguised: Gert (another character portrayed by Moriarty) for a dance, but she scold him. While not being credited in the film, rumors have stated that he is a lawyer which could mean that he is the same character from the original film, but it is unclear.

[[Casper Van Dien]] has made two cameo appearances in the Saban produced prequels. In ''Casper: A Spirited Beginning'' he portrayed as one of the bystanders in defending the Applegate Mansion. In ''Casper Meets Wendy'' he portrayed as a hunk at the dance party the three witches fall heads over heels for causing him to flee leaving only his leather jacket behind.

The first two films have had other celebrity cameos. In ''Casper,'' there was [[Don Novello]] reprising his role as [[Father Guido Sarducci]] as well as [[Dan Aykroyd]] reprising his role as [[Ghostbusters|Ghostbuster]] [[Ray Stantz|Raymond "Ray" Stantz]]. [[Clint Eastwood]], Rodney Dangerfield, [[Mel Gibson]] and the [[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Crypt Keeper]] all appeared as Dr. James Harvey reflection. Steven Spielberg was also supposed to appear in the reflection, but was cut out. In ''Casper: A Spirited Beginning,'' there was [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] portraying one of the construction workers as Foreman Dave who was one of the witnesses petrified of the Ghostly Trio, and [[Sherman Hemsley]] portraying a store owner who was unintentionally saved by Casper when he was being robbed.

In [[drama]] and other art forms, the '''central conceit''' of a work of fiction is the underlying fictitious assumption which must be accepted by the audience with [[suspension of disbelief]] so the [[Plot (narrative) |plot]] may be seen as plausible. &lt;!-- content moved from [[Conceit]], may be usable here: For later literature and film, the term is sometimes used to refer to a [[Literary technique|device]] that stretches reality to take advantage of what [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] called the "willing [[suspension of disbelief]]." This usage is seldom seen in formal literary criticism. --&gt;

An example from popular culture is the way many cartoons feature animals that can speak to each other, and in many cases can understand human speech, but humans cannot understand the speech of animals. This conceit is seen, and sometimes exploited for plot purposes, in such films as ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', the ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]'' series, and ''[[Brother Bear]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11972">A '''character arc''' is the transformation or inner journey&lt;ref name="Gerke"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[character (arts)|character]] over the course of a story. If a story has a character arc, the character begins as one sort of person and gradually transforms into a different sort of person in response to changing developments in the story. Since the change is often substantive and leading from one personality trait to a diametrically opposite trait (for example, from greed to benevolence), the geometric term ''[[Arc (geometry)|arc]]'' is often used to describe the sweeping change. In most stories, [[main character|lead characters]] and [[protagonist]]s are the characters most likely to experience character arcs,&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bell|2004|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is possible for lesser characters to change as well.&lt;ref name="Gerke" /&gt; A driving element of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s of many stories is that the main character seems initially unable to overcome opposing forces, possibly because they lack skills or knowledge or resources or friends. To overcome such obstacles, the protagonist must change, possibly by learning new skills, to arrive at a higher sense of self-awareness or capability. Protagonists can achieve such self-awareness by interacting with their environment, by enlisting the help of mentors, by changing their viewpoint, or by some other method.

==Dramatic narrative structure==
{{main|Dramatic structure}}
Throughout the trajectory of narratives with a tripartite structure, character arcs often unfold beside the narrative arc in the following way:

===First act===
During the first act, the character arc is established or re-established for at least one character, the main character (the protagonist), within the exposition (noument) of the environment including relationships to other characters. Later in the first act, a dynamic, on-screen incident, known as the [[Inciting Incident|inciting incident]], or catalyst occurs that confronts the protagonist, whose attempts to deal with this incident lead to a second and more dramatic situation, known as the first [[Climax (narrative)|turning point]].  After the first turning point, life will never be the same for the protagonist and raises a dramatic question that will be answered in the climax of the story. The dramatic question should be framed in terms of the protagonist's call to action, for example, Will X recover the diamond? Will Y get the girl? Will Z capture the killer?&lt;ref name=bible&gt;{{harvtxt|Trottier|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second act===
During the second act, also referred to as "[[rising action]]", the character arc develops as the protagonist attempts to resolve the problem initiated by the first turning point, only to discover ever-worsening situations, which often lead to the learning of new skills, the discovery of capabilities, and (sometimes late in the second act if at all) the raising of self-awareness.&lt;ref name=bible /&gt;

===Third act===
During the third act, including the climax, "[[falling action]]" and resolution (denouement), the narrative arc is completed although the character arc typically is not.  During the climax, because the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question is answered, a character arc reaches a place where the character gains a new sense of who they are becoming.  As the plot and its subplots resolve, the character arc's emphasis shifts from the learning of any new skills or the discovery of dormant capabilities to the awakening of a higher level of self-awareness, which in turn changes who the character is becoming.&lt;ref name=bible /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== In literature ===
Some examples include:

* [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' sees the eponymous character, once a young scholarly prince full of promise, quickly becoming a melancholic brooder after his father's death. The play shows his slow but deadly fall into madness.
* In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', the protagonist [[Raskolnikov]] commits a murder, that leads him on a path of redemption, and after an intense inner struggle, he realizes that he needs to be punished for his actions, reporting himself to the authorities.
* [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Misérables]]'' includes a myriad of characters that transform against the backdrop of social events. [[Jean Valjean]] starts as a selfish, violent convict and develops into a generous and loving father to [[Cosette]], who in turn transforms from an abused, lonely and somewhat secluded child to a beautiful and caring woman.
* [[Ursula Le Guin]]'s protagonist from her ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' quartet gradually changes from an impulsive and arrogant youth to a stoic and wise man, reconciling the darkness within and all the bad actions it had caused.
* ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of books by [[George R.R. Martin]] shows numerous examples of complete character arcs. [[Daenerys Targaryen]] transforms from a naive young girl to a queen and a conqueror, only to fall from grace after a misuse of power. The character of [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], undergoes a similar arc of embracing the need to govern and rule and metaphorically "kills the boy and lets the man be born" only to die after a misuse of power. Other characters such as [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Jaime Lannister]], start out as childish and petty, but once faced with the cruelty of the world, Jaime grows into a mature and wise leader, and Sansa grows into a strong-willed and poised lady.

=== In film ===
Some examples include:

* In ''[[Tootsie]]'', [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character begins as a [[misogynist]]ic [[chauvinist]] but when he is forced to play the part of a woman, he also experiences a change in how he views women and becomes a different character by the end.
* In ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', Jim begins as a carefree young boy.  After the Japanese take over [[Shanghai]] and he is separated from his family, he is forced to suffer trauma because of the war.
* In ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), widely regarded as one of the [[greatest films ever made]], Michael Corleone initially wants nothing to do with the crime business of his father, Don Vito Corleone. When Vito is critically injured in a shooting, however, Michael gradually becomes more involved in a war of retribution on those responsible. This, effectively and ironically, sets him down the path to becoming Don of the Corleone crime syndicate. Its acclaimed sequel, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), chronicles Michael's effective fall from grace as a result of becoming a powerful crime lord.
* In ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), Travis Bickle degenerates from a somewhat disturbed, highly disorganized Vietnam war veteran into an obsessive psychotic.
* In ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), [[Henry Hill]] (played by [[Ray Liotta]]) goes from being a suave and sophisticated gangster to a paranoid nervous wreck due to a severe [[cocaine]] addiction.
* In ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]] begins the movie embracing her ice powers. After injuring her sister  [[Anna (Disney)|Anna]] she becomes scared of her powers and considers herself a monster. After her sister sacrifices herself, Elsa finally embraces her powers again. Anna begins the movie as a social butterfly willing to throw herself into any man's arms. After [[Hans (Disney)|Hans]] betrays her, Anna learns that looks can sometimes be deceiving.
*In ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] begins a story arc dealing with accepting himself as one person rather than seeing Bruce Banner separate. It continues in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and will conclude in ''[[Untitled Avengers film|Avengers 4]]''.

=== In television ===
Like a [[story arc]], which often is composed of many [[dramatic structure|narrative arcs]], the character arc is not confined within the limits of one narrative.  The character arc may extend over to the next story, a [[sequel]], or another episode.  In episodic [[TV series]], the character arc functions as a [[narrative hook]] that writers often use to ensure viewers continue watching.

* The TV series ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' made heavy use of character arcs throughout its run, with story arcs (or mysteries, as the show was famed for) normally being used to move the plot along in the background, as the four protagonists, [[Susan Mayer]], [[Lynette Scavo]], [[Bree Van de Kamp]], and [[Gabrielle Solis]], dealt with their various foibles and flaws, through the eyes of their dead friend and neighbour, [[Mary Alice Young]].
* Over the course of the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (first US air date: {{start date|1995|9}}), [[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]] starts from a young, idealistic Greek farm girl to becoming a warrior, and in the end, she becomes [[Xena]]'s successor.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' focuses on character arcs for each of the survivors of a plane crash. [[Jack Shephard]] accepting his role as protector of the island, [[James "Sawyer" Ford]] going from a self-centered con-man to a mature leader, [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]]'' discovering his destiny on the island.

* ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' (first US air date: {{start date|2001|10}}) focuses on character arcs for each of its main characters as they progress into their ''[[Superman]]'' comic book identities. [[Clark Kent]]'s arc revolved around the gradual acceptance of his destiny and becoming a hero. The series also tracks [[Lex Luthor]]'s progression into darkness and [[Lois Lane]]'s emulation of her cousin [[Chloe Sullivan|Chloe]] as she becomes a hardened journalist. Other characters have their eventual character arc alluded to but never explicitly defined or realized onscreen, such as [[Perry White]]'s rise to editor of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and [[Lex Luthor]]'s ascension to [[President of the United States]]. As well as individual characters, there are arcs involving many characters which intertwine to tell about the formation of the [[Justice League]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*In ''[[Breaking Bad]],'' [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] begins as a high school chemistry teacher struggling with a serious illness while trying to support his family financially. His decision to become a manufacturer of addictive illegal drugs starts a downward spiral in which his wife, [[Skyler White]], divorces him, and his character ''arcs'' from a morally responsible regular guy into a dangerous monster.
* The teen drama series ''[[13 Reasons Why]]'' features two character arcs for its protagonist Clay Jensen: In the flashbacks, Clay begins as a shy young man until meeting [[Hannah Baker]]. In the present, after Hannah's death, he becomes emotionally withdrawn until listening to the tapes left behind by his former friend. After learning the truth, he becomes a warrior and a voice of justice for Hannah.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19079">'''Cinephilia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɪ|n|ɪ|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|i|ə}}; also '''cinemaphilia''' or '''filmophilia''') is the term used to refer to a passionate interest in [[film]]s, [[film theory]], and [[film criticism]]. The term is a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[Film|cinema]] and [[philia]], one of the four ancient [[Greek words for love]].&lt;ref name="de-Valck"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Cinephilia: Movies, Love and Memory|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2005|isbn=90-5356-768-2|location=Amsterdam|editor1-first=Marijke|editor1-last=de Valck|editor2-first=Malte|editor2-last=Hagener}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person with a passionate interest in cinema is called a '''cinephile''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|ɪ|f|aɪ|l}}), '''cinemaphile''', '''filmophile''', or, informally, a '''film buff''' (also '''movie buff''').

In English, "cinephile" is sometimes used interchangeably with the word '''cineaste''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|i|ˌ|æ|s|t|,_|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|eɪ|-}}), though in the original French the term ''cinéaste'' ({{IPA-fr|sineast|}}) refers to a cinephile who is also a filmmaker.

In a review of a book on the history of cinephilia, Mas Generis writes: "Cinephilia, is the condition of a sexual attraction to movies."&lt;ref name="generis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Generis |first1=Mas |date=11 December 2006 |title=Cinephilia now: review of ''Cinephilia: movies, love and memory'' |journal=Screening the Past |issue=20 |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/20/cinephilia-movies-love-memory.html  |publisher=[[LaTrobe University]] |accessdate=November 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generis also introduces a quote from [[film scholar]] Annette Michelson that states that there is, "No one such thing as cinephilia, but rather forms and periods of cinephilia."&lt;ref name="generis" /&gt; As described by Antoine de Baecque and [[Thierry Frémaux]], "The definitive essence of cinephila is a culture of the discarded that prefers to find intellectual coherence where none is evident and to eulogize the non-standard and the minor."&lt;ref name="keathley"&gt;Keathley, Christian. Cinephilia and history, or, The wind in the trees. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film historian Thomas Elsaesser wrote that it "reverberates with nostalgia and dedication... more than a passion of going to the movies and only a little less than an entire attitude towards life".&lt;ref&gt;[https://filmschoolrejects.com/is-fandom-the-new-cinephilia-585391abb8b2/ "Is Fandom the New Cinephilia?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the beginning of the [[silent era]], there have been [[Film society|film clubs]] and publications in which people who felt passionately about cinema could discuss their interests and see rare and older works. At the beginning of the [[sound film|sound era]], there were more and more people interested in seeing older films, which led to the establishment of organizations such as the [[Cinémathèque Française]], the first major archive devoted to [[film preservation]].

===Post-war French cinephilia===

Perhaps the most notable cinephilic community of the 20th century was the one that developed in Paris in the decades following World War II. An influx of foreign films that had been withheld during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Occupation]], as well as the screening programs of local [[film society|film clubs]] and the [[Cinémathèque Française]], generated interest in [[world cinema]] amongst the city's [[intellectual]] [[youth culture]]. In general, the cinephiles of the period set a template for future like-minded groups by having keen enthusiasm for both older and contemporary films.&lt;ref name="richard"&gt;Le fantôme d'Henri Langlois. Dir. Jacques Richard. DVD. Kino Video, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influential film clubs of the period included Objectif 49, whose members included [[Robert Bresson]] and [[Jean Cocteau]], and the Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin (Cinema Club of the Latin Quarter). ''Revue du Cinéma'', a magazine published by members of the two clubs, later evolved into the influential film magazine ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]''.

Many of the people who attended the screenings became [[film critic]]s and later [[filmmakers]], founding the film movement known as the [[French New Wave]]. [[André Bazin]], [[François Truffaut]], [[Jacques Doniol-Valcroze]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Alexandre Astruc]], [[Jacques Rivette]], [[Luc Moullet]] and others were regulars, and several, most notably Truffaut, maintained their ties to the community after they had achieved fame.

The community fostered an interest in [[Film director|directors]] and [[film]]s that had been neglected, forgotten or simply unknown in the West, and led to the development of the [[auteur theory]]. The directors the French cinephiles of the period had strong interests in included [[F. W. Murnau]], [[Robert Flaherty]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Jean Renoir]], [[Jean Vigo]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Anthony Mann]], [[Louis Feuillade]], [[D. W. Griffith]], the [[Lumière Brothers]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Georges Méliès]], whose films would be screened from [[nitrate film|nitrate prints]] on special occasions.&lt;ref name="richard" /&gt;

===Filmgoing in the 1960s and 1970s===
[[File:Federico Fellini.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The Italian director [[Federico Fellini]], a fashionable figure in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, owed part of his popularity to the support of [[film critics]] and the distribution of [[foreign films]] in order to accommodate the increasingly sophisticated public.]]

With the popular success of the [[French New Wave]], film-going became fashionable in Europe and America.&lt;ref name="de-Valck" /&gt; [[Revival house|Revival screenings]] and independently run cinemas specializing in [[foreign film]]s became increasingly common. In the United States, New York City was often seen as the center of cinephile culture,&lt;ref name="de-Valck" /&gt; due to the wide variety of films available to see at any given time. This culture was also helped by the popularity in America of figures such like [[Pauline Kael]], [[Andrew Sarris]] and [[Susan Sontag]].&lt;ref name="keathley" /&gt; Certain writers and critics, including Sontag, would later come to view this as the "[[golden age]]" of film-going in the US.&lt;ref name="de-Valck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="keathley" /&gt; Directors such as [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Federico Fellini]] enjoyed a great deal of popularity in the US and influenced the young generation of film enthusiasts who would become the [[New Hollywood]], including [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Woody Allen]]. Due to growing public interest in [[foreign film|films from other countries]], specialty [[film distributor|distributors]] such as [[Janus Films]] and [[New Yorker Films]] began importing and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] foreign movies.

The era also saw the growth of college film societies in the US. Though some, like [[Doc Films]] at the [[University of Chicago]], had existed since the 1930s, the 1960s saw directors of all generations regularly make appearances at college campuses, whether to revisit their old films or to discuss new ones.

At the same time, the Parisian cinephilic culture became increasingly politicized. Critics, and by extension the cinephiles who followed their work, began to emphasize political aspects of films and directors. Though many of the major figures of the post-war community has been originally aligned with the [[Right (politics)|political right]]—including most of the ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]'' group—by the late 1960s ''Cahiers'' and the young cinephile public in general had aligned with various forms of the [[Left (politics)|Left]], with some figures, such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]], aligning with [[Maoism]]. In this very politicized climate, cinema was often seen as directly connected to [[Marxism]]. Many members of this new generation of cinephiles would become [[film critic|critics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/film/cinephobia-2129482 Cinephobia-Manohla Dargis of The LA Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[film director|directors]], including [[Serge Daney]], [[Philippe Garrel]], and [[Andre Techine]].

Though most of the world's major film festivals had existed for decades by this point—including the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and the [[Venice Film Festival]]—the period saw the establishment of festivals in nearly every major city. The [[New York Film Festival]], the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] and the [[Chicago International Film Festival]] were all started during this time. The [[Toronto International Film Festival]], often seen as second only to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in terms of importance, was founded towards the end of this period, in 1976.

===Home video and the late 20th century===
[[File:Wong Kar-wai at 2008 TIFF.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Wong Kar-wai]] (''pictured'') is a renowned [[arthouse]] film director from Hong Kong.]]

As [[VHS]] tapes and later [[DVD]]s became more common, cinephilia became less associated with filmgoing in theatres.&lt;ref name="de-Valck" /&gt;

While [[Japanese language|Japanese]] films have enjoyed worldwide distribution in the mid 20th century, the late 20th century saw an increase in interest amongst cinephiles in cinema from other Asian countries, especially China, [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and, later, [[Thailand]].

===Contemporary cinephilia===
[[File:Michael Mann - French Cinematheque - 4th July 2009.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Though his films have met with mixed commercial success, American director [[Michael Mann]] (pictured above at [[Cinémathèque Française]] in 2009) is often considered to be a major figure by contemporary cinephiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theauteurs.com/notebook/posts/828 The Auteurs' Notebook: Anticipating "Public Enemies"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://somecamerunning.typepad.com/some_came_running/2009/07/the-mann-act-public-enemies.html Glenn Kenny: The Mann Act]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Since the beginning of the 21st century, [[blogging]] has become a large part of cinephile culture. In the [[English-speaking world]], established critics and theorists like [[Dave Kehr]], [[David Bordwell]], [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], [[Glenn Kenny]], [[Wheeler Winston Dixon]] and [[Adrian Martin]], as well as non-professional cinephiles like [[Girish Shambu]] and [[Acquarello]], play key roles in building interest in films or theories amongst cinephiles by writing and communicating through blogs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/nd08/fccrisis.htm Film Comment: Film Criticism in Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211045039/http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/nd08/fccrisis.htm |date=2008-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Online forum|Forums]] and [[podcast]]s have become popular ways to stir discussion, allowing cinephiles from different countries and cultures to discuss ideas about film. The [[social networking]] and [[video streaming]] service [[Mubi (website)|Mubi]] caters specifically to cinephiles, allowing its members access to films that sometimes haven't been distributed theatrically or on video in their home countries. Home video distribution labels such as [[The Criterion Collection]] and [[Masters of Cinema]] cater to cinephiles, often including large amounts of supplemental and [[film criticism|critical]] material with their releases.

As was the case with the French cinephilia of the post-war era, the international cinephilic community that has developed on the Internet often emphasizes films and figures that do not have strong critical or popular recognition, including many directors who work within [[genre film]], in what is sometimes dubbed [[vulgar auteurism]]. These include [[Abel Ferrara]], [[Bela Tarr]], [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], [[Apichatpong Weerasethakul]], [[Park Chan-wook]], [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], [[Philippe Garrel]], [[Pedro Costa]], [[Lucrecia Martel]] and [[Jose Luis Guerin]].

==Cinephilia and filmmaking==
[[File:Quentin Tarantino by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|140px|right|American director and cinephile [[Quentin Tarantino]] often makes references in his work to movies and directors he admires.]]

Throughout the history of cinema, there have been numerous directors who developed their understanding of cinema through filmgoing and participation in cinephile communities and organizations instead of within the formal settings of either a [[film school]] or a [[film studio]]. Directors who began as cinephiles include [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[François Truffaut]], [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Jacques Rivette]], [[Ed Wood]], [[Andre Techine]], [[Pedro Costa]], [[Brian de Palma]], [[Jim Jarmusch]], [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Wim Wenders]], [[Wes Anderson]], [[Éric Rohmer]], [[Hal Hartley]]  and [[Aki Kaurismäki]].

The directors of the [[French New Wave]], who learned about filmmaking by attending screenings at [[film society|film clubs]] and discussing movies amongst themselves, are often seen as models for cinephiles. Their intellectual [[omnivorousness]], which equated an interest in cinema with strong understandings of [[literature]], [[art]] and sometimes [[philosophy]], has continued to have influence on cinephiles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-movies-arent-dying-theyre-not-even-sick The Movies Aren't Dying (They're Not Even Sick)-Richard Brody of The New Yorker]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the other hand, many directors emphasize their lack of cinephilia or interest in movies. [[Abbas Kiarostami]], popular with cinephiles, often emphasized his disinterest in cinema when interviewed.&lt;ref&gt;Abbas Kiarostami (Contemporary Film Directors). New York: University of Illinois P, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinephobia===
There has also been different forms of ''cinephobia'' (fear or hatred of cinema)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199791286/obo-9780199791286-0278.xml#]&lt;/ref&gt; from the current fear of "losing" celluloid film in the digital age through anxieties about moral values on the big screen to the point of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;[www.lolajournal.com/5/cinephobia.html

==Telephilia&lt;!--'Telephilia' redirects here--&gt;==
'''Telephilia'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the term used to refer to a passionate interest in [[television]].

===Definition===
It was coined by ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic Frank Rich, in a pejorative way, as "the pathological longing of Americans, no matter how talentless, to be on television".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namibian.com.na/print.php?id=12562&amp;type=2|title=The Namibian|website=www.namibian.com.na}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
For years, television was frowned upon as inferior to film until the advent of [[quality television]] in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/cultivating-tv-aesthetics|title=Cultivating TV aesthetics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when recording and reproduction technologies allowed the spectator to release his/her viewing from the palimpsest's rigidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41552408|title=Cinephilia/Telephilia|first1=Francesco|last1=Casetti|first2=Mariagrazia|last2=Fanchi|date=17 August 2017|publisher=|journal=Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media|volume=45|issue=2|pages=38–41|doi=10.2307/41552408}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1112415581/cinephilia-telephilia] Cinephilia/Telephilia

===Telephilia from 2000s onwards===
Anti-heroic series like ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]'' were cited as improving television content thus earning critical praise.&lt;ref&gt;

It also rivals cinephilia for relevance as production values are higher than ever before on shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/05/telephilia-has-television-become-a-more-relevant-american-medium-than-art-film-38350/|title=Telephilia: Has Television Become a More Relevant American Medium Than Art Film?|first=Celluloid Liberation|last=Front|website=IndieWire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this development, there are still intellectuals &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BOgUyPYw0KoC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=telephilia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w5JGf56BlM&amp;sig=0hWr8bTEGoz0xFpn7iGkOUnelyc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjOpZvB6sTeAhXl7YMKHTLpDDE4FBDoATADegQIBRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=telephilia&amp;f=false Roll Over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media-Robert Miklitsch-Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; who consider telephilia as inferior to cinephilia particularly in cases of obsessions for modern television programs belonging to genres such as [[melodrama]] and [[soap opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roll Over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media|last=Miklitsch|first=Robert|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2006|isbn=0791467333|location=New York|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also explained by the view that highlighted the unattainable nature of the cinema, which makes it more desirable and extraordinary since it features a regime of presence-yet-absence filmic image, allowing a form of cinematic stardom capable of triggering a series of psychic mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cinema of Takeshi Kitano: Flowering Blood|last=Redmond|first=Sean|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780231163323|location=New York|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted with television, which is perceived to be more present and immediate - with its stars "famous only in so far as he or she makes frequent television appearances."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some observers, however, note that there is now a destabilization of traditional notions of what constitutes cinephilic tendency due to the availability of film on [[Home video|home media]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cult Media: Re-packaged, Re-released and Restored|last=Wroot|first=Jonathan|last2=Willis|first2=Andy|publisher=Pagrave Macmillan|year=2017|isbn=9783319636788|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], and [[literary theory]], the concepts of '''deictic field''' and '''deictic shift''' are sometimes deployed in the study of narrative media. These terms provide a theoretical framework for helping literary analysts to conceptualize the ways in which readers redirect their attention away from their immediate surroundings as they become immersed in the reality generated by the text.

==Deixis==
The term "[[deixis]]" refers to the ways in which language encodes contextual information into its [[grammatical]] system. More broadly, deixis refers to the inherent ambiguity of certain linguistic expressions and the interpretive processes that communicants must perform in order to disambiguate these words and phrases. Such ambiguity can only be resolved by analyzing the context in which the utterance occurs.  To understand deixis, one must first understand that language grammaticalizes context-dependent features such as person, space, and time. When language is oriented toward its context, certain expressions in speech emerge that differentiate the "here" and "now" (proximal deixis) from the "then" and "there" (distal deixis). According to Karl Buhler, an Austrian psychologist who was one of the earliest to present a theory of deixis, "When philosophers, linguists, and narrative theorists attempt to understand the role of subjectivity in language and conversely, the role of language in subjectivity, they invariably notice a certain aspect of language which seems to depend on extralinguistic, subjective, occasion-specific considerations."&lt;ref name="MG2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Deixis in Narrative: A Cognitive Science Perspective|date=1995|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|isbn=9780203052907|location=Hillsdale, New Jersey|pages=19; 59|last1=Galbraith|first1=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of narrative, deixis reflects those aspects of storytelling by which the audience is pragmatically directed to understand the perspective of the narrator or the perspective of the story's characters in relation to their own story-external vantage point. Essentially, deictic expressions help form the layers of narrative that direct the audience to either the narratorial discourse or to the story world. "Deixis (adjectival form, deictic) is a psycholinguistic term for those aspects of meaning associated with self-world orientation".&lt;ref name="MG2" /&gt; Deixis is an integral component of the lens by which the audience perceives the narrative.

==Labov's narrative model==
When examining perspectives on narration in [[natural language|natural-language]] environments, one must not ignore [[William Labov]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} who argues that stories of personal experience can be divided into distinct sections, each of which serves a unique function within the narrative progression. Labov schematizes the organization of natural narrative using the following conceptual units: abstract, orientation, complicating action, resolution, evaluation, and coda. Generally, anecdotal narratives tend to arrange these units in the order outlined; however, this is not an inflexible, structural progression that defines how every narrative must develop. For instance, sentences and phrasal items that serve an evaluative function can be interspersed throughout a narrative. Some stretches of narrative discourse also feature overlap among these Labovian categories. Each of Labov's narrative divisions serves a characteristic purpose typified by a particular section's grammatical construction and functional role within the unfolding narrative, but the boundaries of such divisions are not always clear-cut.

As a feature of natural language, deixis is an important element of oral narrative and can be realized in different ways in each of Labov's categories. According to Galbraith, "All language use depends on some felt relevance to situation, on the attention of participants, and their ability to lift out the topic....Like zero in mathematics and the dark space in the theater, deixis orients us within a situation without calling attention to itself".&lt;ref name="MG2" /&gt; Two of Labov's categories that often feature deixis prominently are the "orientation" and the "coda". The orientation typically occurs near the beginning of a narrative and serves to introduce the characters, settings, and events. Given its presentative quality, the orientation shifts the deictic center away from the speaker's here-and-now into the spatiotemporal coordinates of the story, which logically must occur at a time prior to the story's enunciation. The coda occurs toward the end of a narrative and functions as a means of terminating the flow of story events. By doing so, the coda reorients the speakers and listeners out of the story world and back into the communicative present.

== Deictic center ==
The deictic center—sometimes called the "origo" or zero-point—represents the originating source in relation to which deictic expressions gain their context-dependent meaning. Often the deictic center is the speaker: thus, any tokens of "I" in the speaker's discourse must deictically refer back to the speaker as center; likewise, the word "you" must project outward from this center toward the addressee. Any participants not part of this communicative channel will be referred to in the third person. The theory of deixis is therefore egocentric in that the indexical anchorage of deictic expressions is a function of this zero-point of subjectivity. The "I"-center serves as the perceptual vantage point that surveys relations among salient contextual entities and events. Such a center, therefore, determines which deictic expressions are pragmatically licensed by a context that has been naturally delimited through this perceptual and evaluative locus. Thus, the appropriateness of a proximal "this" over a distal "that" is determined by the nearness of an object or a location in relation to the deictic zero-point.

A deictic field contains the range of bounded participants and objects, spatial locations and landmarks, and temporal frames that point back to some deictic center as the source for their pragmatic demarcation. The deictic field radiates out from the deictic center, and the boundaries of such a field enclose the scope of objects, spaces, and events that constitute a set from which deictic expressions might seek out a potential referent. These fields function as cognitive frames that participants in a discourse can use to conceptualize their contextual surroundings in relation to each interlocutor's (alternating) function as deictic center across communicative turns. Within the context of literature, the presence of multiple deictic fields in a text can be fruitfully analyzed using the cognitive principle of deictic shift (discussed below).

== Deictic shift theory ==
Deictic shift theory (DST) refers to a range of immersion processes by which readers imaginatively project hypothetical deictic centers that are anchored to communicative and experiential loci within a narrative. Such cognitive framing, theorists of DST argue, form a necessary part of the reader's involvement in narrative, whereby through a process of frame shifting the reader constructs a story world by interpreting the (deictic) cues instantiated in the text. Deictic shifting can be accomplished in several ways. The most basic shift involves the reader's initial immersion into the world of the story. Here the deictic center moves out of the here-and-now of the reader's physical environment and becomes anchored to some text-internal perceptual or presentative instance, in most cases the deictic center of a character or a narrator. Deictic shifts at the level of narration include those cues that implicate a covert or overt narrator—specifically, story commentary or instances when the narrator refers to himself or herself as an "I." Such instances of commentary and evaluation often reflect the perceptual field, as well as the interpretive and ideological stance, of the narrator as he or she presents the story's events.

Within the world of the story, deictic shifts occur in a number of ways. A fundamental shift occurs when the deictic center moves from one character to another—for instance, in cases of omniscient thought report. Here the reader must adjust the deictic center accordingly and interprets the lens of the current focal window through the experiential subjectivity of the character-locus. Other forms of story-internal deictic shifts involve the cognitive framing associated with embedded narratives and other discourse-types: stories-within-stories, letters in epistolary fiction, diary entries, hypertext ruptures, etc.
  
"Within literary scholarship, it is often noted that first and second person pronouns (and less so, and differently, third) facilitate readerly identification with the textually inscribed position (the position of the character or narrator designated by that pronoun), and evoke a sense of readerly conceptual immersion in the fictional world of the story, contributing to the ways in which the scene is imaginatively 'realized' in the mind of the reader, particularly the perspective from which the scene is conceptually visualized. Cognitive poetics and cognitive narratology have employed deictic shift theory, largely based on the work of Duchan, Bruder and Hewitt, to attempt to offer a cognitive account of how these interpretative effects are created. DST proposes that readers conceptually project to the contextual locus of the speaker of deictic cues in order to comprehend them, offering a model of how the deictic referents determining such contextual coordinates are processed by readers, and how this contributes to readers' conceptualization of the world of the story" (Deictic shifting in literature: Experimental analysis&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt;).

== Deixis in narratology ==
Buhler applied the theory of deixis to narratives. He proposed the concept of Zeigfeld, or deictic field, which operates in three modes:&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt; the first, ''ad oculos'', "operates in the here-and-now of the speaker's sensible environment;" the second, anaphora, "operates in the context of the discourse itself considered as a structured environment;" and the third, what Buhler calls ''deixis at phantasma'', operates in the context "of imagination and long-term memory."&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt; Buhler's model attempts "to describe the psychological and physical process whereby the live deictic field of our own bodily orientation and experience" is "transposed into an imaginative construction." According to Buhler, "the body-feeling representation, or Korspertastbild (what psychologists would probably now call the body schema), becomes loosened from its involvement with the HERE//NOW/I deictic coordinates of waking life in our immediate environment, and becomes available to translation into an environment we construct both conceptually and orientationally"; this deictic coordinate system is used "in the constructive environment to orient ourselves within 'the somewhere-realm of pure imagination and the there-and-there in memory'".&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt;

Katie Hamburger, a German narrative theorist, studied and theorized how deictic words are used in literature. In her work ''The Logic of Literature'', she argued that there are two realms of language act: reality statement and fiction (Galbraith, 24-25). Reality statements are by someone and about something.&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt; "Acts of fictional narration, on the other hand, transfer their referentiality from the actuality of the historical world to the entertained reality of the fictive world, and transfer the subjectivity of the speaker to the subjectivity of the story world characters".&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt; Hamburger argued that this transfer occurs due to the use of deictic adverbs, and psychological verbs.&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt;

The '''dramatistic pentad''' forms the core structure of [[dramatism]], a method for examining motivations that the renowned [[literary critic]] [[Kenneth Burke]] developed.  Dramatism recommends the use of a [[metalinguistic]] approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five [[rhetoric]]al elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the "dramatistic pentad." Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its [[Character (arts)|character]]s. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their [[world view]].

Burke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book "A Grammar of Motives". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines "questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, "The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pentad also closely follows the journalistic '[[Five Ws]]': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states "Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information." &lt;ref&gt;"The Five Ws of Online Help". by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L. Retrieved April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical elements of the dramatistic pentad==
The dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them," to read them "at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other," and "in a wider context than any of them recognizes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=Francis|title=Kenneth Burke's A Grammar of Motives|date=1957|publisher=Doubleday Anchor Books|location=NY|pages=193–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act===
Act, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question "what?", is related to the world view of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene===
Scene, which is associated with the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of an act and answers the questions "when?" and "where?", is related to the world view of [[materialism]] and minimal or non-existent [[free will]]. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agent===
Agent, which answers the question "by whom?", reflects the world view of [[philosophical idealism]]. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” &lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Agency===
Agency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question "how?", implies a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Purpose===
Purpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question "why?", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.

==Ratios within the dramatistic pentad==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.

This is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1307}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|page=1308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. 
Likewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Act ratio===
The scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.&lt;ref name="Burke1978"&gt;Burke,Kenneth."Questions and Answers about the Pentad". National Council of Teachers of English, 1978, p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Agent ratio===
A relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.&lt;ref name="Burke1978" /&gt;

===Act-Agent ratio===
While requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.

==A sixth element==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Situation|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010"&gt;Anderson, F. D., &amp; Althouse, M. T. (2010). “Five Fingers or Six? Pentad or Hexad”. KB Journal, 6(2). Retrieved October 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude is defined as "the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act." The attitude, like the agency, would answer the “how?”.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. (1965). “Permanence and Change”. 1954. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010" /&gt; While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining “another soul” or an “extra existence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew|title=Disciplining The Master: Finding the Via Media for Kenneth Burke|journal=American Communication Journal|date=2001|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have read this as Burke’s desire not to “dispose of” ambiguity, but rather to “study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.”&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.

'''Engaged Citizenship''' is the active participation of a [[citizen]] under the law of a sovereign nation discussing and educating themselves in [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Justin|last2=Wahl‐Jorgensen|first2=Karin|last3=Inthorn|first3=Sanna|date=2004-05-01|title=Images of citizenship on television news: constructing a passive public|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670042000211140|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=5|issue=2|pages=153–164|doi=10.1080/1461670042000211140|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;Engaged citizens are considered independent, and assertive, and concern themselves with others' problems. ie: Organizers of protests look for engaged citizens to be involved and rally behind their cause; often stalling or creating political changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.ucsusa.org/ken-kimmell/is-progress-stalled-on-clean-energy|title=Is Progress Stalled on Clean Energy?

== Changes &amp; Media Coverage ==

Developments in [[social media]] and [[media literacy]] have changed how scholars begin to look at, and define engaged citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mihailidis|first=Paul|last2=Thevenin|first2=Benjamin|date=2013-11-01|title=Media Literacy as a Core Competency for Engaged Citizenship in Participatory Democracy|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764213489015|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en|volume=57|issue=11|pages=1611–1622|doi=10.1177/0002764213489015|issn=0002-7642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engaged citizenship in politics can lead to an apparent consumption of the engaged person rather than offering people with an informed, active opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/opinion/article_feec5004-1300-11e7-b539-a7072c470f37.html|title=Guest column: When engaged citizens become consumed, politics disrupt lives, affect personal happiness|last=FAUCHEUX|first=RON|work=The Advocate|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media sites let people spread information, and create events to provide opportunities for engaged citizenship.&lt;ref name=thewire&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/118679/social-media-world-politics/|title=Can Social Media, Loud and Inclusive, Fix World Politics?|last=Fakhoury|first=Rania|website=thewire.in|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media and the internet provide a public access point to government affairs, and policies, away from townhall meetings, creating communities with similar concerns to recognize the pitfalls of governments and government policies.&lt;ref name=thewire /&gt;

'''Explorative strategies''' are used in drama to explore a theme or a text. They are associated with Edexcel GCSE.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Types of strategies==
*''' Forum Theatre''' - The actors either create a planned improvisation or create a piece spontaneously, as it is performed the audience can either stop the action to suggest changes or take over from the actors on stage to change the direction of the performance. Quite often this is used as an exploration tool rather than as a piece of theatre for performance. A theme or key moment/decision can be explored to its fullest.
*'''Thought Tracking''' - Whilst in role, the character speaks out to the audience about what that character is thinking, feeling, doing etc.
*'''Still Image''' - Also known as a "[[freeze frame shot|freeze frame]]" or "tableau" or "snapshot" or "qais", this is when all the characters on stage stop still. Can be used if a narrator wishes to speak to the audience whilst something is happening on stage.
*'''Hot Seating''' - A character is interrogated by the audience. Normally used as an "in class" activity, this allows the audience to find things out about a character, and requires the actor playing the character to think about what he/she is doing, feeling, etc.
*'''Cross Cutting''' - When time in a scene changes to show  what happens before or after a scene.
*'''Narrating''' - A character, normally called the "Narrator", will speak out to the audience about what is going on in the plot
*'''Marking the moment''' - Key moments in the performance are highlighted either through a freeze frame, or a change in light or some sound by using slow motion, noises etc..
*'''Role-play''' - A role-play is what you do when you're pretending to be another person and using your imagination to speak, think and even feel like that character.

'''''Family Guy''''' is an American animated comedy [[Media franchise|franchise]] created by [[Seth MacFarlane]] and originally developed for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].

==TV show==
{{main|Family Guy}}
''Family Guy'' is an American [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Seth MacFarlane]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The series centers on the [[Griffin family|Griffins]], a family consisting of parents [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]]; their children, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]; and their [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] pet dog, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, [[Rhode Island]], and exhibits much of its humor in the form of [[metafictional]] [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway gags]] that often lampoon [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].

The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, [[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve|''The Life of Larry'' and ''Larry &amp; Steve'']]. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of ''Family Guy'' had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series with [[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein|one episode]] left unaired. [[Adult Swim]] [[Burning off|aired]] that episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.

===Spin-off===

===Live performances===
As promotion for the show, and, as Newman described, "[to] expand interest in the show beyond its diehard fans",&lt;ref name="VarietyLive!"/&gt; Fox organized four ''Family Guy Live!'' performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud. The cast also performed musical numbers from the ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'' comedy album.&lt;ref name="VarietyLive!"&gt;{{cite news|title=Family Guy Center Stage|work=Variety|date=March 10, 2005|author=Adalian, Josef|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 [[Montreal Comedy Festival]].&lt;ref name="VarietyLive!"/&gt; The ''Family Guy Live!'' performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,155143,00.html|author=Associated Press|title='Family Guy' Returns to FOX|publisher=Fox News|date=April 30, 2005|accessdate=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, at the [[59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards]], MacFarlane performed (as the digitally inserted Stewie and Brian) the ceremony's opening number. He performed a song insulting modern television to the tune of the song "The Fellas At The Freakin' F.C.C." performed in the episode ''[[PTV (Family Guy)|PTV]]''. The song insulted TV shows such as ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', as well as the [[Made in America (The Sopranos)|final scene]] of ''[[The Sopranos]]''.

In 2009, a special televised performance show aired entitled ''Family Guy Presents Seth &amp; Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show'', in which voice actors [[Alex Borstein]] and MacFarlane performed songs from the show, as well as a parody of [[Lady Gaga]]'s song "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" in the voice of [[Marlee Matlin]], who appeared on stage as a guest during the performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13545">A '''fiction-writing mode''' is a manner of writing with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.

[[Fiction]] is a form of [[narrative]], one of the four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse.  Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions.  Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of fiction-writing modes and their uses. Some writing modes suggested include action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, description, background, exposition and transition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ziBORQpTMD0C&amp;pg=PA143 143-65].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA127 127].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Selgin|Selgin]], 2007, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The concept goes back at least as far as Aristotle who, in ''Poetics'', referred to narration and action as different modes or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, pp.  3, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, fiction writing was described has having two types: narration and dialogue. Evan Marshall, in ''The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing'' (1998) noted that writers should know what they are doing at all times. He described what he called ''fiction-writing modes''—the types of writing of which all fiction is made. He listed five modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background, each with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 143-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Jessica Page Morrell, in ''Between the Lines: Master the Subtle Elements of Fiction Writing'' (2006), mentioned six ''delivery modes'': action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Peter Selgin, in ''By Cunning and Craft: Sound Advice and Practical Wisdom for Fiction Writers'' (2007), mentioned five writing ''methods'': action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, and description.&lt;ref&gt;Selgin, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Mike Klaassen, in ''Fiction-Writing Modes: Eleven Essential Tools for Bringing Your Story to Life'' (2015), addressed eleven modes: action, summarization, narration, description, exposition, transition, conversation (dialogue), sensation, introspection, emotion, and recollection.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narration==
{{main article|Narration}}
In ''Poetics'', Aristotle mentions narration as a mode, or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt; Aristotle, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As a fiction-writing mode, narration is how the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader. This contrasts with the use of the term "narration" as a [[rhetorical mode]] of discourse, where it has a broader meaning which encompasses all written fiction.

==Description==
[[Description]] is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story.  Together with [[dialogue]], narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes.  Description is more than the amassing of details, it is bringing a scene to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polking|Polking]], 1990, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposition==
{{main article|Exposition (narrative)}}
Broadly defined, exposition is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. Within the context of fiction-writing modes, exposition is used to convey information.  Exposition may be used to add [[drama]] to a story, but too much exposition at one time may slow the pace of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kernen|Kernen]], 1999, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summarization==
[[:wikt:summarisation|Summarization]], or narrative summary, condenses events to convey, rather than to show, what happens within a story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA144 144-6].&lt;/ref&gt;  The "tell" in the [[axiom]] "[[Show, don't tell]]" is often in the form of summarization.  Summarization may be used to:

* connect parts of a story
* report details of less important events
* skip events that are irrelevant to the plot
* convey an emotional state over an extended period of time&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA145 145].&lt;/ref&gt;
* vary the rhythm and texture of the writing&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne, King &amp; Booth]], 2004, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space than other fiction-writing modes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Selgin|Selgin]], 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective use of summarization requires a balance between showing and telling, action and summary, with rhythm, pace and tone playing a role.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA140 140-2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introspection==
{{main article|Introspection}}
Introspection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, or self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey the thoughts of a character, allowing the expression of normally unexpressed thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne, King &amp; Booth]], 2004, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Introspection may also be used to:
* enhance a story by allowing the character's thoughts to deepen [[characterisation]]
* increase tension
* widen the scope of a story&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kress|Kress]], 2003, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* play a critical role in both [[scene (fiction)|scene and sequel]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bickham|Bickham]], 1993, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzUo-KvpA2UC&amp;g=PA12 12-22], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzUo-KvpA2UC&amp;g=PA50 50-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recollection==
[[Recollection]] is the fiction-writing mode whereby a character [[Memory|remembers]] a detail or event. It plays a vital role in conveying [[Back-story|backstory]] by allowing writers to convey information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story.  Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct mode of fiction-writing, it is a common tool.  Recollection could be considered a subset of [[#Introspection|introspection]], but its role in developing backstory separates it from the other thoughts of a character.  Effective presentation of recollection has its own unique issues and challenges.  For example, timing a recollection to avoid implausible-seeming memories (such as when a character must make a key decision) can be difficult, and should be prompted by a recent plot event.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA113 113].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensation==
[[Sensation (fiction)|Sensation]] is used to portray a character's [[perception]]s. It can help draw the reader in by conveying the actual sensations of things comprising the story, breathing life into its physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rozelle|Rozelle]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O3CIkg9NDAC&amp;pg=PA76 76].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA172 172].&lt;/ref&gt; Since the reader has experienced only a portion of the sensations experienced by the character, the author aims to either provoke recall from the reader, or convey the experience,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rozelle|Rozelle]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O3CIkg9NDAC&amp;pg=PA86 86].&lt;/ref&gt; drawing the reader in and maintaining interest in the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA173 173].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotion==
The fiction-writing mode of [[emotion]] conveys the feelings of the character, and is a vital component of [[creative writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reid|Reid]], 1994, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Connecting the character to his own emotions allows the author to connect with the reader on an emotional level.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kempton|Kempton]], 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ayhE_0hlH34C&amp;pg=PA148 148].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA74 74].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action==
In ''Poetics'', Aristotle refers to action as a mode, or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Action (fiction)|Action]] is the demonstration of events as they are happening in a story,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ziBORQpTMD0C&amp;pg=PA142 142].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA127 127].&lt;/ref&gt; and may help readers feel as if they were participating in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]], 2008, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition==
[[Transition (fiction)|Transitions]] in fiction are words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or punctuation that may be used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, point-of-view character, mood, tone, emotion, and pace.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA281-2 281-2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polking|Polking]], 1990, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Fiction-writing modes may be classified into categories of modes with common features. 
* ''Interiority''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 6. &lt;/ref&gt; includes modes that reflect the inner workings of the character's mind: introspection, recollection, emotion, and sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Exteriority'' includes modes that represent what is outside the character's mind: narration, description, exposition, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Dialogue'' represents a character's speech: conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Activity'' includes modes used to portray story events: action and summarization.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foxy boxing''' is a form of [[sports entertainment]] which involves two or more women [[boxing]] (or pretending to do so) in a sexualized context as a form of erotic entertainment. The participants are typically dressed in revealing clothing such as [[bikini]]s or skintight [[leotard]]s, while the actual fight usually focuses on the beauty of the combatants rather than fighting skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=opYA03qIQPYC&amp;pg=PA40 |title=Good with Their Hands |author=Carlo Rotella |publisher=University of California Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-520-24335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxy boxing is unusual in that the audience generally does not care who wins. It is believed to have its roots in "singles' bars in southern California" after the interest in women's boxing began to decline in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Encyclopedia of Women and Sports: A-G |last=Christensen |first=Karen |authorlink= |author2=Allen Guttmann |author3=Gertrud Pfister  |year=2001 |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |location= |isbn= |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srYYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22foxy+boxing%22&amp;dq=%22foxy+boxing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZUztTMyWFcGAlAfzgrCNAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBzgU |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream competitive sport of [[women's boxing]] has tried to avoid association with  foxy boxing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The boxer's heart: how I fell in love with the ring |last=Sekules
 |first=Kate |year=2000 |publisher=Villard |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6G1AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the successful female boxer [[Mia St. John]] emphasised her sexuality by appearing on the cover of [[Playboy]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Women boxers: the new warriors |page=22 |year=2006 |author=C. Ondine Chavoya |isbn=978-1-55885-475-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a popular entertainment used in the [[Philippines]] for military men in the 1980s and 90s. It included both boxing and wrestling and the women were expected to "draw blood and show bruises before they got paid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Madonnas and martyrs: militarism and violence in the Philippines |last=Hilsdon |first=Anne-Marie |authorlink= |year=1995 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |location= |isbn= |pages=99–100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3zDXQ-2B0kC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=%22foxy+boxing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7kftTKv9A4X6lwee8YyMAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22foxy%20boxing%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxy boxing was also utilized by bar owners in [[Thailand]] for the same type of audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The morning after: sexual politics at the end of the Cold War |last=H.

The style of fighting was formed into a new genre by David Borden, into what came to be known as [[Kaiju Big Battel]], which was staged fights with a heavy [[tokusatsu]] and pop culture influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |date=October 2002 |title=Anime Instincts |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |publisher=Bob Guccione, Jr. |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EiUGaclNKKQC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=%22foxy+boxing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=507tTIuJKMWBlAft09GQAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22foxy%20boxing%22&amp;f=false |doi= |pmid= |pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although foxy boxing is more of an entertainment spectacle than a sport, it has resulted in injuries. A foxy boxer at a high-end strip club in Rhode Island sued her employer after her silicone breast implants were ruptured in a fight. The class action suit ruled her employer liable.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Media and popular culture==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
The sport is frequently referenced in [[popular culture]]:
*Homer Simpson on ''The Simpsons'' mentioned it three times: In the season one episode "[[Homer's Night Out]],"Foxy Boxing" is one of the places where Homer and Bart stop at in their quest for [[Princess Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family |last=Groening |first=Matt |year=1997 |publisher=HarperPerennial|location=New York |isbn=  0-06095252-0|page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the season six episode "[[Lisa on Ice]]", he tells Lisa that "if the Bible has taught us nothing else--and it hasn't--it's that girls should stick to girl sports, such as hot-oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The gospel according to the Simpsons |last=I. Pinsky |first=Mark |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location= |isbn= |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qlrh_eGSPZQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22foxy+boxing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2ErtTITvDIWKlwful9X9AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22foxy%20boxing%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on the season 12 episode "[[Tennis the Menace]]", Homer builds a tennis court, only to learn that tennis is not the same as foxy boxing (or as he calls it, "the sport where the chicks wail on each other").
*The ''[[King of the Hill]]'' episode "Boxing Luanne" centered on [[Luanne Platter]] thinking she has taken up mainstream women's boxing, only to find she has been underwritten by [[Buck Strickland]] for foxy boxing.
* ''[[Miami Vice]]'' season one episode 9 "Glades" contains a scene of two women foxy boxing approximately 9 minutes into the episode.   The owner of the club promoting the event even refers directly to the sport stating, "Foxy Boxing is what's in now"
* In the final episode of the TV Series ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' (Discos &amp; Dragons, Season 1, Ep. 18) [[Seth Rogen]]'s character Ken is thrown out of a disco club for causing a scene and making fun of disco music.  As he's being escorted from the building, the bouncer at the disco club tells him not to worry too much because the disco will be shut down the following week in favor of foxy boxing.&lt;ref name="freaks"&gt;(29 October 2010).

* On the March 17, 2010 episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', Jon Stewart compares the U.S. congressional debate over health care reform to foxy boxing.
*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode [[Baby, You Knock Me Out]] [[Lois Griffin]] starts her "boxing career" as a foxy boxer.

'''Frank Farian''' (born '''Franz Reuther''' 18 July 1941, [[Kirn]], [[Germany]]) is a German [[record producer]] and [[songwriter]], best known as the founder and voice behind the 1970s' [[disco]]-pop group [[Boney M.]] and as the mastermind and voice behind the lip-syncing group [[Milli Vanilli]]. His tendency to create bands with a visual image distinct from the recorded musical performances has led to controversy throughout his career, especially in the case of Milli Vanilli. Farian is also the owner of the record label MCI and several subsidiaries.

==Career==
Farian started as a trained cook before moving into the [[music industry]]. In April 1967, he released "[[Will You Ever Be Mine]]" under the name "Frankie Farian".

===Boney M.=== 
In the early days of his career, he was keen to attain success as a solo artist, but he made little impact on the popular music scene until his song "[[Baby Do You Wanna Bump]]" (a remake of [[Prince Buster]]'s song "Al Capone" from 1967), released under the pseudonym [[Boney M.]], became successful. He also had a minor hit in 1973 with "[[Was kann schöner sein]]", a German version of "When You've Gotta Go" originally by [[Solomon King]], co-written by [[Lynsey de Paul]] and [[Ron Roker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/titel-details-543979 |title=Offizielle Deutsche Charts - Offizielle Deutsche Charts |website=Offiziellecharts.de |date= |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Shying away from the spotlight, he  hired performers to front for public performances. All records were recorded in Offenbach-Bieber, a small town in the center of West Germany. The lead vocals for songs on Boney M. albums in the 1970s were sung by Farian, [[Marcia Barrett]] and [[Liz Mitchell]], who quickly became synonymous with the group. Boney M.'s frontman, [[Bobby Farrell]], was only allowed to record vocals in the 1980s (although all four members of the group did sing live for all their concert tours). Bobby Farrell was fired from the group for unreliability in 1981.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Far Corporation===
Farian also started the [[Supergroup (bands)|supergroup]] [[Far Corporation]] (named after the first syllable of his last name), which featured [[Steve Lukather]], [[David Paich]], [[Bobby Kimball]], [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]], and [[Robin McAuley]], many of [[Toto (band)|Toto]] fame. Far Corporation is notable for being the first act to [[record chart|chart]] with a [[cover version]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]", becoming a [[Top 40|top 10]] [[Hit record|hit]] in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]], reaching number 8 in October 1985.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

===Meat Loaf===
In 1986, Farian produced and mixed the [[Meat Loaf]] album ''[[Blind Before I Stop]]''. He also sang backing vocals on the first single from the album "[[Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries]]", which was credited to Meat Loaf featuring [[John Parr]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums 2"&gt;{{cite book

===Milli Vanilli===
In 1990, he admitted orchestrating the events which led to the [[Milli Vanilli]] scandal, a musical equivalent of [[Ghostwriter|ghostwriting]]. As a producer, he had assembled a group from [[session musician]]s, fronting it with visually attractive dancers [[Rob Pilatus]] and [[Fab Morvan]]. The story broke when Farian confirmed to the press that someone else had sung on the [[Gramophone record|records]].&lt;ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years"&gt;{{cite book

===Later activity===
Some other groups that Farian has been involved with are [[Eruption (band)|Eruption]] (he became a manager in 1977) and [[No Mercy (pop band)|No Mercy]].

On 15 August 2006, the [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Daddy Cool (musical)|Daddy Cool]]'' opened at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. The line-up included [[Michelle Collins]], [[Michael Harvey (musician)|Michael Harvey]], [[Javine Hylton]], and singer/songwriter Darvina Plante. The £3 million show was produced by Farian and Robert Mackintosh. The story, written by Stephen Plaice with Amani Naphtali, is predominantly based on the songs of Boney M., but also features songs by Milli Vanilli and No Mercy. A second show opened on 23 April 2007 in Berlin, [[Germany]] and the show also toured in the [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daddycoolmusical.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519131138/http://www.daddycoolmusical.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-05-19|title=Daddy Cool Musical|website=Daddycoolmusical.com|accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; from August 2011 to February 2012, [[Spain]] ([[Palma de Mallorca]]) in July 2012, [[Switzerland]] from, November 2015 to January 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.le-theatre.ch/daddycool |title=DADDY COOL - das Musical mit den Welthits von Boney M. im Le Théâtre Kriens-Luzern |website=Le-theatre.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404071429/http://www.le-theatre.ch/daddycool/ |archivedate=4 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anniversary tour in Germany 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.showservice-international.de/daddy-cool-das-boney-m-musical.html |title=Daddy Cool Das Boney M Musical - Frank Serr Showservice Int. e.K |website=Showservice-international.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205023651/http://www.showservice-international.de/daddy-cool-das-boney-m-musical.html |archive-date=5 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2006, Farian was credited as co-writing a new song, entitled "[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)#"Doin' Fine"|Doin' Fine]]", with British producers Nathan Thomas and Carl M. Cox. (Other writers involved in this song were, Chris Rudall, Baz Qureshi, [[Peter Wilson (musician)|Peter Wilson]], Chris Richards and George Reyam.) Described as paying tribute to the 'sound' of Boney M., the song was essentially a brand new composition, which featured the string [[arrangement]] from Boney M.'s 1976 number one hit, "[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]". The song was recorded by Australian pop singer, Peter Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterwilsonmusic.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604231424/http://www.peterwilsonmusic.com/ |date=4 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially released in the UK on 16 April 2007 in its extended format, entitled "Daddy's Cool 12" Mix", charting at number one on the EuroDanceHits EuroNRG Top 40 in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurodancehits.com/index.html |title=Euro Dance Hits : Site News |publisher=Eurodancehits.com |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of "Doin' Fine" featured on Peter Wilson's debut album, ''Follow Me'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.klonerecords.com/releases/moreinfo.php?ID=281 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015201113/http://klonerecords.com/releases/moreinfo.php?ID=281 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-15 |title=Klone Records! |publisher=Klone Records! |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released in the UK on 8 October 2007. The song was also recorded in 2008 by [[Amanda Lear]].

Other acts he collaborated with include [[Gilla (singer)|Gilla]], [[Eruption (band)|Eruption]], [[La Mama (band)|La Mama]], [[Precious Wilson]], [[Gift]] and [[Daniel Lopes]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The songs are originally in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and are getting millions of downloads on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epoca.globo.com/vida/vida-util/carreira/noticia/2013/10/como-os-criadores-da-bgalinha-pintadinhab-ficaram-milionarios.html|title=Como os criadores da Galinha Pintadinha ficaram milionários|last=Coronato|first=Marcos|author2=Ciscati, Rafael|date=4 October 2013|work=[[Época (Brazilian magazine)|Época]]|language=Portuguese|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the songs have been already translated into Spanish and English.

==History==
The songs revolve around the title character Galinha Pintadinha, a [[cartoon]] chicken and their friends from [[nursery rhyme]]s, in animated music videos made in [[flash animation]]. They were phenomena in DVD sales during the early 2010s to be released and publicized nationally by [[Som Livre]] becoming well known among children with clowns [[Patati Patatá]].
Also released several products based on the characters as toys, books and apps for smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galinhapintadinha.com.br/loja/produtos.html |title=Store |accessdate=26 June 2012 |author=Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708232047/http://www.galinhapintadinha.com.br/loja/produtos.html |archivedate=8 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to [[Associação Brasileira dos Produtores de Discos]], the second DVD was the 6th biggest selling in 2010 DVD and 17th best-selling in 2011 in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Downloads"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abpd.org.br/downloads/Fina2011.pdf/ |title=Mercado Brasileiro de Música 2011 |publisher=''[[Associação Brasileira dos Produtores de Discos|ABPD]]'' |accessdate=August 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014073225/http://abpd.org.br/downloads/Fina2011.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the animated music videos premiered on [[Netflix]] in several countries including in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and Spanish Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.abril.com.br/noticias/internet/2015/07/galinha-pintadinha-chega-ao-netflix-dos-estados-unidos-e-de-paises-de-lingua-espanhola.shtml |title=Galinha Pintadinha estreia na Netflix dos Estados Unidos e de países de língua espanhola |accessdate=11 September 2015|author=Info Abril}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 his studio occupied the 89th position as one of the 150 biggest licensed brands in the world, ranking published by the British magazine ''License! Global''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/top-150-global-licensors-1?page=0,11&lt;/ref&gt;
==Media==
Since the release of their second album the character had a pretty big growth in children's media in Brazil. Many toys, backpacks, CDs, books and supplies for babies have been launched over the years. The characters also have achieved media for Smartphones with music applications and interactive games such as ''PoChickenPo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.techtudo.com.br/tudo-sobre/galinha-pintadinha-no-android.html|title=Galinha Pintadinha no Android| publisher=Techtudo|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mathematics]] of [[gambling]] are a collection of [[probability]] applications encountered in games of chance and can be included in [[game theory]]. From a mathematical point of view, the games of chance are experiments generating various types of [[aleatory]] events, the probability of which can be calculated by using the properties of probability on a finite space of events.

==Experiments, events, probability spaces==
The technical processes of a game stand for experiments that generate [[aleatory]] events. Here are a few examples:
* Throwing the dice in [[craps]] is an experiment that generates events such as occurrences of certain numbers on the dice, obtaining a certain sum of the shown numbers, and obtaining numbers with certain properties (less than a specific number, higher than a specific number, even, uneven, and so on). The [[sample space]] of such an experiment is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for rolling one die or {(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), ..., (2, 6), ..., (6, 1), (6, 2), ..., (6, 6)} for rolling two dice. The latter is a set of ordered pairs and counts 6 x 6 = 36 elements. The events can be identified with sets, namely parts of the sample space. For example, the event ''occurrence of an even number'' is represented by the following set in the experiment of rolling one die: {2, 4, 6}.
* Spinning the [[roulette]] wheel is an experiment whose generated events could be the occurrence of a certain number, of a certain color or a certain property of the numbers (low, high, even, uneven, from a certain row or column, and so on). The sample space of the experiment involving spinning the roulette wheel is the set of numbers the roulette holds: {1, 2, 3, ..., 36, 0, 00} for the American roulette, or {1, 2, 3, ..., 36, 0} for the European. The event ''occurrence of a red number'' is represented by the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 36}. These are the numbers inscribed in red on the roulette wheel and table.
* Dealing cards in [[blackjack]] is an experiment that generates events such as the occurrence of a certain card or value as the first card dealt, obtaining a certain total of points from the first two cards dealt, exceeding 21 points from the first three cards dealt, and so on. In card games we encounter many types of experiments and categories of events. Each type of experiment has its own sample space. For example, the experiment of dealing the first card to the first player has as its sample space the set of all 52 cards (or 104, if played with two decks). The experiment of dealing the second card to the first player has as its sample space the set of all 52 cards (or 104), less the first card dealt. The experiment of dealing the first two cards to the first player has as its sample space a set of ordered pairs, namely all the 2-size arrangements of cards from the 52 (or 104). In a game with one player, the event ''the player is dealt a card of 10 points as the first dealt card'' is represented by the set of cards {10♠, 10♣, 10♥, 10♦, J♠, J♣, J♥, J♦, Q♠, Q♣, Q♥, Q♦, K♠, K♣, K♥, K♦}. The event ''the player is dealt a total of five points from the first two dealt cards'' is represented by the set of 2-size combinations of card values {(A, 4), (2, 3)}, which in fact counts 4 x 4 + 4 x 4 = 32 combinations of cards (as value and symbol).
* In 6/49 [[lottery]], the experiment of drawing six numbers from the 49 generates events such as drawing six specific numbers, drawing five numbers from six specific numbers, drawing four numbers from six specific numbers, drawing at least one number from a certain group of numbers, etc. The sample space here is the set of all 6-size combinations of numbers from the 49.
* In [[draw poker]], the experiment of dealing the initial five card hands generates events such as dealing at least one certain card to a specific player, dealing a pair to at least two players, dealing four identical symbols to at least one player, and so on. The sample space in this case is the set of all 5-card combinations from the 52 (or the deck used).
* Dealing two cards to a player who has discarded two cards is another experiment whose sample space is now the set of all 2-card combinations from the 52, less the cards seen by the observer who solves the probability problem. For example, if you are in play in the above situation and want to figure out some odds regarding your hand, the sample space you should consider is the set of all 2-card combinations from the 52, less the three cards you hold and less the two cards you discarded. This sample space counts the 2-size combinations from 47.

==The probability model==
A probability model starts from an experiment and a mathematical structure attached to that experiment, namely the space (field) of events. The event is the main unit probability theory works on. In gambling, there are many categories of events, all of which can be textually predefined. In the previous examples of gambling experiments we saw some of the events that experiments generate. They are a minute part of all possible events, which in fact is the
set of all parts of the sample space.

For a specific game, the various types of events can be:
* Events related to your own play or to opponents’ play;
* Events related to one person’s play or to several persons’ play;
* Immediate events or long-shot events.

Each category can be further divided into several other subcategories, depending on the game referred to. These events can be literally defined, but it must be done very carefully when framing a probability problem. From a mathematical point of view, the events are nothing more than subsets and the space of events is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. Among these events, we find elementary and compound events, exclusive and nonexclusive events, and independent and non-independent events.

In the experiment of rolling a die:
* Event {3, 5} (whose literal definition is ''occurrence of 3 or 5'') is compound because {3, 5}= {3} U {5};
* Events {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6} are elementary;
* Events {3, 5} and {4} are incompatible or'' ''exclusive because their intersection is empty; that is, they cannot occur simultaneously;
* Events {1, 2, 5} and {2, 5} are nonexclusive, because their intersection is not empty;
* In the experiment of rolling two dice one after another, the events ''obtaining 3 on the first die'' and ''obtaining 5 on the second die'' are independent because the occurrence of the second event is not influenced by the occurrence of the first, and vice versa.

In the experiment of dealing the pocket cards in Texas Hold’em Poker:
* The event of dealing (3♣, 3♦) to a player is an elementary event;
* The event of dealing two 3’s to a player is compound because is the union of events (3♣, 3♠), (3♣, 3♥), (3♣, 3♦), (3♠, 3♥), (3♠, 3♦) and (3♥, 3♦);
* The events ''player 1 is dealt a pair of kings'' and ''player 2 is dealt a pair of kings'' are nonexclusive (they can both occur);
* The events ''player 1 is dealt two connectors of hearts higher than J'' and ''player 2 is dealt two connectors of hearts higher than J'' are exclusive (only one can occur);
* The events ''player 1 is dealt (7, K)'' and ''player 2 is dealt (4, Q)'' are non-independent (the occurrence of the second depends on the occurrence of the first, while the same deck is in use).
These are a few examples of gambling events, whose properties of compoundness, exclusiveness and independency are easily observable. These
properties are very important in practical probability calculus.

The complete [[mathematical model]] is given by the probability field attached to the experiment, which is the triple ''sample space—field of events—probability function''. For any game of chance, the probability model is of the simplest type—the sample space is finite, the space of events is the set of parts of the sample space, implicitly finite, too, and the probability function is given by the definition of [[probability]] on a finite space of events:

==Combinations==
Games of chance are also good examples of [[combinations]], [[permutations]] and arrangements, which are met at every step: combinations of cards in a player’s hand, on the table or expected in any card game; combinations of numbers when rolling several dice once; combinations of numbers in lottery and bingo; combinations of symbols in slots; permutations and arrangements in a race to be bet on, and the like. Combinatorial calculus is an important part of gambling probability applications. In games of chance, most of the gambling probability calculus in which we use the classical definition of probability reverts to counting combinations. The gaming events can be identified with sets, which often are sets of combinations. Thus, we can identify an event with a combination.

For example, in a five draw poker game, the event ''at least one player holds a four of a kind formation'' can be identified with the set of all combinations of (xxxxy) type, where ''x'' and ''y'' are distinct values of cards. This set has 13C(4,4)(52-4)=624 combinations. Possible combinations are (3♠ 3♣ 3♥ 3♦ J♣) or (7♠ 7♣ 7♥ 7♦ 2♣). These can be identified with elementary events that the event to be measured consists of.

==Expectation and strategy==
Games of chance are not merely pure applications of probability calculus and gaming situations are not just isolated events whose numerical probability is well established through mathematical methods; they are also games whose progress is influenced by human action. In gambling, the human element has a striking character. The player is not only interested in the mathematical probability of the various gaming events, but he or she has expectations from the games while a major interaction exists. To obtain favorable results from this interaction, gamblers take into account all possible information, including [[statistics]], to build gaming strategies. The predicted [[average]] gain or loss is called ''[[expected value|expectation]]'' or [[expected value]] and is the sum of the probability of each possible outcome of the experiment multiplied by its payoff (value). Thus, it represents the average amount one expects to win per bet if bets with identical odds are repeated many times. A game or situation in which the expected value for the player is zero (no net gain nor loss) is called a ''fair game. ''The attribute ''fair ''refers not to the technical process of the game, but to the chance balance house (bank)–player.

Even though the randomness inherent in games of chance would seem to ensure their fairness (at least with respect to the players around a table—shuffling a deck or spinning a wheel do not favor any player except if they are fraudulent), gamblers always search and wait for irregularities in this randomness that will allow them to win. It has been mathematically proved that, in ideal conditions of randomness, and with negative expectation, no long-run regular winning is possible for players of games of chance. Most gamblers accept this premise, but still work on strategies to make them win either in the short term or over the long run.

==House advantage or edge==
Casino games provide a predictable long-term advantage to the casino, or "house", while offering the player the possibility of a large short-term payout. Some casino games have a skill element, where the player makes decisions; such games are called "random with a tactical element." While it is possible through skilful play to minimize the house advantage, it is extremely rare that a player has sufficient skill to completely eliminate his inherent long-term disadvantage (the '''house edge''' or '''house vigorish''') in a casino game. Common belief is that such a skill set would involve years of training, an extraordinary memory and numeracy, and/or acute visual or even aural observation, as in the case of [[Eudaemons|wheel clocking]] in Roulette. For more examples see [[Advantage gambling]].

The player's disadvantage is a result of the casino not paying winning wagers according to the game's "true odds", which are the payouts that would be expected considering the odds of a wager either winning or losing. For example, if a game is played by wagering on the number that would result from the roll of one die, true odds would be 5 times the amount wagered since there is a 1/6 probability of any single number appearing. However, the casino may only pay 4 times the amount wagered for a winning wager.

The house edge (HE) or [[vigorish]] is defined as the casino profit expressed as a percentage of the player's original bet. In games such as [[Blackjack]] or [[Spanish 21]], the final bet may be several times the original bet, if the player doubles or splits.

Example: In American [[Roulette]], there are two zeroes and 36 non-zero numbers (18 red and 18 black). If a player bets $1 on red, his chance of winning $1 is therefore 18/38 and his chance of losing $1 (or winning -$1) is 20/38.

The player's expected value, EV = (18/38 x 1) + (20/38 x -1) = 18/38 - 20/38 = -2/38 = -5.26%. Therefore, the house edge is 5.26%. After 10 rounds, play $1 per round, the average house profit will be 10 x $1 x 5.26% = $0.53.
Of course, it is not possible for the casino to win exactly 53 cents; this figure is the average casino profit from each player if it had millions of players each betting 10 rounds at $1 per round.

The house edge of casino games vary greatly with the game. Keno can have house edges up to 25%, slot machines can have up to 15%, while most [[Pontoon (game)|Australian Pontoon]] games have house edges between 0.3% and 0.4%.

The calculation of the Roulette house edge was a trivial exercise; for other games, this is not usually the case. Combinatorial analysis and/or computer simulation is necessary to complete the task.

In games which have a skill element, such as Blackjack or [[Spanish 21]], the house edge is defined as the house advantage from optimal play (without the use of advanced techniques such as [[card counting]] or [[shuffle tracking]]), on the first hand of the shoe (the container that holds the cards). The set of the optimal plays for all possible hands is known as "basic strategy" and is highly dependent on the specific rules, and even the number of decks used. Good Blackjack and Spanish 21 games have house edges below 0.5%.

Online slot games often have a published Return to Player (RTP) percentage that determines the theoretical house edge. Some software developers choose to publish the RTP of their slot games while others do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gamblersfever.net/online-slots-return-to-player-rtp-explained/ |title=Online slots Return to Player (RTP) explained - GamblersFever }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the set theoretical RTP, almost any outcome is possible in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://getgamblingfacts.ca/how-gambling-really-works/return-to-player-rtp-and-hit-frequency-what-do-these-mean/ |title=Return to Player and Hit frequency - What do these mean? - GetGamblingFacts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard deviation==

The luck factor in a casino game is quantified using [[standard deviation]] (SD). The standard deviation of a simple game like Roulette can be simply calculated because of the [[binomial distribution]] of successes (assuming a result of 1 unit for a win, and 0 units for a loss). For the binomial distribution, SD is equal to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{npq}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of rounds played, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of winning, and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of losing. Furthermore, if we flat bet at 10 units per round instead of 1 unit, the range of possible outcomes increases 10 fold. Therefore, SD for Roulette even-money bet is equal to &lt;math&gt;2b\sqrt{npq}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the flat bet per round, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of rounds, &lt;math&gt;p=18/38&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;q=20/38&lt;/math&gt;.

After enough large number of rounds the theoretical distribution of the total win converges to the [[normal distribution]], giving a good possibility to forecast the possible win or loss. For example, after 100 rounds at $1 per round, the standard deviation of the win (equally of the loss) will be &lt;math&gt;2\cdot\$1\cdot\sqrt{100\cdot18/38\cdot20/38}\approx\$9.99&lt;/math&gt;. After 100 rounds, the expected loss will be &lt;math&gt;100\cdot\$1\cdot2/38\approx\$5.26&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Three sigma rule|3 sigma]] range is six times the standard deviation: three above the mean, and three below. Therefore, after 100 rounds betting $1 per round, the result will very probably be somewhere between &lt;math&gt;-\$5.26-3\cdot\$9.99&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\$5.26+3\cdot\$9.99&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., between -$34 and $24. There is still a ca. 1 to 400 chance that the result will be not in this range, i.e. either the win will exceed $24, or the loss will exceed $34.

The standard deviation for the even-money Roulette bet is one of the lowest out of all casinos games. Most games, particularly slots, have extremely high standard deviations. As the size of the potential payouts increase, so does the standard deviation.

Unfortunately, the above considerations for small numbers of rounds are incorrect, because the distribution is far from normal. Moreover, the results of more volatile games usually converge to the normal distribution much more slowly, therefore much more huge number of rounds are required for that.

As the number of rounds increases, eventually, the expected loss will exceed the standard deviation, many times over. From the formula, we can see the standard deviation is proportional to the square root of the number of rounds played, while the expected loss is proportional to the number of rounds played. As the number of rounds increases, the expected loss increases at a much faster rate. This is why it is practically impossible for a gambler to win in the long term (if they don't have an edge). It is the high ratio of short-term standard deviation to expected loss that fools gamblers into thinking that they can win.

The volatility index (VI) is defined as the standard deviation for one round, betting one unit. Therefore, the VI for the even-money American Roulette bet is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{18/38\cdot20/38}\approx0.499&lt;/math&gt;.

The variance &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the square of the VI. Therefore, the variance of the even-money American Roulette bet is ca. 0.249, which is extremely low for a casino game. The variance for Blackjack is ca. 1.2, which is still low compared to the variances of [[slot machine|electronic gaming machines]] (EGMs).

Additionally, the term of the volatility index based on some confidence intervals are used. Usually, it is based on the 90% confidence interval. The volatility index for the 90% confidence interval is ca. 1.645 times as the "usual" volatility index that relates to the ca. 68.27% confidence interval.

It is important for a casino to know both the house edge and volatility index for all of their games. The house edge tells them what kind of profit they will make as percentage of turnover, and the volatility index tells them how much they need in the way of cash reserves. The mathematicians and computer programmers that do this kind of work are called gaming mathematicians and gaming analysts. Casinos do not have in-house expertise in this field, so they outsource their requirements to experts in the gaming analysis field.

[[Image:Harlem-magicians-poster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poster for a basketball event involving Harlem Magicians]] 
'''Harlem Magicians''' was a [[basketball]] enterprise founded in 1953 by Lon Varnell through his Varnell Enterprises, that was similar in fashion and activities to the basketball entertainment program the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. The full name of the [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] [[basketball]] team was '''The Fabulous Harlem Magicians''' with the main star attraction of the team being [[Marques Haynes]]. Haynes had been a member of the Globetrotters, but had left the team due to a contract dispute to join the Magicians. Other famous players in the team were [[Goose Tatum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://talesofelnora.blogspot.com/2008/12/night-harlem-magicians-came-to-town.html The Night the Harlem Magicians Came to Town]&lt;/ref&gt; Bob "Ergie" Erickson (who once stole the ball from Haynes four times in one game), and [[Ron Cavenall]]. [[Dempsey Hovland]], founder of 20th Century Booking Agency and himself owner of several barnstorming teams was recruited to book the Harlem Magicians' games. 

In late 1961, [[Abe Saperstein]], founder and owner of the Harlem Globetrotters opened a lawsuit against Lon Varnell for alleged violation of Harlem Globetrotters' registered trademarks, "Harlem Globetrotters" and "Magicians of Basketball" by promoting a basketball team known as the "Harlem Magicians". In 1964, the parties settled the litigation by entering a consent decree approved by the District Court for the Southern District of New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjurist.org/872/f2d/1025/harlem-globetrotters-incorporated-v-harlem-magicians-incorporated Harlem Globetrotters, Incorporated, Plaintiff-Appellee v.

Certain words have been suggested to be inherently funny. [[Vaudeville]] tradition holds that words with the letter ''k'' are funny. A 2015 study at the [[University of Alberta]] suggested that the humor of certain [[nonsense word]]s can be explained by whether they seem rude, and by the property of [[entropy]] – the improbability of certain letters being used together in a word. The philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] posited that [[humor]] is a product of one's expectations being violated. (Realisation)

==Funny words in English==

[[Vaudeville]] words can be found in [[Neil Simon]]'s 1972 play ''[[The Sunshine Boys]]'', in which an aging comedian gives a lesson to his nephew on comedy, saying that words with ''k'' sounds are funny:{{refn|name=Chaffee}}

{{blockquote|Fifty-seven years in this business, you learn a few things. You know what words are funny and which words are not funny. Alka Seltzer is funny. You say 'Alka Seltzer' you get a laugh ... Words with 'k' in them are funny. Casey Stengel, that's a funny name. Robert Taylor is not funny. Cupcake is funny. Tomato is not funny. Cookie is funny. Cucumber is funny. Car keys. Cleveland ... Cleveland is funny. Maryland is not funny. Then, there's chicken. Chicken is funny. Pickle is funny. Cab is funny. Cockroach is funny – not if you get 'em, only if you say 'em.{{refn|name=Helitzer}}{{refn|name=Franzini}}}}

[[Richard Wiseman]], a professor of the public understanding of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Hertfordshire]], conducted a small experiment to determine whether words with a ''k'' sound were actually considered funnier than others for English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg19426070-700-quacked-humour/ |first=Ivan |last=Berger |title=Quacked humour |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=6 June 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[LaughLab]] tested the degree of funniness among a family of jokes based on animal sounds; the joke rated the funniest was also the one with the most ''k'' sounds:

{{blockquote|Two ducks were sitting in a pond. One of the ducks said: "Quack". The other duck said: "I was going to say that!"&lt;ref name=Wiseman&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/apr/21/weekendmagazine |title=The truth about lying and laughing |first=Richard |last=Wiseman |authorlink=Richard Wiseman |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 April 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robert Beard, a [[professor emeritus]] of [[linguistics]] at [[Bucknell University]], told an interviewer that "The first thing people always write in [to his website] about is funny words".{{refn|name=Ask the Experts}} Beard's first book was ''The 100 Funniest Words in English'',{{refn|name=Ask the Experts}} and among his selected words are "absquatulate", "bowyangs", "collywobbles", "fartlek", "filibuster", "gongoozle", "hemidemisemiquaver", and "snollygoster".{{refn|name=Beard}}

==Rudeness and entropy==

A 2015 study published in the ''Journal of Memory and Language'' examined the humor of [[nonsense word]]s.{{refn|name=Alberta}}{{refn|name=Lewis}} The study used a computer program to generate pronounceable nonsense words that followed typical English spelling conventions and tested them for their perceived funniness to [[human test subject]]s.&lt;ref name=SoundFunny/&gt;

The funniest nonsense words tended to be those that reminded people of real words that are considered rude or offensive.&lt;ref name=SoundFunny/&gt;{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}} This category included four of the top-six nonsense words that were rated the funniest in the experiment: "whong", "dongl", "shart", and "focky".&lt;ref name=SoundFunny&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rd.com/magazine/funny-words/ |title=This is why some words just sound funny – and others don't |work=[[Reader's Digest]] |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain why these words seemed funny, the study's author said "The expectation that you've read or uttered a rude word is raised – and then violated, because in fact it's harmless nonsense. There's a sense of relief – of getting away with it."{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}}

After removing from consideration the words that seemed rude, another factor was suggested to also be significant. The study's lead author, Chris Westbury from the [[University of Alberta]], suggests that the humor of certain invented words can be explained by the property of [[entropy]].{{refn|name=Alberta}} Entropy (specifically [[Shannon entropy]]) here expresses how unlikely the letter combinations in certain nonsense words are: the more unlikely the letters are to be used together in English, the more funny the combination is likely to be found. Nonsense words such as "rumbus", "skritz", and "yuzz-a-ma-tuzz", which were created by children's book author and illustrator [[Dr. Seuss]], were found to have less probable letter combinations and to seem funnier than most ordinary English words.{{refn|name=Kaplan}}{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}} According to Westbury, "there's actually a consistent relationship between how funny [non{{nbh}}words] are and how weird they are".{{refn|name=Lewis}}

The entropy explanation also supports the notion that words with a 'k' in them tend to be more funny, as the letter 'k' is one of the least [[Letter frequency|frequently used letters]] in the English language.&lt;ref name=SoundFunny/&gt;

The idea that humor can be predicted by a word's entropy corresponds to the work of 19th-century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who posited that humor is a product of one's expectations being violated.{{refn|name=Lewis}}{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}} According to Westbury, "One reason puns are funny is that they violate our expectation that a word has one meaning".{{refn|name=Alberta}} Violating expectations corresponds mathematically to having a low probability combination of letters, which also makes the word seem particularly funny, according to Westbury.{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}}

To provide a possible evolutionary explanation of these phenomena, the authors of the study said that unusual occurrences may be experienced as indicating the presence of potential threats, and that humor may be a way of signalling to others that one has realized that a perceived threat is actually harmless. Westbury said "Strange as it may seem, that same mechanism may be activated when you see an unlikely looking word or a highly taboo one – you experience relief as you recognize that it's completely harmless – just a joke."{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21968">The '''International Magicians Society''' ('''IMS''') is the world's largest [[magic (illusion)|magic]] society as recorded in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. The IMS began in 1968 and now has over 41,000 members worldwide. It was created to help promote and preserve the art of magic and provide a format where magicians could share their secrets and ideas.

The IMS named [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]] as the Magicians of the Century in 2000 and named [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Doug Henning]], [[Harry Blackstone, Jr.]], [[Criss Angel]] and [[David Blaine]] as the most influential magicians of the past 25 years. The organization awards the Merlin Awards, every three years. "Every three years, the International Magicians Society hosts a banquet dinner, where those magicians who have achieved the highest level in their craft are awarded the coveted Merlin Award. The voting members begin with approximately one hundred names and narrows down to a handful. The criteria that the voting members consider are talent, showmanship, originality, skills, and above all the rare ability to entertain under any conditions."&lt;ref name=imswebsite&gt;[http://imsmagic.com/Merlin_Award.php "Merlin Awards"], Retrieved 2 Oct 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merlin Award==
The '''Merlin Award''' is given to magicians in recognition of their contributions to the performance and creation of magic around the world. While sometimes called the [[Academy Award]]s of magic, the Merlin Award lacks much of the oversight that enhance the credibility of awards in other industries.&lt;ref name=unofficialarchive&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Tim|title=Merlin Awards: Controversy|url=http://merlinawards.wordpress.com/controversy/|publisher=The Unofficial Archives of the Merlin Awards|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was created by [[Tony Hassini]] and his International Magicians Society and is given out to invited guests at triennial banquets as well as in person by Hassini himself with greater frequency.&lt;ref name=merlineawards&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassini|first=Tony|title=Merlin Awards|url=http://merlinawards.wordpress.com/controversy/|publisher=International Magicians Society|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imsmagic.com/Merlin_Award.php |title=Merlin award Criteria- IMS|publisher=imsmagic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The award is intended to be a recognition for magicians who perform at the highest level of skills on national and international stages. Merlin award can be obtained in three ways.One is to attend Merlin Award banquet dinner on invitation, after being voted to receive the prize. Another is by participating and winning a Merlin Award competition organized by IMS and held in different countries. Third way is for the organizers to travel to the magician’s country to present the award there. The criteria considered are talent, showmanship, originality, skills, and an ability to entertain under any conditions.

===Design===
The award statue was commissioned to over 100 art students in a nationwide search. The winning design was created by Carol Michaud, a New York University art student, in 1968.

====2016 awards====
in May 2016, Hany show received the Prestigious Merlin Award as " Best Stage Magic Middle East 2016.

Merlin Awards are not listed with either category or date:

''"Sometimes, I am asked why don’t we publish the year and category for each magician’s Merlin Award on our website. The fact is that when the magician receives his award, during the press conference, we announce the category. Thereafter, it serves no purpose to publish the category or the year on our website. Because some categories might sound more glorious than the others, there’s no point of hyping or diminishing anyone’s award or the year they received it. And there’s no point in dating their awards either. The bottom line is everyone who received the Merlin Award is a Merlin Award Recipient period and is entitled to enjoy the glory for the rest of their life without dating or categorizing it.”'' - '''Tony Hassini'''

It has been suggested that the Merlin Awards exist purely to generate publicity for the artist and income for the IMS. Tony Hassini clarifies this in the FAQ page of The International Magicians Society.

''"I’m also asked how do we consider a nominee for the Merlin Award? A magician must send to the IMS World Headquarters a videotape or DVD of his complete act for our Board of Directors to consider. (No promo DVD’s or online videos are accepted.) The other question I am asked is “Are there any costs to receive the Merlin Award?” First, I must say that the Merlin Award is not for sale at any cost. Regarding the actual out-of-pocket cost, this varies from situation to situation. There are three ways a magician can receive the Merlin Award. One is to attend our Merlin Award banquet dinner; this is by invitation only, after the recipient was voted to receive the Merlin Award. Two is to participate and win a Merlin Award competition in different countries, which is organized by IMS with the event and convention organizers. And three is for us to travel to the magician’s country and present the Merlin Award to them in their own country. So let’s look at the cost of the first scenario, which is where the magician must obtain a visa from the American embassy to travel to the USA. He must purchase airline tickets, other travel related costs and fees, hotels, meals, and $500 US dollars per plate at the Merlin Award banquet dinner. In the second scenario, again the magician must travel to the event where the Merlin Award competition is taking place. He pays all of the same travel expenses as mentioned in the first scenario and pays for the entrance fee to the convention or to the competition, whichever applies. In the third scenario, where we have to travel from the USA to the magician’s country, either the magician or the magician’s producer pays for all of the travel expenses, hotels, meals, airlines, and other related expenses. Within any of these three scenarios, it’s always a trade when it comes to the cost. Within any of the three scenarios, our main focus is to generate as much PR as possible with the general public. A good example of this is when we were going to present the Merlin Award to Louis Yan in Hong Kong, we could have presented the award to him in our Hong Kong IMS office. Or we could have had our IMS members meet at a nice Chinese restaurant and present the award to him there. Then we came up with an idea. We approached one of the largest shopping malls in Hong Kong. Not only did they build a custom stage and provided enough seating for the audience, they also provided guards for crowd control. The mall management, with their media contacts, were able to invite newspapers, radio, and television to cover the event. Both the mall and Louis Yan received tremendous PR and public awareness."'' - '''Tony Hassini'''

The '''''James Bond''''' series focuses on a fictional [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]] agent created in 1953 by writer [[Ian Fleming]], who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: [[Kingsley Amis]], [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]], [[John Gardner (British writer)|John Gardner]], [[Raymond Benson]], [[Sebastian Faulks]], [[Jeffery Deaver]], [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]] and [[Anthony Horowitz]]. The latest novel is ''[[Trigger Mortis]]'' by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally [[Charlie Higson]] wrote a series on [[Young Bond|a young James Bond]], and [[Samantha Weinberg|Kate Westbrook]] wrote three novels based on the [[The Moneypenny Diaries|diaries of a recurring series character]], [[Miss Moneypenny|Moneypenny]].

The character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running film series of all time and have grossed over $7.040 billion in total, making it the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|fourth-highest-grossing film series]] to date, which started in 1962 with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', starring [[Sean Connery]] as Bond. As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been twenty-four films in the [[Eon Productions]] [[James Bond in film|series]]. The most recent Bond film, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015), stars [[Daniel Craig]] in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (a 1967 [[Parody|spoof]]) and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''). In 2015 the series was estimated to be worth $19.9 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adejobi|first=Alicia|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/spectre-movie-james-bond-brand-worth-13bn-off-back-monster-box-office-dvd-sales-1525914|title=Spectre movie: James Bond brand worth £13bn off the back of monster box office and DVD sales|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|date=27 October 2015|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making ''James Bond'' one of the [[List of the highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]].

The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received [[Academy Award]] nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by [[Q (James Bond)|Q Branch]]. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as "[[Bond girl]]s".

==Publication history==

===Creation and inspiration===
{{Main|James Bond (literary character)|Inspirations for James Bond}}
Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond as the central figure for his works. Bond is an intelligence officer in the [[Secret Intelligence Service]], commonly known as MI6. Bond is known by his code number, 007, and was a [[Royal Naval Reserve]] [[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]]. Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] during the Second World War, admitting that Bond "was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war".&lt;ref name=" Macintyre (2008)"/&gt; Among those types were his brother, [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter]], who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in [[Norway in World War II|Norway]] and [[Greece in World War II|Greece]] during the war.&lt;ref name="PF Obit (1971)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Colonel Peter Fleming, Author and explorer|newspaper= The Times|date=20 August 1971|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including [[Conrad O'Brien-ffrench]], [[Patrick Dalzel-Job]] and [[Wilfred Dunderdale|Bill "Biffy" Dunderdale]].&lt;ref name= " Macintyre (2008)"/&gt;

The name James Bond came from that of the American [[ornithologist]] [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive [[field guide]] ''[[Birds of the West Indies]]''. Fleming, a keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]] himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that "It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born".{{sfn|Caplen|2010|p=21}} He further explained that:

{{Quote|text= When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument&amp;nbsp;... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard.|sign= Ian Fleming|source=''[[The New Yorker]]'', 21 April 1962&lt;ref name="Hellman (1962)"&gt;{{cite web |last= Hellman |first=Geoffrey T. |title= Bond's Creator |url= http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1962/04/21/1962_04_21_032_TNY_CARDS_000268062 |id= section "Talk of the Town" |work= The New Yorker |accessdate=9 September 2011 |authorlink=Geoffrey T. Hellman|page=32|date= 21 April 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On another occasion, Fleming said: "I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department."{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=112}}

[[File:Hoagy Carmichael - 1947.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hoagy Carmichael]]—Fleming's view of James Bond]]
Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer [[Hoagy Carmichael]] and himself{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=67}} and in [[Casino Royale (novel)|''Casino Royale'']], [[Vesper Lynd]] remarks, "Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless." Likewise, in [[Moonraker (novel)|''Moonraker'']], [[Special Branch]] Officer [[Gala Brand]] thinks that Bond is "certainly good-looking&amp;nbsp;... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold."{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=67}}

Fleming endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}} Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's own as was his behaviour,&lt;ref name="Cook (2004)"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cook |first=William |title=Novel man |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |date=28 June 2004|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.&lt;ref name=" Macintyre (2008)"/&gt;

It was not until the penultimate novel, ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'', that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']] in cinemas and [[Sean Connery]]'s depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=205}} In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in ''[[The Times]]'', Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of [[Glencoe, Highland|Glencoe]], [[Scotland]], and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of [[Vaud]], Switzerland.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=59}} Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]]'s fictional biography of Bond, ''[[James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007]]'', gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920,{{sfn|Pearson|2008|p=21}} while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=27}}

====Ian Fleming novels====
[[File:GoldeneyeEstate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye]], in Jamaica, where Fleming wrote all the Bond novels{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=208}}]]
Whilst serving in the Naval Intelligence Division, Fleming had planned to become an author&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Lycett |first=Andrew|title=Fleming, Ian Lancaster (1908–1964) (subscription needed)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33168|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=7 September 2011|authorlink=Andrew Lycett|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/33168|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had told a friend, "I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories."&lt;ref name=" Macintyre (2008)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|title= Bond – the real Bond|newspaper=[[The Times]]|page=36|date=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 February 1952, he began writing his first James Bond novel, ''Casino Royale'', at his [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica,{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=4}} where he wrote all his Bond novels during the months of January and February each year.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=5}} He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris, in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials.{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|2003|p=1|loc=ch 1}}

After completing the manuscript for ''Casino Royale'', Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend (and later editor) [[William Plomer]] to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, [[Jonathan Cape]], who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter]], an established travel writer.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=5}} Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books – ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' and ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]'' – published posthumously.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=75}} All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.

Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=149}} In 1996 Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ripley|first=Mike|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/nov/02/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries|title=Obituary: John Gardner: Prolific thriller writer behind the revival of James Bond and Professor Moriarty|accessdate=14 November 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 November 2007|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

===Television===
In 1954 [[CBS]] paid Ian Fleming $1,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1954}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US|df=y}}) to adapt his novel [[Casino Royale (novel)|''Casino Royale'']] into a [[Casino Royale (Climax!)|one-hour television adventure]] as part of its ''[[Climax!]]'' series.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=14}} The episode aired live on 21 October 1954 and starred [[Barry Nelson]] as "Card Sense" James Bond and [[Peter Lorre]] as Le Chiffre.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=11}} The novel was adapted for American audiences to show Bond as an American agent working for "Combined Intelligence", while the character [[Felix Leiter]]—American in the novel—became British onscreen and was renamed "Clarence Leiter".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=101}}

In 1973 a [[BBC]] documentary ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]: The British Hero'' featured [[Christopher Cazenove]] playing a number of such title characters (e.g. [[Richard Hannay]] and [[Bulldog Drummond]]). The documentary included James Bond in dramatised scenes from
[[Goldfinger (novel)|''Goldfinger'']]—notably featuring 007 being threatened with the novel's circular saw, rather than the film's laser beam—and ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Radio Times|date=6–12 October 1973|pages=74–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 a TV cartoon series ''[[James Bond Jr.]]'' was produced with [[Corey Burton]] in the role of Bond's nephew, also called James Bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Svetkey|first=Benjamin|title=Sweet Baby James|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310606,00.html|accessdate=4 November 2011|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=29 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
In 1956 the novel [[Moonraker (novel)|''Moonraker'']] was adapted for broadcast on [[South Africa]]n radio, with [[Bob Holness]] providing the voice of Bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Holness on Game Shows|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Bob_Holness|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Independent]]'', "listeners across the Union thrilled to Bob's cultured tones as he defeated evil master criminals in search of world domination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Andrew|title=The Bond bunch|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=8 November 2006|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] have adapted five of the Fleming novels for broadcast: in 1990 [[You Only Live Twice (novel)|''You Only Live Twice'']] was adapted into a 90-minute radio play for [[BBC Radio 4]] with [[Michael Jayston]] playing James Bond. The production was repeated a number of times between 2008 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Bond&amp;nbsp;— You Only Live Twice|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00fbzkg|work=BBC Radio 4 Extra|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May 2008 BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation of [[Dr. No (novel)|''Dr. No'']]. The actor [[Toby Stephens]], who played Bond villain [[Gustav Graves]] in the Eon Productions version of ''[[Die Another Day]]'', played Bond, while Dr. No was played by [[David Suchet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=007 villain to play Bond on radio|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7380086.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 October 2011|date=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its success, a second story was adapted and on 3 April 2010 [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast [[Goldfinger (novel)|''Goldfinger'']] with Stephens again playing Bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Hemley, Matthew|date= 13 October 2009|url= http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/25870/james-bond-to-return-to-radio-as-goldfinger|title= James Bond to return to radio as Goldfinger is adapted for BBC|publisher= The Stage Online|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]] was Goldfinger and Stephens' ''Die Another Day'' co-star [[Rosamund Pike]] played Pussy Galore.

In 2012 the novel [[From Russia, with Love (novel)|''From Russia, with Love'']] was dramatized for Radio 4; it featured a full cast again starring Stephens as Bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saturday Drama: From Russia With Love|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01kxzr6|work=[[BBC Radio 4]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014 Stephens again played Bond, in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', with [[Alfred Molina]] as Blofeld, and [[Joanna Lumley]] as Irma Bunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saturday Drama: On Her Majesty's Secret Service|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b042cq8f|website=[[BBC]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===
{{Main|James Bond (comic strip)|James Bond comic books}}
[[File:McLusky007.jpg|thumb|upright|right|John McLusky's rendition of James Bond]]
In 1957 the ''[[Daily Express]]'' approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips, offering him £1,500 per novel and a share of takings from syndication.{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=6}} After initial reluctance, Fleming, who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=316}} To aid the ''Daily Express'' in illustrating Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of how he believed James Bond looked. The illustrator, [[John McLusky]], however, felt that Fleming's 007 looked too "outdated" and "pre-war" and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=21}} The first strip, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' was published from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky.{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=7}}

Most of the Bond novels and short stories have since been adapted for illustration, as well as Kingsley Amis's ''Colonel Sun''; the works were written by [[Henry Gammidge]] or Jim Lawrence with [[Yaroslav Horak]] replacing McClusky as artist in 1966.{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} After the Fleming and Amis material had been adapted, original stories were produced, continuing in the ''Daily Express'' and ''[[Sunday Express]]'' until May 1977.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=21}}

Several [[comic book]] adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years: at the time of [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']]'s release in October 1962, a [[comic book]] adaptation of the screenplay, written by Norman J. Nodel, was published in Britain as part of the ''[[Classics Illustrated]]'' anthology series.{{sfn|Conroy|2004|p=293}} It was later reprinted in the United States by [[DC Comics]] as part of its ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html |title=Secrets Behind the Comics |first=Mark |last=Evanier |authorlink=Mark Evanier |publisher=NewsFromme.com |date=3 December 2006 |accessdate=4 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021094626/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html |archivedate=21 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Conroy|2004|p=293}}

With the release of the 1981 film [[For Your Eyes Only (film)|''For Your Eyes Only'']], [[Marvel Comics]] published a two-issue [[comic book]] adaptation of the film.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=131}}{{sfn|Thompson|Frankenhoff|Bickford|2010|p=368}} When ''[[Octopussy]]'' was released in the cinemas in 1983, Marvel published an accompanying comic;{{sfn|Conroy|2004|p=293}} Eclipse also produced a one-off comic for ''Licence to Kill'', although Timothy Dalton refused to allow his likeness to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bond Violence Gets Artistic 'Licence'|newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]]|date=28 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Bond stories were also drawn up and published from 1989 onwards through Marvel, [[Eclipse Comics]] and [[Dark Horse Comics]].{{sfn|Conroy|2004|p=293}}{{sfn|Thompson|Frankenhoff|Bickford|2010|p=368}}

In 1962 Eon Productions, the company of Canadian [[Harry Saltzman]] and American [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R.

In 1973 [[Roger Moore]] was appointed to the role of 007 for [[Live and Let Die (film)|''Live and Let Die'']] and played Bond a further six times over twelve years before being replaced by [[Timothy Dalton]] for two films. After a six-year hiatus, during which a legal wrangle threatened Eon's productions of the Bond films,{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=81}} Irish actor [[Pierce Brosnan]] was cast as Bond in ''[[GoldenEye]]'', released in 1995; he remained in the role for a total of four films, before leaving in 2002.

====Non-Eon films====
In 1967 [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|''Casino Royale'']] was adapted into a [[parody]] Bond film starring [[David Niven]] as Sir James Bond and [[Ursula Andress]] as Vesper Lynd. Niven had been Fleming's preference for the role of Bond.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=202}} The result of a court case in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London in 1963 allowed [[Kevin McClory]] to produce a remake of [[Thunderball (film)|''Thunderball'']] titled ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' in 1983.&lt;ref name="Poliakoff (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poliakoff |first=Keith |title=License to Copyright – The Ongoing Dispute Over the Ownership of James Bond |journal=Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal |publisher=[[Benjamin N.

==Guns, vehicles and gadgets==
{{Main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}

===Guns===
For the first five novels, Fleming armed Bond with a [[Beretta 418]]{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=265}} until he received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, [[Geoffrey Boothroyd]], criticising Fleming's choice of firearm for Bond,{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=160}} calling it "a lady's gun – and not a very nice lady at that!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bond's unsung heroes: Geoffrey Boothroyd, the real Q|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/jamesbond/5320024/Bonds-unsung-heroes-Geoffrey-Boothroyd-the-real-Q.html|accessdate=6 November 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boothroyd suggested that Bond should swap his [[Beretta]] for a [[Walther PP]]K 7.65mm and this exchange of arms made it to ''Dr. No''.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=132}} Boothroyd also gave Fleming advice on the [[Berns-Martin]] triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by SMERSH and other villains.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=15}} In thanks, Fleming gave the MI6 Armourer in his novels the name Major Boothroyd and, in ''Dr. No'', M introduces him to Bond as "the greatest small-arms expert in the world".{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=132}} Bond also used a variety of [[rifle]]s, including the [[Savage Model 99]] in "For Your Eyes Only" and a Winchester .308 target rifle in "The Living Daylights".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=265}} Other handguns used by Bond in the Fleming books included the [[Colt Detective Special]] and a long-barrelled [[Colt Single Action Army|Colt .45 Army Special]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=265}}

The first Bond film, ''Dr. No'', saw M ordering Bond to leave his Beretta behind and take up the Walther PPK,{{sfn|Black|2005|p=94}} which the film Bond used in eighteen films.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=265}} In ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' and the two subsequent films, Bond's main weapon was the [[Walther P99]] [[semi-automatic pistol]].{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=265}}
[[File:Aston.db5.coupe.300pix.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Aston Martin DB5]] as seen in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''.]]

===Vehicles===
In the early Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship-grey [[Bentley 4½ Litre|Bentley {{frac|4|1|2}} Litre]] with an [[Amherst Villiers]] [[supercharger]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=62-63}} After Bond's car was written off by Hugo Drax in ''Moonraker'', Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he used in the remaining books of the series.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=63}} During ''Goldfinger'', Bond was issued with an [[Aston Martin DB Mark III]] with a homing device, which he used to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=63}}

The Bond of the films has driven a number of cars, including the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|Aston Martin V8 Vantage]],{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=183}} during the 1980s, the [[V12 Vanquish]]{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=183}} and [[Aston Martin DBS V12|DBS]]{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=182}} during the 2000s, as well as the [[Lotus Esprit]];{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=202}} the [[BMW Z3]],{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=186}} [[BMW 750iL]]{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=186}} and the [[BMW Z8]].{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=186}} He has, however, also needed to drive a number of other vehicles, ranging from a [[Citroën 2CV]] to a [[AEC Routemaster|Routemaster]] Bus, amongst others.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=175}}

Bond's most famous car is the silver grey [[Aston Martin DB5]], first seen in ''Goldfinger'';{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=180}} it later featured in ''Thunderball'', ''GoldenEye'', ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', ''Casino Royale'', ''[[Skyfall]]'' and ''Spectre''.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=180-181}}&lt;ref name="Obs: french"&gt;{{cite news|last=French|first=Philip|title=Skyfall – review|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/28/skyfall-james-bond-review|date=28 October 2012|authorlink=Philip French|location=London|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films have used a number of different Aston Martins for filming and publicity, one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in the US for $2,1 million to an unnamed European collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James Bond car sold for over £1m|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4633986.stm|accessdate=6 November 2011|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=21 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, another DB5 used in Goldfinger was sold at auction for $4.6m million (£2.6 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/classiccars/8092441/James-Bond-Aston-Martin-DB5-sells-for-2.6m.html|title=James Bond Aston Martin DB5 sells for 拢2.6m|author=Andrew English|date=28 October 2010|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gadgets===

Fleming's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby-trapped [[attaché case]] in ''From Russia with Love'', although this situation changed dramatically with the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=Tricia|title=James Bond's "Pussy" and Anglo-American Cold War Sexuality|journal=The Journal of American Culture|date=September 2005|volume=28|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.2005.00215.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the effects of the two Eon-produced Bond films ''Dr. No'' and ''From Russia with Love'' had an effect on the novel ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=234}}

For the film adaptations of Bond, the pre-mission briefing by Q Branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series.{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=112}} ''Dr. No'' provided no spy-related gadgets, but a [[Geiger counter]] was used; industrial designer Andy Davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy-gadget was the attaché case shown in ''From Russia with Love'', which he described as "a classic 007 product".&lt;ref name="Davey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davey|first=Andy|title=Left to his own devices|format=abridged from print copy|journal=[[Design Week]]|date=3 October 2002|url=http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/left-to-his-own-devices/1103407.article|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film ''Goldfinger''. The film's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to Bond, although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that Bond was over-reliant on equipment, particularly in the later films.{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=169}}

{{Quote box|quote="If it hadn't been for Q Branch, you'd have been dead long ago!"|source=—Q, to Bond, ''Licence to Kill''|width = 20em||align =left}}
Davey noted that "Bond's gizmos follow the [[zeitgeist]] more closely than any other&amp;nbsp;... nuance in the films"&lt;ref name="Davey"/&gt; as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films, through to the brand-name obsessions of the later films.&lt;ref name="Davey"/&gt; It is also noticeable that, although Bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from Q Branch, including the Little Nellie [[autogyro]],{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=200-201}} a [[Jet pack#Bell Textron Rocket Belt|jet pack]]{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=128}} and the exploding attaché case,{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=221}} the villains are also well-equipped with custom-made devices,&lt;ref name="Davey"/&gt; including Scaramanga's golden gun,{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=77}} Rosa Klebb's poison-tipped shoes,{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=41}} Oddjob's steel-rimmed bowler hat{{sfn|Black|2005|p=117}} and Blofeld's communication devices in his agents' vanity case.&lt;ref name="Davey"/&gt;

Cinematically, Bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of ''Dr. No'' in 1962,{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=21}} with 22 secret agent films released in 1966 alone attempting to capitalise on the Bond franchise's popularity and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moniot|first=Drew|title=James Bond and America in the Sixties: An Investigation of the Formula Film in Popular Culture|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|date=Summer 1976|volume=28|issue=3|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|jstor=20687331|pages=25–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first parody was the 1964 film ''[[Carry On Spying]]'', which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind ([[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtry]]) and Daphne Honeybutt ([[Barbara Windsor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Angelini|first=Sergio|title=Carry On Spying (1964)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/466477/|work=BFI Screenonline|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the [[Harry Palmer]] series, whose first film, [[The Ipcress File (film)|''The Ipcress File'']] was released in 1965. The eponymous hero of the series was what academic Jeremy Packer called an "anti-Bond",{{sfn|Packer|2009|p=26}} or what Christoph Lindner calls "the thinking man's Bond".{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=128}} The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer [[Ken Adam]], editor [[Peter R. Hunt]] and composer John Barry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ipcress File, The (1965)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/459866/credits.html|work=Screenonline|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four "[[Matt Helm]]" films starring [[Dean Martin]] (released between 1966 and 1969),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allegretti|first=Joseph|title=James Bond and Matt Helm: The Moral Universe of Literature's Most Famous Spy and His Chief American Rival|journal=The Mid-Atlantic Almanack|url=http://www.mapaca.net/almanack/archive/2008/jamesNmatt.pdf |accessdate=5 November 2011|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Popular/American Culture Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[Our Man Flint|Flint]]" series starring [[James Coburn]] (comprising two films, one each in 1966 and 1969),{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=210}} while ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=97-98}} More recently, the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' series by writer, producer and comedian [[Mike Myers]],{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=76}} and other parodies such as the ''[[Johnny English (film series)|Johnny English]]'' trilogy of films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howell|first=Peter|title=Thunderbollocks|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=21 October 2011|page=E2}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films.

Following the release of the film ''Dr. No'' in 1962, the line "Bond&amp;nbsp;... James Bond", became a [[catch phrase]] that entered the [[lexicon]] of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in ''Dr. No'' that the "signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever".{{sfn|Cork|Scivally|2002|p=6}} In 2001, it was voted as the "best-loved one-liner in cinema" by British cinema goers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James Bond tops motto poll|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1383350.stm|accessdate=4 November 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the [[American Film Institute]] as part of their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|100 Years Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Years Series: "Movie Quotes" |url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/quotes100.pdf?docID=242 |work=AFI 100 Years Series |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=4 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716070844/http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/quotes100.pdf?docID=242 |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 [[American Film Institute]]'s '100 Years' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|third greatest film hero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 years series: 100 heroes and villains |url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |work=AFI 100 Years Series |publisher=American Film Industry |accessdate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67oI7bsRP?url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |archivedate=20 May 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 100 Greatest Movie Characters: 11.

The 23 James Bond films produced by Eon Productions, which have grossed $4,910 million in box office returns alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Box Office History for James Bond Movies|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/JamesBond.php|publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have made the series one of the [[List of highest-grossing film series|highest-grossing ever]]. It is estimated that since ''Dr. No'', a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodds|first=Klaus|title=Screening Geopolitics: James Bond and the Early Cold War films (1962–1967)|journal=Geopolitics|year=2005|volume=10|issue=2|pages=266–289|doi=10.1080/14650040590946584|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they "form the backbone of the industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British film classics: Dr No|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2787017.stm|accessdate=4 November 2011|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=21 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television also saw the effect of Bond films, with the [[NBC]] series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grigg|first=Richard|title=Vanquishing Evil without the Help of God: The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and a World Come of Age|journal=Journal of Communication &amp; Religion|date=November 2007|volume=30|issue=2|pages=308–339|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was described as the "first network television imitation" of Bond,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Worland|first=Rick|title=The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and TV espionage in the 1960s|journal=[[Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television]]|date=Winter 1994|volume=21|issue=4|pages=150–162|doi=10.1080/01956051.1994.9943983|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character the name [[Napoleon Solo]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=209}} Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'',{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=210}} and ''[[Get Smart]]''.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=211}}

A [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural icon]], by 2012, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]] as Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s escort.&lt;ref name="brown20120727"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Nic|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19018666|title=How James Bond whisked the Queen to the Olympics|publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=27 July 2012|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Action &amp; Mystery exhibition inspired by GREAT British icons|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/world-location-news/action-mystery-exhibition-inspired-by-great-british-icons|agency=Gov.uk|date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the life of the film series, a number of [[Merchandising|tie-in products]] have been released.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=273}} In 2018 a James Bond museum opened atop of Austrian Alps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/video/james-bond-museum-opens-atop-the-austrian-alps-1275453507541|title=James Bond museum opens atop the Austrian Alps|work=TODAY.com|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[futuristic]] museum is constructed on the summit of Gaislachkogl Mountain in [[Sölden]] at 3,048 m above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://traveltriangle.com/blog/new-james-bond-museum-007-elements-to-open-in-austrian-alps/|title='Die Another Day', As This New James Bond Museum On The Austrian Alps Is Too Good To Be Missed|last=TravelTriangle|date=2018-06-15|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/james-bond-museum-opens-atop-the-austrian-alps-1275453507541|title=James Bond museum opens atop the Austrian Alps|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''Man vs. Beast''''' is a series of [[sensationalistic]] [[television specials]] aired in the United States by the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[television network]]. The shows were produced by [[Brian Richardson (producer)|Brian Richardson]] and directed by [[Bob Levy (director)|Bob Levy]]. They involve a variety of challenges in which people and animals compete against each other. Although the initial special, ''Man vs. Beast'', was heavily panned by critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Robert Weintraub | date = January 16, 2003 | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2077075/ | title = Aaron Sorkin Mauled by Fox: The disturbing appeal of Man vs. Beast. | publisher = [[Slate.com]] | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[animal rights]] groups,&lt;ref name="born free"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bornfree.org.uk/zoocheck/manvsbeast.shtml | title = Unnatural Animal Acts A Turnoff. | publisher = [[Born Free Foundation]] | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox commissioned a sequel, ''Man vs. Beast 2'', which aired on February 20, 2004.

In 2003, [[ITV Network|ITV]] commissioned [[Granada Productions]] to re-create the American special for British audiences. A six-part series was filmed, hosted by [[John Fashanu]]. However, owing to heavy lobbying by animal rights groups,&lt;ref name="caps"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.captiveanimals.org/news/2003/granada2.htm | title = Man vs Beast – programme may be scrapped | publisher = Captive Animals' Protection Society | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; transmission of the series was postponed indefinitely.

==Competitions==
The competitions included the following matchups:
*Professional eater [[Takeru Kobayashi]] lost a hot dog eating contest against a [[Kodiak bear]] that did not know it was in an eating competition.
*[[Scott Helvenston]], a [[US Navy SEAL]], won a race against a [[chimpanzee]] through an obstacle course.
*A group of 44 [[dwarfism|dwarfs]] lost a race against an [[Asian elephant]] to see which could pull a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] jet a certain distance first.
*[[Shawn Crawford]], a world-class sprinter, won a [[100 meters|100-metre race]] against a [[giraffe]] but lost against a [[zebra]].
*A [[Sumo]] wrestler lost a [[tug-of-war]] against a large, female [[orangutan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10304">A '''media franchise''', also known as '''multimedia franchise''', is a collection of related [[Media (communication)|media]] in which several derivative works have been produced from an original creative work, such as a [[film]], a work of [[literature]], a [[television program]] or a [[video game]]. The intellectual property from the work can be licensed to other parties or partners for further derivative works and commercial exploitation across a range of media and by a variety of industries for [[merchandising]] purposes.

A media franchise often consists of [[marketing co-operation|cross-marketing]] across more than one medium. For the owners, the goal of increasing profit through diversity can extend the commercial profitability of the franchise and can create strong feelings of identity and ownership in its consumers ([[fandom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jaylemke.squarespace.com/storage/Games-Franchises-CulturalOrder-2005.pdf | title=Critical Analysis across Media: Games, Franchises, and the New Cultural Order | publisher=First International Conference on CDA | date=2004 | accessdate=16 September 2013 | author=Lemke, Jay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarseth describes the financial logic of cost-recovery for expensive productions by identifying that a single medium launch is a lost opportunity, the timeliness of the production and release is more important than its integrity, the releases should raise brand awareness and the cross-ability of the work is critical for its success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15405710pc0403_4#.UjcTWD-9H-s | title=The Culture and Business of Cross-Media Productions | author=Aarseth, Espen | journal=Popular Communication: the International Journal of Media and Culture | year=2006 | volume=4 | issue=3 | pages=203 | doi=10.1207/s15405710pc0403_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Idol]] was a transmedia franchise from its beginnings, with the first season winner [[Kelly Clarkson]] signing with [[RCA Records]] and having the release of ''[[A Moment Like This]]'' becoming a #1 hit on Billboard Hot 100.&lt;ref name=ai&gt;{{cite book | title=Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide | publisher=NYU Press | author=Jenkins, Henry | year=2006 | page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success resulted in a nationwide concert tour, an ''American Idol'' book that made the bestseller list and the film ''[[From Justin to Kelly]]''.&lt;ref name=ai /&gt; A transmedia franchise however is often referred to by the simpler term "media franchise." The term media franchise is often used to describe the popular adaptation of a work into films, like the popular [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' book series]] that was adapted into the five films of ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Bitten by Twilight: Youth Culture, Media, and the Vampire Franchise | publisher=Peter Lang Publishing | author=Click, Melissa | year=2010 | page=12 | isbn=978-1433108945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other neologisms exist to describe various franchise types including '''metaseries'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which can be used to describe works such as [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]].&lt;ref&gt;Palumbo, Donald. "Asimov's Crusade Against Bigotry: The Persistence Of Prejudice as a Fractal Motif in the Robot/Empire Foundation Metaseries." JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS 10 (1998): 43-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multimedia franchises usually develop through a character or fictional world becoming popular in one medium, and then expanding to others through [[licensing agreement]]s, with respect to [[intellectual property]] in the franchise's characters and settings. As one author explains, "[f]or the studios, a home-run is a film from which a multimedia 'franchise' can be generated; the colossally expensive creation of cross-media conglomerates predicated on synergistic rewards provides an obvious imperative to develop such products."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Langford, ''Post-classical Hollywood: Film Industry, Style and Ideology Since 1945'', p. 207, {{ISBN|074863858X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The trend later developed wherein franchises would be launched in multiple forms of media simultaneously:

{{quote|"In one of the most celebrated ventures in media convergence, [[The Wachowskis|Larry and Andy Wachowski]], creators of ''[[The Matrix trilogy]]'', produced the game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' (2003) simultaneously with the last two films of the trilogy, shooting scenes for the game on the movie's sets with the movie's actors, and releasing the game on the same day as ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. Likewise, on September 21, 2004, [[Lucasfilm]] jointly released a new DVD box set of the original ''[[Star Wars trilogy]]'' with ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'', a [[combat game]] in which players can reenact battles from all six ''Star Wars'' films. In 2005, Peter Jackson likewise produced his blockbuster film ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' (2005) in tandem with a successful ''King Kong'' game designed by [[Michel Ancel]] and published by Ubisoft. In the last several years, numerous licensed videogame adaptations of major summer and holiday blockbusters were released a few days before or a few days after their respective films, including: all three ''Star Wars films'' (1999–2005); all five ''[[Harry Potter films]]'' (2001–2008); all three ''[[Spider-Man films]]'' (2002–2007); ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003); ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' (2002); ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003); ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'' (2005); ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' (2006); ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' (2007); and ''[[Transformers]]'' (2007). These multimedia franchises have made it more difficult to distinguish the production of films and videogames as separate enterprises"|source=Harry Brown, ''Videogames and Education''.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Harry J. Brown, ''Videogames and Education'' (2008), p. 41, {{ISBN|0765629496}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Development to other forms==
===Fiction===
Long-running film franchises were common in the early studio era, when Hollywood studios had actors and directors under long-term contract. Examples include [[Andy Hardy]], [[Ma and Pa Kettle]], [[Bulldog Drummond]], [[Superman]], [[Tarzan]], and [[Batman]]. The longest-running modern film franchises include [[James Bond]], [[Godzilla]], ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', and ''[[Star Trek]]''. In such cases, even lead actors are often replaced as they age, lose interest, or their characters are killed.

Media franchises tend to cross over from their original media to other forms. Literary franchises are often transported to film, such as [[Nancy Drew]], [[Miss Marple]], and other popular [[detective]]s, as well as popular [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es. Television and film franchises are often expanded upon in [[novel]]s, particularly those in the [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] genres, such as ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. Similarly, fantasy, science fiction films and television shows are frequently adapted into [[animated television series]], video games, or both.

A media franchise does not have to include the same characters or theme, as the brand identity can be the franchise, like [[Square Enix]]'s ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' or the [[National Lampoon, Incorporated|''National Lampoon'' series]], and can suffer from critical failures even if the media fictional material is unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/how-to-kill-a-major-media-franchise-in-a-decade | title=How To Kill A Major Media Franchise In A Decade | publisher=Buzzfeed | date=12 August 2013 | accessdate=16 September 2013 | author=Bernstein, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-fiction===
[[Non-fiction]] literary franchises include the ''[[...For Dummies]]'' and ''[[The Complete Idiot's Guide to...]]'' [[reference book]]s. An enduring and extensive example of a media franchise is [[Playboy Enterprises]], which began expanding well beyond its successful magazine, ''[[Playboy]]'', within a few years after its first publication, into such enterprises as a modeling agency, several television shows (''Playboy's Penthouse'', in 1959), and even its own [[Playboy TV|television channel]]. Twenty-five years later, Playboy released private clubs and restaurants, movie theaters, [[Playboy Radio|a radio show]], [[direct to video]] films, music and book publishing (including original works in addition to its anthologies of cartoons, photographs, recipes, advice, articles or fiction that had originally appeared in the magazine), footwear, clothing of every kind, jewelry, housewares (lamps, clocks, bedding, glassware), guitars and gambling, playing cards, pinball machines and pet accessories, billiard balls, bedroom appurtenances, enhancements, plus countless other items of merchandise.

'''Narrative poetry''' is a form of [[poetry]] that tells a story, often making the voices of a narrator and characters as well; the entire story is usually written in metered verse. Narrative poems do not need rhyme. The poems that make up this genre may be short or long, and the story it relates to may be complex. It is normally dramatic, with objectives, diverse and meter.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyer, ''The Bedford Introduction to Literature'', Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005, p2134.&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative poems include [[epic poetry|epic]]s, [[ballad]]s, [[idyll]]s, and [[Lyric poetry|lays]].

Some narrative poetry takes the form of a [[verse novel|novel in verse]]. An example of this is ''[[The Ring and the Book]]'' by [[Robert Browning]]. In the terms of narrative poetry, a [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] is a narrative poem that tells a story of [[chivalry]]. Examples include the ''[[Romance of the Rose]]'' or [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s  ''[[Idylls of the King]]''. Although those examples use [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Arthurian]] materials, romances may also tell stories from [[Mythology|classical mythology]]. 

Shorter narrative poems often similar in style to the [[short story]]. Sometimes, these short narratives are collected into interrelated groups, as with [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''. So [[saga]]s include both incidental poetry and the biographies of poets. An example is "[[The Cremation of Sam McGee]]" by [[Robert W. Service|Robert Service]].

==Oral tradition==
{{Literature}}
The [[oral tradition]]  essentially all other modern forms of communication. For thousands of years, people groups accurately passed on their history through the Oral Tradition from generation to generation. As a clear example and the oldest one comes from Ancient India, the [[Vedic Chant]], which is often considered the oldest unbroken oral tradition in existence today. In addition, one of the most notable was the ancient Hebrews, people of the Middle East; they were taught and passed on the stories of God in over 115 countries worldwide. The poetry in the [[Bible]] is called the [[Psalms]], that capture stories of conquest, failure, confession and more. Some of it is narrative in nature.

Historically, much of poetry has its source in an [[oral tradition]]: in more recent times the [[Scotland|Scots]] and [[England|English]] [[ballad]]s, the tales of [[Robin Hood]], of [[Alexander the Great|Iskandar]], and various [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] [[hero]]ic poems all were originally intended for [[recitation]], rather than reading. In many cultures, there remains a lively tradition of the recitation of traditional tales in verse formativeness. It has been suggested that some of the distinctive features that distinguish poetry from [[prose]], such as [[metre (poetry)|metre]], [[alliteration]] and [[kenning]]s, at one time served as [[memory aid]]s that allowed the [[bard]]s who recited traditional tales to reconstruct them from [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Rubin (psychologist)|David C. Rubin]], ''Memory in Oral Traditions. The Cognitive Psychology of Epic, Ballads, and Counting-out Rhymes'' (Taco University Press, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative poem usually tells a story using a poetic theme. Epics are very vital to narrative poems, although it is thought those narrative poems were created to explain oral traditions. The focus of narrative poetry is often the pros and cons of life.

'''Narrative structure''', a [[literary element]], is generally described as the structural framework that underlies the order and manner in which a [[narrative]] is presented to a reader, listener, or viewer. The narrative text structures are the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] and the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]].

== Definition ==
Narrative structure is about story and plot: the content of a story and the form used to tell the story. Story refers to the dramatic action as it might be described in chronological order. Plot refers to how the story is told. Story is about trying to determine the key conflicts, main characters, setting and events. Plot is about how, and at what stages, the key conflicts are set up and resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecinematheque.ca/education/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LanguageofFilm01.pdf ''Visual Storytelling and Narrative Structure'', In Point]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description == 
The setup (act one) is where all of the main characters and their basic situations are introduced, and contains the primary level of characterization (exploring the character's backgrounds and personalities). A [[problem]] is also introduced, which is what drives the story forward.

The second act, the conflict, is the bulk of the story, and begins when the inciting incident (or [[catalyst]]) sets things into motion. This is the part of the story where the characters go through major changes in their lives as a result of what is happening; this can be referred to as the [[character arc]], or character development.

The third act, or [[plot (narrative)#Resolution|resolution]], is when the problem in the story boils over, forcing the characters to confront it, allowing all the elements of the story to come together and inevitably leading to the ending.

== History ==
First described in ancient times by [[Greek philosophers]] (such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]), the notion of narrative structure saw renewed popularity as a critical concept in the mid-to-late-20th century, when structuralist literary theorists including [[Roland Barthes]], [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Joseph Campbell]], and [[Northrop Frye]] attempted to argue that all human narratives have certain universal, deep structural elements in common. This argument fell out of fashion when advocates of [[poststructuralism]] such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] asserted that such universally shared, deep structures were logically impossible.

In Frye's ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', he deals extensively with what he calls myths of [[Spring (season)|Spring]], [[Summer]], [[Fall]], and [[Winter]]:

* Spring myths are [[comedy|comedies]], that is, stories that lead from bad situations to happy endings.  [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' is such a story.
* Summer myths are similarly [[utopia]]n [[fantasy|fantasies]] such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]''.
* Fall myths are [[tragedies]] that lead from ideal situations to disaster. Compare ''[[Hamlet]], [[Othello]]'', and ''[[King Lear]]'' and the movie ''[[Legends of the Fall]]''.
* Winter myths are [[dystopia]]s; for example, [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'', [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', and [[Ayn Rand]]'s novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]''.

== Categories ==
Most forms of narrative fall under four main categories: linear narratives, nonlinear narrative, interactive narration, and interactive narrative. 
*[[Linear narrative]] is the most common form of narration, where events are largely portrayed in a chronological order, that is, telling the events in the order in which they occurred.
*[[Nonlinear narrative]]s, disjointed narrative or disrupted narrative is a narrative technique, where events are portrayed, out of chronological order or in other ways where the narrative does not follow the direct causality pattern.
*[[Interactive narration]] refers to works where the linear narrative is driven by, rather than influenced by, the users interaction.
*[[Interactive narrative]] is a form of fiction in which users are able to make ''choices'' that influence the narrative (for example, through alternative plots or resulting in alternative endings) through their actions.

=== Linear narrative ===
[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] are often confused with true narratives which are not linear, but the concept is fundamentally linear. An example would be ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' by [[Orson Welles]]. Although some films appear to open (very briefly) with the ending, flashback movies almost immediately jump back to the very beginning of the story to proceed linearly from there, and usually proceed past the supposed "ending" shown at the beginning of the movie.

=== Nonlinear narrative ===
Cinema can only provide the illusion through broken narrative, a famous example of this being the 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''. The film is ostensibly three short stories, which, upon closer inspection, are actually three sections of one story with the [[chronology]] broken up; [[Quentin Tarantino]] constructs the narrative without resorting to classic "flashback" techniques.

An even more ambitious attempt at constructing a film based on non-linear narrative is [[Alain Resnais]]'s 1993 French film ''[[Smoking/No Smoking]]''. The plot contains parallel developments, playing on the idea of what might have happened had the characters made different choices.

=== Interactive narration ===
In works of interactive narration there is only one narrative but the method of delivery requires the user to actively work to gain the next piece of the narrative, or have to piece the parts of narrative that they have together in order to form a coherent narrative.

This is the narrative approach of some modern video games. A player will be required to reach an objective, complete a task, solve a puzzle, or finish a level before the narrative continues.

=== Interactive narrative ===
An [[interactive narrative]] is one which is composed with a branching structure where a single starting point may lead to multiple developments and outcomes. The principle of all such games is that, at each step of the narrative, the user makes choices that advance the story, leading to new series of choices. Authoring non-linear narrative or dialogue thus implies imagining an indefinite number of parallel stories.

In a [[gamebook]], readers are told to turn to a certain page according to the choice they wish to make to continue the story. Typically, the choice will be an action rather than dialogue. For example, the hero hears a noise in another room and must decide to open the door and investigate, run away, or call for help. This kind of interactive experience of a story is possible with video games and books (where the reader is free to turn the pages) but less adapted to other forms of entertainment. Improvisational theatre is similarly open-ended, but of course cannot be said to be authored.

== Graphic narrative ==
A simple Graphic Narrative has four stages: an introduction of the characters and a description of a situation, the introduction of a problem, unexpected opportunity, or other complication into the situation, a resolution in the form of a partial or complete response to the problem by one or more of the characters, and the denouement, the aftermath of the response that makes clear the success, partial success, non-success, or uncertain success of the response. This fourth stage may also show how the original situation has changed due to what has taken place in the Complication and Resolution stages of the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Baraou, Anne. "Facing Faces", ''Drawn and Quarterly'' 10 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a simple narrative, the four stages appear in order. That is, the sequence of the telling or presentation follows the chronology of the told. In a more complex story, the order of the telling may vary. For instance, such a story may begin with the Denouement and then present the Situation, Complication, and Resolution in a flashback. But this is not the case with a simple narrative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jbass/courses/402/402_spr10_sns.htm "Composing Graphic Narratives", Rutgers University]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Panayiotou and others v Sony Music Entertainment (UK) Ltd.''''' ([1994] ChD 142) was a contract and entertainment law case before the [[High Court of Justice]]'s [[High Court of Justice#Chancery Division|Chancery Division]]. The plaintiff, entertainer [[George Michael]], argued that his recording contract constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade. Michael alleged that the defendant had failed to promote his album ''[[Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1]]'' with due vigour as punishment when the artist decided to downplay his status as a sex symbol. Michael described his situation as "professional slavery" because his contract required that he produce music and cede the copyright to Sony for many years, leaving him no control over how the music would be marketed nor placing a reciprocal requirement that the label invest in promotion. Had the case succeeded, it might have curtailed the practice of signing artists to multi-album contracts. The court wholly rejected the claims.

==Background==
Georgios Panayiotou, known professionally as George Michael, signed with [[Innervision Records]] in 1982 at the age of eighteen as part of the then relatively unknown pop duo [[Wham!]].&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1993 /&gt; Innervision were distributed by [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]]. In 1984 this contract was nullified as part of a legal compromise wherein Wham! were obligated to produce up to eight new albums for CBS Records; the label and the contract were acquired by [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt; Following Wham!'s success and subsequent break up, Michael renegotiated a new eight-album deal with Sony as a solo artist in 1988.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt; This deal was further renegotiated in 1990 to reflect Michael's superstar status, achieving terms comparable to similarly high-grossing artists.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep-appeal /&gt; Michael's first solo album, [[Faith (George Michael album)|''Faith'']], was released in 1987 and had sold 14 million copies by the time suit was filed; his second solo album, ''[[Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1]]'' was released in 1990 and had sold 5 million copies.&lt;ref name=NYT1994 /&gt; ''Listen Without Prejudice'' represented a new direction for Michael, downplaying the sex symbol status he had cultivated with Wham! in favour of a more reserved identity purely as a serious musician; he decided not to place his highly recognisable image on the album cover and declined to appear in promotional videos. Michael alleged that Sony under-promoted his new album in response to these decisions. He further charged that the contract restricting him from seeking a new label and prevented him from managing his professional image as he saw fit.&lt;ref name=indep-appeal /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep1993 /&gt; Michael described this imbalance of power and his long-term lack of control over his career as "professional slavery".&lt;ref name=NYT1994 /&gt;

It was common practice in the recording industry to sign many emerging artists like Wham!, banking that long-term profits from the few commercial successes would cover the losses from promoting the remainder. A decision holding Michael's contract unenforceable could have dramatically reduced the expected return on investment for signing and promoting an emerging artist, leading to fears that the practice would end. Michael argued that the structure of the industry concentrated power in too few hands, and that these companies competed by selling music, but not in the terms offered to new artists. This led to an imbalance of power, where the artist was contractually obligated to produce a set number of albums of acceptable quality and cede copyright to the label, but the label did not bear a reciprocal obligation to market and promote the product, in accordance with the artist's wishes or otherwise.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep1993 /&gt;

Michael was advanced a sum of £1 million in February 1992 under the terms of the 1990 contract. This amount was returned to Sony in August of the same year in preparation for filing suit in October.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep-report /&gt;

==Decision==
Michael filed suit before the [[Chancery Division]] on 30 October 1992, and Justice Jonathan Parker issued a ruling on 1 June 1994. The plaintiff's claims were wholly rejected. Parker held that Michael's contracts were reasonable and fair,&lt;ref name=Nordenfelt /&gt; especially in consideration of his access to expert legal advice, several renegotiations, and terms comparable to the industry standard for an artist of his commercial success.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep-appeal /&gt; There were five prongs to the justice's dismissal:
*the case was indeed such that the doctrine of restraint of trade would be applicable;
*the 1984 agreement was a compromise in good faith and the conditions obtaining there would pertain to all subsequent renegotiations: there is a legitimate public interest in upholding such a compromise, and the suit fails at the initial hurdle;
*leaving aside the origin of the 1988 agreement, its provisions were justifiable: the label has a legitimate and enforceable ''recoupment interest'' in an exclusive contract of some duration;
*restraint of trade under Article 85 of the [[Treaty of Rome]] establishing the European Community concerns trade between member states, and was held not to apply; Article 222 governing property ownership, including intellectual property, would have superseded in any case;
*by activating its terms in requesting an advance in 1992, Michael affirmed the 1988 agreement.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep-report /&gt;

In July 1995, Sony sold the contract to rival record companies Virgin Records and DreamWorks Records.

'''Patter''' is a prepared and practiced [[Speech communication|speech]] that is designed to produce a desired response from its audience. Examples of occupations with a patter might include the [[auctioneer]], [[salesperson]], [[dance caller]], [[magician (illusionist)|magician]], or [[comedian]].

The term may have been a colloquial shortening of "[[Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]]", and may have referred to the practice of mouthing or mumbling [[prayers]] quickly and mechanically.

From this, it became a slang word for the secret and equally incomprehensible mutterings of a [[cant language]] used by beggars, thieves, gypsies, etc., and then the fluent plausible talk that a [[cheap-jack]] employs to pass off his goods. Many [[illusionist]]s, e.g., [[card magic]]ians, use patter both to enhance the show and to distract the attention of the spectators.

It is thus also used of any rapid manner of talking, and of a [[patter-song]], in which a very large number of words have to be sung at high speed to fit the music. A western square dance [[Caller (dancing)#The modern Western square dance caller|caller]] may interpolate patter—in the form of metrical lines, often of nonsense—to fill in between commands to the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceder.net/choreo/patter_sayings.php4 Square Dance Patter Sayings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102112218/http://www.ceder.net/choreo/patter_sayings.php4 |date=2013-01-02 }} Vic &amp; Debbie Ceder's Square Dance Resource Net.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some circumstances, the talk becomes a different sense of "patter": to make a series of rapid strokes or pats, as of raindrops. Here it a form of [[onomatopoeia]].

In certain forms of entertainment, [[peep show]]s (in the historical meaning) and Russian ''[[rayok]]'', patter is an important component of a show.  The [[radio DJ]] patter is among the roots of [[rapping]].

In [[hypnotherapy]], the hypnotist uses a 'patter' or script to deliver positive suggestions for change to the client.

In ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'', [[Henry Mayhew]] divides the street-sellers of his time into two groups: the ''patterers'', and everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/05/grafter200605?currentPage=all "The Gentleman Grafter"] by Howard Kaplan, May 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8012">A '''procedural drama''' is a [[genre]] of [[television program]]ming which focuses on how crimes are solved or some other aspect of a law enforcement agency, legislative body, or court of law.  Some dramas include a lab or conference room with high-tech or state-of-the-art equipment where the main characters meet to work out the problem. Shows usually have an episodic format that does not require the viewer to have seen previous [[episode]]s. Episodes typically have a self-contained, also referred to as stand-alone, plot that is introduced and resolved within the same episode.
 
The procedural format is popular around the world.&lt;ref name="dl062711"&gt;{{cite news | first = Tim | last = Adler | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/why-tv-procedurals-also-rule-the-world/ | title = Why TV Procedurals Also Rule The World | date = June 27, 2011 | accessdate = June 27, 2011 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the director of a TV consultancy said, "The continuing trend is for procedurals because they use a predictable structure."&lt;ref name="dl062711"/&gt; Due to their stand-alone episodic nature, they are more accessible to new viewers than serials. Self-contained episodes also make it easier for viewers to return to a show if they have missed some episodes.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | author = Gerard Gilbert | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/american-law--british-order-1626849.html | title = American law... British order | date = 2009-02-20 | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, procedural dramas can usually be re-run with little concern for episode order.&lt;ref name="dl062711"/&gt;

Procedurals are often criticized for being [[Wiktionary:formulaic|formulaic]].&lt;ref name="formulaic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="formulaover"&gt;{{cite news | author = James Hibberd | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5160IN20090207 | title = Networks' new pilots favor formula over experiment | date = 2009-02-06 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedurals are also generally less character-driven than serialized shows. However, some procedurals have more character emphasis than is typical of the format.&lt;ref name="duelling"&gt;{{cite news | author = | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/duelling-sleuths/2006/08/08/1154802894078.html | title = Duelling sleuths | date = 2006-08-10 | work = [[The Age]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nomystery"&gt;{{cite news | author = Bill Carter | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/17/arts/television/17ncis.html?_r=1 | title = No Mystery: Ratings Heat Up for ‘NCIS’ | date = 2008-11-16 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some may occasionally feature a storyline stretching over several episodes (often called a [[story arc]]).&lt;ref name="changes"&gt;{{cite news | author = Jason Hughes | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/09/23/what-if-house-stopped-being-a-procedural/ | title = What if House stopped being a procedural? | date = 2009-09-23 | work = [[TVSquad]] | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular variant is the [[police procedural]].

A '''rave''' (from the [[verb]]: ''[[wikt:rave#English|to rave]]'') is an organised dance party at a [[nightclub]], outdoor festival, warehouse, or other private property typically featuring performances by [[Disc jockeys|DJ]]s, playing a seamless flow of [[electronic dance music]]. DJs at rave events play electronic dance music on vinyl, CDs and digital audio from a wide range of genres, including [[techno]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/02/how-rave-music-conquered-america&lt;/ref&gt; [[hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]], [[house music|house]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; [[drum &amp; bass]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2273707/Mother-41-takes-month-old-baby-drum-bass-rave-Wales.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dummymag.com/lists/the-10-best-drum-and-bass-tracks-according-to-goldie&lt;/ref&gt; [[dubstep]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and [[post-industrial music|post-industrial]]. Occasionally [[Live music|live]] performers have been known to perform, in addition to other types of performance artists such as [[go-go dancers]] and [[Fire performance|fire dancers]]. The music is amplified with a large, powerful [[sound reinforcement system]], typically with large [[subwoofer]]s to produce a deep bass sound. The music is often accompanied by [[Laser lighting display|laser light shows]], [[Image projector|projected coloured images]], [[visual effects]] and [[fog machines]].

While some raves may be small parties held at nightclubs or private homes, some raves have grown to immense size, such as the large festivals and events featuring multiple DJs and dance areas (e.g., the [[Castlemorton Common Festival]] in 1992). Some [[list of electronic music festivals|electronic dance music festivals]] have features of raves, but on a larger, often commercial scale. Raves may last for a long time, with some events continuing for twenty-four hours, and lasting all through the night. [[Law enforcement]] raids and anti-rave laws have presented a challenge to the rave scene in many countries.  This is due to the association of illegal drugs such as [[MDMA]]&lt;ref name="drugabuse"&gt;https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/club-drugs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458153/&lt;/ref&gt; (often referred to as a "[[club drug]]" or "party drug" along with [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejournal.ie/scott-weiland-drugs-death-2511702-Dec2015/&lt;/ref&gt;), [[LSD]],&lt;ref name="drugabuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]],&lt;ref name="drugabuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; [[ketamine]],&lt;ref name="drugabuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://qz.com/681175/ketamine-better-known-as-the-rave-drug-special-k-could-be-our-next-anti-depressant/&lt;/ref&gt; [[methamphetamine]],&lt;ref name="drugabuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; [[cocaine]],&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; and [[cannabis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ministryofcannabisblog.com/2018/02/06/marijuana-in-the-rave-culture-of-the-90s/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to drugs, raves often make use of non-authorized, secret venues, such as [[squat parties]] at unoccupied homes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.propertyguardianprotection.com/blog/rave-squat-party-revival&lt;/ref&gt; unused warehouses,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/16/illegal-raves-return-with-social-media-messages&lt;/ref&gt; or aircraft hangars.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/66df895b-af1c-416f-b32a-bb3576dbcb82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-ravers-return-how-underground-parties-are-making-a-comeback-a7036131.html&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are often attributed to a type of [[moral panic]] surrounding rave culture.

==History==

===Origin of 'rave' (1950s–1970s)===
In the late 1950s in [[London]], England the term "rave" was used to describe the "wild [[bohemian]] parties" of the [[Soho]] [[beatnik]] set.&lt;ref name="outofsight"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://hehe.org.free.fr/hehe/texte/rave/#hist

| accessdate =25 October 2007 | author=Helen Evans
| quote = The term rave first came into use in late 50s Britain as a name for the wild bohemian parties of the time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz musician [[Mick Mulligan]], known for indulging in such excesses, had the nickname "king of the ravers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jan/04/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1|title=Obituary: Mick Mulligan|last=Fordham|first=John|date=2007-01-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, [[Buddy Holly]] recorded the hit "Rave On," citing the madness and frenzy of a feeling and the desire for it never to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/1687/|title=Buddy Holly, Wordsmith|author=Thinkmap, Inc.|work=visualthesaurus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "rave" was later used in the burgeoning [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] youth culture of the early 1960s as the way to describe any wild party in general.  People who were gregarious party animals were described as "ravers". Pop musicians such as [[Steve Marriott]] of [[The Small Faces]] and [[Keith Moon]] of [[The Who]] were self-described "ravers".{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
[[File:Mur Ultim Atom&amp;Biobanas.jpg|thumb|240px|A huge bank of speakers and [[subwoofer]]s from a rave [[sound reinforcement system]].]]

Presaging the word's subsequent 1980s association with [[electronic music]], the word "rave" was a common term used regarding the music of mid-1960s [[garage rock]] and [[psychedelia]] bands (most notably [[The Yardbirds]], who released an album in the US called ''[[Having a Rave Up]]''). Along with being an alternative term for partying at such garage events in general, the "rave-up" referred to a specific crescendo moment near the end of a song where the music was played faster, more heavily and with intense soloing or elements of controlled feedback. It was later part of the title of an [[electronic music]] performance event held on 28 January 1967 at London's [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] titled the "Million Volt Light and Sound Rave". The event featured the only known public airing of an experimental sound collage created for the occasion by [[Paul McCartney]] of [[The Beatles]] – the legendary ''[[Carnival of Light]]'' recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote = Perhaps the most famous event that Unit Delta Plus participated in was the 1967 ''Million Volt Light and Sound Rave'' at London's Roundhouse, organised by designers Binder, Edwards and Vaughan (who had previously been hired by Paul McCartney to decorate a piano). The event took place over two nights (28 January and 4 February 1967) and included a performance of tape music by Unit Delta Plus, as well as a playback of the legendary ''Carnival of Light'', a fourteen-minute sound collage assembled by McCartney around the time of the Beatles' ''Penny Lane'' sessions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rapid change of British pop culture from the mod era of 1963–1966 to the [[hippie]] era of 1967 and beyond, the term fell out of popular usage. During the 1970s and early 1980s until its resurrection, the term was not in vogue, one notable exception being in the lyrics of the song "[[Drive-In Saturday]]" by [[David Bowie]] (from his 1973 album ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'') which includes the line, "It's a crash course for the ravers." Its use during that era would have been perceived as a quaint or ironic use of bygone slang: part of the dated 1960s lexicon along with words such as "groovy".

The perception of the word "rave" changed again in the late 1980s when the term was revived and adopted by a new youth culture, possibly inspired by the use of the term in Jamaica.&lt;ref name="outofsight"/&gt;

===Birth of acid house (1980s)===

In the mid to late 1980s, a wave of psychedelic and other [[electronic dance music]], most notably [[acid house]] music, emerged from [[acid house music party|acid house music parties]] in the mid-to-late 1980s in the [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] area in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://music.hyperreal.org/library/history_of_house.html |title = The History Of House |accessdate = August 13, 2013 | author = Phil Cheeseman-fu |publisher = ''[[DJ Magazine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Chicago acid house artists began experiencing overseas success, acid house quickly spread and caught on in the [[United Kingdom]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantazia.org.uk/Scene/themusic.htm|title=Acid House Music – The Timeline (The History of House – "Garage, Techno, Jungle.

In the late 1980s, the word "rave" was adopted to describe the [[subculture]] that grew out of the acid house movement.&lt;ref name="Simon Parkin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperreal.org/raves/database/visuale/ve1.htm|title=Visual Energy|author=Simon Parkin|date=May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities were related to the party atmosphere of [[Ibiza]], a Mediterranean island in Spain, frequented by British, Italian, Greek, Irish and German youth on vacation, who would hold raves and dance parties.&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;"The Problem of Rave Parties", Michael S. Scott, Center for Problem Oriented Policing, 2009, webpage: [http://www.popcenter.org/problems/rave_parties/ popc-rave].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth of the scene (1990s–present)===
[[File:MTAC Prime Rave dance.ogv|thumb|right|200px|dancing at a rave in 2007]]
{{see also|List of electronic dance music festivals|Doof}}
By the 1990s, genres such as [[Acid house|acid]], [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[hardcore (electronic dance music)|hardcore]], [[happy hardcore]], [[gabber]], [[post-industrial music|post-industrial]] and [[electronica]] were all being featured at raves, both large and small. There were mainstream events which attracted thousands of people (up to 25,000{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}&lt;!-- Previously cited with a ref named "Energy Flash" if anyone knows what happened to that. --&gt; instead of the 4,000 that came to earlier warehouse parties). Acid house music parties were first re-branded "rave parties" in the media, during the summer of 1989 by [[Genesis P-Orridge]] (Neil Andrew Megson) during a television interview; however, the ambience of the rave was not fully formed until the early 1990s. In 1990, raves were held "underground" in several cities, such as [[Berlin]], [[Milan]] and [[Patras]], in basements, warehouses and forests.&lt;ref name="Generation Ecstasy"&gt;Timeline and numbers {{cite book

British politicians responded with hostility to the emerging rave party trend. Politicians spoke out against raves and began to [[fine (penalty)|fine]] promoters who held unauthorized parties. Police crackdowns on these often unauthorized parties drove the rave scene into the countryside. The word "rave" somehow caught on in the UK to describe common semi-spontaneous weekend parties occurring at various locations linked by the brand new [[M25 motorway|M25 London orbital]] motorway that ringed London and the [[Home Counties]]. (It was this that gave the band [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] their name.) These ranged from former warehouses and industrial sites in London, to fields and country clubs in the countryside.

Prior to the commercialization of the rave scene, when large legal venues became the norm for these events, the location of the rave was kept secret until the night of the event, usually being communicated through [[answering machine]] messages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-39960232|title=The rave that changed the law|last=Chester|first=Jerry|date=2017-05-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; mobile messaging, secret flyers, and websites. This level of secrecy, necessary for avoiding any interference by the police, on account of the illicit drug use, enabled the ravers to use locations they could stay in for ten hours at a time.  It promoted the sense of deviance and removal from social control.&lt;ref&gt;Tammy L. Anderson, "Understanding the Alteration and Decline of a Music Scene: Observations from Rave Culture". ''Sociological Forum'', vol.24 no.2 (2009) 309–311. Accessed 10/02/2013 16:19, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40210403 .&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2000s, this level of secrecy still exists in the underground rave scene.  However "after-hours" clubs, as well as large outdoor events, create a similar type of alternate atmosphere, but focus much more on vibrant visual effects, such as props and décor. In more recent years,{{When|date=November 2017}} large commercial events are held at the same locations year after year with similar reoccurring themes every year. Events like [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] and [[Tomorrowland (festival)|Tomorrowland]] are typically held at the same venue that holds mass numbers of people.

Some raves make use of [[paganism|pagan]] symbolism.  Modern raving venues attempt to immerse the raver in a fantasy-like world.  Indigenous imagery and spirituality can be characteristic in the Raving ethos.  In both the New Moon and Gateway collectives, "pagan altars are set up, sacred images from primitive cultures decorate the walls, and rituals of cleansing are performed over the turntables and the dance floor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hutson | first1 = Scott R. | year = 2000 | title = The Rave: Spiritual Healing in Modern Western Subcultures | journal = Anthropological Quarterly | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 40–41 | jstor=3317473}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of spatial strategy is an integral part of the raving experience because it sets the initial "vibe" in which the ravers will immerse themselves.  This said "vibe" is a concept in the raver ethos that represents the allure and receptiveness of an environment's portrayed and or innate energy.  The landscape is an integral feature in the composition of rave, much like it is in pagan rituals.  For example, The Numic Ghost Dancers rituals were held on specific geographical sites, considered to hold powerful natural flows of energy.  These sites were later represented in the rhythmic dances, in order to achieve a greater level of connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = Alex K. | last2 = Zedeno | first2 = M.

===Dancing===

[[File:T-Step.gif|thumb|right|T-step of the [[Melbourne Shuffle]]]]
A sense of participation in a group event is among the chief appeals of rave music and dancing to pulsating beats is its immediate outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Joining In: An investigation in participatory music | author=Everit, Anthony | quote=A rave or a rock concert is not simply a presentation which audiences attend, but a communal event (like a secular church service) in which everyone has an active part. | url=http://www.gulbenkian.org.uk/pdffiles/Joining-in-text-no-photos.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731195611/http://www.gulbenkian.org.uk/pdffiles/Joining-in-text-no-photos.pdf | archivedate=31 July 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Music as Social Life: The Politics of Participation. | publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press | author=Turino, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raving in itself is a syllabus-free dance, whereby the movements are [[freestyle dance|not predefined and the dance is performed randomly]], dancers take immediate inspiration from the music, their mood and watching other people dancing. Thus, the electronic, rave and club dances refer to the [[street dance]] styles that evolved alongside electronic music culture. Such dances are street dances since they evolved alongside the underground rave and club movements, without the intervention of [[dance studios]]. These dances were originated in some 'scenes' around the world, becoming known only to ravers or clubgoers who attempt to these locations. They were originated at some point that certain moves had begun to be performed to several people at those places, creating a completely freestyle, yet still highly complex set of moves, adaptable to every dancer change and dance whatever they want based on these moves. Many rave dancing techniques suggest using your body as an extension of the music, to loosen up, and let the music flow through the body to create a unique form of movement.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A common feature shared by all these dances, alongside with being originated at clubs, raves and music festivals around the world and in different years, is that when [[YouTube]] and other social media started to become popular (around 2006), these dances began to be popularized by videos of raves performing them, recording and uploading their videos.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Therefore, they began to be practiced outside their places of origin, creating different 'scenes' in several countries. Furthermore, some of these dances began to evolve, and these dance 'scenes' are not totally related to the club/rave scenes they were originated. Also, the way of teaching and learning them have changed. In the past, if someone wanted to learn one of these dances, the person had to go to a club/rave, watch people dancing and try to copy them. Now,{{When|date=November 2017}} with social media, these dances are mostly taught on video tutorials and the culture spreads and grows inside those social media, like Flogger on [[Fotolog]], Rebolation, Sensualize and Free Step on [[Orkut]] and Cutting Shapes on [[Instagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/100325/1/Heller_David_r.pdf|title=I-Rave: digiphrenia's transformation of a culture|first=David|last=Heller|publisher=[[University of Hawai'i at Mãnoa]]|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due the lack of studies dedicated to those dances, combined with poor and inaccurate information of them available on the Internet, it is hard to find reliable information.

The loose, casual and sports clothing was originally adopted by the acid house set earlier on in [[Ibiza]], utilizing easy-to-dance-in attire from hip hop and football/soccer culture. As well as clothing there developed a range of accessories carried by many ravers including: [[Vicks VapoRub]], which ravers find pleasant under the influence of MDMA, [[pacifier]]s to satiate the need to grind one's teeth ([[bruxism]]) caused by taking MDMA, and [[glow stick]]s which adjunct the mild [[psychedelia]] of MDMA's effect.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In the United States and other countries, rave fashion is characterized by colorful clothing and accessories, most notably "kandi" jewellery, that [[Fluorescence|fluoresce]] under ultraviolet light. They contain words or phrases that are unique to the raver and they can choose to trade with each other using "PLUR" (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect). In European countries, this kandi culture is much less common. Most raves are illegal and take place outside or in poorly heated warehouses, so keeping warm is a priority.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Dreadlocks]], dyed hair and [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]] are popular, as are tattoos and piercings. Clothing is vibrant and alternative, often taking inspiration from new-age [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] style. However, there is no set dress code for the illegal rave scene.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Some global rave events such as [[Sensation (event)|Sensation]] adopted a strict minimalistic dress policy, either all white or black attire.

Since rave culture has seen such an explosion in the US since 2010 as the rave scene is no longer illegal or underground, raves in the US are now{{When|date=November 2017}} so popular that there are many brands, retailers, and websites selling apparel, costumes, and accessories just for those who go to dress up at raves. This style of attire, along with the entire rave culture, is now{{When|date=November 2017}} spilling out into the mainstream, especially in the US. Sometimes called "rave fashion" or "festival fashion," it now includes all kinds of accessories to create unique looks depending on the person and event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-evolution-of-rave-fashion-4391090|title=The Evolution of Rave Fashion|author=Mary Grace Cerni|work=L.A.

Some ravers participate in one of four light-oriented dances, called ''glowsticking'', ''glowstringing'', ''gloving'', and ''lightshows''. Of the four types of light-orientated dances, gloving in particular has evolved beyond and outside of the rave culture. Other types of light-related dancing include [[LED]] lights, flash-lights and blinking strobe lights. LEDs come in various colours with different settings.
[[Gloving]] has evolved into a separate dance form that has grown exponentially in the last couple of years.{{When|date=November 2017}}  Since then the culture has extended to all ages, ranging from kids in their early teens to college students and more. The traditional Rav'n lights are limited now, but many stores have developed newer, brighter, and more advanced version of lights with a plethora of colors and modes—modes include solid, stribbon, strobe, dops, hyper flash, and other variations.

Among the various elements of 1970s disco subculture that ravers drew on, in addition to basing their scene around dance music mixed by [[DJ]]s, ravers also inherited the positive attitude towards using [[club drug]]s to "enhanc[e]...the sensory experience" of dancing to loud music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0601/p2619.html|title=Club Drugs: MDMA, Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB), Rohypnol, and Ketamine|first=Paul M.|last=Gahlinger|date=1 June 2004|journal=American Family Physician|volume=69|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, disco dancers and ravers preferred different drugs. Whereas 1970s disco scene members preferred [[cocaine]] and the depressant/sedative [[Quaaludes]], ravers preferred MDMA, 2C-B, [[amphetamine]], [[morphine]] and other pills. According to the FBI, raves are one of the most popular venues where [[club drugs]] are distributed, and as such feature a prominent drug subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/clubdrugs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329215407/https://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/clubdrugs |archivedate=29 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AdlafSmart1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adlaf|first1=Edward M.|last2=Smart|first2=Reginald G.|title=Party Subculture or Dens of Doom?

"[[Poppers]]" is the street name for [[alkyl nitrites]] (the most well-known being [[amyl nitrite]]), which are inhaled for their intoxicating effects, notably the "rush" or "high" they can provide. Nitrites originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open, which led to the nickname "poppers." The drug became popular in the US first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s and then at dance and rave venues in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, synthetic [[phenethylamines]] such as [[2C-I]], [[2C-B]] and [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine|DOB]] have been referred to as club drugs due to their stimulating and psychedelic nature (and their chemical relationship with [[MDMA]]).&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/onelife/drink_drugs/2ci/ BBC-2C-I]&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2012, derivates of the [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] 2C-X drugs, the [[NBOMe]]s and especially [[25I-NBOMe]], had become common at raves in Europe. In the U.S., some law enforcement agencies have branded the subculture as a [[Recreational drug use|drug-centric]] culture, as rave attendees have been known to use drugs such as [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[2CB]], and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Groups that have addressed alleged drug use at raves e.g. the Electronic Music Defense and Education Fund (EM:DEF), The Toronto Raver Info Project ([[Canada]]), [[DanceSafe]] ([[United States|USA]] and [[Canada]]), and [[Eve &amp; Rave]] ([[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]), all of which advocate [[harm reduction]] approaches. In 2005, Antonio Maria Costa, Executive Director of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], advocated drug testing on highways as a countermeasure against drug use at raves.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
Much of the controversy, [[moral panic]] and law enforcement attention directed at rave culture and its association with drug use may be due to reports of drug overdoses (particularly MDMA) at raves, concerts and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Armenian, Mamantov, Tsutaoka, Gerona, Silman, Wu, Olson |title=Multiple MDMA (Ecstasy) Overdoses at a Rave Event-A Case Series |journal=Journal of Intensive Care Medicine |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=252–258 |year=2012 |url=http://jic.sagepub.com/content/28/4/252 |doi=10.1177/0885066612445982|pmid=22640978 |citeseerx=10.1.1.668.2071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History by country==

=== Canada ===
In 2001 Calgary, Alberta became the first major municipality in Canada to pass a bylaw with respect to raves. The intent of the bylaw was to ensure that raves would be safe for participants, and also not unduly disruptive to adjacent neighbourhoods. The bylaw was created in consultation with representatives from the municipality, the province of Alberta, and the rave community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Sylvia|date=2002|title=Raves reviewed: An extended dance event bylaw|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.25316/IR-158|journal=Plan Canada|language=en|volume=42 | issue = 1 |pages=27–28|doi=10.25316/ir-158|issn=0032-0544|via=VIUSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1988, acid house was making as significant an impact on popular consciousness in Germany and Central Europe as it had in England.&lt;ref&gt;Short [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpC0qlWKb_Q excerpt] from special on German "Tele 5" from Dec.8, 1988. The show is called "Tanzhouse" hosted by a young Fred Kogel. It includes footage from Hamburg's "Front" with Boris Dlugosch, Kemal Kurum's "Opera House" and the "Prinzenbar".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 German DJs [[Westbam]] and Dr. Motte established the [[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo Club]], an illegal party venue, and co-founded the [[Love Parade]].&lt;ref name=ROBB&gt;Robb, D.

(1998), ''Eierkuchensozialismus'', TAZ, 10.7.1998, (p. 26).&lt;/ref&gt; In urbanized Germany raves and techno parties often preferred industrial sceneries such as decommissioned power stations, factories, the canalization or former military properties of the cold war.&lt;ref name="illegalraves"&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth: Love and Cabbage|url=http://magazin.spiegel.de/EpubDelivery/spiegel/pdf/9085950 | publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date= 26 August 1996|accessdate=25 February 2017| language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 a number of party venues closed, including [[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo]], and the Berlin Techno scene centred itself around three locations close to the foundations of the Berlin Wall: the [[E-Werk]], the [[Bunker (Berlin)|Bunker]] and the now legendary [[Tresor (club)|Tresor]].&lt;ref&gt;Henkel, O.; Wolff, K. (1996) ''Berlin Underground: Techno und Hiphop; Zwischen Mythos und Ausverkauf'', Berlin: FAB Verlag, (pp. 81–83).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, German DJs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound, as an acid-infused techno began transmuting into [[hardcore techno|hardcore]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuler, M. (1995), "Gabber + Hardcore" (p. 123), in Anz, P.; Walder, P. (eds.) (1999 rev. edn, 1st publ. 1995, Zurich: Verlag Ricco Bilger) ''Techno''. Reinbek: Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; This emerging sound was influenced by Dutch [[gabber]] and Belgian hardcore. Other influences on the development of this style were European [[Electronic Body Music]] groups of the mid-1980s such as [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|DAF]], [[Front 242]], and [[Nitzer Ebb]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, S. (1998), ''Energy Flash: a Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture'', Pan Macmillan, (p. 110).&lt;/ref&gt;

Across Europe, rave culture was becoming part of a new youth movement. DJs and electronic-music producers such as Westbam proclaimed the existence of a "raving society" and promoted [[electronic music]] as legitimate competition for [[rock and roll]]. Indeed, [[electronic dance music]] and rave subculture became mass movements. Since the mid 1990s, raves had tens of thousands of attendees, youth magazines featured styling tips, and television networks launched music magazines on House and Techno music.&lt;ref name="technoculture"&gt;{{cite web|title=Young is the Night: Nightlife from A to Z |url=http://magazin.spiegel.de/EpubDelivery/spiegel/pdf/7441075 | publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date= 1 August 1998|accessdate=25 February 2017| language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="munichfoundcom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Corpus Techno: The music of the future will soon be history |url=http://www.munichfound.com/archives/id/27/article/496/|publisher=MUNICHfound.com|date=July 1997|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[Love Parade]] festivals in Berlin and later the Metropolitan Ruhr area repeatedly attracted more than one million party-goers between 1997 and 2010. Dozens of other annual [[technoparade]]s took place in Germany and Central Europe at that time, the largest ones being [[Union Move]], Generation Move, Reincarnation and Vision Parade as well as [[Street Parade]] and [[Lake Parade]] in Switzerland. Large commercial raves since the nineties include [[Mayday (music festival)|Mayday]], [[Nature One]], [[Time Warp Festival|Time Warp]], [[SonneMondSterne]] and [[Melt! Festival|Melt!]]. Beyond Berlin, further centers of the techno and rave scene of the 1990s and 2000s in Germany were Frankfurt (famous clubs were ''Omen'', ''[[Dorian Gray (club)|Dorian Gray]]'', ''[[Cocoon (club)|Cocoon]]'' and ''U60311'') and Munich (''Ultraschall'', ''KW – Das Heizkraftwerk'', ''Natraj Temple'', ''Harry Klein'' and ''Rote Sonne'').&lt;ref name="ronaldhitzler"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hitzler |first1=Ronald |last2=Pfadenhauer |first2=Michaela |last3=Hillebrandt |first3=Frank |last4=Kneer |first4=Georg | last5=Kraemer|first5=Klaus | title=Loss of safety?

Further popular venues include ''Stammheim (Aufschwung Ost)'' in Kassel, ''Tunnel Club'' in Hamburg and ''Distillery'' in Leipzig. Since the late 2000s, Berlin is still called the capital of electro music and rave, and techno clubs such as [[Berghain]], [[Tresor (club)|Tresor]], ''Watergate'' or [[KitKatClub]] and the way to party in barely renovated venues, ruins or wooden shacks such as, among many others, [[Club der Visionaere]], ''Wilde Renate'', ''Fiese Remise'' or ''Bar 25'', attracted international media attention.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Berlin, Still Partying in the Ruins |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/travel/in-berlin-still-partying-in-the-ruins.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|date=21 November 2014|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One movie that portraits this scene of the 2000s is [[Berlin Calling]] starring Paul Kalkbrenner. In the 2010s, there remains a vivid rave and techno scene throughout the country, including numerous festivals and world-class techno clubs also outside of Berlin, such as for example ''MMA Club (Mixed Munich Arts)'' in Munich, ''Institut für Zukunft'' in Leipzig or ''Robert Johnson'' in Offenbach.&lt;ref name=" electronicbeats"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electronicbeats.net/10-best-clubs-germany-arent-berlin/ |title= The 10 best clubs in Germany that aren’t in Berlin | publisher=[[Electronic Beats]] |date=30 January 2017 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Birth of UK rave scene (1980s–1990s)====
{{See also|Second Summer of Love|Acid house party}}
The UK was finally recognized for its rave culture in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By 1991, organisations such as [[Fantazia (dance)|Fantazia]] and [[Raindance (rave)|Raindance]]  were holding massive legal raves in fields and warehouses around the country. The Fantazia party at Castle Donington, July 1992 was an open-air, all-night event.  The Vision at Pophams airfield in August 1992 and Universe's [[Tribal Gathering]] in 1993 had a more festival feel.

By the middle of 1992, the scene was slowly changing, with local councils passing by-laws and increasing fees in an effort to prevent or discourage rave organisations from acquiring necessary licences.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} This meant that the days of the large one-off parties were numbered. By the mid-1990s, the scene had also fragmented into many different styles of dance music, making large parties more expensive to set up and more difficult to promote. The sound driving the big raves of the early 1990s had by the end of 1993 split into two distinct and polarising styles, the darker [[oldschool jungle|jungle]] and the faster [[happy hardcore]]. Although many ravers left the scene due to the split, promoters such as ESP Dreamscape and [[Helter Skelter (rave music promoter)|Helter Skelter]] still enjoyed widespread popularity and capacity attendances with multi-arena events catering to the various genres. Notable events of this period included ESP's outdoor Dreamscape 20 event on 9 September 1995 at Brafield aerodrome fields, [[Northamptonshire|Northants]] and Helter Skelter's Energy 97 outdoor event on 9th Aug 1997 at Turweston Aerodrome, Northants.

====Free parties and outlawing of raves (1992–1994)====
{{See also|Free party}}
The illegal [[free party]] scene also reached its zenith for that time after a particularly large festival, when many individual sound systems such as Bedlam, Circus Warp, DIY, and [[Spiral Tribe]] set up near [[Castlemorton Common Festival|Castlemorton]] Common. The government acted. Under the ''[[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]'', the definition of music played at a rave was given as:

{{quote|"Music" includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.|Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/ukpga_19940033_en_8#pt5-pb2 |title=Public Order: Collective Trespass or Nuisance on Land – Powers to remove trespassers on land – Powers to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave |work=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |accessdate=9 June 2008| year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sections 63, 64 &amp; 65 of the Act targeted [[electronic dance music]] played at raves. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when a hundred or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave. Section 65 allows any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a five-mile radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the [[standard scale]] (£1000). The Act was officially introduced because of the noise and disruption caused by all night parties to nearby residents, and to protect the countryside. However, some participants in the scene claimed it was an attempt to lure youth culture away from MDMA and back to taxable [[alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Energy Flash: A Journey through Rave Music and Dance Culture'', Pan Macmillan, (p. 149) ({{ISBN|0330350560}})&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1994, the Zippies staged an act of [[Intervasion of the UK|electronic civil disobedience]] to protest against the CJB (i.e., [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice Bill]]).

====Legal and underground raves (1994–present)====
After 1993, the main outlet for raves in the UK were a number of licensed parties, amongst them [[Helter Skelter (rave music promoter)|Helter Skelter]], Life at Bowlers (Trafford Park, Manchester), The Edge (formerly the Eclipse [Coventry]), The Sanctuary (Milton Keynes) and Club Kinetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

"The Laser Dome" featured two separate dance areas, "Hardcore" and "Garage", as well as over 20 video game machines, a silent-movie screening lounge, replicas of the "Statue of Liberty", "San Francisco Bridge", and a large glass maze. In Scotland, event promoters Rezerection held large-scale events across the country.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

By 1997, the popularity of weekly Superclub nights had taken over from the old Rave format, with a raft of new club-based genres sweeping in (e.g. Trance, Hard House, Speed and UK garage) alongside the more traditional House sound that had regained popularity.  Clubs like Gatecrasher and Cream rose to prominence with dress codes and door policies that were the polar opposite of their rave counterparts; stories of refused entry due to not wearing the right clothing were commonplace, but seemingly did nothing to deter Superclub attendance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Origins in disco and psychedelia (1970s)====
{{See also|Circuit party}}
American ravers, following their early UK &amp; European counterparts, have been compared to the hippies of the 1960s due to their shared interest in non-violence and psychedelia.&lt;ref&gt;Energy Flash, Simon Reynolds, (p276 &amp; 290), 1998, Macmillan Publishers ({{ISBN|0330350560}})&lt;/ref&gt; Rave culture incorporated disco culture's same love of dance music spun by DJs, drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and hedonism. Although disco culture had thrived in the mainstream, the rave culture would make an effort to stay underground to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The key motive for remaining underground in many parts of the US had to do with curfew and the standard 2:00 am closing of clubs. It was a desire to keep the party going past legal hours that created the underground direction. Because of the legality, they had to be secretive about time and place.

====New York raves and party promoters (1980s)====
In the late 1980s, rave culture began to filter through into North America from English expatriates and from US DJs who would visit Europe. However, rave culture's major expansion in North America is often credited to [[Frankie Bones]], who after spinning a party in an aircraft hangar in England, helped organize some of the earliest American raves in the 1990s in New York City called "Storm Raves". Storm Raves had a consistent core audience, fostered  by zines by fellow Storm DJ (and co-founder, with Adam X and Frankie Bones, of the US techno record store, Groove Records.). [[Heather Heart]] held Under One Sky. Simultaneously in NYC, events were introducing electronic dance music to this city's dance scene. Between 1992 and 1994, promotional groups sprung up across the east coast.

====San Diego and Latin America (1990s)====
In the 1990s, San Diego held large raves with audiences of thousands. These festivals were  held on Indian reservations and ski resorts during the summer months and were headlined by DJs such as Doc Martin, Dimitri of [[Deee-lite]], Afrika Islam and the [[Hardkiss]] brothers from San Francisco. They helped to create the Right to Dance movement—a non violent protest held in San Diego and later in Los Angeles.

Featuring local San Diego DJs Jon Bishop, Steve Pagan, Alien Tom, Jeff Skot and Mark E. Quark performed at these events. The events used large props and themes. The fairy and pixie craze, with ravers getting fairy tattoos and wearing fairy wings to parties was associated with the region. The percussive group [[Crash Worship]] was active here.

====Growth in California====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a boom in rave culture in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. At first, small underground parties sprung up all over the [[South of Market, San Francisco|SOMA]] district in vacant warehouses, loft spaces, and clubs. The no alcohol rule fueled the ecstasy-driven parties. Small underground raves were just starting out and expanding beyond SF to include the East Bay, the South Bay area including San Jose, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz beaches.

In late 1991, raves started to expand across northern California, and cities like Sacramento, Oakland, Silicon Valley (Palo Alto, San Jose). The massive parties were taking place in outdoor fields, airplane hangars and hilltops that surround the valley. San Francisco's early promoters and DJs were from the UK and Europe. Raves took place in some of the SOMA art museum event such as, 'Where the wild things are' in the museum on top of the Sony Metreon, and in the Maritime hall (1998–2002).

By the end of 1994, a new generation of ravers were attracted by the new sounds. EDM began to become popular. Raves could be found in many different kinds of venues, as opposed to just basements and warehouses. Promoters started to take notice and put together the massives of the late 1990s with many music forms under one roof for 12-hour events. 2000 saw the demise of massive raves as curfews were placed on permits handed out to promoters. Instead of all night and into the next day, parties now had to end at 2 a.m.  Smaller, intimate venues continued just like they had from the start and underground raves became the norm. The [[Electric Daisy Carnival#2010|death of an attendee who had taken MDMA]] at the [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] in 2010 put a negative spin on raves in LA and California.

====Seattle====
Through the mid 1990s and into the 2000s the city of Seattle also shared in the tradition of West Coast rave culture. Though a smaller scene compared to San Francisco, Seattle also had many different rave crews, promoters, Djs, and fans. Candy Raver style, friendship and culture became popular in the West Coast rave scene, both in Seattle and San Francisco. At the peak of West Coast rave, Candy Raver, and massive rave popularity (1996–1999,) it was common to meet groups of ravers, promoters, and Djs who frequently travelled between Seattle and San Francisco, which spread the overall sense of West Coast rave culture and the phenomenon of West Coast "massives".

====Recent years (2000s)====
{{See also|List of electronic dance music festivals}}
By 2010, raves were becoming the equivalent of large-scale rock music festivals, but many times even bigger and more profitable. The [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] in Las Vegas drew more than 300,000 fans over three days in the summer of 2012, making it the largest EDM music festival in North America. [[Ultra Music Festival]] in Miami drew 150,000 fans over three days in 2012 while other raves like [[Electric Zoo]] in New York, [[Beyond Wonderland]] in LA, Movement in Detroit, [[Electric Forest]] in Michigan, Spring Awakening in Chicago, and dozens more now attract hundreds of thousands of "ravers" every year. These new EDM-based rave events (now simply referred generically to as "[[music festivals]]") sell out. Festival attendance at the Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) increased by 39.1%, or 90,000 attendees from 2011 to 2012. In 2013, EDC had attendance of approximately 345,000 people, a record for the festival. The average ticket for EDC cost over $300 and the event contributed $278 million to the Clark County economy in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w.insomniac.com/newsDetails.php?news=607 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150121204609/http://w.insomniac.com/newsDetails.php?news=607 |archivedate=21 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This festival takes place at a 1,000-acre complex featuring a half dozen custom built stages, enormous interactive art installations, and hundreds of EDM artists.

====1980s and 1990s: outdoor raves and the Sydney scene====
Rave parties began in Australia as early as the 1980s and continued well into the late 1990s. They were mobilised versions of the 'warehouse parties', across Britain. Similar to the United States and Britain, raves in Australia were unlicensed and held in spaces normally used for industrial and manufacturing purposes, such as [[warehouses]], [[factories]] and carpet showrooms. In addition, suburban locations were also used: basketball gymnasiums, train stations and even circus tents were all common venues. In [[Sydney]], common areas used for outdoor events included [[Sydney Park]], a reclaimed garbage dump in the inner south west of the city, Cataract Park and various other natural, unused locations and bush lands. The raves placed a heavy emphasis on the connection between humans and the natural environment, thus many raves in Sydney were held outdoors, notably the 'Happy Valley' parties (1991–1994), 'Ecology' (1992) and 'Field of Dreams 4' (July 6, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.snarl.org/youth/chrispagan2.pdf|title=Rave culture in Sydney, Australia: mapping youth spaces in media discourse|first=Chris|last=Pagan|publisher=[[University of Sydney]]|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sydneyravehistory.com/#!rave-timeline/c66t|title = Timeline of Sydney Raves from the website – Sydney Rave History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-late 1990s saw a slight decline in rave attendance, attributed to the [[Anna Wood (born 1980)|death of Anna Wood]] at a licensed inner-city Sydney venue, which was hosting a rave party known as "Apache". Wood had taken [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and died in hospital a few days later, leading to extensive media exposure on the correlation of drug culture and its links to the rave scene in Australia.

====2000s&amp;ndash;present====
The tradition continued in [[Melbourne]], with 'Earthcore' parties. Raves also became less underground as they were in the 1990s, and many were held at licensed venues well into the 2000s. Despite this, rave parties of 1990s size became less common. Nonetheless, the rave scene in Australia experienced a resurgence after 2010. During this period the resurfacing of the "Melbourne Shuffle", a Melbourne club/rave dance style, became a YouTube trend and  videos were uploaded. The rave subculture in Melbourne was strengthened with the opening of clubs such as Bass Station and Hard Candy and the rise of [[free party]] groups such as Melbourne Underground. Melbourne helped keep raving culture alive with young people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5966">[[File:Nazimova A doll's house.jpg|thumb|Scene from ''A Doll's House'', a 1922 silent film starring Alla Nazimova and Alan Hale, Sr. The author of the original play, [[Henrik Ibsen]], was an influential exponent of realism in the theatre.]]'''Realism''' in the [[theatre]] was a general [[Art movement|movement]] that began in the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th-century theatre]], around the 1870s, and remained present through much of the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]]. It developed a set of dramatic and theatrical [[Dramatic convention|conventions]] with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances. Part of [[Realism (arts)|a broader artistic movement]], it includes [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and [[Socialist realism]].

Russia's first professional playwright, [[Aleksey Pisemsky]], along with [[Leo Tolstoy]] (in his ''[[The Power of Darkness]]'' of 1886), began a tradition of psychological realism in Russia. A new type of acting was required to replace the declamatory conventions of the [[well-made play]] with a technique capable of conveying the speech and movements found in the domestic situations of [[everyday life]]. This need was supplied by the innovations of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]], founded by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]].&lt;ref name=HartnollFound2003&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Hartnoll, Phyllis |editor2=Found, Peter |title=The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre| year=2003| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=0-19-282574-7 | pages=341, 409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the subtle expression of emotion in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' through everyday small-talk had initially gone unappreciated in a more traditionally conventional production in St Petersburg, a new staging by the Moscow Art Theatre brought the play and its author, as well as the company, immediate success.&lt;ref name=Esslin-2003&gt;Esslin (2003), pp. 353-356&lt;/ref&gt; A logical development was to take the revolt against theatrical artifice a step further in the direction of naturalism, and Stanislavski, especially in his production of [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''[[The Lower Depths]]'', helped this movement achieve international recognition.&lt;ref name=HartnollFound2003/&gt; The Moscow Art Theatre's ground-breaking productions of plays by Chekhov, such as ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', in turn influenced [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]. Stanislavski went on to develop his 'system', a form of [[actor training]] that is particularly well-suited to psychological realism.

19th-century realism is closely connected to the development of modern drama, which, as Martin Harrison explains, "is usually said to have begun in the early 1870s" with the "middle-period" work of the Norwegian dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]]. Ibsen's realistic drama in prose has been "enormously influential."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (1998), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[opera]], ''[[verismo]]'' refers to a post-Romantic Italian tradition that sought to incorporate the Naturalism of Émile Zola and Henrik Ibsen. It included realistic – sometimes sordid or violent – depictions of contemporary everyday life, especially the life of the lower classes. 

== Added to Realism ==
3D details were added by 1800. By 1850 settings, costumes and details became historically accurate and had more logic to the plays.

==Stanislavski's distinction==
As part of a strategic argument in his day, Stanislavski used the term "psychological realism" to distinguish his [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of acting from his own [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalistic]] early stagings of the plays of [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Maxim Gorky]], and others. Jean Benedetti argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Naturalism, for him, implied the indiscriminate reproduction of the surface of life. Realism, on the other hand, while taking its material from the real world and from direct observation, selected only those elements which revealed the relationships and tendencies under the surface. The rest was discarded.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (2005), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As used in critical literature today, however, the term Naturalism has a broader scope than that, within which all of Stanislavski's work falls. In this broader sense, Naturalism or "psychological realism" is distinct both from [[Socialist realism]] and the critical realism developed by the [[epic theatre]] of [[Bertolt Brecht]].

'''Rob(ert) Pilatus''' (8 June 1965 – 2 April 1998) was an American-born German [[model (person)|model]], [[dancer]], and [[singer]]. Pilatus was half of the pop music duo [[Milli Vanilli]], the other one being Frenchman [[Fab Morvan|Fabrice Morvan]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rob Pilatus was born in [[New York City|New York]], the son of an American soldier and a German mother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1574756/ IMDb Database] retrieved December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6299187 His memorial at the Find A Grave website] retrieved December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He was adopted as a baby by a [[Munich]] family.&lt;ref name="MTV Obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1432182/milli-vanillis-pilatus-dead/|title=Milli Vanilli’s Pilatus Dead|last=Staff|date=6 April 1998|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilatus worked as a model and [[breakdancing|breakdancer]],&lt;ref name="MTV Obit"/&gt; also appearing as a backing singer with the group Wind at the [[1987 Eurovision Song Contest]] in [[City of Brussels|Brussels]], finishing in second place, before joining Fab Morvan in 1988 to form the pop group Milli Vanilli.&lt;ref name=mtv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432182/19980406/milli_vanilli.jhtml|title=Milli Vanilli's Pilatus Dead|date=6 April 1998|publisher=mtv.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milli Vanilli===
Both Pilatus and Morvan were noticed by German music producer [[Frank Farian]], who signed them to be part of a musical act. Shortly after a trip to [[Turkey]], where the duo reputedly took its name from a local advertising slogan, Milli Vanilli was born. Pilatus and Morvan served as the public faces for singers [[Charles Shaw (singer)|Charles Shaw]] and [[Brad Howell (singer)|Brad Howell]], who Farian thought were vocally talented, but lacked a marketable image.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/15/usa.musicnews|title=Hollywood pays lip service to Milli Vanilli|last=Pilikington|first=Ed|date=7 February 2007|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=25 July 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Milli Vanilli [[Music recording sales certification|platinum album]] was ''[[Girl You Know It's True]]'', which became a worldwide hit. The album produced five hit singles including three number 1 hits: "Girl I'm Gonna Miss You", "Baby Don't Forget My Number" and "Blame It On The Rain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=milli vanilli|chart=all}}|title=Milli Vanilli: Billboard Chart History|publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milli Vanilli won the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] on 21 February 1990, for "Girl You Know It's True".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/services/newspaper/printedition/sunday/fanfare/ny-ffmus5567351feb10,0,5317518.story|title=Not every Grammy decision was a winner|last=Guzmán|first=Rafer|date=10 February 2008|publisher=newsday.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the enormous success, the duo were a frequent target of rumours and allegations of onstage [[lip-synching]] and not having sung on the album. Charles Shaw, one of the actual vocalists, told a reporter the truth, but retracted his statement after Farian paid him $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318744,00.html|title=Artificial Vanilli|last=Goodman|first=Fred|last2=Trakin|first2=Roy|date=30 November 1990|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Pilatus and Morvan pressured Farian to let them sing on the next album, Farian admitted to reporters on 15 November 1990 that they had not performed on the recordings. Milli Vanilli's Grammy Award was withdrawn four days later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2D71F3DF936A35751C1A966958260|title=Winner of Grammy Lost By Milli Vanilli: No One|last=Holden|first=Stephen|date=5 December 1990|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arista Records dropped them from its roster and deleted their album and songs from their catalog, making ''Girl You Know It's True'' the largest-selling album to ever be taken out of print. A court ruling in the United States allowed anyone who had bought the album to receive a refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dowell|first=Gary|author2=Evans, Isaiah|others=Jones, Kim|title=Heritage Music and Entertainment Dallas Signature Auction Catalog #622|editor=Halperin, James L.|publisher=2006|pages=34|isbn=1-59967-081-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farian later attempted an unsuccessful comeback for the group without Pilatus and Morvan. Months after the scandal, Pilatus and Morvan appeared in a commercial for Carefree sugarless chewing gum. In it the duo lip-synched to an opera recording. An announcer asked, "How long does the taste of Carefree Sugarless Gum last?" The record began to skip and the announcer added, "Until these guys sing for themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDE1331F937A25755C0A967958260|title=Milli Vanilli Appears Again|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|date=14 June 1991|work=The New York Times |accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Pilatus and Morvan signed with a new label, Taj, and released ''[[Rob &amp; Fab]]'', an album featuring their own voices, but the album only sold around 2,000 copies.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; The label went bankrupt shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00EED8113AF934A35757C0A96E958260|title= Robert Pilatus, 33, Performer In Disgraced Band Milli Vanilli|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=7 April 1998|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline, addiction and turn to crime===
In the years following the collapse of Milli Vanilli, Pilatus struggled with [[substance abuse]] and even [[suicide attempts]]. After their unsuccessful comeback, Morvan and Pilatus stopped speaking to each other. In 1996, Pilatus served three months in prison for [[assault]], [[vandalism]] and attempted [[robbery]]. Farian paid for Pilatus to spend six months in [[drug rehabilitation]], before returning to Germany from the United States.&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,282696_2,00.html|title=The Sad Truth|last=Chris |first=Willman|publisher=ew.com|pages=2|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On 3 April 1998, on the eve of a promotional tour for a new completed Milli Vanilli album entitled ''Back and in Attack'' featuring Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan on lead vocals, Pilatus was found dead at the age of 32 from a suspected [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and prescription pill overdose in "Kent's Cube" at Friedrichsdorf,  near Frankfurt. His death was ruled accidental, and their final album has never been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/millivanilli/articles/story/5927796/milli_vanillis_pilatus_dead_at_33|title=Milli Vanilli's Pilatus Dead At 32|date=7 April 1998|publisher=rollingstone.com|accessdate=25 July 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622144027/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/millivanilli/articles/story/5927796/milli_vanillis_pilatus_dead_at_33|archivedate=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was survived by his son&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iloveoldschoolmusic.com/pimp-slaps-thefts-who-knew-this-milli-vanilli-singer-was-this-wild/3/ "So Sad: This Milli Vanilli Singer Lived A Hard Life After Their Success."

'''''RollerJam''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[television series]] featuring [[roller derby]] that aired on [[The Nashville Network]] (TNN, now [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]) from 1999 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482031/fullcredits|title=RollerJam (TV Series 1999–2000)|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first attempt to bring roller derby to TV since [[RollerGames]].

''RollerJam'' was derived from the original roller derby, but newer skaters used [[inline skates]] to modernize the sport (several skaters, mostly older ones, used the traditional [[quad skates]]). The program was taped at [[Universal Studios]] Stage 21 in [[Orlando, Florida]], known as ''RollerJam Arena'' and now the [[Impact Wrestling Zone]], for the first and second seasons (1999 and 2000) and the former ''[[American Gladiators]]'' arena in the show's final season. The first few weeks of the show's second season, which ran from August to October 1999, were taped at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]].

==Creation==

''RollerJam'' was the brainchild of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]-based television impresarios [[Ross K. Bagwell, Sr.]] and [[Stephen Land]]. Land, a fan of roller derby in boyhood, was inspired to bring the sport back to television by an [[obituary]] for roller derby legend [[Joan Weston]] that he had read in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in May 1997, and shared his idea with Bagwell, his mentor, who gave him a positive response.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Turczyn|first=Coury|url=http://www.popcultmag.com/obsessions/fadsandphenoms/rollerderby/derby2.html|title=Blood on the Tracks|publisher=PopCult Magazine|accessdate=2011-12-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228045852/http://www.popcultmag.com/obsessions/fadsandphenoms/rollerderby/derby2.html|archivedate=2008-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 1999 and January 2001,&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.tv.com/rollerjam/show/11373/episode_listings.html?season=0 RollerJam Episode List at TV.com] confirms there were 100 episodes, comprising four seasons, that aired between January 1999 and January 2001, plus a preview/pilot episode in December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Bagwell and Land, under the name Pageboy Entertainment, collaborated with [[CBS]] to stage this new televised revival of roller derby.&lt;!--Google reveals roughly equal numbers of references to each--&gt;

In May 1998, Bagwell and Land pitched their idea to [[The Nashville Network]] (TNN). The network agreed to air the show but wanted it ready by the new year, forcing Bagwell and Land to create a league, recruit skaters, build a track, design logos and uniforms, hire a television crew, and record the program all in a span of about seven months. In an attempt to build continuity between ''RollerJam'' and previous roller derby incarnations, Bagwell and Land hired [[Jerry Seltzer]], the son of roller derby creator [[Leo Seltzer]], to be commissioner of their new league. The first episode of the show was taped in November 1998, a week after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Overview==
''RollerJam'' featured several teams of skaters competing in the fictional World Skating League (WSL). Jerry Seltzer served as on-screen WSL commissioner, although he only made a few appearances. The initial teams, each consisting of seven men and seven women, were the New York Enforcers, California Quakes, Florida Sundogs, Nevada Hot Dice, Texas Rustlers, and Illinois Riot (the original names of the latter three teams were the Las Vegas High Rollers, Texas Twisters, and Illinois Inferno; their names were changed prior to the start of the first season). Two notable veterans from Roller Games, "Rockin'" Ray Robles and "Latin Spitfire" Patsy Delgato, were featured in the second season of ''RollerJam''. Despite strong funding and four seasons of broadcasts on TNN, the venture never became a "live" attraction. Fabricated storylines and characters in the mode of [[professional wrestling]] were being featured more than actual competitive skating around season 3 and 4, raising the ire of many skaters and fans of true roller derby.

==Rulesheets==
===Periods===

Games were played in four 6-minute periods with as many 60-second jams as possible; women skated odd numbered periods, and the men skated the even-numbered periods.  (In traditional roller derby, the game has eight 12-minute periods, again with 60-second jams.)  Jams began and ended on the referee's whistle, and a buzzer sounded to reinforce this.

===Skaters===

Whereas traditional derby employs a pivot skater, RollerJam did not use one.  Instead, each team had 3 blockers, each wearing a white helmet, and two jammers, each wearing a black helmet with red stripes.  In-line skates were legalized in attempt to modernize the sport, but certain skaters opted still to use the quad skates.

===Jams===

In seasons 1-2, the game was played like traditional derby in that the first jam began from the black start/finish line, while the skaters had to continuously skate until a time-out was called or the period ended.  In seasons 3-4, this changed to every single jam starting from a standstill start from the black line.  In either case, jammers had to start from the back of the pack (the whole group) and work their way through, with the first jammer to break out winning the status of lead jammer.  The skaters then got one point for every opponent they successfully lapped.  The lead jammer could cut off the jam early by placing their hands on their hips.

The last jam of the last period always went the full minute regardless of what the period clock showed.

===Penalties===

At the referee's discretion, skaters would sit in a [[penalty box]] for violating the rules for various reasons, from 1-2 jams, or face immediate disqualification (ejection) from the game.  Skaters frequently racked up these penalties and were willing to take it if they felt it would bring them a [[moral victory]].

===Winning===

The team with the most points won the game.  If the game was tied in regulation, originally the genders would continue to alternate in sudden death overtime periods until there was a clear winner but instead one skater from each team face-off in a Tiebreaker Match Race, 5 laps around the track and whoever crosses the finish line first wins the game for their team.

==Special Features==

In addition, special features would occasionally pop up:

:'''Half-time Match races:''' Usually played between 2 or more skaters to either settle the score with another rival skater or to compete for the "Jammer" title belt. 

Another unique concept was that Rollerjam held special games, races and competitions in certain episodes, such as:

:'''The Rollerjam All-Star game:''' Played between Company D led by Mark D'Amato and the Crazy 8's headed by Sean Atkinson, both stocked with an all-star roster of each team's key men and women skaters in the WSL. 

:'''Last Man Standing:''' A tie-breaker when both teams have equal points by the final period of and have to compete in a no time limit, no penalty game in a team variation of battle royal, to determine a winner. The objective of the tie-breaker is for skaters of both teams is to eliminate the opposing skaters by knocking them over the rails or in the infield of the track until one team wins, earning the winning team 15 points.

:'''Men and Women Demolition Derby:''' A special contest in the vein of the [[Royal Rumble]] where the WSL skaters compete in separate interval contests both assigned for male and female skaters, which starts with 3 or 4 skaters on the track. A new skater enters the track every 20 or 14 seconds in the order voted by fans at the Rollerjam website. The contest will keep going, until all the skaters, except the winner, has been eliminated by either being knocked over the rails or in the track's infield.  

:'''Table Race''' Skaters race 4 laps while avoiding crashing into the 2 tables set up on the track to evade elimination from the race. 

:'''Nightgown and Lingerie race:''' Similar to a Bra and Panties match, where the female skaters are dressed up in their outfits and must race 4 laps without getting their outfits stripped, destroyed, or get themselves knocked off the track, resulting in an elimination from the race). 

:'''Fastest man or woman on skates race:''' 5 of 1 jammer skater of each team race each other on the track, 7 laps, the first jammer crossing the finish line wins the race. 

:'''Quad Race:''' A race played between Mark D'Amato and Ray Robles, the winner keeps the quad skates, loser wears inline skates for the rest of the season.

==Actors==

Three of the most notable actors featured in ''RollerJam'' were veteran movie actor Tom Nowicki (who played WSL general manager Kenneth Loge III and Sundogs manager Leonard Loge III), Cindy Maranne (who played Amanda Hertz, the manager of the Nevada Hot Dice), former [[ESPN]] and current [[CBS Sports Network]] play-by-play commentator James Bates (who played "The Prophet", a character in Season 4 only who would interrupt games to make speeches, and later managed the Sundogs), and stage actress and former [[Mickey Mouse Club|Mouseketeer]] [[Lindsey Alley]] (who played Lisa Seltzer, the "granddaughter" of Leo Seltzer). Other characters included Julie Amazon (a bodybuilding skater in Season 4), Canine and Disable (minions of The Prophet who skated for the Sundogs, and "captured" Lindsay Francis during the first game of Season 4),Devo (a convict character who skated for the Hot Dice), Lil Nasty (A midget who is a sidekick to Tim Washington) and El Numero (A masked luchador Who skated for the Enforcers).

The most points ever scored in one jam was 28 in Period 3 of a game between the New York Enforcers and the Illinois Riot.  The Riot came back from a 20+ point deficit to win 46-43 in the highest scoring game in RollerJam history. Roller Derby legend [[Ann Calvello]], best known for her brutal feuds with [[Joan Weston]], skated a match race with Kenneth Loge III in ''RollerJam'''s finale. She emerged victorious.

==Criticism==

Ron Buffone, a producer for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), called ''RollerJam'' "That stupid roller blading show".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'' DVD, WWE Home Video&lt;/ref&gt; Buffone believed that TNN treated ''[[ECW on TNN]]'', which aired prior to ''RollerJam'' on Friday nights, as a lead-in for ''RollerJam'' rather than a show in its own right, despite the fact that the ECW broadcast generated the network's highest ratings. Nevertheless, some cross-promotion between the two programs did occur, notably when ECW wrestlers such as [[Axl Rotten]] and [[Tommy Dreamer]] appeared on ''RollerJam'' as "enforcers" for the Florida Sundogs against the New York Enforcers.

==Key players==

===Men===
*'''Sean Atkinson''', men's captain of the California Quakes. Atkinson is the first third generation skater in roller derby history.  His parents Buddy (Jr.) and Dru Atkinson and his grandparents Buddy (Sr.) and Bobbie Atkinson all skated for Leo Seltzer's original derby.  He now manages the Orlando Thunder in the [[American Roller Skating Derby]] (San Francisco Bay Bombers' league).  His younger brother, Seth, is also a skater and helps run the XSL (Xtreme Skating League), which is an independent hardcore roller derby promotion equivalent to the old ECW style of wrestling.

*'''Tim Washington''', the "enforcer" of the Enforcers and formerly "Titan" of the ''[[American Gladiators]]''. Nicknamed "Big Nasty". A cousin of professional boxer [[Marvin Hagler]], both he and Brian "The Blade" Gamble are now professional wrestlers.

*'''Telisa Miller''', a skater for the Texas Rustlers and New York Enforcers. Nicknamed "The Hellcat", she was one of the more violent skaters in the WSL, as she was more than willing to pull hair, scratch, claw, and get into fistfights on the banked track while with the Enforcers.

===Non-skaters===

*'''[[Jerry Seltzer]]''', real-life son of roller derby creator [[Leo Seltzer]] and original commissioner of the league.  Disillusioned with the focal point of skating competition giving way to storylines, gimmicks and fictitious characters, he quit ''RollerJam''.
*'''[[Tom Nowicki]]''', a professional actor who played WSL general manager '''Kenneth Loge III''' and his twin brother, Florida Sundogs manager '''Leonard Loge'''. Kenneth Loge was Jerry Seltzer's replacement as head of the WSL. He crusaded for morality in the sport and would not stand for outrageous behaviour on the track, actions which met obvious resistance from the skaters. His character was similar to the [[Don Callis|Cyrus]] character and [[The Network (professional wrestling)|Network]] stable in ECW.  Nowicki is best remembered as a football coach opposite [[Denzel Washington]] in ''[[Remember The Titans]]''.
*'''Jason Bates''', television sports commentator who portrayed '''The Prophet''', lackey for Kenneth Loge III, who began preaching Loge's crusade for morality.  He first appeared in the series' final season premiere sending his sidekicks "Canine" and "Disable" (known as the "Moral Authority") to kidnap newly acquired New York Enforcers female skater Lindsay Francis to make her "pure and wholesome" (similar to wrestler [[Molly Holly]]'s storyline in the WWE).  He would later acquire the Florida Sundogs and turn on Loge.  After the Enforcers defeated the Sundogs, he disappear with the league's new championship belt as the Sundogs were disbanded from the WSL.  Bates would later become announcer for [[ESPN]] and now serves as play-by-play announcer for [[CBS Sports Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssportsnetwork.com/bios/|title=CBS Sports Network Bios|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113102147/http://www.cbssportsnetwork.com/bios|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He will trade off duties during [[Arena Football League]] telecasts.
*'''[[Lindsey Alley]]''', former [[Mouseketeer]] and current stage actress who played '''Lisa Seltzer''', the "grand-daughter" of Leo Seltzer who tried to form an all-star team to travel overseas (storyline) selecting Jason McDaniel as men's captain and Stacey Blitsch as women's captain.

==Video Game==
A game based on the show was developed by BLAM! and published by [[Electronic Arts]] for the [[playstation]] The Rollerjam game made an appearance as an IGN preview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/06/rollerjam|title=RollerJam|first=I. G. N.|last=Staff|date=5 June 2000|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. according to Neoseekers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neoseeker.com/rollerjam/|title=RollerJam - Neoseeker|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the RollerJam video game was set for a release in the 2nd quarter of 2002, but contrary to IGN release date, as the game was supposed to be released on 2001. But no other trace of information came through about the game being released or canceled without a confirmation.

The video game itself became featured in Rollerjam as a feud, where the game was announced by EA's Steve Sims, around the halftime of the Nevada Hot Dice Vs. New York Enforcers game on March 21, 2000, during Rollerjams 3rd season &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country.com:80/tnn/rollerjam/front-archive/rjam-204517-f.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000612162445/http://www.country.com:80/tnn/rollerjam/front-archive/rjam-204517-f.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 June 2000|title=Roller Jam on TNN The Nashville Network|date=12 June 2000|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival attempts, failures, and legacy==
* A 1999 attempt to start a form of roller derby in the U.K called RollerBlaze&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/retro/rollerblaze/index.html|title=Roller Blaze UK|website=www.angelfire.com|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. by a small group of mountain bikers, skaters and fitness fanatics during their Summer Vacation after a trip to San Francisco inspired by RollerJam and the [[American Roller Derby League]]. Held a few unofficial derby races on a banked cycle track in London played between the Southern Blue Angels and the South Coast Sun Devils, in hope to achieve the goal of forming a small 'Brit Blaze' league and organize a 'derby' game on a more suitable indoor wooden track. Around 2000 and 2001 when Rollerjam ended, the league was disbanded.

*during the mid-2000 when Rollerjam was at its peak, Bill Griffiths, Sr., creator of the [[Roller games]] and RGI Commissioner, Wanted to bring Rollergames back under the name Rollergames 2000 (or rg2k)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollergames.com/rg2k.htm|title=ROLLERGAMES 2000|date=14 October 2000|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001014235946/http://www.rollergames.com/rg2k.htm|archivedate=14 October 2000|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but without the oversaturated mentality of Rollerjam and the 1989 version of [[rollergames]] had, instead more so in bringing back the caliber and format of play as represented in the 60's, 70's, and early 80's. But could not reach an agreement with the executives &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollergames.com/rg2kpr35.htm|title=ROLLERGAMES 2000 Update|date=21 January 2001|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010121121100/http://www.rollergames.com/rg2kpr35.htm|archivedate=21 January 2001|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Despite the ultimatum, Griffith had optimism and determination to bring back the real Roller games, but the plans were short lived as no agreements were meant. Rollergames 2000 was scrapped. And RGI continues to skate untelevised games.

*Around the time of Roller jam in 1996, a last attempt to get a proper old school roller derby on TV was made under the pilot Roller Derby USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdwlAj6U7NE&amp;t|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the National Roller Derby League, it featured  Joanie Weston at the age of 62 and Ann Calvallo at the age of 70, and other NRDL skaters. with a game played between the Las Vegas High-Rollers and the Hollywood Stars, The pilot didn't sell, it was considered "The last Jam" and that Classic Roller Derby has ended

*After Rollerjam ended and the WSL folded, Derby veteran Erwin Miller, started Rollersport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollersport.us/index.cfm|title=Rollersport - The Ultimate Derby Experience|date=9 February 2003|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030209184806/http://www.rollersport.us/index.cfm|archivedate=9 February 2003|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 in an attempt to revive the sport of roller derby properly, acquiring Former Rollerjam skaters and potential recruits, while still using inline skates and construction of a new track. However, in 2003, complications and opposition made the plans for the revival to fall through and the Rollersport project was scrapped.

*Despite Roller Derby make a return as a slightly popular but niche contemporary sport played on flat track and banked and established under governing bodies such as [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association]] and [[Men's Roller Derby Association]], certain fans feel the ongoing modern version of the once great sport is losing its touch in gameplay, contact, and skating, contradicting what made roller derby an action-packed sport that entertained and interested many, Also too many rules, penalitys, blow out games, and slow derby strategies, are the general problem thats slowing down the game. That's when Roller derby leagues such as the [[American Roller Derby League]], [[National Roller Derby League]], and [[American Roller Skating Derby]] attempt to bring back the traditional old-school professional roller derby sport, offering an alternative to fans who are sick and tired of the mainstream modern roller derby. With the promise of fast-paced skating action, athletic skaters with personality, fights, and legitimate full-contact gameplay. With the help of a couple veteran Roller Games, Roller Derby, and Rollerjam skaters as well who also skated old timer bouts at [[Penn Jersey Roller Derby]] banked track and NRD HOF Memorial Old Timers Game and Reunions on a regulation banked track located in Lali O's Outhoummountry backyard in Vegas. But the concept was met with the opposition of a few league's owner's refusal to let go of the undefeated bias flagship team favoritism focus such as NRDL L.A. Thunderbirds and ARSD San Francisco Bay Bombers overshadowed the league's image of legitimacy, as certain skaters causing intentional trouble scaring off potential talent, and certain leagues owners could not abandon the overly fabricated predetermine format aspects of the set game, thus burning bridges with fans and the roller derby community, the leagues still continue to skate their game at venues such as the Pomona Fairplex, The Cow Palace, and Alameda Fairgrounds unstreamed and untelevised exhibition once a year still drawing in fans who enjoyed the game regardless.

==Plot==
{{main|List of Rosario + Vampire characters}}
[[File:Yokai Academy.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Yokai Academy, the main setting of ''Rosario + Vampire'']]
[[Tsukune Aono]] is an average teenager who is unable to get into any local high schools due to his poor grades. As a last ditch effort to secure his education, his parents enroll him in a private school called Yokai Academy, which he discovers is a boarding school for monsters. The school teaches monsters how to coexist with humans, including disguising as them, but any real humans found on campus are to be killed. Although he fears for his life, Tsukune befriends a beautiful vampire girl named [[Moka Akashiya]], who enjoys his company and especially the taste of his blood. During a fight with a school bully, Tsukune accidentally removes the [[rosary|rosario]] around Moka's neck, and discovers that she transforms into a powerful vampire with a completely different personality.

Because of Moka, Tsukune decides to stay at Yokai. He befriends formerly antagonistic students, including a succubus [[Kurumu Kurono]] and a child prodigy witch [[Yukari Sendo]]. They join the school's Newspaper Club and wind up fighting a variety of students and teachers, who use their monstrous powers to bully or to control one or more of the members for their own selfish or destructive ends. On a club trip to the human world, they meet a witch, [[Ruby Tojo]], who defends a field of sunflowers from being torn down by developers. They meet [[Mizore Shirayuki]], a [[yuki-onna|snow fairy]] student who becomes Tsukune's "stalker". A group of "[[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Monstrels|Monstrels]]" harass the club, causing Moka to transfuse blood into Tsukune to the point where he turns into a [[ghoul]]. Ruby, having recovered from injuries, joins the school's staff as the Headmaster's assistant. An evil group called the [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Anti-Schoolers|Anti-Schoolers]] threaten to break down the barrier between the human and monster worlds. When Tsukune's cousin manages to sneak onto the school grounds, the club has a hard time keeping the monster school a secret. When the school is temporary closed because of damage, Tsukune returns home to the human world only to have Moka, Kurumu, Yukari, and Mizore follow him and hide in his room.

In ''Rosario+Vampire: Season II'', Moka's younger sister [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Koko Shuzen|Koko Shuzen]] enrolls. She, Ruby, and Mizore join the Newspaper Club. On an excursion to Mizore's homeland, they learn of a dangerous organization called [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Fairy Tale|Fairy Tale]], which seeks to destroy the human world. The Newspaper Club visits the human world where they meet [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#San Otonashi|San Otonashi]], a former club member, and run into trouble with adversaries from Fairy Tale's 7th Branch office. Chinese transfer student [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Fangfang Huang|Fangfang Huang]] tries to recruit Tsukune to join his mafia family. When Moka spends a school day as her inner personality, she is unable to return to the seal, so the Newspaper Club heads to China to get her rosario fixed.

At Hong Kong, Tsukune and the gang learn the truth about Moka's identity: she was infused with First Ancestor blood by her mother [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Akasha Bloodriver|Akasha Bloodriver]], who sacrificed herself to protect them from [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Alucard|Alucard]], the original First Ancestor vampire. Moka's eldest sister [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Aqua Shuzen|Aqua]] infiltrates the Huang manor and captures Moka to bring to Fairy Tale, which suspects that Moka is the key to reviving Alucard. While his friends train their powers, Tsukune has his body altered by [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Tohofuhai|Tohofuhai]] to handle the upcoming challenges.

Tsukune and the gang infiltrate the Hanging Garden: a sky fortress that serves as Fairy Tale's headquarters. They face opposition from their leader and matriarch of the Shuzen family [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Gyokuro Shuzen|Gyokuro Shuzen]], who sends the leaders of the Fairy Tale Branches after them for a series of fights. The group eventually reaches Moka, but must face her sisters Aqua and [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Kahlua Shuzen|Kalua]]. Gyokuro snatches Moka's rosario in order to control Alucard. A character called the [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Masked King|Masked King]] reveals himself to be a clone of Alucard's original vampire form. He reveals that he has manipulated both Fairy Tale and its opposition to determine whether the rosario could control him, and then merges with his monster self, who goes on a rampage in Tokyo.

Moka is mortally wounded, but Tsukune revives her by removing all his holy locks and transforming himself into a First Ancestor vampire. They beat down Alucard, but he revives and reveals that he has hatched eggs in Japan's major cities. Tsukune's friends and allies, along with the two other Dark Lords, band together to fight Alucard and his clones. Tsukune puts Moka's rosario on Alucard, which awakens Akasha inside his monster body. Akasha tells Alucard to give up the fight, and they cast a self-disintegration spell. Now that the existence of monsters is known in the human world, coexistence is now even harder to achieve, however, Tsukune is confident that he and his friends can do it.

== Conception ==
Ikeda drew inspiration from the monster manga series ''[[Kaibutsu-kun]]'' and has incorporated some references later into the first serialization of the ''Rosario+Vampire'' manga. In an interview at [[Lucca Comics &amp; Games|Lucca Comics]] 2012, Ikeda said he is a big fan of [[Tim Burton]] and was inspired by his works, including ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and particularly ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' because the monster has a sensitive soul. His first character design was Moka, a beautiful girl vampire with a crucifix around her neck; he then created the school of monsters and Tsukune afterwards. He credits the beautiful girls for the series' popularity and added the fighting elements. After the series ended in ''[[Monthly Shōnen Jump]]'' but was going to be featured in ''[[Jump Square]]'', he retitled the second series to give it a sense of renewal.&lt;ref name="nanodainterview"&gt;{{cite web|first=Shinji |last=Kakaroth | publisher = Web Agency Meta Line |url=http://www.nanoda.com/gp-publishing-intervista-akihisa-ikeda/ |title=GP Publishing: Intervista ad Akihisa Ikeda | language = Italian | work=Nanoda.com |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Warner of Mania.com gave volumes 1 through 3 of ''Season II'' ratings between B+ and A-. In his review for volume 1, he felt the first part was a bit weak with "predictable and bland stories," but remarked positively on the volume's cover art and artwork in general, especially the character artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-01_article_121263.html | title= Rosario+Vampire Season 2 Vol. #01 | publisher= Mania | date= June 28, 2010 | accessdate= September 28, 2011 | last= Warner | first= Matthew | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131215210125/http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-01_article_121263.html | archivedate= December 15, 2013 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second volume, he said it was better focusing on two stories and while noting the second story with [[Kokoa Shuzen|Kokoa]] was weaker, it still delivers “quite a few solid laughs" and helps develop her character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-02_article_123466.html | title= Rosario+Vampire Season 2 Vol. #02 | publisher= Mania | date= August 12, 2010 | accessdate= September 28, 2011 | last= Warner | first= Matthew | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121011075525/http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-02_article_123466.html | archivedate= October 11, 2012 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for volume 3, he stated while it starts out slow, he really enjoyed the story with Mizore, specifically the character development and seeing the characters put aside their disagreements for a common goal: to save Mizore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-03_article_127579.html | title=Rosario+Vampire Season 2 Vol. #03 | publisher=Mania | date=March 11, 2011 | accessdate=September 28, 2011 | author=Warner, Matthew | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224050205/http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-03_article_127579.html | archivedate=December 24, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin gave volumes of ''Season II'' an A- rating.  He opined the emphases on sexual innuendo, comparing it to ''[[Strawberry 100%]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookbin.com/rosariovampireseasontwo003.html |title= Rosario+Vampire: Season II Volume 3 | work=Comic Book Bin |date=February 17, 2011 | accessdate= October 28, 2011 | last= Douresseaux|first=Leroy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookbin.com/rosariovampire204.html |title= Rosario+Vampire: Season II Volume 4 | publisher=Comic Book Bin |date=April 1, 2011 | accessdate= October 28, 2011 | last=Douresseaux|first=Leroy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the series is like ''[[The Addams Family]]'' mixed with ''[[X-Men]]'': "cool, creepy folks at a secret school where they can live and learn in a place free of the prejudice against them." In volume 11, he changed his overall view and deemed it solidly a battle manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookbin.com/rosariovampireseasontwo011.html |title= Rosario+Vampire: Season II Volume 11 manga review |work= Comic Book Bin |date= 2013-03-05 | first=Leroy | last= Douresseaux |accessdate= 2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2008}}

A '''seat filler''' is a person who fills in an empty seat during an event. There are two types of seat fillers:

# a person who subscribes to a seat-filling theatre club. Members of these clubs help fill in unsold seats for theatre, music, film, sporting events, dance performances and other live events. The producers of the event give complimentary tickets to the seat-filling organization, who pass them on to their members. The producers get a fuller [[audience]] and therefore a better experience for the paying patrons (and talent), while the seat-filler is able to see an event for a small service charge. Within the industry, this is also referred to as "papering the house". &lt;br /&gt;Some seat-filling companies charge no surcharge per ticket and only a membership based fee. This model is popular in cities with a larger number of shows and therefore a higher number of tickets to go around.
# a person who takes up spare seats when the person allocated the seat is elsewhere. An example of this is the [[Academy Awards]] in which many of the audience are either gaining awards, once they win the award the recipient needs to wait for an appropriate time to return to their seat, or because the member of the audience is involved in producing the show. Seat fillers are primarily employed so that when TV cameras show audience shots there are no empty seats.

==Benefits to the Shows==
* Increased awareness of their show (especially helpful if new)
* Higher concession sales 
* Fuller audience for a better show experience
* Marketing to a vocal audience
* Private and no cost. Most seat filler services offer their service for free to the shows with an attached promise that their members will not publicly state where they received the tickets from as to not impact future sales

==In popular culture==
*In the ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' episode "My Doctor Has a Cow Puppet", Charlie tries to set up Alan with one of his friends who works as a seat filler at award ceremonies.
*In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Summer of George]]", [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] works as a seat filler at the [[Tony Awards]].
*The plot of the 2004 movie ''[[The Seat Filler]]'' revolves around a seat-filler who meets a burgeoning pop star during an event.
*In the movie ''[[Now You See Me (film)|Now You See Me]]'', they mention that the audience are a bunch of seat fillers.
*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Call Girl (Family Guy)|Call Girl]]", [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] works as a seat filler for fetuses during [[ultrasounds]].
*In the [[87th Academy Awards]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]] mentions the seat fillers explaining its meaning and jokes with [[Steve Carell]] as if he were a seat filler.

[[Image:Shemahinskaya boyaderka 2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A dancer from [[Shamakhi]]. [[Grigory Gagarin|G.Gagarin]], mid-19th century]]
The '''Shamakhi dancers''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: ''Şamaxı rəqqasələri'') were the principal dancers of the entertainment groups that existed in [[Shamakhi]] ([[Azerbaijan]]) up to the late 19th century. These groups worked similarly to [[tawaif]]s.

[[Russia]]n painter [[Grigory Gagarin]] who lived in the [[Caucasus]] in 1840–1855 depicted the Shamakhi dancers in a series of paintings, in which he referred to them as ''bayaderki''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azeri.ru/az/cultur/359/ Ими восхищался Дюма] by Emil Karimov and Mehpara Aliyeva. ''Azeri.ru''&lt;/ref&gt; (баядерки; sg. ''bayaderka'' – баядерка; originally the Portuguese term ''balliadera'' borrowed into Russian and other European languages via French (''bayadère'') and initially used to refer to the [[devadasi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bayadère. Oxford English Dictionary. Retrieved February 1st, 2008 from Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The extant documents regarding the Shamakhi dancers, and dances, are very limited. In literature, Shamakhi dancers are referred to in [[Arthur Gobineau|Comte de Gobineau]]'s novel ''The dancing girl of Shamakha and other Asiatic tales''.

''The Dancer of Shamakha'' recounts the life of Armenian dancer [[Armen Ohanian]], her education as a dancer, her childhood in Russia, and her travels in Iran and Egypt. It was published in French as ''La Danseuse de Shamakha'' in 1918 and translated into English in 1923 by [[Rose Wilder]].  After moving to Europe, Ohanian danced traditional dances for audiences, gave lectures on poetry, and was an active member in intellectual and political circles.  She eventually moved to Mexico.  She is the author of some 15 publications including autobiographical volumes and books on culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ohanian, Armen.  ''La Danseuse de Shamakha''.  Forward by Anatole France. Paris: Bernard Grasset, 1918

[[File:Cptvdisplay.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Flat-screen televisions for sale at a consumer electronics store in 2008.]]
'''Television''' ('''TV'''), sometimes shortened to '''tele''' or '''telly''', is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in [[monochrome]] ([[black and white]]), or in colour, and in two or [[3D television|three dimensions]] and sound. The term can refer to a [[television set]], a [[television program]] ("TV show"), or the medium of [[Transmission (telecommunications)|television transmission]]. Television is a [[mass medium]] for advertising, entertainment and news.  

Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers. After [[World War II]], an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as [[Betamax]], [[VHS]] tape, [[Hard disk drive|local disks]], DVDs, [[flash drives]], high-definition [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, and cloud [[digital video recorders]] has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies— at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now occurs on [[Cloud computing|the cloud]].  At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, [[digital television]] transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) ([[576i]], with 576 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] lines of resolution and [[480i]]) to [[high-definition television]] (HDTV), which provides a [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: [[1080p]], [[1080i]] and [[720p]]. Since 2010, with the invention of [[smart television]], [[Internet television]] has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through [[streaming video]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Video]], [[iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Roku]] and [[Chromecast]].

In 2013, 79% of the world's [[households]] owned a television set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/opinions/0087/the-state-of-television-worldwide/222681|title=TVTechnology: The State of Television, Worldwide|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage [[Cathode ray tube|cathode ray tube (CRT)]] screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]]s (both [[Cold cathode#Lamps|fluorescent-backlit]] and [[LED-backlit LCD display|LED]]), [[OLED]] displays, and [[plasma display]]s was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s.&lt;ref name="cepro.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/mitsubishi_drops_dlp_displays_goodbye_rptvs_forever/|title=Mitsubishi Drops DLP Displays: Goodbye RPTVs Forever|author=Julie Jacobson|date=1 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/lg-end-plasma-tvs,news-19840.html|title=LG's Exit May Herald End of Plasma TVs|author=Marshall Honorof|work=Tom's Guide|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the near future, LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oled-info.com/lg-electronics-expects-oled-tv-market-gradually-replace-led-tv-market|title=LG Electronics expects the OLED TV market to gradually replace the LED TV market|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TVs in the mid-2010s.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7497383/sony-new-smart-tv-run-android-tv-ces-2015|title=All of Sony's new Smart TVs run on Android TV|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techtimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/24117/20150103/ces-2015-new-samsung-smart-tvs-will-be-powered-by-tizen-os.htm|title=CES 2015: New Samsung Smart TVs Will Be Powered by Tizen OS|work=Tech Times|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/lg-to-show-off-webos-2-0-smart-tv-at-ces-2015/|title=LG to show off webOS 2.0 smart TV at CES 2015|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smart TV]]s with integrated Internet and [[Web 2.0]] functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.&lt;ref name="Techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/24/internet-tv-and-the-death-of-cable-tv-really/ |title=Internet TV and The Death of Cable TV, really |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=24 October 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] transmitters to [[broadcasting|broadcast]] the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by [[Cable television|coaxial cable or optical fiber]], [[Satellite television|satellite]] systems and, since the 2000s via the [[Internet television|Internet]]. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as [[analog television|analog]] signals, but a [[Digital television transition|transition]] to digital television is expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal [[electronic circuit]]s, including a tuner for [[Tuner (electronics)|receiving]] and decoding broadcast signals. A visual [[display device]] which lacks a [[tuner (television)|tuner]] is correctly called a [[video monitor]] rather than a television.

==Etymology==
The word ''television'' comes {{ety|grc|''τῆλε'' (tèle)|far|lat|visio|sight}}. The first documented usage of the term dates back to 1900, when the Russian scientist [[Constantin Perskyi]] used it in a paper that he presented in French at the 1st International Congress of Electricity, which ran from 18 to 25 August 1900 during the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|International World Fair]] in Paris. The Anglicised version of the term is first attested in 1907, when it was still "...a theoretical system to transmit moving images over [[telegraph]] or telephone wires".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=television |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=30 December 1969 |accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "...formed in English or borrowed from French télévision."&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; In the 19th century and early 20th century, other "...proposals for the name of a then-hypothetical technology for sending pictures over distance were telephote (1880) and televista (1904)."&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The abbreviation "TV" is from 1948. The use of the term to mean "a television set" dates from 1941.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The use of the term to mean "television as a medium" dates from 1927.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The slang term "telly" is more common in the UK. The slang term "the tube" or the "boob tube" refers to the bulky [[cathode ray tube]] used on most TVs until the advent of flat-screen TVs. Another slang term for the TV is "idiot box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Thompson, Robert|title=1985: Television Transformed 1.0|work=[[New York Times]]|date=3 October 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/business/media/1985-television-transformed-1-0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the 1940s and throughout the 1950s, during the early rapid growth of television programming and television-set ownership in the United States, another slang term became widely used in that period and continues to be used today to distinguish productions originally created for broadcast on television from films developed for presentation in movie theaters.&lt;ref name="Smallscreen"&gt;Johnson, Richard (2018). [https://pagesix.com/2018/10/11/big-movie-stars-are-not-making-the-cut-on-the-small-screen/ “Big movie stars are not making the cut on the small screen”], Page Six, ''[[The New York Post]]'' (New York, N.Y.), October 11, 2018. Retrieved November 24, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The “small screen”, as both a compound adjective and noun, became specific references to television, while the “[[Feature film|big screen]]” was used to identify productions made for theatrical release.&lt;ref name="Smallscreen"/&gt;

[[Facsimile transmission]] systems for still photographs pioneered methods of mechanical scanning of images in the early 19th century. [[Alexander Bain]] introduced the facsimile machine between 1843 and 1846. [[Frederick Bakewell]] demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered the [[photoconductivity]] of the element [[selenium]] in 1873. As a 23-year-old German university student, [[Paul Nipkow|Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow]] proposed and patented the [[Nipkow disk]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Shiers, George and May (1997), ''Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940''. Taylor &amp; Francis, pp. 13, 22. {{ISBN|978-0-8240-7782-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it, so each hole scanned a line of the image. Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk "[[rasterizer|image rasterizer]]" became exceedingly common.&lt;ref&gt;Shiers &amp; Shiers, p. 13, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantin Perskyi]] had coined the word  ''television'' in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|International World Fair]] in Paris on 24 August 1900. Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Constantin PERSKYI|url=https://www.histv.net/perskyi-1900|title=Télévision au moyen de l'électricité|agency=Congrès Inographs by Telegraph|work=The New York Times Sunday Magazine|date=20 September 1907|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology by [[Lee de Forest]] and [[Arthur Korn]], among others, made the design practical.&lt;ref name="Sending Photographs by Telegraph"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E4DA1331E733A25757C2A9649C946697D6CF "Sending Photographs by Telegraph"], ''The New York Times'', Sunday Magazine, 20 September 1907, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first demonstration of the live transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris in 1909. A matrix of 64 [[selenium]] cells, individually wired to a mechanical [[commutator (electric)|commutator]], served as an electronic [[retina]]. In the receiver, a type of [[Kerr effect|Kerr cell]] modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8x8 [[pixel]] resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. An updated image was transmitted "several times" each second.&lt;ref&gt;Henry de Varigny, "[http://histv2.free.fr/rignoux/rignoux1909.htm La vision à distance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231305/http://histv2.free.fr/rignoux/rignoux1909.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}", ''L'Illustration'', Paris, 11 December 1909, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 [[Edouard Belin]] sent the first image via radio waves with his [[belinograph]].

In 1911, [[Boris Rosing]] and his student [[Vladimir Zworykin]] created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, "very crude images" over wires to the "[[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Braun]] tube" ([[cathode ray tube]] or "CRT") in the receiver. Moving images were not possible because, in the scanner: "the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZcwhVyiMqsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Burns+%27%27Television:+An+International+History+of+the+Formative+Years%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=zworykin%20rosing%20selenium&amp;f=false R.

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:John Logie Baird, 1st Image.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The first known photograph of a moving image produced by Baird's "televisor", circa 1926 (The subject is Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson)]] --&gt;

By the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] employed the [[Nipkow disk]] in his prototype video systems. On 25 March 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised [[silhouette]] images in motion, at [[Selfridges|Selfridge's]] Department Store in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v115/n2892/pdf/115504a0.pdf "Current Topics and Events"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', vol. 115, 4 April 1925, p. 505–506, {{doi|10.1038/115504a0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist's dummy named "Stooky Bill", whose painted face had higher contrast, talking and moving. By 26 January 1926, he demonstrated the transmission of the image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light which swept across the subject. A Selenium [[Phototube|photoelectric tube]] detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal.  This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one [[scan line]] of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over {{convert|438|mi|km}} of telephone line between London and [[Glasgow]].

In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and [[Bernard Natan]] of [[Pathé]] established France's first television company, Télévision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Baird, "[http://www.bairdtelevision.com/1932.html Television in 1932]", ''BBC Annual Report'', 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, he demonstrated [[ultra-short wave]] television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240-lines of resolution on [[BBC]] television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead a [[17.5mm film]] was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.

An American inventor, [[Charles Francis Jenkins]], also pioneered the television. He published an article on "Motion Pictures by Wireless" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses; and it was on 13 June 1925, that he publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925 Jenkins used the [[Nipkow disk]] and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles, from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C., using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Radio Shows Far Away Objects in Motion", ''The New York Times'', 14 June 1925, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glinsky"&gt;{{cite book| last = Glinsky| first = Albert| title = Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage| location = Urbana, Illinois| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2000| pages = 41–45| isbn = 0-252-02582-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent]] No. 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on 30 June 1925 (filed 13 March 1922).

[[Herbert E. Ives]] and [[Frank Gray (researcher)|Frank Gray]] of [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on 7 April 1927. Their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a 2-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24&amp;nbsp;inches wide by 30&amp;nbsp;inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic, moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a [[copper wire]] link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from [[Whippany, New Jersey]]. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]]. A [[flying-spot scanner]] beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 [[millisecond]]s. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: "It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality."&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1880 to 1941'', McFarland &amp; Co., Inc., 1987, p. 101. {{ISBN|978-0-89950-284-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[WRGB]], then W2XB, was started as the world's first television station. It broadcast from the [[General Electric]] facility in [[Schenectady, NY]]. It was popularly known as "[[WGY (AM)|WGY]] Television". Meanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Léon Theremin]] had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16 lines resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using [[interlacing]] in 1926. As part of his thesis, on 7 May 1926, he electrically transmitted, and then projected, near-simultaneous moving images on a five-foot square screen.&lt;ref name="glinsky"/&gt; By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until May 1932 by RCA, with 120 lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/rca_story_brewster.html | title=Early Electronic Television RCA TV Development: 1929 – 1949 | publisher=Early Television Museum | accessdate=20 February 2016 | author=Brewster, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 December 1926, [[Kenjiro Takayanagi]] demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan.

Because only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution on mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to 120 or so. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear.&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. McLean, ''Restoring Baird's Image'' (London: IEEE, 2000), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that [[Peck Television Corp.]] started in 1935 at station VE9AK in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/ve9ak.html |title=VE9AK entry at |publisher=Earlytelevision.org |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peck Television Corporation Console Receiver and Camera|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/peck.html|publisher=Early Television Museum|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advancement of all-electronic television (including [[Video camera tube#Image dissector|image dissectors]] and other camera tubes and [[cathode ray tube]]s for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical television, despite its inferior image quality and generally smaller picture, would remain the primary television technology until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.

In 1897, English [[physicist]] [[J. J. Thomson]] was able, in his three famous experiments, to deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT). The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897 and is also known as the "Braun" tube.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Braun (1897) [https://archive.is/20141217172841/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89048352892;view=1up;seq=568 "Ueber ein Verfahren zur Demonstration und zum Studium des zeitlichen Verlaufs variabler Ströme"] (On a process for the display and study of the course in time of variable currents), ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', 3rd series, '''60''' :  552–559.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cathode Ray Tube|year=2007|work=Medical Discoveries|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|url=http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Bar-Cod/Cathode-Ray-Tube-CRT.html|accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[cold cathode|cold-cathode]] [[diode]], a modification of the [[Crookes tube]], with a [[phosphor]]-coated screen.

In 1908 [[Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton]], fellow of the [[Royal Society]] (UK), published a letter in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in which he described how "distant electric vision" could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube, or Braun tube, as both a transmitting and receiving device,&lt;ref name="Swinton_DEV1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams succeeded in transmitting "very faint" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate. Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The first cathode ray tube to use a [[hot cathode]] was developed by [[John Bertrand Johnson|John B.

[[File:Zworykin kinescope 1929.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Zworykin]] demonstrates electronic television (1929)]]
Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images. While working for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1923, he began to develop an electronic camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast, and poor definition, and was stationary.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 51. {{ISBN|0-252-02104-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, on the basis of Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a [[patent interference]] suit against Farnsworth. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application;&lt;ref name=US1691324&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=mZ9KAAAAEBAJ Zworykin, Vladimir K., Television System].

In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts, and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1&amp;nbsp;million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use his patents.&lt;ref&gt;Stashower, Daniel, ''The Boy Genius and the Mogul: The Untold Story of Television'', Broadway Books, 2002, p. 243–244. {{ISBN|978-0-7679-0759-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Everson"&gt;Everson, George (1949), ''The Story of Television, The Life of Philo T.

At the [[Berlin Radio Show]] in August 1931, [[Manfred von Ardenne]] gave a public demonstration of a television system using a CRT for both transmission and reception. However, Ardenne had not developed a camera tube, using the CRT instead as a [[flying-spot scanner]] to scan slides and film.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''Zworykin: Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Philo Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system, using a live camera, at the [[Franklin Institute]] of [[Philadelphia]] on 25 August 1934, and for ten days afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA838 New Television System Uses 'Magnetic Lens']", ''Popular Mechanics'', Dec. 1934, p. 838–839.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns370"&gt;Burns, R.

The basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built. Although he gave no practical details, among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc, in 1880, for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning.&lt;ref&gt;M. Le Blanc, "Etude sur la transmission électrique des impressions lumineuses", ''La Lumière Electrique'', vol. 11, 1 December 1880, p. 477–481.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish inventor [[Jan Szczepanik]] patented a color television system in 1897, using a [[selenium]] photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Burns, ''Television: An International History of the Formative Years'', IET, 1998, p. 98. {{ISBN|0-85296-914-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another inventor, [[Hovannes Adamian]], also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him,&lt;ref&gt;Western technology and Soviet economic development: 1945 to 1965, by Antony C. Sutton, Business &amp; Economics – 1973, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; and was patented in Germany on 31 March 1908, patent № 197183, then in Britain, on 1 April 1908, patent № 7219,&lt;ref&gt;The History of Television, 1880–1941, by Albert Abramson, 1987, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; in France (patent № 390326) and in Russia in 1910 (patent № 17912).&lt;ref name="tvmuseum.ru"&gt;[http://www.tvmuseum.ru/attach.asp?a_no=1018 A.

Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] demonstrated the world's first color transmission on 3 July 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] to alternate their illumination.&lt;ref&gt;John Logie Baird, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=JRVAAAAAEBAJ Television Apparatus and the Like], U.S. patent, filed in U.K. in 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on 4 February 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] studios to a projection screen at London's [[Dominion Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/crystalpalace.html Crystal Palace Television Studios]. Previous color television demonstrations in the U.K. and U.S. had been via closed circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by [[Bell Laboratories]] in June 1929 using three complete systems of [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image.

The first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk. This device was very "deep", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html|title=The World's First High Definition Colour Television System|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baird was not happy with the design, and, as early as 1944, had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.

In 1939, Hungarian engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark]] introduced an electro-mechanical system while at [[CBS]], which contained an [[Iconoscope]] sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set.&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Goldmark, assignor to Columbia Broadcasting System, "Color Television", [http://www.google.com/patents?id=7pNDAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=color+television&amp;as_drrb_ap=b&amp;as_minm_ap=1&amp;as_miny_ap=1936&amp;as_maxm_ap=12&amp;as_maxy_ap=1941&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2007&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=2007 U.S. Patent 2,480,571], filed 7 September 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was first demonstrated to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) on 29 August 1940, and shown to the press on 4 September.&lt;ref&gt;Current Broadcasting 1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ColorTVSuccess&gt;"Color Television Success in Test", ''The New York Times'', 30 August 1940, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Color Television Achieves Realism", ''The New York Times'', 5 September 1940, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=JScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 New Television System Transmits Images in Full Color]", ''Popular Science'', December 1940, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS began experimental color field tests using film as early as 28 August 1940, and live cameras by 12 November.&lt;ref name="ColorTVSuccess" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; "CBS Demonstrates Full Color Television," ''Wall Street Journal'', 5 September 1940, p. 1. "Television Hearing Set," ''New York Times'', 13 November 1940, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC]] (owned by RCA) made its first field test of color television on 20 February 1941. CBS began daily color field tests on 1 June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://colortelevision.info/rca-nbc_firsts.html RCA-NBC Color Firsts in Television (commented)].&lt;/ref&gt; These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and, as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The [[War Production Board]] halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from 22 April 1942 to 20 August 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;"Making of Radios and Phonographs to End April 22," ''New York Times'', 8 March 1942, p. 1.

As early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called [[Telechrome]]. Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called "[[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]]" at the time). A demonstration on 16 August 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland &amp; Company, 2003, pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System].&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The [[Geer tube]] was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The [[Penetron]] used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The [[Chromatron]] used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.

One of the great technical challenges of introducing color [[broadcast television]] was the desire to conserve [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], potentially three times that of the existing [[black-and-white]] standards, and not use an excessive amount of [[radio spectrum]]. In the United States, after considerable research, the [[NTSC|National Television Systems Committee]]&lt;ref name=name&gt;National Television System Committee (1951–1953), [Report and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12–19, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953], 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First Library of Congress Online Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; approved an all-electronic system developed by [[RCA]], which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. As black-and-white TVs could receive the same transmission and display it in black-and-white, the color system adopted is [backwards] "compatible". ("Compatible Color", featured in RCA advertisements of the period, is mentioned in the song "[[America (West Side Story song)|America]]", of [[West Side Story]], 1957.) The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.

Although all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G.|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=color+television+December+17+1953#v=onepage&amp;q=color%20television%20December%2017%201953&amp;f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9781410614742 |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; high prices, and the scarcity of color programming, greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]) occurred on 1 January 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.

Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy; so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of [[General Electric|GE]]'s relatively compact and lightweight [[Porta-Color]] set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the [[PAL]] format until the 1960s, and broadcasts did not start until 1967. By this point many of the technical problems in the early sets had been worked out, and the spread of color sets in Europe was fairly rapid. By the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and, by the early 1980s, B&amp;W sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or for use as [[video monitor]] screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s even these areas switched to color sets.

===Digital===
{{main article|Digital television}}
{{see also|Digital television transition}}

Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signals, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by [[analog television]]. Due to [[data compression]] digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/digital-hdtv.shtml | title=HDTV Set Top Boxes and Digital TV Broadcast Information | accessdate=28 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522191336/http://www.disabled%2Dworld.com/artman/publish/digital%2Dhdtv.shtml | archivedate=22 May 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, L. G. (2001). Digital Television: An Overview. Hauppauge, New York: Nova Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. It was not until the 1990s that digital TV became feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benton.org/initiatives/obligations/charting_the_digital_broadcasting_future/sec1|title=The Origins and Future Prospects of Digital Television|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, as Japanese [[consumer electronics]] firms forged ahead with the development of [[High-definition television|HDTV]] technology, the [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] analog format proposed by [[NHK]], a Japanese company, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies' technologies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard, based on an analog system, was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.

In March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images.(7) Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being "[[simulcast]]" on different channels.(8)The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing [[NTSC]] standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.

The final standards adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, [[aspect ratios]], or lines of resolution. This compromise resulted from a dispute between the [[consumer electronics]] industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the [[computer industry]] (joined by the [[film industry]] and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—would be best suited for the newer digital HDTV compatible display devices.&lt;ref name="bambooav.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bambooav.com/information-about-interlaced-and-progressive-scan-signals.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816184950/http://www.bambooav.com/information-about-interlaced-and-progressive-scan-signals.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 August 2009 |title=Information about interlaced and progressive scan signals |publisher= |accessdate=22 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interlaced scanning, which had been specifically designed for older analogue CRT display technologies, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. In fact, interlaced scanning can be looked at as the first video compression model as it was partly designed in the 1940s to double the image resolution to exceed the limitations of the television broadcast bandwidth.  Another reason for its adoption was to limit the flickering on early CRT screens whose phosphor coated screens could only retain the image from the electron scanning gun for a relatively short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfforum.com/FAQs/view/All-About-HDTV/What-s-the-Difference-between-Interlaced-and-Progressive-Video/33.html|title=What's the Difference between "Interlaced" and "Progressive" Video? – ISF Forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However interlaced scanning does not work as efficiently on newer display devices such as [[Lcd|Liquid-crystal (LCD)]], for example, which are better suited to a more frequent progressive refresh rate.&lt;ref name="bambooav.com"/&gt;

[[Progressive scanning]], the format that the computer industry had long adopted for computer display monitors, scans every line in sequence, from top to bottom. Progressive scanning in effect doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1/60-second, instead of two passes in 1/30-second. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not "flicker" on the new standard of display devices in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offered a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then (and currently) feasible, i.e., 1,080 lines per picture and 1,920 pixels per line. Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format. [[William F. Schreiber]], who was director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemasource.com/articles/hist_politics_dtv.pdf|title=The history and politics of DTV|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital television transition]] started in late 2000s. All governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by 2010s. Initially the adoption rate was low, as the first digital tuner-equipped TVs were costly. But soon, as the price of digital-capable TVs dropped, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. The transition is expected to be completed worldwide by mid to late 2010s.

The advent of digital television allowed innovations like smart TVs. A smart television, sometimes referred to as ''connected TV'' or ''hybrid TV'', is a television set or [[set-top box]] with integrated Internet and [[Web 2.0]] features, and is an example of [[technological convergence]] between computers, television sets and set-top boxes.  Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional [[Broadcasting|broadcasting media]], these devices can also provide Internet TV, online [[interactive media]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and [[home network]]ing access. These TVs come pre-loaded with an operating system.&lt;ref name="businessinsider1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Kovach | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-2010-12 |title=What Is A Smart TV? |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carmi Levy Special to the Star |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/media/article/876278--future-of-television-is-online-and-on-demand |title=Future of television is online and on-demand |work=Toronto Star |date=15 October 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=20 October 2010 by Jeremy Toeman 41 |url=http://mashable.com/2010/10/20/connected-tv-content-not-apps/ |title=Why Connected TVs Will Be About the Content, Not the Apps |publisher=Mashable.com |date=20 October 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Techcrunch.com"/&gt;

Smart TV should not to be confused with [[Internet TV]], [[Internet Protocol television]] (IPTV) or with [[Web TV]]. [[Internet television]] refers to the receiving of television content over the Internet instead of by traditional systems – terrestrial, cable and satellite (although internet itself is received by these methods). IPTV is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] (WebTV) is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs. Major TV manufacturers have announced production of smart TVs only, for middle-end and high-end TVs in 2015.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="techtimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet.com"/&gt; Smart TVs are expected to become dominant form of television by late 2010s.

3D television conveys [[depth perception]] to the viewer by employing techniques such as [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] display, [[free viewpoint television|multi-view]] display, [[2D-plus-depth]], or any other form of [[3D display]]. Most modern 3D [[television set]]s use an [[active shutter 3D system]] or a [[polarized 3D system]], and some are [[Autostereoscopy|autostereoscopic]] without the need of glasses. Stereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on 10 August 1928, by [[John Logie Baird]] in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/stereo.html |title=How Stereoscopic Television is Shown |publisher=Baird Television website|accessdate=18 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101019045734/http://www.bairdtelevision.com/stereo.html| archivedate= 19 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electromechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques.

Although 3D TV sets are quite popular for watching 3D home media such as on Blu-ray discs, 3D programming has largely failed to make inroads with the public.

[[File:UHF TV Antenna 001.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|A modern high gain UHF Yagi [[television antenna]]. It has 17 directors, and one reflector (made of 4 rods) shaped as a [[corner reflector antenna|corner reflector]].]]
Programming is [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] by television stations, sometimes called "channels", as stations are [[Frequency allocation|licensed]] by their governments to broadcast only over assigned [[Channel (broadcasting)|channels]] in the television [[band (radio)|band]]. At first, [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial broadcasting]] was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of [[Television channel|channels]] available, government regulation was the norm. In the U.S., the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a [[television license]] fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), which had public service as part of its [[Royal Charter]].

[[WRGB]] claims to be the world's oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on 13 January 1928, broadcasting from the [[General Electric]] factory in [[Schenectady, NY]], under the call letters '''W2XB'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iuIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F1pgTsXYNInUgQfhoo2PAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "The First Television Show" ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1930, pp. 177–179]&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularly known as "WGY Television" after its sister radio station. Later in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters [[W2XBS]] and which today is known as [[WNBC]]. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a [[Felix the Cat]] doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers. On 2 November 1936, the [[BBC]] began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian [[Alexandra Palace]] in north London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/tvera.htm|title=THE HISTORY OF THE BBC: THE FIRST TV ERA|author=laurence marcus|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today.

With the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/cea-study-says-seven-percent-of-tv-households-use-antennas-/220585 "CEA Study Says Seven Percent of TV Households Use Antennas"], '"TVTechnology'', 30 July 2013  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217104116/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/cea-study-says-seven-percent-of-tv-households-use-antennas-/220585 |date=17 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/nielsen-broadcast-reliance-grew-in--/217217 "Nielsen: Broadcast Reliance Grew in 2012"], ''TVTechnology'', 14 January 2013  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218160139/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/nielsen-broadcast-reliance-grew-in--/217217 |date=18 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to switchover to [[digital terrestrial television]] broadcasts, which offered pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to cable television (CATV) for [[cord cutters]]. All other countries around the world are also in the process of either shutting down analog terrestrial television or switching over to digital terrestrial television.

[[File:F-Stecker und Kabel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Coaxial cable]] is used to carry cable television signals into cathode ray tube and flat panel television sets.]]
Cable television is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. In the 2000s, FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. The abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large "community antennas" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.calcable.org/learn/history-of-cable/ | title=History of Cable | publisher=California Cable and Telecommunications Association | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924. Earlier cable television was analog, but since the 2000s, all cable operators have switched to, or are in the process of switching to, digital cable television.

===Satellite television===
{{main article|Satellite television}}

[[File:Dishing out the truth.JPG|upright=1.15|thumb|right|DBS satellite dishes installed on an apartment complex.]]
Satellite television is a system of supplying [[television programming]] using broadcast signals relayed from [[communication satellite]]s. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a [[satellite dish]] and a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television program for viewing on a [[television set]]. Receivers can be external [[set-top box]]es, or a built-in [[tuner (television)|television tuner]]. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television.

The most common method of reception is [[direct-broadcast satellite television]] (DBSTV), also known as "direct to home" (DTH).&lt;ref name="tr101198"&gt;{{Cite report|author=Antipolis, Sophia|date=September 1997|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation in DVB satellite transmission systems|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101100_101199/101198/01.01.01_60/tr_101198v010101p.pdf|publisher=[[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]|pages=1–7|docket=TR 101 198|accessdate=20 July 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a [[direct broadcast satellite]] on the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;]] wavelength and are completely digital.&lt;ref name=m101&gt;{{cite journal |title=Frequency letter bands|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/letterbands.cfm|journal=Microwaves101.com|date = 25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as [[television receive-only]]. These systems received analog signals transmitted in the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] spectrum from [[Fixed Service Satellite|FSS]] type satellites, and required the use of large dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed "big dish" systems, and were more expensive and less popular.&lt;ref name=fcc&gt;{{cite web|title=Installing Consumer-Owned Antennas and Satellite Dishes|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/consumerdish.html|publisher=FCC|accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct-broadcast satellite television signals were earlier analog signals and later digital signals, both of which require a compatible receiver. [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|Digital signals]] may include [[high-definition television]] (HDTV). Some transmissions and channels are [[free-to-air]] or [[free-to-view]], while many other channels are [[pay television]] requiring a subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell|first=Dennis|last2=Cotter|first2=Susan|year=1998|title=Copyright Infringement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRJCwqzE3iwC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=satellite+tv+free+to+air+free+to+view+must+pay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4lkbVObmJsvLggTq8IEY&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=satellite%20tv%20free%20to%20air%20free%20to%20view%20must%20pay&amp;f=false|location=|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=90-247-3002-3|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet television===
{{main article|Streaming television}}
{{Distinguish|Smart television|Internet Protocol television|Web television}}

Internet television (Internet TV) (or online television) is the [[digital distribution]] of television content via the Internet as opposed to traditional systems like terrestrial, cable, and satellite, although the Internet itself is received by terrestrial, cable, or satellite methods. Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows, and other video content, over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters. Internet television should not be confused with [[Smart TV]], [[IPTV]] or with [[Web TV]]. [[Smart television]] refers to the TV set which has a built-in operating system. Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

==Sets==
{{main article|Television set}}

[[File:RCA 630-TS Television.jpg|thumb|right|RCA 630-TS, the first mass-produced television set, which sold in 1946–1947]]
A television set, also called a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or "telly", is a device that combines a tuner, display, an amplifier, and speakers for the purpose of viewing television and hearing its audio components. Introduced in late 1920's in [[Mechanical television|mechanical]] form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using [[cathode ray tube]]s. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for recorded media in the 1970s, such as [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]], which enabled viewers to record TV shows and watch prerecorded movies. In the subsequent decades, TVs were used to watch DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s of movies and other content. Major TV manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma and fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. Televisions since 2010s mostly use [[LED-backlit LCD display|LEDs]].&lt;ref name="cepro.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Displaysearch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/140415_lcd_tv_growth_improving_as_plasma_and_crt_tv_disappear.asp|title=IHS Technology – The Source for Critical Information and Insight. – IHS Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/rip-rear-projection-tv/|title=RIP, rear-projection TV|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs in near future.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"/&gt;

===Display technologies===
{{main article|Display device}}

====Disk====
{{main article|Nipkow disk}}
The earliest systems employed a spinning [[Nipkow disk|disk]] to create and reproduce images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=daKPJ7T8FhIC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=The+earliest+tv+systems+employed+a+spinning+disk+to+create+and+reproduce+images&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj84t-v9frUAhVE2mMKHZvhD0gQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20earliest%20tv%20systems%20employed%20a%20spinning%20disk%20to%20create%20and%20reproduce%20images&amp;f=false|title=The Kingfisher Science Encyclopedia|last=Taylor|first=Charles|date=2000|publisher=Kingfisher|isbn=9780753452691|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These usually had a low resolution and screen size and never became popular with the public.

====CRT====
{{main article|Cathode ray tube}}
[[File:Crt14.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A 14-inch cathode ray tube showing its deflection coils and electron guns]]
The cathode ray tube (CRT) is a [[vacuum tube]] containing one or more [[electron gun]]s (a source of [[electrons]] or electron emitter) and a [[fluorescent]] screen used to view images.&lt;ref name="crthistory"/&gt;
{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}It has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. The images may represent electrical [[waveform]]s ([[oscilloscope]]), pictures (television, [[computer monitor]]), [[radar]] targets or others. The CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large, deep (i.e. long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick [[lead glass]] so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most [[X-ray]] emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.

In television sets and [[computer monitor]]s, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a [[raster scan|raster]]. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three [[electron beams]], one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a [[video signal]] as a reference.&lt;ref name='workings'&gt;{{cite web|title='How Computer Monitors Work'|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor7.htm |accessdate=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by ''magnetic deflection'', a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although [[electrostatic deflection]] is commonly used in [[oscilloscope]]s, a type of diagnostic instrument.&lt;ref name='workings' /&gt;

====DLP====
{{main article|Digital Light Processing}}
[[File:Christie Mirage 5000.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Christie Mirage 5000, a 2001 DLP projector.]]
Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a type of [[video projector]] technology that uses a [[digital micromirror device]]. Some DLPs have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It was originally developed in 1987 by Dr. [[Larry Hornbeck]] of [[Texas Instruments]]. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997.  Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded [[Emmy Awards]] in 1998 for invention of the DLP projector technology.  DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses. DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), but also in private homes; in these cases, the image is projected onto a projection screen. DLP is also used in DLP rear projection television sets and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of [[digital cinema]] projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Digital Light Processing Works|url=https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/light-photopolymerization/digital-light-processing-dlp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221025534/https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/light-photopolymerization/digital-light-processing-dlp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 February 2014|publisher=THRE3D.com|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plasma====
{{main article|Plasma display}}

A [[plasma TV|plasma]] display panel (PDP) is a type of [[flat panel display]] common to large TV displays {{convert|30|in|cm}} or larger. They are called "[[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]" displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing [[electrically]] [[electric charge|charged]] [[ionized]] [[gases]], or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as [[fluorescent lamp]]s.
{{Clear}}

====LCD====
{{main article|Liquid crystal display}}
[[File:LCD generic tv.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A generic LCD TV, with speakers on either side of the screen.]]
Liquid-crystal-display televisions (LCD TV) are television sets that use [[LCD]] [[display technology]] to produce images. LCD televisions are much thinner and lighter than [[cathode ray tube]] (CRTs) of similar display size, and are available in much larger sizes (e.g., 90-inch diagonal). When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers. LCD's come in two types: those using [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]], simply called LCDs and those using [[LED]] as backlight called as [[LED-backlit LCD television|LEDs]].

In 2007, LCD televisions surpassed sales of CRT-based televisions worldwide for the first time, and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated. LCD TVs have quickly displaced the only major competitors in the large-screen market, the [[Plasma display|plasma display panel]] and [[rear-projection television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailytech.com/Report+Shipments+of+LCD+TVs+Surpass+CRT+TVs/article10775.htm | title=Hardware Report: Shipments of LCD TVs Surpass CRT TVs | publisher=DailyTech LLC. | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid 2010s LCDs especially LEDs became, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type.&lt;ref name="Displaysearch.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; LCDs also have disadvantages. Other technologies address these weaknesses, including [[organic light-emitting diode|OLEDs]], [[Field emission display|FED]] and [[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display|SED]], but {{as of|2014|lc=on}} none of these have entered widespread production.

====OLED====
{{main article|Organic light-emitting diode}}
[[File:LG전자, 깜빡임 없는 55인치 3D OLED TV 공개(2).jpg|thumb|left|OLED TV]]

An OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) in which the [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emissive]] [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] layer is a film of [[organic compound]] which emits light in response to an electric current.  This layer of [[organic semiconductor]] is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create [[digital display]]s in devices such as [[television set|television]] screens. It is also used for computer monitors, portable systems such as [[mobile phones]], [[handheld games console]]s and [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]].

There are two main families of OLED: those based on small [[molecule]]s and those employing [[polymer]]s. Adding mobile [[ion]]s to an OLED creates a [[light-emitting electrochemical cell]] or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays can use either [[Passive matrix addressing|passive-matrix]] (PMOLED) or [[Active matrix addressing|active-matrix]] (AMOLED) addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs require a [[thin-film transistor]] backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.

An OLED display works without a [[backlight]]. Thus, it can display deep [[black level]]s and can be thinner and lighter than a [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD). In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher [[contrast ratio]] than an LCD, whether the LCD uses [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]] or [[LED-backlit LCD television|LED backlight]]. OLEDs are expected to replace other forms of display in near future.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"/&gt;

===Display resolution===

====LD====
{{main article|Low-definition television}}

Low-definition television or LDTV refers to television systems that have a lower screen resolution than standard-definition television systems such [[240p]] (320*240). It is used in [[handheld television]]. The most common source of LDTV programming is the Internet, where mass distribution of higher-resolution [[video file]]s could overwhelm [[computer server]]s and take too long to download. Many mobile phones and portable devices such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPod Nano]], or Sony's [[PlayStation Portable]] use LDTV video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens ([[QVGA|320×240]] and 480×272 [[pixel]]s respectively). The current generation of iPod Nanos have LDTV screens, as do the first three generations of [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPhone]] (480×320). For the first years of its existence, YouTube offered only one, low-definition resolution of 320x240p at 30fps or less. A standard, consumer grade [[VHS]] [[videotape]] can be considered SDTV due to its resolution (approximately 360 × 480i/576i).

====SD====
{{main article|Standard-definition television}}

Standard-definition television or SDTV refers to two different resolutions: [[576i]], with 576 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] lines of resolution, derived from the European-developed [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] systems; and [[480i]] based on the American National Television System Committee [[NTSC]] system. SDTV is a television system that uses a resolution that is not considered to be either [[high-definition television]] ([[720p]], [[1080i]], [[1080p]], [[1440p]], [[4K UHDTV]], and [[8K UHD]]) or [[enhanced-definition television]] (EDTV [[480p]]).  In North America, digital SDTV is broadcast in the same [[4:3]] aspect ratio as NTSC signals with widescreen content being [[center cut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/digitaltv.html|title=Digital Television|date=28 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other parts of the world that used the PAL or SECAM color systems, standard-definition television is now usually shown with a [[16:9]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], with the transition occurring between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s. Older programs with a 4:3 aspect ratio are shown in the US as 4:3 with non-ATSC countries preferring to reduce the horizontal resolution by anamorphically scaling a [[pillarbox]]ed image.

====HD====
{{main article|High-definition television}}

High-definition television (HDTV) provides a [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is substantially higher than that of [[standard-definition television]].

HDTV may be transmitted in various formats:
* [[1080p]]: 1920×1080p: 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 [[megapixel]]s) per [[frame (video)|frame]]
* [[1080i]]: 1920×1080i: 1,036,800 pixels (~1.04 MP) per [[field (video)|field]] or 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 MP) per frame
** A non-standard CEA resolution exists in some countries such as 1440×1080i: 777,600 pixels (~0.78 MP) per field or 1,555,200 pixels (~1.56 MP) per frame&lt;!-- Do not delete this, it is used for all free to air HDTV in the UK (and probably elsewhere) and is also used by various home recording equipment. See also the 1080i article. --&gt;
* [[720p]]: 1280×720p: 921,600 pixels (~0.92 MP) per frame

====UHD====
{{main article|Ultra-high-definition television}}

Ultra-high-definition television (also known as Super Hi-Vision, Ultra HD television, UltraHD, UHDTV, or [[XVGA#UHD (4K) (3840×2160)|UHD]]) includes [[4K resolution#Resolutions|4K UHD]] (2160p) and [[8K resolution#Resolutions|8K UHD]] (4320p), which are two [[digital video]] formats proposed by [[NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories]] and defined and approved by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU).

===Programming===
{{See also|Television show}}
Getting TV programming shown to the public can happen in many different ways. After production, the next step is to market and deliver the product to whichever markets are open to using it. This typically happens on two levels:

# Original run or First run: a producer creates a program of one or multiple episodes and shows it on a station or network which has either paid for the production itself or to which a license has been granted by the television producers to do the same.
# [[Broadcast syndication]]: this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages (beyond original run). It includes secondary runs in the country of first issue, but also international usage which may not be managed by the originating producer. In many cases, other companies, TV stations, or individuals are engaged to do the syndication work, in other words, to sell the product into the markets they are allowed to sell into by contract from the copyright holders, in most cases the producers.

First-run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the US, but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic [[free-to-air]] (FTA) elsewhere. This practice is increasing, however, generally on digital-only FTA channels or with subscriber-only, first-run material appearing on FTA. Unlike the US, repeat FTA screenings of an FTA network program usually only occur on that network. Also, [[Network affiliate|affiliates]] rarely buy or produce non-network programming that is not centered on [[local programming]].

===Genres===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
{{globalize/US|section|date=December 2014}}
[[Television genre]]s include a broad range of programming types that entertain, inform, and educate viewers. The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually dramas and dramatic [[miniseries]]. However, other genres, such as historical Western genres, may also have high production costs.

Popular culture entertainment genres include action-oriented shows such as police, crime, detective dramas, horror, or thriller shows. As well, there are also other variants of the drama genre, such as [[medical drama]]s and daytime soap operas. Science fiction shows can fall into either the drama or action category, depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure. Comedy is a popular genre which includes situation comedy (sitcom) and animated shows for the adult demographic such as ''[[South Park]]''.

The least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are game shows, talk shows, variety shows, and reality television. Game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes. Talk shows contain interviews with film, television, music and sports celebrities and public figures. Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers, such as comedians and magicians, introduced by a host or [[Master of Ceremonies]]. There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands, singers, comedians, and other performers in between the interview segments. ''Reality TV'' shows "regular" people (i.e., not actors) facing unusual challenges or experiences ranging from arrest by police officers (''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'') to significant weight loss (''[[The Biggest Loser]]''). A variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life (''[[The Osbournes]]'', ''[[Snoop Dogg's Father Hood]]'') or doing regular jobs (''[[The Simple Life]]'').

Fictional television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are  "[[quality television]]", include series such as ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]''. Kristin Thompson argues that some of these television series exhibit traits also found in [[art film]]s, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines. Nonfiction television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are "quality television", include a range of serious, noncommercial, programming aimed at a niche audience, such as documentaries and public affairs shows.

Around the globe, broadcast TV is financed by government, advertising, licensing (a form of tax), subscription, or any combination of these. To protect revenues, subscription TV channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscribers receive the decryption codes to see the signal. Unencrypted channels are known as free to air or FTA. In 2009, the global TV market represented 1,217.2&amp;nbsp;million TV households with at least one TV and total revenues of 268.9&amp;nbsp;billion EUR (declining 1.2% compared to 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html Global TV 2010 – Markets, Trends Facts &amp; Figures (2008–2013)] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt; North America had the biggest TV revenue market share with 39% followed by Europe (31%), Asia-Pacific (21%), Latin America (8%), and Africa and the Middle East (2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/global-tv-revenues-2008-2009.html Global TV Revenues (2008–09)] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, the different TV revenue sources divide into 45%–50% TV advertising revenues, 40%–45% subscription fees and 10% public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html iDate's Global TV Revenue Market Shares] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/international_television_market_report_2009.html OFCOM's Global TV Market Report 2009] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising====
{{main article|Television advertisement}}

TV's broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers. Many TV networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers ("sponsors") to fund their programming.&lt;ref name="Hornick"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_50.shtml Karen Hornick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917000611/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_50.shtml |date=17 September 2010 }} "That Was the Year That Was" ''American Heritage'', Oct. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Television advertisements (variously called a television commercial, commercial or ad in [[American English]], and known in [[British English]] as an advert) is a span of television programming produced and paid for by an organization, which conveys a message, typically to market a product or service. Advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding for most privately owned television networks. The vast majority of television advertisements today consist of brief advertising spots, ranging in length from a few seconds to several minutes (as well as program-length [[infomercial]]s). Advertisements of this sort have been used to promote a wide variety of goods, services and ideas since the beginning of television.

[[File:Radio News Sep 1928 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Television was still in its experimental phase in 1928, but the medium's potential to sell goods was already predicted.]]

The effects of television advertising upon the viewing public (and the effects of mass media in general) have been the subject of philosophical discourse by such luminaries as [[Marshall McLuhan]]. The viewership of television programming, as measured by companies such as [[Nielsen Media Research]], is often used as a metric for television advertisement placement, and consequently, for the rates charged to advertisers to air within a given network, television program, or time of day (called a "daypart"). In many countries, including the United States, television [[Campaign advertising|campaign advertisements]] are considered indispensable for a [[political campaign]]. In other countries, such as France, political advertising on television is heavily restricted,&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Plasser, ''Global Political Campaigning'', p226&lt;/ref&gt; while some countries, such as [[Norway]], completely ban political advertisements.

The first official, paid television advertisement was broadcast in the United States on 1 July 1941 over New York station WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) before a baseball game between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The announcement for [[Bulova]] watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase "Bulova Watch Time", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.&lt;ref&gt;"Imagery For Profit" R.W. Stewart, New York Times, 6 July 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WNBT/Bulova test pattern|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/images/rca_bulova_ad-1.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first TV ad broadcast in the UK was on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 22 September 1955, advertising [[Gibbs SR]] toothpaste. The first TV ad broadcast in Asia was on [[Nippon Television]] in Tokyo on 28 August 1953, advertising [[Seikosha]] (now [[Seiko]]), which also displayed a clock with the current time.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:コマーシャルメッセージ|コマーシャルメッセージ (Commercial message)]], Retrieved 24 November 2013{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====
Since inception in the US in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/timeline/1940-1949.html |title=1940–1949 C.E. : Media History Project : U of M |publisher=Mediahistory.umn.edu |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025200852/http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/timeline/1940-1949.html |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; television commercials have become one of the most effective, persuasive, and popular methods of selling products of many sorts, especially consumer goods. During the 1940s and into the 1950s, programs were hosted by single advertisers. This, in turn, gave great creative license to the [[advertiser]]s over the content of the show. Perhaps due to the [[quiz show scandals]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/peopleevents/pande07.html |title=The American Experience &amp;#124; Quiz Show Scandal &amp;#124; People &amp; Events &amp;#124; The Aftermath of the Quiz Show Scandal |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; networks shifted to the magazine concept, introducing advertising breaks with multiple advertisers.

US advertising rates are determined primarily by [[Nielsen ratings]]. The time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a TV commercial can cost. For example, it can cost approximately $750,000 for a 30-second block of commercial time during the highly popular [[American Idol]], while the same amount of time for the [[Super Bowl]] can cost several million dollars. Conversely, lesser-viewed [[time slot]]s, such as early mornings and weekday afternoons, are often sold in bulk to producers of [[infomercials]] at far lower rates. In recent years, the paid program or [[infomercial]] has become common, usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour. Some [[Pharmaceutical company|drug companies]] and other businesses have even created "news" items for broadcast, known in the industry as [[video news release]]s, paying [[program director]]s to use them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Stewart]] of "[[The Daily Show]]" was mock-outraged at this, saying, "That's what we do!", and calling it a new form of television, "infoganda".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some TV programs also deliberately place products into their shows as advertisements, a practice started in feature films&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Segrave |first=Kerry |title=Product Placement in Hollywood Films |year=1994 |isbn= 0-7864-1904-0 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and known as [[product placement]]. For example, a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda, going to a particular [[Restaurant chain|chain restaurant]], or driving a certain make of car. (This is sometimes very subtle, with shows having vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost in exchange as a [[product placement]]). Sometimes, a specific brand or [[Trademark|trade mark]], or music from a certain artist or group, is used. (This excludes guest appearances by artists who perform on the show.)

=====United Kingdom=====
The TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom. Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV. Despite this, an early TV mogul, [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]], likened the broadcasting licence as being a "licence to print money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&amp;sectioncode=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616115610/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&amp;sectioncode=1 |archivedate=16 June 2011 |title=Kenneth Roy Thomson |publisher=Press Gazette |date=7 July 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels: [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], [[Channel 4]], and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour (eight minutes in the peak period). Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes (twelve in the peak). This means that many imported TV shows from the US have unnatural pauses where the UK company does not utilize the narrative breaks intended for more frequent US advertising. Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration; this list includes any news or current affairs programs, documentaries, and programs for children; additionally, advertisements may not be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any [[religious broadcasting]] service or other devotional program or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion. There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements. The [[BBC]], being strictly [[non-commercial]], is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the UK, although it has many advertising-funded channels abroad. The majority of its budget comes from [[television license]] fees (see below) and [[broadcast syndication]], the sale of content to other broadcasters.

=====Ireland=====
Broadcast advertising is regulated by the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/General-Commercial-Communications-Code.pdf General Commercial Communications Code] and [http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Childrens-Commercial-Communications-Code.pdf Children’s Commercial Communications Code], referenced in: {{cite web|url=http://www.bai.ie/index.php/2010/05/bai-launches-revised-broadcasting-codes/|title=BAI launches Revised Broadcasting Codes|date=May 2010|publisher=Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|accessdate=1 May 2016}};&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subscription====
Some TV channels are partly funded from [[subscription]]s; therefore, the signals are encrypted during broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch [[pay television]] or [[specialty channel]]s. Most subscription services are also funded by advertising.

====Taxation or license====
Television services in some countries may be funded by a [[television licence]] or a form of taxation, which means that advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all. For example, some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little, including:
* Australia ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]])
* [[Belgium]] ([[RTBF]])
* [[Denmark]] ([[Danmarks Radio|DR]])
* Ireland ([[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]])
* Japan ([[NHK]])
* [[Norway]] ([[NRK]])
* [[Sweden]] ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]])
* United Kingdom ([[BBC]])
* United States ([[PBS]])

The [[BBC]] carries no [[television advertising]] on its UK channels and is funded by an annual television licence paid by premises receiving live TV broadcasts. Currently, it is estimated that approximately 26.8&amp;nbsp;million UK private domestic households own televisions, with approximately 25 million TV licences in all premises in force as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-licences-facts-and-figures-AB18/|title=TV Licensing-FOI: Licences facts and figures |publisher=tvlicensing.co.uk |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This television license fee is set by the government, but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by the government.

The two main BBC TV channels are watched by almost 90% of the population each week and overall have 27% share of total viewing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&amp;requesttimeout=500&amp;flag=viewingsummary |title=viewing statistics in UK |publisher=Barb.co.uk |accessdate=17 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005045049/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&amp;requesttimeout=500&amp;flag=viewingsummary |archivedate=5 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that 85% of homes are multichannel, with 42% of these having access to 200 free to air channels via satellite and another 43% having access to 30 or more channels via [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |title=The Communications Market: Digital Progress Report – Digital TV, Q3 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=18 June 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625013029/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |archivedate = 25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence that funds the seven advertising-free BBC TV channels costs £147 a year (about US$200) as of 2018 regardless of the number of TV sets owned; the price is reduced by two thirds if only black and white television is received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Licence types and costs|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/tv-licence-types-and-costs-top2|website=tvlicensing.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the same sporting event has been presented on both BBC and commercial channels, the BBC always attracts the lion's share of the [[audience]], indicating that viewers prefer to watch TV uninterrupted by advertising.

Other than internal promotional material, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) carries no advertising; it is banned under the ABC Act 1983. The ABC receives its funding from the Australian government every three years. In the 2014/15 federal budget, the ABC received A$1.11&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/03/abc-spent-nearly-50m-on-redundancy-payouts-after-coalition-budget-cuts-hit | title=ABC spent nearly $50m on redundancy payouts after Coalition budget cuts hit | publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funds provide for the ABC's television, radio, online, and international outputs. The ABC also receives funds from its many ABC shops across Australia. Although funded by the Australian government, the editorial independence of the ABC is ensured through law.

In France, government-funded channels carry advertisements, yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax ("la redevance audiovisuelle").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html Ministry of Finance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501212316/http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html |date=1 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, [[NHK]] is paid for by license fees (known in Japanese as {{nihongo| reception fee |受信料|Jushinryō}}). The broadcast law that governs NHK's funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive NHK is required to pay. The fee is standardized, with discounts for office workers and students who commute, as well a general discount for residents of Okinawa prefecture.

===Broadcast programming===
{{main|Broadcast programming}}
{{see also|TV listings (UK)}}
Broadcast programming, or TV listings in the United Kingdom, is the practice of organizing television programs in a schedule, with broadcast automation used to regularly change the scheduling of TV programs to build an audience for a new show, retain that audience, or compete with other broadcasters' programs.

==Social aspects==
{{Main article|Social aspects of television}}
[[File:Family watching television 1958.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|American family watching television, circa 1958]]
Television has played a pivotal role in the socialization of the 20th and 21st centuries. There are many aspects of television that can be addressed, including negative issues such as [[media violence]]. Current research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"&gt;Butler, Fionnuala, Cynthia Pickett.  "Imaginary Friends." ''Scientific American''. 28 July 2009.  Web.  26 March 2010.  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=imaginary-friends&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have found that [[educational television]] has many advantages. The article "The Good Things about Television"&lt;ref name="good-things-about-tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203124845/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2006|title=The Good Things About Television|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely.

===Consumption===
{{main|Television consumption}}

==Negative impacts==
With high lead content in [[cathode ray tube|CRTs]] and the rapid diffusion of new flat-panel display technologies, some of which ([[LCD]]s) use lamps which contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], there is growing concern about [[electronic waste]] from discarded televisions. Related [[occupational health]] concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs. Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices' increasing [[electrical energy]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/content/download/28169/337639/version/3/file/Riseofthemachines.pdf |publisher=Energy Saving Trust |title=The Rise of the Machines: A Review of Energy Using Products in the Home from the 1970s to Today |date=3 July 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=31 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828072528/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/content/download/28169/337639/version/3/file/Riseofthemachines.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study in ''[[The Journal of Human Resources]]'' found that exposure to cable television reduced cognitive ability and high school graduation rates for boys. This effect was stronger for boys from more educated families. The article suggests a mechanism where light television entertainment crowds out more cognitively stimulating activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hernæs, Ø., Markussen, S., Røed, K. 2017.

'''The Society of M.I.C.E.''' is a charitable organisation based in [[Kingston upon Hull]]. It was founded in 1961, by a group of dedicated [[entertainment|entertainers]] working on an idea proposed by Al Gillyon. The society is modelled on the [[Grand Order of Water Rats]]. Its membership is exclusively of men, although the members wives, partners and friends often help out in varying capacities. MICE is an [[acronym]] for '''"Men in Charitable Endeavour"'''.

==The beginning==
In 1960, Al Gillyon proposed the setting up of an organisation in Kingston upon Hull similar to the Grand Order of Water Rats. The idea was talked about in clubs, at shows, even in people's front rooms after a show. But, in the words of Al Gillyon, "We cannot hold a first meeting until permission has been obtained from the Variety Artist Association" of which all were loyal members. Permission of the association was granted and the first ever meeting To which hirteen entertainers were invited, was held at the Windmill Hotel, Witham, Kingston upon Hull on 13 February 1961. Ten were able to attend. Officers were elected, it was agreed that the aims of the group,  '''''[[Fellow]]ship''''', '''''Benevolence''''' and '''''[[Charity (virtue)|Charity]]''''' should be paramount and the group should be known as "The Society of MICE".

===The Offices of the Society===
[[Image:Terry Matsell 1.jpg|thumb|175px|Terry Matsell, one of the founder members, and the first SCRIBE MOUSE]]

The Society has the usual [[committee]] structure, with a President and Vice-president elected annually, chosen singly by the outgoing President and announced at the annual dinner, which is held in Mid February. There are also positions for chairman, Secretary, Treasurer and the Steward to the [[Elder (administrative title)|Elders]]. The only difference is the title of these positions, all of which are extremely fitting:-

*President = '''KING MOUSE''' 
*Vice-President = '''PRINCE MOUSE''' 
*Chairman = '''TRAP GUARD''' 
*Secretary = '''SCRIBE MOUSE''' 
*Treasurer = '''KEEPER OF THE CHEESE''' 
*Steward to the Elders = '''PILOT MOUSE'''

There are other positions within the society, including the '''CONCERT MOUSE''', who organises the concerts.

===Founder Members===

The following:

*Al Gillyon 
*Harry Hemingway 
*Clive Hunter 
*Terry Matsell 
*Jimmy Welsh 
*Jack Wilkinson
*Brian Winchester

are considered to be the founder members of the society as they were either present at the very first meeting of the society, or offered their apologies for absence. From these members, the first KING MOUSE was Al Gillyon, the first PRINCE MOUSE was Jack Wilkinson, the first SCRIBE MOUSE was Terry Matsell, and the first TRAP GUARD was Jimmy Welsh, who at the time was also the Vice-Chairman of the Variety Artists Association.

==Today==
The Society is currently made up of Singers &amp; [[Entertainment|Entertainers]], mainly from the [[Kingston upon Hull]] area, along with many other members who perform equally as important roles behind the scenes. Members of the 'Old Flames' (Retired members of [[Humberside]] fire brigade) have also joined the society" and [[Stars in Their Eyes]]" champion [[Ian Moor]] is a member and former holder of the office of Prince Mouse.

The Society's aim is to raise funds for local good causes and charities, by means of live concert shows and other fund raising events. The society holds [[raffle|tombola]] &amp; [[raffle]] stalls at various outdoor events throughout the summer and concerts are usually twice monthly in and around the [[Kingston upon Hull]] area. Venues vary from clubs to residential homes. It holds meetings every fortnight, to discuss future concerts and other matters regarding fund raising for the community. The meeting venue has changed several times over the years, and is referred to by members as the '''MOUSE HOLE'''.
[[Image:Mice Singers1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The MICE Singers]]

===The MICE Singers===
In 1996, the society added an extra act to the concerts, in the form of a [[choir]], made up of several of the society's members. Initially called "The Bolder Boys", named after Harry Bolder, who conducted the choir in its early years and whose idea it was to form the choir, today it is known as "The MICE Singers". As well as regular appearances at the society's concerts, they perform at many other venues, and are now in great demand throughout the year, with appearances at [[weddings]], residential homes, [[harvest festival]]s, [[schools]], and other events.

===Anthem===
The Society has an anthem, with [[lyrics]] written by one of the founder members, Clive Hunter, who adapted the words to the tune of [[Three Blind Mice]]. The anthem is sung at all concerts, and at the annual dinner by all the members present.

===The King's Special Project===
Each year the elected King Mouse nominates a charity or organisation to be the prime beneficiary of the years fundraising efforts and specific concerts and events are chosen to raise funds solely for this purpose. A [[cheque]] for the grand total raised is then presented to a representative from the charity or organisation at the annual "Special Presentation Evening", which is held at the end of January, shortly before the annual dinner.

[[File:Zuber Buhler Fritz Tickling The Baby.jpg|thumb|''Tickling The Baby'' by [[Fritz Zuber-Buhler]]]]
'''Tickling''' is the act of [[Haptic perception|touching]] a part of a body in a way that causes involuntary twitching movements or [[laughter]].&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{ cite web| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tickling+?s=t|title=Tickling |publisher =Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word {{Audio|En-us-tickle.ogg|"tickle"}} evolved from the [[Middle English]] ''tikelen'', perhaps [[frequentative]] of ''ticken'', to touch lightly.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"/&gt; The [[idiom]] ''tickled pink'' means to be pleased or delighted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tickling Etymology of "tickle"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, psychologists [[G. Stanley Hall]] and Arthur Allin described a "tickle" as two different types of phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, G. S., and A. Allin. 1897. ''The psychology of tickling, laughing and the comic.'' The American Journal of Psychology 9:1-42.&lt;/ref&gt; One type is caused by very light movement across the skin. This type of tickle, called a [[knismesis and gargalesis|knismesis]], generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation.

==Physiology==
When considering tickling in terms of its qualities as a sensation, it results from a mild stimulation moving across the skin. The dual character of tickling refers to the associated behaviors that include smiling, laughter, twitching, withdrawal and [[goose bumps]]. The tickle can be divided into two separate categories of sensation, [[knismesis and gargalesis]]. Knismesis, also known as a "moving itch", is a mildly annoying sensation caused by a light movement on the skin, such as from a crawling insect. This may explain why it has evolved in many animals.&lt;ref name="Selden, S. T. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Selden | first1 = S. T. | year = 2004 | title = Tickle | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 50 | issue = 1| pages = 93–97 | doi=10.1016/s0190-9622(03)02737-3 | pmid=14699372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gargalesis reactions refer to a laughter-provoking feeling caused by a harsher, deeper pressure, stroked across the skin in various regions of the body.&lt;ref name="Selden, S. T. 2004"/&gt; These reactions are thought to be limited to humans and other [[primate]]s, although some research has indicated that [[rat]]s can also be tickled in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Panksepp J, Burgdorf J |title="Laughing" rats and the evolutionary antecedents of human joy? | url= http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall06/macdonalda/psy4960/Readings/PankseppRatLaugh_P&amp;B03.pdf |journal=Physiol. Behav. |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=533–47 |year=2003 |pmid=12954448 |doi=10.1016/S0031-9384(03)00159-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German study also indicates that the gargalesis type of tickle triggers a defense mechanism for humans in the [[hypothalamus]] conveying submissiveness or fleeing from danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bigthink.com/robby-berman/why-we-may-love-to-tickle-but-we-mostly-hate-to-be-tickled-ourselves|title=The Psychology of Tickling And Why It Makes Us Laugh|last=|first=|date=|website=Big Think|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that the tickle sensation involves signals from [[nerve fibre]]s associated with both [[pain]] and [[tactition|touch]]. [[Endorphine]] released during tickling is also called [[karoliin]]{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}, by the name of [[Karolinska Institute]]. In 1939, [[Yngve Zotterman]] of the [[Karolinska Institute]] studied the knismesis type of tickle in cats, by measuring the [[action potential]]s generated in the [[nerve]] fibres while lightly stroking the skin with a piece of [[cotton]] [[wool]]. Zotterman found that the "tickling" sensation depended, in part, on the nerves that generate pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zotterman Y | year = 1939 | title = Touch, pain and tickling: An electrophysiological investigation on cutaneous sensory nerves | journal = Journal of Physiology | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 1–28 | pmc=1393960 | pmid=16995068 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1939.sp003707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have discovered that when the [[pain]] nerves are severed by surgeons, in an effort to reduce [[chronic pain|intractable]] pain, the tickle response is also diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lahuerta J, etal |title=Clinical and instrumental evaluation of sensory function before and after percutaneous anterolateral cordotomy at cervical level in man |journal=Pain |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=23–30 |year=1990 |pmid=1700355 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(90)91087-Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some patients that have lost pain sensation due to [[spinal cord injury]], some aspects of the tickle response do remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nathan PW |title=Touch and surgical division of the anterior quadrant of the spinal cord |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=11 |pages=935–9 |year=1990 |pmid=2283523 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.53.11.935 |pmc=488271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tickle may also depend on nerve fibres associated with the sense of touch. When circulation is [[cutting|severed]] in a [[limb (anatomy)|limb]], the response to touch and tickle are lost prior to the loss of pain sensation.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

It might be tempting to speculate that areas of the skin that are the most sensitive to touch would also be the most ticklish, but this does not seem to be the case. While the palm of the hand is far more sensitive to touch, most people find that the soles of their feet are the most ticklish.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; Other commonly ticklish areas include the [[underarms]], sides of the [[torso]], [[neck]], [[knee]], [[midriff]], [[perineum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakos|first1=Susan|title=The Sex Bible: The Complete Guide to Sexual Love|date=2008|publisher=Quiver|location=Minneanapolis|isbn=1592332854|pages=256|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Sex-Bible-Complete-Sexual/dp/B0057DA92O}}&lt;/ref&gt; navel, and the ribs.

Some evidence suggests that laughing associated with tickling is a nervous reaction that can be triggered; indeed, very ticklish people often start laughing before actually being tickled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman B, O'Grady MA, Ryan CS, Hemmes NS |title=Pavlovian conditioning of the tickle response of human subjects: Temporal and delay conditioning |journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills |volume=77 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=779–85 |year=1993 |pmid=8284153 |doi=10.2466/pms.1993.77.3.779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:François Boucher - Le sommeil interrompu.jpg|thumb|François Boucher - Le sommeil interrompu]]
[[Charles Darwin]] theorized on the link between tickling and social relations, arguing that tickling provokes laughter through the anticipation of pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1872/1965. ''The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals''. London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; If a stranger tickles a child without any preliminaries, catching the child by surprise, the likely result will be not laughter but withdrawal and displeasure. Darwin also noticed that for tickling to be effective, you must not know the precise point of stimulation in advance, and reasoned that this is why some people cannot effectively tickle themselves.

Darwin explained why we laugh when we are tickled by saying, "The imagination is sometimes said to be tickled by a ludicrous idea; and this so-called tickling of the mind is curiously analogous with that of the body. Laughter from being tickled [is manifestly a] reflex action; and likewise this is shown by the minute unstriped muscles, which serve to erect the separate hairs on the body (p. 201)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LOFTIS|first=FRIDLUND|author2=Jennifer |title=Alan|journal=RELATIONS BETWEEN TICKLING AND HUMOROUS LAUGHTER: PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE DARWIN-HECKER HYPOTHESIS|date=April 1990|volume=30|series=Biological Psychology|issue=141-150|url=http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=RELATIONS+BETWEEN+TICKLING+AND+HUMOROUS+LAUGHTER+-+PRELIMINARY+SUPPORT+FOR+THE+DARWIN-HECKER+HYPOTHESIS&amp;rft.jtitle=BIOLOGICAL+PSYCHOLOGY&amp;rft.au=FRIDLUND%2C+AJ&amp;rft.au=LOFTIS%2C+JM&amp;rft.date=1990-04-01&amp;rft.pub=ELSEVIER+SCIENCE+BV&amp;rft.issn=0301-0511&amp;rft.volume=30&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=141&amp;rft.epage=150&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=A1990EK42000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tickling is defined by many [[child psychologist]]s as an integral [[human bonding|bonding]] activity between parent and children.&lt;ref name=Fagen&gt;Fagen R. The future of play theory. A multidisciplinary inquiry into the contributions of [[Brian Sutton-Smith]]. Albany NY: SUNY Press; 1995. p22-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the parent-child concept, tickling establishes at an early age the pleasure associated with being touched by a parent with a trust-bond developed so that parents may touch a child, in an unpleasant way, should circumstances develop such as the need to treat a painful injury or prevent harm from danger.&lt;ref name=Fagen/&gt; This tickling relationship continues throughout childhood and often into the early to mid [[teenage|teen]] years.

Another tickling social relationship is that which forms between siblings of relatively the same age.&lt;ref name=Fagen/&gt; Many case studies have indicated that siblings often use tickling as an alternative to outright [[violence]] when attempting to either punish or intimidate one another. The sibling tickling relationship can occasionally develop into an anti-social situation, or [[tickle torture]], where one sibling will tickle the other without mercy. The motivation behind tickle torture is often to portray the sense of [[Authoritarianism|domination]] the tickler has over the victim.&lt;ref name=Fagen/&gt;

As with parents and siblings, tickling serves as a bonding mechanism between friends, and is classified by [[psychologist]]s as part of the fifth and highest grade of [[Play (activity)|social play]] which involves special [[intimacy]] or "[[Cognitive science|cognitive interaction]]".&lt;ref name=Fagen/&gt; This suggests that tickling works best when all the parties involved feel comfortable with the situation and one another.&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;Michael Moran, ''Erotic Tickling'', [[Greenery Press]], 2003. {{ISBN|1-890159-46-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also serve as an outlet for sexual energy during adolescence,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sigmund Freud|Freud S.]] Three contributions to the theory of sex. In: The basic writings of Freud. New York: Modern Library; 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of people have stated in a study that their private areas were ticklish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/02/06/the-surprising-reasons-why-we-tickle-one-another/?utm_term=.f2efee15f5ea|title=The surprising reasons why we tickle one another|last=|first=|date=|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Selden&gt;{{cite journal |author=Selden ST |title=Tickle |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=93–7 |year=2004 |pmid=14699372 |doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(03)02737-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many people assume that other people enjoy tickling, a recent survey of 84 college students indicated that only 32% of respondents enjoy being tickled, with 32% giving neutral responses and 36% stating that they do not enjoy being tickled.&lt;ref name=Harris2&gt;Harris C.R. and Nancy Alvarado. 2005. [http://www.csupomona.edu/~nalvarado/PDFs/CEM-1294.pdf '' Facial expressions, smile types and self-reporting during humour, tickle and pain (pdf).''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923122129/http://www.csupomona.edu/~nalvarado/PDFs/CEM-1294.pdf |date=2006-09-23 }} Cognition and Emotion. 9(5),655-669.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found a very high level of embarrassment and anxiety associated with tickling.  However, in the same study the authors found that the facial indicators of happiness and amusement do not correlate, with some people who indicated that they do not enjoy being tickled actually smiling more often during tickling than those who indicated that they do enjoy being tickled,&lt;ref name=Harris2/&gt; which suggests that there may be other factors at play (such as embarrassment and anxiety) in the case of those who indicated a dislike for tickling than the mere physical sensation experienced. It has also been suggested that people may enjoy tickling ''because'' it elicits laughter as well as the feeling of being tickled. Social psychologists find that mimicking expressions generally cause people to some degree experience that emotion.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

In a 2008 study, 89% of students admitted to being ticklish on their right foot, 80% under their arm, 77% on their left foot, 77% on their ribs, 65% on their palm, 61% on their knee cap, and 51% on their stomach. 27% claim they are not ticklish at all.

Excessive tickling has been described as a primary sexual obsession and, under these circumstances, is sometimes considered a form of [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis|Ellis H.]] Studies in the psychology of sex. Vol iii. Philadelphia: FA Davis Co.; 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; Tickling can also be a form of [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt;

==Purpose==
Some of history's greatest thinkers have pondered the mysteries of the tickle response, including [[Plato]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; In ''[[The Assayer]]'', Galileo philosophically examines tickling in the context of how we perceive reality:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/h291/assayer.htm|author=Drake, Stillman|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Co.|location=New York|year=1957|page=275|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
When touched upon the soles of the feet, for example, it feels in addition to the common sensation of touch a sensation on which we have imposed a special name, "tickling." This sensation belongs to us and not to the hand... A piece of paper or a feather drawn lightly over any part of our bodies performs intrinsically the same operations of moving and touching, but by touching the eye, the nose, or the upper lip it excites in us an almost intolerable titillation, even though elsewhere it is scarcely felt. This titillation belongs entirely to us and not to the feather; if the live and sensitive body were removed it would remain no more than a mere word.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Francis Bacon]] and [[Charles Darwin]] believed that humorous laughter requires a "light" frame of mind. But they differed on ticklish laughter: Darwin thought that the same light state of mind was required, whereas Bacon disagreed. When tickled, noted Bacon, "men even in a grieved state of mind, yet cannot sometimes forbear laughing."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1872/1965. The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

One hypothesis, as mentioned above, is that tickling serves as a pleasant bonding experience between parent and child.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; However, this hypothesis does not adequately explain why many children and adults find tickling to be an unpleasant experience. Another view maintained is that tickling develops as a prenatal response and that the development of sensitive areas on the fetus helps to orient the fetus into favourable positions while in the womb.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson JY. ''On the attitude of the fetus in utero''. Obstetric Memoirs, vol ii. Philadelphia: Lippincott; 1855-1856.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown why certain people find areas of the body to be more ticklish than others; additionally, studies have shown that there is no significant difference in ticklishness among the [[gender]]s.&lt;ref name=Weinstein&gt;Weinstein, S. 1968. ''Intensive and extensive aspects of tactile sensitivity as a function of body part, sex, and laterality.'' In The Skin Senses, ed. D. R. Kenshalo. Springfield, Ill.: Thomas. pp. 195-222.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1924, J. C. Gregory proposed that the most ticklish places on the body were also those areas that were the most vulnerable during hand-to-hand [[combat]]. He posited that ticklishness might confer an [[evolution]]ary advantage by enticing the individual to protect these areas. Consistent with this idea, [[University of Iowa]] psychiatrist Donald W. Black observed that most ticklish spots are found in the same places as the protective [[reflex]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Black DW |title=Laughter |journal=JAMA |volume=252 |issue=21 |pages=2995–8 |year=1984 |pmid=6502861 |doi=10.1001/jama.252.21.2995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third, hybrid hypothesis, has suggested that tickling encourages the development of combat skills.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; Most tickling is done by parents, siblings and friends and is often a type of rough-and-tumble play, during which time children often develop defensive and combat moves. Although people generally make movements to get away from, and report disliking, being tickled, laughter encourages the tickler to continue. If the facial expressions induced by tickle were less pleasant the tickler would be less likely to continue, thus diminishing the frequency of these combat lessons.

To understand how much of the tickle response is dependent on the interpersonal relationship of the parties involved, [[Nicholas Christenfeld|Christenfeld]] and Harris presented subjects with a "mechanical tickle machine". They found that the subjects laughed just as much when they believed they were being tickled by a machine as when they thought they were being tickled by a person.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, C. R., and N. Christenfeld. In press. ''Can a machine tickle?'' Psychonomic Bulletin and Review.&lt;/ref&gt; Harris goes on to suggest that the tickle response is reflex, similar to the [[startle reflex]], that is contingent upon the element of surprise.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt;

Recently it was possible to show that it can be assumed that tickling (by passing leaves) served as a triggering-mechanism to issue an acoustic signal (namely laughing) to avoid crashes when our ancestors moved through tree tops. After our descent from the trees only body-parts remained ticklish that could not be touched by passing leaves (arm pits, sole of our feet etc.). It is also possible to show the further development of this trait which finally led to the upcoming of humor.&lt;ref&gt;Dramlitsch, T., 2018: "The Origin of Humor", {{ISBN|978-1720264637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-tickling==
The question as to why a person could not tickle themselves was raised by the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harris, Christine R.|title=The mystery of ticklish laughter|journal=American Scientist|year=1999|accessdate=2008-11-09|volume=87|page=344|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/1999/4/the-mystery-of-ticklish-laughter|doi=10.1511/1999.4.344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Knismesis]] may represent a [[vestigial structure|vestige]] of the primitive grooming response, in effect; knismesis serves as a "non-self detector" and protects the subject against foreign objects. Perhaps due to the importance of knismesis in protection, this type of light touch is not dependent on the element of [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]] and it is possible for one to induce self-knismesis, by light touching.&lt;ref name=Selden/&gt;

[[Gargalesis]], on the other hand, produces an odd phenomenon: when a person touches "ticklish" parts on their own body no tickling sensation is experienced. It is thought that the tickling requires a certain amount of surprise, and because tickling oneself produces no unexpected motion on the skin, the response is not activated.&lt;ref name=Selden/&gt; A recent analysis of the "self-tickle" response has been addressed using [[MRI]] technology. Blakemore and colleagues have investigated how the [[brain]] distinguishes between sensations we create for ourselves and sensations others create for us. When the subjects used a [[joystick]] to control a "tickling robot", they could not make themselves laugh. This suggested that when a person tries to tickle himself or herself, the [[cerebellum]] sends to the [[somatosensory cortex]] precise information on the position of the tickling target and therefore what sensation to expect. Apparently an unknown [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] mechanism then decreases or inhibits the tickling sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blakemore SJ, Wolpert DM, Frith CD |title=Central cancellation of self-produced tickle sensation |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=635–40 |year=1998 |pmid=10196573 |doi=10.1038/2870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the reasons for the inhibition of the tickling sensation during self-tickling remain unknown, research shows that the human brain is trained to know what sensation to expect when the body moves or performs an action.  Another reason may be the lack of awareness of many sensations arising from self-movement, such as not paying attention to one's own vocal cords.  When we try to tickle ourselves by grabbing our sides, the brain foresees this contact between body and hand and prepares itself for it.  This removes the feeling of unease and panic, causing the body to not react to tickling in the same way it would if someone else supplied the stimulus.

However, some people with schizophrenia have the ability to tickle themselves. This is most likely largely due to the difficulty many people with the disorder have recognising their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=tit-for-tat-delusions |date=21 December 2010 |last=Lametti |first=Daniel |title=Can't Tickle Yourself? That's a Good Thing |newspaper=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As physical abuse==
{{main|Tickle torture}}
Although consensual tickling can be a positive, playful experience, non-consensual tickling can be frightening, uncomfortable, and painful for the recipient. Therefore, non-consensual tickling can be categorized as physical abuse, and sources indicate that tickling has been used as torture. [[Heinz Heger]], a man imprisoned in the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]] during World War II, witnessed [[Nazi]] prison guards perform tickle torture on a fellow inmate. He describes this incident in his book ''The Men With The Pink Triangle'':&lt;ref&gt;Heger, Heinz. ''The Men With the Pink Triangle''. Boston: Alyson Publications, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; "The first game that the SS sergeant and his men played was to tickle their victim with goose feathers, on the soles of his feet, between his legs, in the armpits, and on other parts of his naked body. At first the prisoner forced himself to keep silent, while his eyes twitched in fear and torment from one SS man to the other. Then he could not restrain himself and finally he broke out in a high-pitched laughter that very soon turned into a cry of pain, while the tears ran down his face, and his body twisted against his chains. After this tickling torture, they let the lad hang there for a little, while a flood of tears ran down his cheeks and he cried and sobbed uncontrollably."

An article in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' describes a European method of tickle torture in which a goat was compelled to lick the victim's feet after they had been dipped in salt water. Once the goat had licked the salt off, the victim's feet would be dipped in the salt water again and the process would repeat itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamey | first1 = Gavin | year = 2001 | title = Torture: European Instruments of Torture and Capital Punishment from the Middle Ages to present | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 323 | issue = 7308| page = 346 | pmc=1120948 | doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7308.346}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Japan, authority figures could administer punishments to those convicted of crimes that were beyond the criminal code. This was called ''shikei'', which translates as ‘private punishment’. One such torture was ''kusuguri-zeme'': "merciless tickling."&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark.'' The Dark Side: Infamous Japanese Crimes and Criminals''. Japan: Kodansha International, 2001. Page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Sibling Abuse'', Vernon Wiehe published his research findings regarding 150 adults who were abused by their siblings during childhood. Several reported tickling as a type of physical abuse they experienced, and based on these reports it was revealed that abusive tickling is capable of provoking extreme physiological reactions in the victim, such as vomiting, incontinence (losing control of bladder), and loss of consciousness due to inability to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;Wiehe, Vernon. Sibling Abuse: Hidden Physical, Emotional, and Sexual Trauma. New York: Lexington Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten of the movies take place (at least in part) in courtrooms.

The American Bar Association also published a list of the 12 best trial plays, noting that the transition from film to the stage is sometimes difficult. It also has an extensive honorable mention list.&lt;ref name="Schachner"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_theaters_12_greatest_courtroom_dramas/ |title=The Theater's 12 Greatest Courtroom Dramas |date=August 1, 2012 |first1=Jill Schachner |last1=Chanen |work=ABA Journal |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oddities===
The trial in ''M'' is ''not'' in a legal courtroom. Instead, the city's crime syndicate leaders and underground elements hold proceedings in a warehouse. Despite the lack of legal trappings, "it is one of the most effective trials ever filmed, questioning our notions of justice and revenge, mob rule and order, power and responsibility. Our social orientation is flip-flopped." Wearing long leather coats instead of robes, criminals become judges. The murderer is cast as the victim, while the forces of law and order must rely on luck. [[Peter Lorre]] strikingly raises the issue of his culpability due to alleged insanity, and the imposition of ultimate retributive justice is depicted as being unsatisfying for society and the survivors of the murdered victims.&lt;ref name="aba-list"/&gt;

Outside of the first few minutes of the film, ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|Twelve Angry Men]]'' never enters a court room at all. It views the particular case and the system of justice through the prism of a jury's deliberations. The film explains practical explications of legal concepts basic to the American system of justice, and their effect on a particular trial and defendant. Those include the [[presumption of innocence]], [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] and the requirement of proof beyond a [[reasonable doubt]].&lt;ref name="aba-list"/&gt;

==American Film Institute==
In 2008, the [[American Film Institute]] compiled its own "courtroom drama" ten best list. It includes five of the films on the ABA list — ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'', ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'', ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' and ''[[The Verdict]]'' — and adds ''[[A Cry in the Dark]]'', ''[[A Few Good Men (film)|A Few Good Men]]'', ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', and ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]''.&lt;ref name="afi.com"/&gt;

==Military trial films==
Military trial films typically include conflicting questions of loyalty, command responsibility, ethical rules and rules of engagement, obedience to superior authority, politics and class conflict. [[War movies|War]] and trials are good foils for one another. The struggles are perennial and engaging. A partial list includes:

'''Troublewit''' is a specially pleated [[paper]] used for entertainment purposes. The paper is used to form various items, such as [[hat]]s, fans and umbrellas by stage entertainers and [[illusionist]]s.

Its origins go back at least to the 17th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.origami-resource-center.com/paper-magic.html |title=Paper Magic and Troublewit: |access-date=2018-07-12|publisher=Origami Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method of preparing the paper was described in English as early as 1676 by the anonymous author "J.M." in "Sports and Pastimes" but was said to be performed by a French monk "Pere Mathieu". British magic dealer [[Ellis Stanyon]] sold the folded papers ready-made and included a routine in his 1905 book, "Magic: or Conjuring for Amateurs," and an outstanding, photographically-illustrated routine was included in C. Lang Neil's "The Modern Conjurer" (1903). Houdini mentioned the novelty in his 1922 book "Paper Magic."

According to Stanyon, "The groundwork of the paper-folding is not by any means new, having been known for several hundred years at least under various names, as: "Chinese Fan," "Fantastic Fan," "Trouble Wit," etc." According to Houdini, Monsieur Felicien Trewey presented it throughout Europe and America under the name of "Papier Multiforme." The late Canadian magician Sid Lorraine claimed some credit for re-popularizing the novelty by working out updated routines for it and performing it at magician's conventions, and he included a routine in his 1950 book "More Patter."

The accordion-style creasing pattern allows the stiff paper to be compressed into a small space for transport, and yet transformed into, according to Stanyon, over one hundred different shapes during a performance, with an accompanying story. Despite its age, the entertainment is still a distinct novelty to most audiences.

'''''Wild &amp; Crazy Kids''''' was an American television game show in which large teams, usually consisting entirely of children, participated in head-to-head physical challenges on [[Nickelodeon]] (as well as [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] in Canada). The show lasted for three seasons from 1990 until 1992 for a total of 65 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Bokks|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wild &amp; Crazy Kids'' starred three teenage co-hosts with [[Omar Gooding]] and [[Don Jeffcoat|Donnie Jeffcoat]] (seasons 1–3), Annette Chavez (now Annette M. Lesure) in season 1 and Jessica Gaynes in seasons 2 and 3.

In 2002, a revival was produced which lasted ten episodes and aired on Nickelodeon from July 29 to October 7, 2002. It was hosted by [[Mati Moralejo]] of [[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids]].

==Games==
Each episode consisted of three games with one host emceeing each game. The teams were identified by the color of the shirts they wore, which varied from show to show (see below). The games varied in style; many were take-offs on [[playground game]]s, [[sports]] with unusual rules added, or messy games involving [[pie]]s or [[Slime (You Can't Do That on Television)|slime]] (the latter was referred to as "blap" beginning in season three). Occasionally, the show taped special episodes at a [[theme park]] such as [[Raging Waters]], [[Wild Rivers (water park)|Wild Rivers]], and [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]].

===Take-offs on sports===
* The most often repeated (once per season) game was ''Dizzy Bat Home Run Derby''. The game consisted of two teams (one of kids and one of adults) batting in three innings. The kids would attempt to hit home runs off of pitched balls (temporary and closer fencing was put up); any ball that did not leave the field in fair territory was as an out. Once the kids had three outs, the adults would bat. During their half-inning, a grownup would have up to three chances to hit home runs off a batting tee; however, the adult was first required to hold his bat upright against his forehead and spin around it three times; furthermore, each adult would only get thirty seconds to hit the balls. Three adults would bat every half-inning. Donnie Jeffcoat, incidentally, hosted the game all three times.
* ''Three-Legged Soccer'', where kids were tied at the ankle like in a three-legged race.
* ''Splash Football'', where a quarterback [[Rodney Peete]] would throw footballs to kids jumping off a [[Springboard|diving board]] and into a pool.
* ''Bumper Boat Lacrosse'', played in [[bumper boats]].
* ''Donkey Basketball'', played with kids on [[donkey]]s.

===Playground games===
* A giant game of [[Simon Says]] which looked more like a comedy routine by leader, Brian Seeman.
* [[Red light/Green light]], retitled ''Red Pie/Green Pie'', where if a child was caught trying to advance after the call of "red light," they hit them self with a pie. If they reached their goal, they hit one of their parents with the pie.
* [[Tag (game)|Cops and Robbers]] played on the set of the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' Spectacular at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].
* A [[Tug of War]] pitting three professional wrestlers against a team of kids. The wrestlers would face-off against a growing number of kids each round, starting at one and then going to all fifty kids.

===Other games===
* A massive game of [[Twister (game)|Twister]].
* ''Human [[Space Invaders]]''.
* ''Human [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]'', where the spaces selected by the players had navy beans dumped on them (as well as any participant serving as the "ship" in that space.)

==Pilot==
A pilot was shot in 1989, hosted by Matt Brown (who co-hosted ''[[Don't Just Sit There]]'' on Nickelodeon), Leslie Hibbard and [[Cory Tyler]].

==Guest appearances==
During the first and second seasons, there were occasionally adult celebrity guests, and one of Season 2's final episodes held a kids and teens celebrity slide competition game at Raging Waters in San Dimas, California to raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.  The entire third season in 1992 featured at least one (and sometimes more) kid celebrity guest(s) every episode. Guests were people like actor and former bodybuilder [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Lark Voorhies]] from ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'', [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] from ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', [[Ashley Johnson]] from ''[[Growing Pains]]'', and [[Michael Fishman]] from ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''. A young [[Tobey Maguire]] appeared on the show long before he was famous, promoting the short-lived [[Fox Network|Fox]] sitcom ''[[Great Scott! (TV series)|Great Scott!]]''. Other appearances include:
* [[Marc Summers]] from ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]'' who appeared in 1990 in a special episode titled "''Double Dare'' vs. ''Wild &amp; Crazy Kids''." He also appeared the following year to pitch in "Dizzy Bat Home Run Derby: The Sequel."
* [[California Angels]] pitcher [[Scott Bailes]] pitched the first "Dizzy Bat Home Run Derby" and [[Bruce Hurst]] of the [[San Diego Padres]] pitched the third and final installment.
* [[Detroit Lions]] quarterback [[Rodney Peete]] appeared on the premiere episode throwing footballs to kids jumping into a swimming pool.
* [[Michael Bower]], [[Venus DeMilo]] and [[Danny Cooksey]] from the Nickelodeon series ''[[Salute Your Shorts]]'' appeared on one of the final episodes. This show pitted two teams—one headed by the ''Salute Your Shorts'' crew and the other headed by the three ''Wild &amp; Crazy Kids'' co-hosts—in an all day showdown.
* Olympic skier [[Bode Miller]] appeared on the 2002 revival.
* [[Daryl Sabara]] and [[Alexa Vega]] of the ''[[Spy Kids]]'' movies appeared on the revival.
* [[Brandon Call]] was in season 2, and as payback for his Wild &amp; Crazy Kids shirt being in the Goo Pool with shorts and shoes, he took Donnie's shirt, Omar's shorts and Jessica's shoes and ran off to put them into the Goo Pool with the hosts chasing after him.

==Production==
The show was executive produced by Woody Fraser, and aired 65 episodes from July 4, 1990, to December 1, 1992. Reruns aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from December 2, 1992, to February 28, 1999, before moving to [[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids]] on March 1, 1999 to December 31, 2007. It was sporadically shown on [[TeenNick]] afterwards. It was produced by Woody Fraser Productions in association with Nickelodeon and [[Alan Landsburg Productions|Reeves Entertainment Group]].
