The '''opening ceremony for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]]''' was held at [[Celtic Park]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, between 21:00 and 23:40 BST, on 23 July 2014.

==Parade of Nations==
The ceremony was directed by [[David Zolkwer]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/24/commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-glasgow-review |title=Commonwealth Games opening ceremony review – no lack of heart but a lack of oomph |last=Gardner |first=Lyn|authorlink=Lyn Gardner|date=24 July 2014|website=[[theguardian.com]]|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included the [[2014 Commonwealth Games Parade of Nations]] where 71 athletes, bearing the flags of their respective nations and territories, led their national delegations as they paraded into the stadium. The games were formally opened by [[Her Majesty (style)|Her Majesty]] [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. She referred to the Commonwealth's "shared ideals and ambitions" and the "bonds that unite" its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duncanson|first=Hilary|date= 23 July 2014|title=Queen tells of 'shared ideals' at Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/queen-tells-of-shared-ideals-at-commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-30455671.html|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|agency=[[Press Association]]|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programme==

The programme, which included about 2,000 performers, featured [[Karen Dunbar]], [[John Barrowman]], [[Amy Macdonald]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Susan Boyle]], [[Nicola Benedetti]], [[Julie Fowlis]], [[Pumeza Matshikiza]], [[Eric Whitacre]] and the [[National Youth Choir of Scotland]], as well as a message from the [[International Space Station]]. The ceremony began with a countdown and a recorded video message from Scottish actor [[Ewan McGregor]], explaining the partnership between the Games and [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/commonwealth-games-2014-opening-ceremony-ewan-mcgregor-launches-unicef-charity-fundraiser-during-performance-9624536.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the arrival of the Queen there was a [[flypast]] by the [[Red Arrows]] display team. The venue featured the largest LED video screen in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Withnall |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/commonwealth-games-2014--on-your-marks-glasgow-ready-for-opening-ceremony-as-scotland-promises-to-show-what-were-made-of-9623129.html |title=Commonwealth Games 2014 – on your marks: Glasgow ready for opening ceremony as Scotland promises to show ‘what we’re made of’ – Commonwealth Games – Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=19 March 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; supplied by Sports Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow2014.com/media-centre/press-releases/sports-technology-showcase-all-bigscreen-action-glasgow-2014 |title=Sports Technology to showcase all the big-screen action of Glasgow 2014 &amp;#124; Glasgow 2014 – Commonwealth Games |publisher=Glasgow 2014 |date= |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland's then First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] welcomed the participants and spectators, and introduced a moment of silence in memory of the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] disaster.

The final part of the [[Queen's Baton Relay]] was run by 32 Scottish volunteers nominated for giving their time to developing the nation's youth through sport. The baton was then passed to [[Chris Hoy|Sir Chris Hoy]], who delivered  it to President of the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] HRH [[Tunku Muda Serting Imran|Prince Imran]] and the Queen. The display of the message concealed within the baton was delayed by a difficulty in opening the device.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

The Games were launched in partnership with UNICEF, to save and change children’s lives. The unique partnership aimed "to use the power of sport to reach every child in Scotland and benefit children in every Commonwealth nation and territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow2014.com/about-us/our-sponsors/unicef |title=Unicef &amp;#124; Glasgow 2014 – Commonwealth Games |publisher=Glasgow 2014 |date= |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adventure education''' is the promotion of learning through adventure centered experiences.

Adventure centered experiences can include a wide variety of activities, due to the different ways people experience adventure. Outdoor sports, [[Ropes course|challenge courses]], races, and even indoor activities can be used in adventure education. Adventure education is related to adventure programming, [[adventure therapy]], and [[outdoor education]]. It is an active process rather than a passive process of learning that requires active engagement from the learners as well as the instructors.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, S., &amp; Gass, M. A. (2005). Effective Leadership in Adventure Programming. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics.&lt;/ref&gt; Often adventure education is linked to an incorporation of all five senses within the experiences which can heighten the opportunities for learning and retaining information. The learning experiences within adventure education programs are structured for a potential increase in human performance and capacity. Sometimes the adventure lies more in the journey than the destination.  The venture lies in the struggle, not in the prize.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J. C. Priest, S. (1999). Adventure Programming. State College, PA: Venture Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of adventure ==
Merriam-Webster defines adventure as "an undertaking usually involving danger and unknown [[risks]]". Danger is defined as "exposure or liability to injury, pain, harm, or loss." Danger involves two factors which are perils – the origins of injury or the causes of loss, and [[hazards]] – the conditions that emphasize the chance of injury or loss.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, S., &amp; Gass, M. A. (2005). Effective Leadership in Adventure Programming. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics.&lt;/ref&gt; Risk is defined as "potential loss or injury". Risk can be described as "real risk" or "perceived risk"&lt;ref&gt;Priest, S., &amp; Gass, M. A. (2005). Effective Leadership in Adventure Programming. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[bungee jumping]]; it seems as though there is a high level of risk, but with proper equipment it can be relatively safe. Danger, then is the exposure, or magnitude, of the harm a person may encounter; risk is the probability of that harm. These two variables are filtered through a person's perceptions, which may or may not be accurate.

Consequently, adventure is created through a person's perception of the magnitude of the potential risk, and the probability of loss. An activity with relatively low magnitude but high probability of harm (such as [[adventure racing]] or [[slacklining]]) may be just as much of an adventure as an activity with relatively high magnitude and low probability of harm (such as sport [[rock climbing]], [[skydiving]], or riding a [[roller coaster]]).

== Outcomes of adventure education programming ==
Adventure education has many positive outcomes. A meta-analysis of adventure education studies identified forty major outcomes, grouped into the following six categories: leadership, self-concept, academic, personality, interpersonal, and adventuresomeness.&lt;ref&gt;Hattie, J., Marsh, H., Neill, J. T., &amp; Richards, G. (1997). Adventure education and Outward Bound: Out-of class experiences that make a lasting difference. Review of Educational Research, 67(1), 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Adventure education often employs practical skills that will benefit an individual in areas beyond the activities in an adventure program. There are three theories of transfer in adventure education in which the participant may apply what they learned into future experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J. C., Priest, S. (1999). Adventure Programming. State College, PA: Venture Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these theories is "specific transfer" – the learner applies the habits and skills learned during an experience to a new and similar experience (e.g. when an individual learns how to [[belay]] during a rock climbing experience and then applies that knowledge to [[Abseiling|rappelling]]). The second theory is "nonspecific transfer" – the learner establishes some common principles acquired through previous experiences and applies them in a new learning situation (e.g. when an individual develops trust through a trust building activity). The third theory is "metaphoric transfer" – the learner applies similar underlying principles to other areas and situations (e.g. when individuals utilize teamwork during an activity such as [[canoeing]] and later applies it to the workplace or other group experiences).&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J. C., Priest, S. (1999). Adventure Programming. State College, PA: Venture Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program characteristics that contribute to program outcomes ==
There are six categories of program characteristics that contribute to achieving the program outcomes described above. These are the physical environment, activities, processing, the group, instructors, and the participant.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical environment ===
Unfamiliar environments contribute a great deal to program outcomes experienced by adventure education participants. Being in a new environment allows participants to gain new perspectives on familiar environments&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V. &amp; Golins, G. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School.&lt;/ref&gt; and gives them the freedom to experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, R. O., &amp; Bacon, S. B. (1993). The wilderness challenge model. In M. A. Gass (Ed.), Adventure therapy: Therapeutic applications of adventure programming (pp. 11-41). Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; An unfamiliar environment also creates some level of anxiety for the participant, as well as creating the perception of risk. Overcoming the challenges presented by unfamiliar environments through the mastery of specific tasks results in positive benefits to the individual, such as increased self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Nadler, R. S. (1993). Therapeutic process of change. In M. A. Gass (Ed.) Adventure therapy: Therapeutic applications of adventure programming (pp. 57-69). Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Positive outcomes are offered by several types of environments, including wilderness, non-wilderness (e.g. ropes-course), or a traditional classroom. However, wilderness is often considered as providing additional benefits to participants, thus being the optimal environmental setting for adventure education programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hattie, J., Marsh, H., Neill, J. T., &amp; Richards, G. (1997). Adventure education and Outward Bound: Out-of class experiences that make a lasting difference. Review of Educational Research, 67(1), 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activities ===
Rather than activities themselves, it is the qualities of activities that are responsible for achieving program outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of challenge, mastery, and success in activities is what led to participant growth. Challenges should be holistic in order to maximize positive outcomes. Programs should include mental, emotional, and physical challenges, and encourage concurrent mastery in all three domains.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V. &amp; Golins, G. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School.&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges should also increase incrementally, so as not to overwhelm participants early on in the program but allow them to grow and develop throughout. Activities should be well organized and matched to suit the particular needs and requirements of the participants. The GRABBS model&lt;ref&gt;Schoel, J., Prouty, D., &amp; Radcliffe, P. (1988). Islands of healing: A guide to adventure based counseling. Hamilton, MA: Project Adventure, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; (Goals, Readiness, Affect, Behavior, Body, and Stage of Development) is a good method for matching activities and participants. Success in the activities must be achievable. However, some failure may also be good for participant development.&lt;ref&gt;Witman, J. P. (1995). Characteristics of adventure programs valued by adolescents in treatment. Monograph on Youth in the 1990s, 4, 127-135.&lt;/ref&gt; Program participants can learn from their failures to achieve success. Goal-setting is critical to achieving program outcomes, at both the individual and group levels. It is also important to allow participants to have personal choice related to activities. The "challenge-by-choice" philosophy of adventure programming allows the participant to have some autonomy related to the activities s/he participates in.

While the qualities of activities are most important in achieving program outcomes, there are also specific activities that are well-suited to adventure programming.&lt;ref&gt;Schoel, J., Prouty, D., &amp; Radcliffe, P. (1988). Islands of healing: A guide to adventure based counseling. Hamilton, MA: Project Adventure, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; These include activities related to trust and empathy (e.g. trust falls), communication, decision-making and problem solving, social responsibility, and personal responsibility.

=== Processing ===
Processing is defined as "the sorting and ordering of information" that enables program participants to internalize meaning gained from an adventure education experience&lt;ref&gt;Luckner, J. L., &amp; Nadler, R. S. (1997). Processing the experience: Strategies to enhance and generalize learning. Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Three models have been identified by which participants process meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, S. B. (1987). The evolution of the Outward Bound 
process. Greenwich, CT: Outward Bound.&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Mountains Speak for Themselves" model, participants are responsible for reflecting on their experiences on their own, without facilitation from the instructor. In the "Outward Bound Plus" model, the instructor serves as a counselor, facilitator, and discussion leader. In the metaphoric model, activities are consciously framed so that they become experiential metaphors that can be applied to challenges in participants' daily lives.

=== The group ===
Several characteristics of the group also contribute to achieving program outcomes. In terms of the size of the group, small groups of seven to fifteen individuals are usually more conducive to achieving desired outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V. &amp; Golins, G. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School.&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocity within the group is also important. This refers to group members learning to cooperate with one another and capitalize on the strengths of each individual.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, D., &amp; Putnam, R. (1993). Personal growth through adventure. London, England: David Fulton Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Autonomy of individuals and personal relationships are other aspects of the group that contribute to achievement.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instructors ===
Certain aspects of program instructors such as biographical characteristics, personality, and interpersonal interactions can have a large influence on participants' achievement of desired program outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructors may be required to have a Bachelors Degree in Outdoor Leadership to instruct at most Universities and community colleges. Instructors may also be required to hold certain certifications in Wilderness First Responder [https://www.nols.edu/en/coursefinder/courses/wilderness-first-responder-WFR/], American Mountain Guides Single Pitch [https://amga.com/single-pitch-instructor/ Instructor] and American Canoe Association Whitewater Instructor [https://www.americancanoe.org/page/Become_an_Instructor Certification], among many others.

=== The participant ===
The age, gender, background, and expectations of program participants have also been shown to be related to the achievement of program outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the program a student is in, the program may require the student to be autonomous during expeditionary courses. Student autonomy can be beneficial to students by enhancing personal growth, an increase in self-reliance, and enhancing the overall group experience. However, student autonomy  is considered to be controversial in regards to outdoor adventure educational programs, due to risk management concerns. Yet, it is recommended that the instructors of these types of programs must fully understand the risks of student autonomy prior to implementing them as part of an adventure education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bobilya|first=Andrew|date=2012|title=Autonomous Student Experience: Are they too risky for Today's outdoor adventure Program?|url=|journal=SAGE|volume=|pages=353-357|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Adventure education programming can be implemented in several contexts, including therapy for youth at risk,&lt;ref&gt;Cross, R. (2002). The effects of an adventure education program on perceptions of alienation and personal control among at-risk adolescents. Journal of Experiential Education, 25(1), 247-254.&lt;/ref&gt; survivors of sexual assault,&lt;ref&gt;Ross, S. (2003). The therapeutic effects of an adventure challenge program on the personal empowerment of women survivors of sexual trauma. Journal of Experiential Education, 25(3), 350.&lt;/ref&gt; families in distress,&lt;ref&gt;Chen, T., Haljun, B., &amp; Schwer Canning, S. (2003). Adventure as enrichment: Measuring social outcomes for families. Journal of Experiential Education, 25(1), 352.&lt;/ref&gt; persons with medical conditions,&lt;ref&gt;Sugerman, D. (2005). "I am more than my cancer:" An exploratory examination of adventure programming and cancer survivors. Journal of Experiential Education, 28(1), 72-83.&lt;/ref&gt; and Veteran assimilation back to civilian life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harper|first=N.J.|date=2014|title=Veterans and the outward bound experience: An evaluation of impact and aiming.|url=|journal=Ecopsychology|volume=6|pages=165-173|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Art director}}
An '''artistic director''' is the executive of an arts organization, particularly in a theatre or dance company, who handles the organization's artistic direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Actor Prepares|last = Stanislavski|first = Constantin|publisher = Theatre Arts Inc. New York|year = 1936|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Meyerhold the Director|last = Rudnitsky|first = Konstantin, Transl. G. Petrov|publisher = Ardis, Ann Arbor, MI|year = 1981|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Empty Space|last = Brook|first = Peter|publisher = Harmondsworth, UK: Pelican|year = 1972|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally a [[Theatrical producer|producer]] and [[Theatre director|director]], but not in the sense of a [[Business magnate|mogul]], since the organization is generally a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] organization. The artistic director of a [[Theatre|theatre company]] is the individual with the overarching artistic control of the theatre's production choices, directorial choices, and overall artistic vision.  In smaller theatres, the artistic director may be the founder of the theatre and the primary director of its plays.  In larger non-profit theatres (often known in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] as [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatres]]), the artistic director may be appointed by the [[board of directors]].

==Overview==
The artistic director of a performing arts company is similar to the [[Music director|musical director]] of an orchestra, the primary person responsible for planning a company's season. The artistic director's responsibilities can include (but are not limited to) choosing the [[Play (theatre)|material]] staged in a season, the hiring of creative/production personnel (such as [[theatre director|directors]]), and other theatre management tasks. He or she may also [[Theatre director|direct]] productions for the company. Artistic directors work closely with the general manager of the theatre, and contribute the artistic evaluation of projects and productions to be included in promotional, funding, and press materials. An artistic director also functions as a resource for the directors who are working to mount productions at the theatre and can provide support, counsel, and/or artistic input where requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication in Theatre Directing and Performance from rehearsal to production|last = Lanipekun|first = Jennifer|publisher = Cambria Press, New York|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = Appendix I: Interview with Director 1, Artistic Director of Opera Company 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic director is usually prepared to assume the production should the director become unable to complete his/her duties. Artistic directors are frequently regarded as the artistic representatives of theatre companies and are often required to speak about their theatre to the press.  In the United States, artistic directors often have [[fundraising]] responsibilities as well. 

In some ensemble companies, the artistic director is responsible for recruiting performers to act as a talent pool for the company's productions.  This ensemble may include actors and artists of various disciplines. The artistic director functions as leader of this group, with the aim to create and/or realize various new and established works. 

In [[ballet]], the artistic director is the head of a [[ballet company]]. They have overall responsibility for training the dancers as well as selecting and mounting productions. They are almost always a retired dancer. Often they also [[Choreography|choreograph]] some of the company's productions. 

In some companies, the artistic director may also manage the day-to-day operations of the company, but in many (particularly larger) companies, the artistic director is often exempt from routine administrative duties, freeing him or her to concentrate on the art.  In those cases, decisions about administration, business issues, finances, fundraising, board relations, donor relations, publicity, and marketing devolve to the responsibility of the general manager, chief operating officer, managing director, etc. or are discussed collaboratively.

[[File:The Assembly Rooms, Bath - geograph.org.uk - 979274.jpg|thumb|The Assembly Rooms, Bath]]
In [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], especially in the [[18th century Britain|18th]] and 19th centuries, '''assembly rooms''' were gathering places for members of the higher [[social class]]es open to members of both sexes. At that time most entertaining was done at home and there were few public places of entertainment open to both sexes besides theatres (and there were few of those outside London). [[Upper class]] men had more options, including [[coffee house]]s and later [[gentlemen's club]]s. 

Major sets of assembly rooms in London, in [[spa town]]s such as [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and in important provincial cities such as [[York]], were able to accommodate hundreds, or in some cases over a thousand people for events such as [[masquerade ball]]s (masked balls), [[Ball (dance)|conventional balls]], public concerts and assemblies (simply gatherings for conversation, perhaps with incidental music and entertainments) or [[Salon (gathering)|Salons]]. By later standards these were formal events: the attendees were usually screened to make sure no one of insufficient rank gained admittance; admission might be subscription only; and unmarried women were [[Chaperone (social)|chaperoned]]. Nonetheless, assemblies played an important part in the marriage market of the day.  

A major set of assembly rooms consisted of a main room and several smaller subsidiary rooms such as card rooms, tea rooms and supper rooms. On the other hand, in smaller towns a single large room attached to the best inn might serve for the occasional assembly for the local [[landed gentry]]. 

Formal assemblies and the associated assembly rooms faded away in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as the range of places of public entertainment increased (for example public dance halls and nightclubs) and attitudes became more accepting of women from the higher social classes attending them. Also to some extent they were supplanted by the ballrooms of major hotels as British hotels became larger from the railway age onwards.

==Examples==
*[[Almack's]] - London's most exclusive assembly rooms.
*[[Pantheon, London|The Pantheon]] - an architecturally grander but more briefly fashionable set of assembly rooms in London.
*[[Bath Assembly Rooms]] - the assembly rooms in England's most fashionable spa.
*[[York Assembly Rooms]] - a notable building designed by [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]].
*[[Victoria Rooms (Bristol)]]
*[[Assembly Rooms (Edinburgh)]]
*[[Assembly Rooms, Surbiton]] in [[Surbiton]], Surrey.
*[[Glasgow Assembly Rooms|New Assembly and Concert Rooms]], 1796, [[Glasgow]], later the home of the [[Glasgow Athenaeum|Athenaeum]] (demolished by new owners, the [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]], in 1892)
* [[Assembly Rooms, Newcastle]] - built in 1776 in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], one of the finest examples of [[Georgian architecture]] in Newcastle's [[Grainger Town]].
* [[Dumfries]] Assembly rooms, c. 1825 - elegant building by Walter Newall, Architect, of Dumfries

==Public gardens==
London also had a number of outdoor "public gardens" where similar entertainments took place. They were more commercial establishments and tended to have less exclusive rules on admission. Each had at least one major indoor space for balls and the like. See: [[Marylebone Gardens]], [[Vauxhall Gardens]], [[Ranelagh Gardens]] and [[Cremorne Gardens, London|Cremorne Gardens]].

The '''Avenue of Stars''' was a version of the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="usa-today04"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-08-23-page-walk-of-fame_x.htm|title=Page gets first star on British Walk of Fame|first=Carl|last=De Souza|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=23 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in 2005 with one hundred names, and was a temporary installation to accompany a TV show to celebrate ITV's 50th birthday. The Avenue of Stars was a walkway through [[Covent Garden]] passing [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's Church]], commonly known as the "Actors' Church". It honoured individuals or groups from the entertainment industry with notable achievements. As on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], the individual or group was represented by a five-pointed star containing the name set into the walkway. To qualify for a star, the individual or group had to have been from the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], or a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nation.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The first inductee onto the Avenue of Stars was [[Jimmy Page]], guitarist with [[Led Zeppelin]].&lt;ref name="usa-today04"/&gt; In 2006, all of the stars were removed, {{Why|date=January 2017}} and only the old flagstones are visible in the courtyard. American singer/songwriter Is'real Benton formed a U.S.-based eponymous foundation to restore the Walk of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londontown.com/LondonInformation/Sights_and_Attractions/Avenue_of_the_Stars/9702|title=Avenue of the Stars Covent Garden London|publisher=londontown.com|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|Burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'', c. 1900]]
A '''burlesque''' is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24999 "Burlesque",] ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burlesco}}'', which, in turn, is derived from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burla}}'' – a joke, ridicule or mockery.&lt;ref&gt;In theatrical use, a burla was "a comic interlude or practical joke introduced, usually extempore, into a performance by the servant masks of the [[commedia dell'arte]] … developed at will into a small independent 'turn', the characters returning at its conclusion to the main theme of the plot". See Hartnoll, Phyllis and Peter Found. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t79.e492 "Burla",] ''The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre'',  Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-90100-43624043/the-new-york-clipper-vol-62-september#fullscreen "Burlesque News – The Growth of Burlesque"], ''[[New York Clipper]]'', Vol. 62, No. 31, September 12, 1914, p. 18 (accessed February 28, 2017, ''via'' [[MyHeritage]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Burlesque overlaps in meaning with [[caricature]], [[parody]] and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with [[extravaganza]], as presented during the [[Victorian burlesque|Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H. W. Fowler|Fowler, H. W.]], rev. [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]] (1965). ''Modern English Usage''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 68 and 96&lt;/ref&gt;  "Burlesque" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are [[Alexander Pope]]'s  ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''.  An example of musical burlesque is  [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].  Examples of [[Victorian burlesque|theatrical burlesques]] include [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' and the [[A. C. Torr]] – [[Meyer Lutz]] shows, including ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.

A later use of the term, [[American burlesque|particularly in the United States]], refers to performances in a [[variety show]] format.  These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in [[cabaret]]s and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female [[striptease]].  Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and 1979's ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'', among others.

[[File:Arabella-Fermor-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arabella Fermor, target of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'']]
The word first appears in a title in [[Francesco Berni]]'s ''Opere burlesche'' of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as ''poesie bernesca'' in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Fredric Woodbridge Wilson: "Burlesque", ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed December 04, 2008), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Pyramus and Thisbe scene in ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' were early examples of such imitation.&lt;ref name=stanton&gt;Stanton, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet [[Miguel de Cervantes]] ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are ''[[Exemplary Novels]]'' and the ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'' published in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQTtSRP?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570534/burlesque.html Burlesque], ''MSN Encarta'', accessed 18 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick/&gt;

Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with "[[pastiche]]", "[[parody]]", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the "[[mock-heroic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt;

17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: '''High burlesque''' refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary [[Parody#English term|parody]] and the [[mock-heroic]]. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is [[Alexander Pope]]'s "sly, knowing and courtly" ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, pp. 290–91&lt;/ref&gt; '''Low burlesque''' applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is [[Samuel Butler (1612-1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s poem ''[[Hudibras]]'', which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric [[doggerel]] verse, using a colloquial idiom.  Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hudibras'' was so popular that it became the subject of parody itself.  See Sanders, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in [[revue]]s and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].&lt;ref name=stanton/&gt;  [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1974 play ''[[Travesties]]'' is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p. 50; and Hunter, Jim (1982) ''Tom Stoppard's Plays''. London: Faber and Faber, {{ISBN|0-571-11903-4}}, pp. 23–33, 141–146 and 237–242&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
{{see also|Parody music}}

===Classical music===
Beginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect.&lt;ref name=kennedy&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As derived from literature and theatre, "burlesque" was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;

In this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by [[Johann Strauss II]] (''Die lustigen Weiber von Wien'', 1868),&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Strauss, Johann" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Michael Ziehrer|Ziehrer]] (''Mahomed's Paradies'',1866; ''Das Orakel zu Delfi'', 1872; ''Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende'', 1875; ''In fünfzig Jahren'', 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Ziehrer, C. M." in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruno Granichstaedten]] (''Casimirs Himmelfahrt'', 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though [[André Grétry|Grétry]] composed for a "drame burlesque" (''Matroco'', 1777).&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, David and M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43361 "Grétry, André-Ernest-Modeste: Works,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 24 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (''The Fox'') a ''"Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée"'' (''burlesque tale sung and played'') and his 1911 ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' a "burlesque in four scenes". A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by [[Ernst Krenek]] entitled ''[[Schwergewicht]]'' (''Heavyweight'') (1927).

Some orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite ''Burlesque de Quixotte'', TWV 55, by [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and the Sinfonia Burlesca by [[Leopold Mozart]] (1760). Another often-performed piece is [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;  Other examples include the following:
*1901: Six Burlesques, Op. 58 for piano four hands by [[Max Reger]]
*1904: Scherzo Burlesque, Op. 2 for piano and orchestra by [[Béla Bartók]]
*1911: Three Burlesques, Op. 8c for piano by Bartók
*1920: Burlesque for Piano, by [[Arnold Bax]]
*1931: Ronde burlesque, Op. 78 for orchestra by [[Florent Schmitt]]
*1932: Fantaisie burlesque, for piano by [[Olivier Messiaen]]
*1956: Burlesque for Piano and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 13g by [[Bertold Hummel]]
*1982: Burlesque for Wind Quintet, Op. 76b by Hummel

Burlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in [[Partitas, BWV 825-830|Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827)]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], the "Rondo-Burleske" third movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] by [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and the "Burlesque" fourth movement of [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1]].&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, Andrew, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mmzf "Dmitri Shostakovich Violin Concertos 1 &amp; 2 Review"], BBC Music, accessed 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz===
The use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well known [[ragtime]] travesties include ''The Russian Rag'', by [[George L. Cobb]], which is based on [[Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]], and [[Harry L. Alford|Harry Alford]]'s  ''Lucy's Sextette'' based on the [[sextet]], 'Chi mi frena in tal momento?', from ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Donizetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Max (2006): ''Rachmaninoff: Life, Works, Recordings'' p 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian theatrical burlesque==
[[File:Florence St. John.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
{{main|Victorian burlesque}}
Victorian burlesque, sometimes known as "travesty" or "[[extravaganza]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s.  It took the form of [[parody music|musical theatre parody]] in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work.  The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors.  [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Other authors of burlesques included [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;

Victorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English [[pantomime]] "with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''.

This English style of burlesque was successfully introduced to New York in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/779924 "Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850",] ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5–50, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faustupto.jpg|thumb|150px|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]''|left]]
Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera.&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33–66, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wells&gt;Wells, Stanley.

Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told, "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=wells/&gt; A staple of burlesque was the display of attractive women in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]], dressed in tights to show off their legs, but the plays themselves were seldom more than modestly risqué.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

[[File:Ruy-blas-programme-crop.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Souvenir programme|Programme]]: ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'']]
Burlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and [[Royal Strand Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.  Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize.  The house stars included [[Nellie Farren]], [[John D'Auban]], [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  From about 1880, Victorian burlesques grew longer, until they were a whole evening's entertainment rather than part of a double- or triple-bill.&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;  In the early 1890s, these burlesques went out of fashion in London, and the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new more wholesome but less literary genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt.

==American burlesque==
[[File:Bon-Ton Burlesquers2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Advertisement for a burlesque troupe, 1898]]
{{main|American burlesque}}
American burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, [[Lydia Thompson]] and the "British Blondes", beginning in 1868.&lt;ref name=Friends&gt;Hoffos, Signe and Moulder, Bob.  [http://www.kensalgreen.co.uk/documents/FOKGC43_Thompson.pdf "Desperately Seeking Lydia" and "Appreciating Lydia",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513080257/http://www.kensalgreen.co.uk/documents/FOKGC43_Thompson.pdf |date=2011-05-13 }} ''The Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery Magazine'', Vol. 43, Autumn 2006, pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;  New York burlesque shows soon incorporated elements and the structure of the popular [[minstrel show]]s. They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted [[Olio (musical number)|olios]] and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9018177 "Burlesque show",] ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Online Library Edition, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While burlesque went out of fashion in England towards the end of the 19th century, to be replaced by [[Edwardian musical comedy]], the American style of burlesque flourished, but with increasing focus on female nudity. Exotic "cooch" dances were brought in, ostensibly Syrian in origin.  The entertainments were given in clubs and cabarets, as well as music halls and theatres. By the early 20th century, there were two national circuits of burlesque shows competing with the [[vaudeville]] circuit, as well as resident companies in New York, such as [[Minsky's Burlesque|Minsky's]] at the Winter Garden.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

The transition from burlesque on the old lines to striptease was gradual. At first, [[soubrette]]s showed off their figures while singing and dancing; some were less active but compensated by appearing in elaborate stage costumes.&lt;ref name=humez&gt;Humez, Nick.

==Novel (1937)==
{{main| Chander Pahar}}

===Plot===
This novel tells the story of an ordinary young Bengali man, [[Shankar Roy Chowdhury (character)|Shankar Roy Chowdhury]], as he adventures in [[Africa]] in the years 1909 and 1910. After graduating from college at 20-years-old, his family's financial struggles almost force him take a job in a [[jute]] mill in Shyamnagar — a prospect he absolutely loathes.

Because loves the subject of geography, he wants to follow the footsteps of renowned explorers like [[David Livingstone|Livingstone]], [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]], and [[Marco Polo]]. He wants to explore the wilderness, passionate for learning about African forests and animals. By a stroke of luck, he gets a job as a clerk at the [[Uganda Railway]] and rushes to Africa without a second thought.

After a few months laying rail tracks, he encounters the first of many dangers in pre-[[World War I]] Africa: a man-eating lion. Later, he takes up a job as station-master in a desolate station amidst the [[Veldt]]s, where he to narrowly escapes a deadly [[black mamba]]. While at this post, Shankar encounters, rescues and nurses Diego Alvarez, a middle-age Portuguese explorer and gold/diamond prospector. Alvarez's arrival becomes a turning point in Shankar's life.

While recovering, Alvarez describes his exploits in Africa with his friend Jim Carter. He explains that, lured by the prosepect of a priceless yellow diamond from a Kaafi village chief, Alvarez and Carter searched for these yellow diamond caves, on the Mountain of the Moon (Chander Pahar) in the [[Richtersveld]]. Rumors suggested a mythical monster, the [[Bunyip]], guards the mine. The explorers set off into the dense jungle, much against the villagers' advice, and Carter was gruesomely killed, supposedly by the Bunyip.
 
Shankar, inspired by Alvarez's exploits, resigns from his job and accompanies Alvarez to venture again for the mines. They meet hardships, like a raging [[volcano]]. Eventually, they get lost in the forests where Alvarez is killed by the [[Bunyip]]. Demoralised, Shankar tries to return to civilization. He finds the Bunyip's cave and the diamond mines by accident. Almost getting lost,  he finds the remains of the Italian explorer, Attilio Gatti, and learns that the cave is in fact the diamond mine.

Leaving, he becomes lost in the deserts of [[Kalahari]] and nearly dies of thirst. Fortunately, he is rescued by a survey team and taken to a hospital in [[Harare|Salisbury]], [[Rhodesia]], from where he sets sail for home. Before going back, he writes his account in a newspaper, earning him money. He names the volcano after Alvarez. He ends the book saying that he will return to the cave one day with a large team, and continue the legacy of Alvarez, Carter, and Gatti.

The '''comedy of humours''' is  a [[genre]] of [[drama]]tic [[comedy]] that focuses on a [[fictional character|character]] or range of characters, each of whom exhibits two or more overriding traits or '[[Humorism|humours]]' that dominates their personality, desires and conduct. This comic technique may be found in [[Aristophanes]], but the [[England|English]] [[playwright]]s [[Ben Jonson]] and [[George Chapman]] popularized the genre in the closing years of the sixteenth century. In the later half of the seventeenth century, it was combined with the [[comedy of manners]] in [[Restoration comedy]]. 

[[Image:Lavater1792.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The four '[[Humourism|humours]]' or temperaments (Clockwise from top right; [[choleric]]; [[Melancholia|melancholic]]; [[Four temperaments#Sanguine|sanguine]]; [[phlegmatic]]).]]
In Jonson’s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (acted 1598), which made this type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] popular, all the words and acts of Kitely are controlled by an overpowering suspicion that his wife is unfaithful; George Downright, a country squire, must be "frank" above all things; the country gull in town determines his every decision by his desire to "catch on" to the manners of the city gallant. 

In his [[Induction (play)|Induction]] to ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'' (1599) Jonson explains his character-formula thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some one peculiar quality&lt;br /&gt;Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw&lt;br /&gt;All his affects, his spirits, and his powers,&lt;br /&gt;In their confluctions, all to run one way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The comedy of humours owes something to earlier vernacular comedy but more to a desire to imitate the classical comedy of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]] and to combat the vogue of [[Shakespearean comedy|romantic comedy]], as developed by [[William Shakespeare]]. The satiric purpose of the comedy of humours and its realistic method lead to more serious character studies with Jonson’s ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''. The humours each had been associated with physical and mental characteristics; the result was a system that was quite subtle in its capacity for describing types of personality.

In fiction, '''continuity''' is consistency of the characteristics of people, plot, objects, and places seen by the reader or viewer over some period of time. It is relevant to several media.

Continuity is particularly a concern in the production of film and television due to the difficulty of rectifying an error in continuity after shooting has wrapped up. It also applies to other art forms, including novels, comics, and [[video games]], though usually on a smaller scale.  It also applies to fiction used by persons, corporations, and governments in the public eye.

Most productions have a [[script supervisor]] on hand whose job is to pay attention to and attempt to maintain continuity across the chaotic and typically non-linear production shoot. This takes the form of a large amount of paperwork, photographs, and attention to and memory of large quantities of detail, some of which is sometimes assembled into the [[Bible (writing)|story bible]] for the production. It usually regards factors both within the scene and often even technical details including meticulous records of camera positioning and equipment settings. The use of a [[Polaroid camera]] was standard but has since been replaced by [[digital camera]]s. All of this is done so that, ideally, all related shots can match, despite perhaps parts being shot thousands of miles and several months apart. It is an inconspicuous job because if done perfectly, no one will ever notice.
 
In comic books, continuity has also come to mean a [[canon (fiction)|set of contiguous events]], sometimes said to be "set in the same [[fictional universe|universe]]."

==Continuity errors==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Futurama]] --&gt;
Most continuity errors are subtle and minor, such as changes in the level of drink in a character's glass or the length of a cigarette, and can be permitted with relative indifference even to the final cut. Others can be more noticeable, such as sudden drastic changes in appearance of a character. Such errors in continuity can ruin the illusion of realism and affect [[suspension of disbelief]].

In cinema, special attention must be paid to continuity because films are rarely shot in the order in which they are presented. The shooting schedule is often dictated by location permit issues. For example, a character may return to [[Times Square]] in New York City several times throughout a movie, but as it is extraordinarily expensive to close off Times Square, those scenes will likely be filmed all at once to reduce permit costs. Weather, the ambience of natural light, cast and crew availability, or any number of other circumstances can also influence a shooting schedule.

=== {{anchor|Attempts to prevent continuity errors in film}} Measures against continuity errors in film ===

Film production companies use various techniques to prevent continuity errors. First would be to film all the shots for a particular scene together, and all shots of consecutive scenes together (if the scenes take place together, with no break between them in the film's timeline). This allows actors to remain in costume, in character, and in the same location (and with the same weather, if shooting on location).

The second major technique is for costume designers, production designers, prop masters, and make-up artists to take instant photographs of actors and sets at the beginning and end of each day's shooting (once made possible by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] cameras, now done with digital cameras and cell phones as well). This allows the various workers to check each day's clothing, set, props, and make-up against a previous day's.

The third is to avoid shooting on location entirely, but instead film everything on a studio set. This allows weather and lighting to be controlled (as the shooting is indoors), and for all clothing and sets to be stored in one place to be hauled out the next day from a secure location.

===Editing errors===
Editing errors can occur when a character in a scene references a scene or incident that has not occurred yet, or of which they should not yet be aware.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

An example of an editing error can be seen in the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), where a scene of people climbing a slope at the start is seen from below and then replayed from above.

===Visual errors===
Visual errors are instant ''discontinuities'' occurring in visual media such as film and television. Items of clothing change colors, shadows get longer or shorter, items within a scene change place or disappear, etc.

One of the earliest examples of a ''visual error'' appears in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[1914 in film|1914]] movie ''[[The Property Man]]''. Here, in a supposedly smooth step from one room to another, [[the Tramp]] loses his hat in one room, but it is instantly back on his head as he enters the next room. Rather "loose" plots and a lack of [[continuity editing]] made most early films rife with such errors.

Another example occurs in the [[1998 in film|1998]] film ''[[Waking Ned]]'', when two of the film's characters, Jackie and Michael, are walking through a storm towards Ned's house. The umbrella they are under is black during their conversation as they walk towards the house (filmed from slightly above and to the front), yet after cutting to a lower shot (filmed from behind Jackie), Michael walks onscreen from the right holding an [[umbrella]] that is not black but beige, with a brown band at the rim.

Yet another glaring example of poor continuity occurs in the Disney film ''[[Pete’s Dragon]]'' (filmed in 1976). During the song "Brazzle Dazzle Day" when Lampie (Mickey Rooney), Pete (Sean Marshall), and Nora (Helen Reddy) climb the stairs to the top of the lighthouse, Pete's shirt beneath his overalls is orange. But after descending to the bottom again and coming out of the lighthouse door, his shirt is now grey.

Though visual continuity errors are logically confined to visual media, parallel mistakes can occur in text. In "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]" in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', a door is ripped off its hinges only to be slowly closed again in the next scene.

===Plot errors===
{{main|Plot hole}}

A plot error, or a plot hole as it's commonly known, reflects a failure in the consistency of the created fictional world. A character might state he was an only child, yet later mention a sibling. In the TV show ''[[Cheers]]'', Frasier Crane's wife Lilith mentions Frasier's parents are both dead. When the character was spun off into ''[[Frasier]]'', his father became a central character with, in a case of [[retroactive continuity]], the explanation that Frasier was embarrassed about his father's lowbrow attitudes and thus claimed his death. This is a frequent occurrence in sitcoms, where networks may agree to continue a show, but only if a certain character is emphasized, leading other minor characters to written out of the show with no further mention of the character's existence, while the emphasized character (usually a [[breakout character]], as in the case of [[Frasier Crane]]) develops a more complete back story that ignores previous, more simplified back stories.

===Homeric Nod===
{{Wiktionary|Homer nods}}
A '''Homeric nod''' (sometimes heard as 'Even Homer nods') is a continuity error. It has its origins in [[Homer]]ic [[epic poetry|epic]].

The [[proverbial phrase]] for it was coined by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars poetica]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Lines 358-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''... et idem'' &lt;br /&gt; ''indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... and yet I also become annoyed whenever the great Homer [[wikt:nod|nod]]s off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are numerous continuity errors in Homer that resemble "nods", as for example:

*In ''[[Iliad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Book V Lines 576-579&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menelaos]] kills a minor character, Pylaimenes, in combat; who is later&lt;ref&gt;Book XIII Lines 643-659&lt;/ref&gt; still alive to witness the death of his son.
*In ''Iliad'' 9.165-93 three characters, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoinix]], [[Odysseus]], and [[Telamonian Aias|Aias]] set out on an embassy to [[Achilleus]]; however, at line 182 the poet uses a verb in the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form to indicate that there are only two people going; at lines 185ff. verbs in the [[plural]] form are used, indicating more than two; but another dual verb appears at line 192 ("the two of them came forward").

In modern [[Homeric scholarship]] many of Homer's "nods" are explicable as the consequences of the poem being retold and improvised by generations of oral poets. So in the second case cited above, it is likely that two different versions are being conflated: one version with an embassy of three people, another with just two people.

[[Alexander Pope]] was inclined to give Homeric nods the benefit of the doubt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those oft are Stratagems which Errors seem,&lt;br /&gt;Nor is it Homer Nods, but We that Dream. - ''[[Essay on Criticism]]'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Modern usage====
In his online column, ''Best of The Web Today'', [[James Taranto]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' often used the phrase "Homer Nods" as the title of a retraction or correction.

===Aging discrepancies===
The practice of accelerating the age of a television character (usually a child or teenager) in conflict with the timeline of a series and/or the real-world progression of time is popularly known as [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome]], or SORAS.&lt;ref name="Rising Stars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3215940&amp;fSectionId=434&amp;fSetId=204 |title=Soaps' rising stars |first=Kim |last=Clayton-Millar |date=April 24, 2006 |work=Tonight |publisher=Independent News &amp; Media |accessdate=December 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children unseen on screen for a time might reappear portrayed by an actor several years older than the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=S. Elizabeth |title=The Audience in Everyday Life: Living in a Media World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtkAqUHwtrIC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=%22soap+opera+sudden+aging+syndrome%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IrVYVYSWxl&amp;sig=dKEAjt43NsvvEgea73UF-lIt1zw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V0sjS6SHCIj-nAeZ9JzuCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22soap%20opera%20sudden%20aging%20syndrome%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 12, 2009 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-94259-4 |page=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually coinciding with a recast, this rapid aging is typically done to open up the character to a wider range of storylines, and to attract younger viewers.&lt;ref name="Rising Stars"/&gt; A recent example of this occurring is in the BBC's ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' series, in which Mordred is initially played by a young child in Season 4, yet suddenly grows up into his late teens in time for the start of Season 5, with the rest of the characters aging by only three years.

The reverse can also happen. On ''[[Lost (TV Series)]]'', the character of 10-year-old [[Walt Lloyd]] was played by 12-year-old [[Malcolm David Kelley]]. The first few seasons took place over the course of just a few months, but by that point Lloyd looked much older than 10. In his remaining few appearances, special effects were used to make him look younger, or the scene took place years later.

==Deliberate continuity errors==

Sometimes a work of fiction may deliberately employ continuity errors, usually for comedy. For example, the [[Marx Brothers]]' classic film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', at the climax of the film, the camera shows a [[shot (filmmaking)|shot]] of [[Groucho Marx]] speaking a line, followed by a shot of something else happening, followed by another shot of Groucho. Each time, Groucho's hat changes, usually to something more outrageous than before (a [[Napoleon]]ic hat, a [[Prussia]]n hat, etc.).

==Dealing with errors==
When continuity mistakes have been made, explanations are often proposed by either writers or fans to smooth over discrepancies. Fans sometimes make up explanations for such errors that may or may not be integrated into [[canon (fiction)|canon]]; this has come to be colloquially known as ''fanwanking'' (a term originally coined by the author [[Craig Hinton]] to describe excessive use of continuity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=AHistory: An Unauthorized History of the ''Doctor Who'' universe |last=Parkin |first=Lance |authorlink=Lance Parkin  |year=2007 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]] |location=Des Moines, Iowa |isbn=978-0-9759446-6-0 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often when fans do not agree with one of the events in a story (such as the death of a favorite character), they will choose to ignore the event in question so that their enjoyment of the franchise is not diminished. When the holder of the intellectual property discards all existing continuity and starts from scratch it is known as [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooting]]. Fans call a less extreme literary technique that erases one episode the [[reset button technique|reset button]]. See also [[Canon (fiction)#Fanon|fanon]].

Discrepancies in past continuity are sometimes made deliberately; this is known as [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ning. Retcons are also sometimes used to either correct or cover up a perceived error. These changes may be made either by the same writer who made it, or more commonly by an author that has taken over the creative lead of a corporate owned show or publication.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Not to be confused with the continuance of a reality (continuality).

==Real time programs vs traditional films==
Television programs like ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', in which actors have to appear as if it is the same day for 24 consecutive episodes, have raised public recognition of continuity. However, traditional films have frequently had much of the same sort of the issues to deal with; film shoots may last several months and as scenes are frequently shot out of story sequence, footage shot weeks apart may be edited together as part of the same day's action in the completed film. In some ways, ''24'' presents a simpler situation, as costumes and hairstyles generally should ''not'' change very frequently; in many feature films a range of different hairstyles and costumes must be created, changed, and then recreated exactly, as various scenes are shot.

''''' Der Bäbu ''''' (''The Baboo'') is a [[Comic opera]] in three acts by [[Heinrich Marschner]]. The German libretto by Wilhelm August Wohlbrück (Marschner's brother-in-law) is based on the book ''The Baboo and Other Tales Descriptive of Society in India. Smith, Elder, and Co., London 1834'' by [[Augustus Prinsep]]. The first performance took place on 19 February 1838 in [[Hanover]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">In [[literature]], the '''deuteragonist''' or '''secondary main character''' (from {{lang-grc|δευτεραγωνιστής}}, ''deuteragōnistḗs'', second actor) is the second most important  character, after the [[protagonist]] and before the [[tritagonist]].&lt;ref name="deut1"&gt;Bartleby.com (2006). [http://www.bartleby.com/61/56/D0175600.html Deuteragonist]&lt;/ref&gt; The deuteragonist may switch between supporting and opposing the protagonist, depending on the deuteragonist's own conflict or plot.

==History==
[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[drama]] began with simply one actor, the protagonist, and a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of dancers. The playwright [[Aeschylus]] introduced the deuteragonist; Aristotle says in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'':

{{Quote
|1={{lang|grc|Καὶ τό τε τῶν ὑποκριτῶν πλῆθος ἐξ ἑνὸς εἰς δύο πρῶτος Αἰσχύλος ἤγαγε καὶ τὰ τοῦ χοροῦ ἠλάττωσε καὶ τὸν λόγον πρωταγωνιστεῖν παρεσκεύασεν}}

''{{lang|grc-Latn|Kai to te tōn hypokritōn plēthos ex enos eis duo prōtos Aiskhilos ēgage kai ta tou khorou ēlattōse kai ton logon prōtagōnistein pareskeuasen}}''

Thus, it was Aeschylus who first raised the number of the actors from one to two. He also curtailed the chorus and made the dialogue be the leading part.
|2=[[Aristotle]]
|3=[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]] (1449a15)&lt;ref name="deut2"&gt;Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a Aristotle, ''Poetics'']&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Aeschylus' efforts brought the dialogue and interaction between characters to the forefront and set the stage for other playwrights of the era, like [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], to produce many iconic plays.&lt;ref name="deut3"&gt;TheatreHistory.com (2006). [http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/aeschylus001.html "Aeschylus and his Tragedies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drama==
Because [[Ancient Greek drama]] involved only three actors (the protagonist, deuteragonist, and tritagonist) plus the chorus, each actor often played several parts. For instance, in Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', the protagonist would be [[Oedipus]], who is on stage in most acts, the deuteragonist would be [[Jocasta]] (Oedipus' mother and wife), as well as the Shepherd and Messenger. This would be because Jocasta is certainly a major role&amp;mdash;acting opposite Oedipus many times and occupying a central part of the story&amp;mdash;and because the Shepherd and Messenger are onstage when Jocasta is offstage.&lt;ref name="deut4"&gt;Wayne S. Turney (2006). [http://www.wayneturney.20m.com/oedipus.htm Sophokles' ''Oedipus Rex'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
In literature, the deuteragonist often assumes the role of "[[sidekick]]" to the protagonist. In [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', the protagonist is [[Huckleberry Finn (character)|Huck]] and the deuteragonist, his constant companion, is [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]]. In this story the tritagonist would be [[Tom Sawyer]].&lt;ref name="deut5"&gt;Dr. L. Kip Wheeler (2006). [http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_T.html Literary Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the deuteragonist could also be a particularly visible [[antagonist]], normally whom the actual antagonist hides behind. In some cases, the deuteragonist is a sidekick who is also used as a foil for the protagonist, in order to more greatly enhance the powers or strengths of the main character. [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John Watson]], for example, in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] series by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], is an educated and intelligent gentleman of professional standing, and yet his own intelligence is of too rigid a stance to embrace fully the kind of possibilities of which the more maverick [[Sherlock Holmes]] is capable.

The title "Dirty John" came from one of John Meehan's nicknames given to him by his classmates during his time at the [[University of Dayton]]. Other nicknames from this time included Filthy John or just Filthy. The exact nexus of these nicknames was never divulged during the podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-dirty-john-filthy/#nt=outfit46 |title= Dirty John Part 3: Filthy - Los Angeles Times |accessdate=November 23, 2017 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Dirty John'' is a [[true crime]] story focusing on the life and exploits of John Meehan. ''[[L.A. Times]]'' journalist Christopher Goffard first heard of Meehan when he learned that the police were investigating a possible murder in [[Newport Beach]]. Upon investigating, Goffard discovered a bizarre web of deceit and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

The main focus of the story is Meehan's relationship with businesswoman Debra Newell, whom he met via an [[Online dating service|Internet dating]] site, as well as her immediate and extended family. The podcast deals with themes of abuse and manipulation, as well as the behaviours of those being abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/13/dirty-john-your-chilling-new-true-obsession-podcasts-of-the-week |title=  Dirty John, your chilling new true crime obsession – podcasts of the week |accessdate=November 23, 2017 |language=English|newspaper=  The Guardian |date=  2017-10-13 |last1=  Verdier |first1=  Hannah |last2=  Slaney |first2=  Rowan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meehan himself was killed by Newell's youngest daughter Terra, who acted in self-defense when he tried to kill her on the rooftop parking lot of her apartment building on August 20, 2016. He was hospitalized and died on the 24th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-stabbing-20160825-story.html|title=Man dies after being stabbed by woman he assaulted with knife, police say|first=Hannah|last=Fry|date=|website=latimes.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was covered by ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' on January 12, 2018, and included interviews with Goffard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/11/dateline-nbc-dirty-john-episode-clip/|title=See Terra Newell describe her showdown with 'Dirty John' Meehan in exclusive 'Dateline NBC' clip|author=|date=|website=ew.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/coercive-control-potential-factor-dirty-john-case-psychological-abuse-n837361|title=‘Coercive control’ potential factor in ‘Dirty John’ case of psychological abuse|author=|date=|website=nbcnews.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/KNTV_20180113_060000_Dateline_NBC|title=Dateline NBC : KNTV : January 12, 2018 10:00pm-11:01pm PST|author=|date=13 January 2018|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dayton.com/news/local/former-dayton-woman-talk-about-marriage-dirty-john-dateline/tvPMd3uVFi47hFe2oNa1JL/|title=Former Dayton woman to talk about marriage to ‘Dirty John’ on Dateline|author=|date=|website=dayton.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-3t6vI8Xwo|title=Dirty John - Christopher Goffard speaks about his story - Dirty John Podcast|first=|last=Podcasts Dirty John by Wondery|date=21 January 2018|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVqPWWoFyalOCIwjROCK8yg|title=Podcasts Dirty John by Wondery|author=|date=|website=YouTube|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dotto''''' is an [[Americans|American]] [[television]] game show that was a combination of a general knowledge quiz and the children's game [[connect the dots]]. [[Jack Narz]] served as the program's host, with [[Colgate-Palmolive]] as its presenting sponsor. ''Dotto'' rose to become the highest rated daytime program in television history, as of 1958.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Dotto'' replaced ''[[Strike It Rich (radio-TV)|Strike it Rich]]'' in CBS's 11:30 am daytime time slot on January 6, 1958. In a rare instance of two networks programming the same show, a weekly nighttime edition was launched on July 1, 1958 on CBS's competitor [[NBC]] on Tuesday nights in their 9:00{{nbsp}}p.m. slot. At the height of both shows' popularity, ''Dotto'' was abruptly cancelled without public explanation over the weekend of August 16, 1958. Soon after, Dotto was publicly revealed to have been fixed by its producer, tarnishing the show's reputation and setting the stage for legal and political investigation of the [[1950s quiz show scandals|fixing of 1950s quiz shows]].

==Gameplay==
Two contestants, one a returning champion, competed in each game.

The object of the game was to identify the subject of an incomplete portrait drawing, which was accomplished by answering questions and connecting dots. The champion and the challenger were both given their own version of the portrait, which contained fifty dots for each contestant to connect. The contestants were positioned on stage in a manner where neither one could see the other or their progress. There was also an overhead projector on stage that was called the "Dottograph", which would come into play as the game progressed.
                     
Play in each game started with the challenger and he/she was given a category along with a choice of three questions, each with a corresponding number of dots to connect. The questions were worth five, eight, or ten dots and more dots meant a higher difficulty. Answering correctly enabled the challenger to have his/her dots connected, but a wrong answer or failure to answer gave that privilege to the champion. 

To further assist the contestants in identifying the subjects of the portrait, three clues were provided. These were unlocked once a contestant reached a certain number of connections. The first required a total of twenty-five connections, the second thirty-five, and the last forty-five.

At any point in the game, including during the opposing player's turn, a contestant could signal that he/she knew the answer by pressing a button. Narz would then direct that contestant to walk to the Dottograph, which the opposing player could not see, and write that answer on the projecto  screen.

After the answer was recorded, Narz would reveal if the contestant had answered correctly. If he/she did, the opponent was given one last chance to force a tie and play on by correctly identifying the subject based on his/her own progress during the game; if he/she could not do so the first contestant won the game. If the first contestant was incorrect, the opponent automatically won the game. 

The winning player won money for each unconnected dot left on his/her picture, and the amount increased for each tie up to two. On the daytime series, the payout was $10 per dot and it doubled for each tie up to a maximum of $40. On the nighttime series, the payout was $100 per dot and increased by that amount for each tie, resulting in a maximum of $300 per dot.

After a game was completed, usually during the middle of each episode, a "Home Viewer Dotto" game was played, in which a person selected by postcard drawing was called by [[telephone]] live on the air for a chance to guess the person being drawn. If correct, the home viewer won a new car or other valuable prizes, and if incorrect, the viewer received a consolation prize (the daytime version gave away a supply of products advertised by the show's sponsor, [[Colgate-Palmolive]], while the nighttime version gave away a [[Tourism|trip]]). At the end of each episode, additional dots were connected and a clue was displayed for the next episode's "Home Viewer Dotto" game.&lt;ref name="dottopartial2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/investigationoft01unit|title=Investigation of television quiz shows.

==Broadcast history==
''Dotto'' debuted on January 6, 1958 at 11:30{{nbsp}}a.m., replacing the long-running (and controversial) [[Warren Hull]] game ''[[Strike It Rich (radio-TV)|Strike It Rich]]''. Facing [[Bob Barker]]'s ''[[Truth or Consequences]]'' on [[NBC]] and local programming on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (who [[1957–1958 United States network television schedule (weekday)|had not programmed at 11:30]] in three years), within six months ''Dotto'' became the highest-rated quiz program of the year, and Narz achieved a popularity equal to that of [[Hal March]] on ''[[The $64,000 Question]]''.

The show became so popular that on July 1 a weekly nighttime version began on [[NBC]] with the same format. On NBC's July 29 episode, a contestant on the show, actress and model [[Connie Hines]] had a telegram read on air with Columbia Pictures stating interest in her as an actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Fun &amp; Games Channel|title=Dotto (July 29, 1958): Connie vs John|date=2015-01-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP-85A7IyNs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=114|accessdate=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hines later became famous as Carol Post on the popular comedy ''[[Mister Ed]]''.

===Scandal and cancellation===
''Dotto'''s downfall began with a backstage discovery in May 1958. A notebook belonging to contestant (and later journalist) [[Marie Winn]] was found by stand-by contestant, Edward Hilgemeier Jr., who realized that the notebook included questions and answers to be used during Winn's appearances, one of which was against a woman named Yaffe Kimball. He tore out the relevant pages of the notebook for himself. Hilgemeier then told Kimball after her onstage loss that her competitor had been given answers in advance. Hilgemeier later reported that ''Dotto's'' producers paid him $1,500 to keep quiet about his discovery, and Kimball, as the loser of a fixed match, $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/154370718|title=28 Aug 1958, Page 6 - The News Journal at Newspapers.com|newspaper=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dotto'' on CBS, meanwhile, grew in popularity as 1958 went on and became the highest rated Daytime show on the air.&lt;ref name="dottopartial2" /&gt;

Hilgemeier Jr. eventually decided to break his silence. He contacted the [[Colgate-Palmolive]] company on approximately August 8, 1958 with his story, which was then relayed to CBS. Executives at [[CBS]] and the show's sponsor quickly moved to confirm the allegation internally and worked the issue between August 11 and 16.&lt;ref name="dottopartial2" /&gt; CBS executive vice president Thomas Fisher tested [[kinescope]]s of the show against Winn's notebook and concluded that the show looked fixed. Executives at CBS series met with its creator, Frank Cooper, concerning the potential rigging of the show on the evening of Friday, August 15.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.memorabletv.com/features/august-15-1958-the-day-the-house-began-to-fall-dotto-and-the-great-quiz-show-scandal/|title=August 15, 1958 - The Day the House Began to Fall - Dotto and the Great Quiz Show Scandal {{!}} Memorable TV|date=2015-10-16|newspaper=Memorable TV|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper admitted that the show was indeed fixed, and CBS then reported these findings to NBC as the hosts of the nighttime version. Over the weekend of August 16, both the CBS daytime and NBC primetime series were cancelled.&lt;ref name="dottopartial2"/&gt; In the meantime, in an August 18 affidavit, Hilgemeier complained to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (as he did to Colgate-Palmolive) that ''Dotto'' was fixed. In interviews, host Jack Narz stated that he was not notified of ''Dotto's'' cancellation until some point after the final episodes had been recorded. Narz was later subpoenaed and took a polygraph test, the results indicating that he was not connected to the fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/arts/television/17narz.html "Jack Narz, 85, Genial Host of Television Game Shows, Dies"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 16, 2008. Accessed October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS immediately moved its game show ''Top Dollar'', hosted by [[Warren Hull]], to ''Dotto''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s 11:30{{nbsp}}a.m. time slot on Monday, August 18. A live studio audience expecting to be seated for Monday's episode of ''Dotto'' was instead set up as an audience for ''Top Dollar''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Viewers were greeted by the opening, “Dotto, the program which normally airs at this time, will no longer be seen. Instead...welcome to ''Top Dollar''!”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The final NBC nighttime weekly episode aired on August 12, 1958; the next week its Tuesday time slot was replaced with "a filmed drama series".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/1482073|title=Alton Evening Telegraph from Alton, Illinois &amp;middot; Page 16|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dotto's cancellation on both CBS and NBC was quickly established as fact on August 18, but the reason for why it was cancelled took days to be confirmed by the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

===Aftermath===
{{See also|1950s quiz show scandals}}
Although it was not the first show to be involved in some wrongdoing, ''Dotto'' was the first game show to have such wrongdoing verified. A year earlier, ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'' contestant [[Herb Stempel]] told the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'' that his run as champion on the series had been choreographed and that he had been ordered to purposely lose his championship to [[Charles Van Doren]]. Stempel's statements gained more credibility once the match fixing at ''Dotto'' was publicized, and investigations (in the form of a grand jury, and later, congressional hearings) followed.

Jack Narz eventually replaced Warren Hull as host of ''Top Dollar'' by November 1958. That series ran in daytime until October 23, 1959. [[Jack Narz|Narz]] continued to work as a game show host for most of the next twenty years after ''Top Dollar'' ended.

Frank Cooper would never do another game show after ''Dotto,'' which was his longest-running game and his only one for CBS. His previous gaming efforts did not fare as well &amp;ndash; his first game, an NBC show called ''Guess What Happened?'' (dropping the "Guess" after the first show), bombed after three episodes in 1952. ''Droodles,'' starring [[Roger Price (comedy)|Roger Price]], ran for three months in 1954 while ABC's ''[[Keep It in the Family (U.S. game show)|Keep It in the Family]]'' ran for four months from 1957-1958.

Connie Hines was revealed to have been coached for her ''Dotto'' appearance, but unlike Marie Winn, she was not given questions and answers in advance. She enjoyed a five-year run as Carol Post on ''[[Mister Ed]]'' and, after a few subsequent television guest roles, retired from acting entirely.

Marie Winn eventually became a journalist whose books include ''[[The Plug-In Drug]]'', a scathing critique on television's influence over children. The book became somewhat controversial for its author having been circumspect about her role in one of the medium's greatest scandals.

===Revival===

It was only in 2013 that [[RTBF]] revived the game in digitized form.

In 2014, it was announced that a revival of ''Dotto'' for French Television is in the works (entitled ''Fizzio'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c21media.net/global-hubert-rework-dotto/ Global, Hubert rework Dotto]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign versions==
''Dotto'' was also hugely successful in the [[United Kingdom]], where it ran on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from September 13, 1958 to June 23, 1960. This version was first hosted by Robert Gladwell, followed by [[Jimmy Hanley]] and then [[Shaw Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Dotto UK Game Shows: ''Dotto'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episode status==
Although the series was presumably intact in 1958 (see above), the series is believed to have been [[wiping|destroyed]] sometime afterward as per network practices (and possibly by Colgate's insistence).

Two episodes are known to exist &amp;ndash; a daytime episode from May 20 featuring Marie Winn's victory over Yaffe Kimball-Slatin (which was subject to the rigging controversy, see above), and the third-to-last nighttime episode from July 29 featuring Connie Hines.

'''Dramatic monologue''', also known as a [[persona]] poem, is a type of poetry written in the form of a speech of an individual character. [[M.H. Abrams]] notes the following three features of the ''dramatic monologue'' as it applies to poetry:
{{Quotation|
# A single person, who is patently ''not'' the poet, utters the speech that makes up the whole of the poem, in a specific situation at a critical moment […].
# This person addresses and interacts with one or more other people; but we know of the auditors' presence, and what they say and do, only from clues in the discourse of the single speaker.
# The main principle controlling the poet's choice and formulation of what the lyric speaker says is to reveal to the reader, in a way that enhances its interest, the speaker's temperament and character.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, gen. ed. "Dramatic Monologue." ''A Glossary of Literary Terms.'' 8th ed. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth, 2005. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Types of dramatic  monologue==

One of the most important influences on the development of the dramatic monologue  is [[romantic poetry]]. However, the long, personal lyrics typical of the Romantic period are not dramatic monologues, in the sense that they do not, for the most part, imply a concentrated narrative. Poems such as [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]'' and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[Mont Blanc (poem)|Mont Blanc]]'', to name two famous examples, offered a model of close psychological observation and philosophical or pseudo-philosophical inquiry described in a specific setting.  The [[conversation poems]] of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] are perhaps a better precedent. The genre was also developed by [[Felicia Hemans]] and [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], beginning in the latter's case with her long poem ''The Improvisatrice''.&lt;ref&gt;Serena Baiesi. ''Letitia Elizabeth Landon and Metrical Romance'', 2009, p.56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel and plays have also been important influences on the dramatic monologue, particularly as a means of characterization. Dramatic monologues are a way of expressing the views of a character and offering the audience greater insight into that character's feelings. Dramatic monologues can also be used in novels to tell stories, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', and to implicate the audience in moral judgments, as in [[Albert Camus]] ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]'' and [[Mohsin Hamid]]'s ''[[The Reluctant Fundamentalist]]''.

== Examples ==

The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period represented the high point of the dramatic monologue in English poetry.

*[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s ''[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]'', published in 1842, has been called the first true dramatic monologue. After ''Ulysses'', Tennyson's most famous efforts in this vein are ''Tithonus'', ''The Lotos-Eaters,'' and ''St. Simon Stylites,'' all from the 1842 ''[[Poems (Tennyson, 1842)|Poems]]''; later monologues appear in other volumes, notably ''[[Idylls of the King]]''.
*[[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''[[Dover Beach]]'' and ''Stanzas from the Grand Chartreuse'' are famous, semi-autobiographical monologues. The former, usually regarded as the supreme expression of the growing [[scepticism (philosophy)|scepticism]] of the mid-Victorian period, was published along with the latter in 1867's ''New Poems.''
*[[Robert Browning]] produced his most famous work in this form. While ''[[My Last Duchess]]'' is the most famous of his monologues, the form dominated his writing career. ''[[The Ring and the Book]]'', ''[[Fra Lippo Lippi (poem)|Fra Lippo Lippi]]'', ''[[Caliban upon Setebos]]'', ''[[Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister]]'' and ''[[Porphyria's Lover]]'', as well as the other poems in ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]'' are just a handful of Browning's monologues.

Other Victorian poets also used the form.  [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] wrote several, including ''Jenny'' and ''The Blessed Damozel''; [[Christina Rossetti]] wrote a number, including ''The Convent Threshold.'' [[Augusta Webster]]'s ''A Castaway,'' ''Circe'', and ''The Happiest Girl In The World'', [[Amy Levy]]'s ''Xantippe'' and ''A Minor Poet,'' and [[Felicia Hemans]]'s ''Arabella Stuart'' and ''Properzia Rossi'' are all exemplars of this technique. [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s ''[[Hymn to Proserpine]]'' has been called a dramatic monologue vaguely reminiscent of Browning's work. Some American poets have also written poems in the genre- famous examples include [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[The Raven]] and [[Sylvia Plath]]'s [[Daddy (poem)|Daddy]].

Post-Victorian examples include [[William Butler Yeats]]'s ''The Gift of Harun al-Rashid'', [[Elizabeth Bishop]]'s ''Crusoe in England'', and [[T.S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]'' and ''[[Gerontion]]''.

'''Entertainment technology''' is the discipline of using manufactured or created components to enhance or make possible any sort of [[entertainment]] experience.  Because entertainment categories are so broad, and because entertainment models the world in many ways, the types of implemented technology are derived from a variety of sources.  Thus, in theatre, for example, entertainment technology practitioners must be able to design and construct [[scenery]], install electrical systems, build clothing, use motors if there is [[scenery automation]],{{clarify|date=January 2018}} provide plumbing (if functioning kitchen fixtures are required, or if "singing in the rain"), etc. In this way, the entertainment technology field intersects with most other types of technology.

Traditionally, entertainment technology is derived from theatrical [[stagecraft]], and stagecraft is an important subset of the discipline. However, the rise of new types and venues for entertainment, as well as rapidly advancing technological development, has increased the range and scope of its practice.

Entertainment technology includes:

*[[Scenery]] [[Manufacturing|fabrication]]
*[[Theatrical property|Properties]]
*[[Costume]]
*[[Lighting]]
*[[Sound]]
*[[Video]]
*[[Show control]]
*[[Automation]]
*[[Animatronics]]
*Interactive environments
*[[Computer simulation]]

In animation and game design, the phrase "entertainment technology" refers to a very real world of [[entertainment]] experiences made possible by the advent of primarily computer-mediated digital technologies.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

== History ==
Entertainment Technology can be traced back to the “Pre-digital Age.” The invention of the first phonograph machine, which is used to record and playback sound, dates back to 1877 by inventor Thomas Edison. There has been a significant progression from that antiquated modality of entertainment. From silent films (which also gave way to the art of creative storytelling using moving pictures) to the digital age, in which we now see growth on a global scale and, relative to earlier inventions, an extremely fast pace. By comparison, from the invention of the phonograph machine in 1877 to the invention of the first motion picture camera by Louis Lumiere in 1895 shows a gap of 18 years between significant entertainment technology inventions. Whereas compact discs were introduced in the 1980’s and within the next 10 years, satellite television was introduced. More recent developments in entertainment technology are sometimes considered to be a “race” in terms of which company will develop and distribute their product first. Knowing what we have available to us and where it all began can be used as a footnote in our ever-increasing development of entertainment and other technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6182692|title=IEEE Xplore Full-Text PDF:|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on Society ==
Society has completely been changed and advanced in many different ways by all the advancements in entertainment technology. Ranging from how companies get their product name out and get customers to buy into that product, to how people come into contact with one another and how we converse. Media and entertainment have become such a huge part of everyone’s life. We are all invested in some kind of media whether it is a tv show or a vlog and the producer of those are all very aware of the consumption of their product and will try to advertise it in as many ways as possible. They will reach out and promote their form of entertainment by having it on multiple platforms. Media companies will share their product on many different popular websites and forms of social media and ask its consumers to share it as well, generating more views and continuously advancing their products notoriety. Millions of dollars have been spent on Artificial Intelligence. Companies use AI because it is so detailed and precise with all of its obtained knowledge, they will use it to help market their brand because AI knows exactly what people like and what they want to see and will put together the final product that will succeed the most. Entertainment websites and websites that sell goods maintain and expand their viewers and customers by advertising something new you haven’t seen before when you are done with what you originally visited the website for. A big reason why a company became so successful and became so popular is that they bundled everything people want into a smaller collection, instead of having a much larger bundle that only included a couple items a consumer wants. Virtual reality is giving us a new way to experience the world. You can travel to see your favorite live event anywhere in the world without even having to leave your house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2017/04/25/top-six-digital-transformation-trends-in-media-and-entertainment/#311c80936729|title=Top Six Digital Transformation Trends In Media And Entertainment|last=Newman|first=Daniel|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-bringing-tv-life-digital-video-transformation-strategies|title=Digital Transformation in Media and Entertainment - Accenture|website=www.accenture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples  ==

===== Virtual Reality =====
A three dimensional, computer generated simulation of a real seeming environment brought on by the use of special electronic equipment. This technology is used to replace the user’s entire real world environment with a computer generated (or simulated) one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.Overview.html|title=VIRTUAL REALITY - Overview|website=archive.ncsa.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Augmented Reality   =====
An interactive technology that intertwines computer generated images with real world objects. These artificial images can align with or block the real world environment. This technology is used to alter the user’s perception of the real world which should not to be confused with virtual reality in which the user’s whole perception is changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/augmented-reality.html|title=Augmented Reality - definition of Augmented Reality, Meaning of Augmented Reality, BuzzWord from Macmillan Dictionary.|website=www.macmillandictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== High Dynamic Range =====
A rich visual and audio experience that provides a greater contrast than standard dynamic range. This technology is most associated with display devices, sound recording, 3D rendering, and photography. Technology like this provides a more lifelike image in the visual aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/dynamic-range.htm|title=Understanding Dynamic Range in Digital Photography|website=www.cambridgeincolour.com|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Light Field Devices   =====
A device (usually a camera) that captures information about the light field that is emerging from a real life scene which is; the direction of the light rays in space and the intensity of the light in the actual environment/scene. This technology will someday surpass Virtual Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117075834/http://www.time4.com/time4/microsites/popsci/howitworks/lightfield_camera.html|title=PopSci's How It Works - 100 Megapixel Camera|date=2008-01-17|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future Developments ==
Video streaming is becoming a huge part of society in this day and age and it’s only beginning to expand. Video streaming brought in a revenue of $30.29 billion in 2016 and based on projections conducted by Research and Markets, will reach an astonishing $70.05 billion in the year 2021. This projected drastic increase has caused there to be more competition in streaming, which has led to rapid growth, development, and a large increase in the amount of users. Technology is a data based driven field, and with this rapid growth the future is bright for this field. Technology has been enhancing discoveries for as long as it’s been invented. It holds the digital power to entertain, inform, and persuade. Technology will continue to provide all of these sentiments and will continue to do so for as long as developments keep forthcoming. Rapid growth and development does not only affect the consumers, but the producers. Large technology companies will have improve content quality of all while extracting maximum value of the product. Challenges for development in the media industry are how to maximize content, brands, and advertising. While also created tailoring consumers needs to enhance their experience. Consumers drive this field, companies are constantly running data about consumers preferences, relationships, habits, and locations. Technology is a growing field and with companies beginning to care more about the consumers, and with rapid growing development in this field, expect technology to take bigger steps forward in years to come.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/media-and-entertainment-industry-outlook-trends.html|title=2018 Media and Entertainment Industry Trends {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-mission/technology-to-shape-the-future-of-media-entertainment-a1e3acd3b3ac|title=Technology to Shape the Future of Media &amp; Entertainment.|last=DataArt|date=2018-01-09|website=Medium|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Schools that offer programs or degrees in entertainment technology include:

* [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Entertainment Technology Center]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etc.cmu.edu/ Entertainment Technology Center].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New York City College of Technology]], Department of Entertainment Technology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entertainmenttechnology.org/ Entertainment Technology], [[New York City College of Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[University of Southern California]], Entertainment Technology Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ Entertainment Technology Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526035103/https://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ |date=2009-05-26 }}, [[University of Southern California]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tshwane University of Technology]], Pretoria, South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tut.ac.za/ Tshwane University of Technology], South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Entertainment Technology Training, New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toiwhakaari.ac.nz/study-at-toi-whakaari/entertainment-technology Entertainment Technology Training], New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently,{{when|date=January 2018}} the only university offering a degree specifically in Entertainment Engineering and Design (EED) is the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV).{{fact|date=January 2018}} Because UNLV's program is in its infancy, current entertainment technologists come from a wide variety of educational backgrounds, the most prevalent of which are theater and mechanical technology. Several other institutions of higher education offer similar programs for entertainment-related ventures.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

A bachelor's degree in these areas will typically have a difference of only a few specialized classes.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Traditionally, people interested in careers in this field either presented themselves as apprentices within craft unions, or attended college programs in theatre technology. Although both are appropriate in limited ways, the growing world of entertainment technology encompasses many different types of performance and display environments than the theatre. To this end, newer opportunities have arisen that provide a wider educational base than these more traditional environments. An article "Rethinking Entertainment Technology Education" by John Huntington describes new teaching philosophies that resonate with the need for a richer and more flexible educational environment:&lt;ref name="huntington02"&gt;{{cite journal

{{quote|"We need to bridge the worlds of ivory-tower theatre education with the commercial world of live entertainment production. I believe this bridge would be beneficial not just to the technical students, but to the whole art of performance. When high-tech systems such as video, moving lights, computerized sound, mechanized scenery and show control are mastered by even average entertainment technicians, they can advance the state of their craft, which will allow artists to advance the state of their art."&lt;ref name="huntington02" /&gt;}}

==Summary==
The definition of an extreme sport is not exact and the origin of the term is unclear, but it gained popularity in the 1990s when it was picked up by [[marketing]] companies to promote the [[X Games]] and when the [[Extreme Sports Channel]] and the Extreme Sports Company launched. More recently, the commonly used definition from research is  "a competitive (comparison or self-evaluative) activity within which the participant is subjected to natural or unusual physical and mental challenges such as speed, height, depth or natural forces and where fast and accurate cognitive perceptual processing may be required for a successful outcome" by Dr. Rhonda Cohen (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/view/creators/Cohen=3ARhonda=3A=3A.html The relationship between personality, sensation seeking, reaction time and sport participation: evidence from drag racers, sport science students and archers].

While use of the term "extreme sport" has spread everywhere to describe a multitude of different activities, exactly which sports are considered 'extreme' is debatable. There are, however, several characteristics common to most extreme sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cqresearcherblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/what-athletes-told-me.html|title=What the Athletes Told Me|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not the exclusive domain of youth, extreme sports tend to have a younger-than-average target demographic. Extreme sports are rarely sanctioned by schools.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Extreme sports tend to be more solitary than traditional sports&lt;ref name="americansportsdata.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |title='Generation Y' drives increasingly popular... |date=August 1, 2002 |publisher=AmericanSportsData.com |accessdate=2008-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162957/http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (rafting and paintballing are notable exceptions, as they are done in teams). In addition, beginning extreme athletes tend to work on their craft without the guidance of a coach (though some may hire a coach later).

Activities categorized by media as extreme sports differ from traditional [[sport]]s due to the higher number of inherently uncontrollable variables. These environmental variables are frequently weather and terrain related, including wind, snow, water and mountains. Because these natural phenomena cannot be controlled, they inevitably affect the outcome of the given activity or event.

In a traditional sporting event, athletes compete against each other under controlled circumstances. While it is possible to create a controlled sporting event such as X Games, there are environmental variables that cannot be held constant for all athletes. Examples include changing snow conditions for [[snowboard]]ers, rock and ice quality for [[climbing|climbers]], and wave height and shape for [[surfing|surfers]].

Whilst traditional sporting judgment criteria may be adopted when assessing performance (distance, time, score, etc.), extreme sports performers are often evaluated on more subjective and aesthetic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Jungmin Lee (2004), [https://ideas.repec.org/p/ecm/nasm04/122.html Extreme Sports Evaluation: Evidence from Judging Figure Skating, Econometric Society]&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a tendency to reject unified judging methods, with different sports employing their own ideals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/06/19/DI2006061900992.html|title='Adrenaline': Extreme Sports|accessdate=2008-07-11 | work=The Washington Post | first1=Jon | last1=Wile | first2=Sonny | last2=Amato | date=2006-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed having the ability to evolve their assessment standards with new trends or developments in the sports.

==Classification==
While the exact definition and what is included as extreme sport is debatable, some attempted to make classification for extreme sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomlinson, Joe |title=Extreme Sports: In Search of the Ultimate Thrill |publisher=Firefly Books Ltd |location=Hove |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-55297-992-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument is that to qualify as an "extreme sport" '''both''' expression terms need to be fulfilled;
* "'''sport'''": The participant has to dispose of considerable skill and/or physical ability to avoid ''poor execution of the activity'';
* "'''extreme'''": ''poor execution of the activity'' has to result in considerable risk of serious physical harm to the participant;

Along this definition, an activity such as [[bungee jumping]] may not qualify as no skill or physical ability is required to execute a good jump (i.e., avoid poor execution). A passenger in a canyon [[jet boat]] ride will not fulfill the requirements, as the skill required pertains to the pilot, not the passengers. "[[Thrill seeking]]" might in these cases be a more suitable qualification than "extreme sport".{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Extreme sports may be subdivided into:

===Extreme vehicle sports===

These sports require the use of  snow, ice or water sports ("sports de glisse" in French) and '''rolling''' sports. Another subdivision can be made along '''motorized''' and '''non motorized''' vehicle sports, resulting in the following matrix;{{cn|date=July 2018}}

{| class="wikitable"

!  !! Gliding !! Rolling
|-
| '''Motorized''' || [[Offshore powerboat racing]], [[Wakeboarding]], [[Water skiing]], [[Air racing]], [[Gliding]] || [[Motorcycle racing]], [[Rallying]], [[Motocross]]

===Extreme non-vehicle sports===

No vehicle is required ([[rock climbing]], [[canyoning]], [[ice climbing]], [[parkour]], [[psicobloc]] etc.){{cn|date=August 2018}}

== History ==

[[File:ExtremeSports3.png|right|thumb|upright=2]]

The origin of the divergence of the term "extreme sports" from "sports" may date to the 1950s in the appearance of a phrase usually, but wrongly, attributed to [[Ernest Hemingway]].&lt;ref name="Ernest Hemingway FAQ part 5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timelesshemingway.com/content/quotationsfaq#threesports |title=Ernest Hemingway FAQ part 5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203013838/http://www.timelesshemingway.com/content/quotationsfaq |archivedate=February 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The implication of the phrase was that the word "sport" defined an activity in which one might be killed. The other activities being termed "games". The phrase may have been invented by either writer [[Barnaby Conrad]] or automotive author [[Ken Purdy]].&lt;ref name="Ernest Hemingway FAQ part 5"/&gt;

The [[Dangerous Sports Club]] of [[Oxford University]], [[England]] was founded by [[David Kirke (bungee jumper)|David Kirke]], Chris Baker, Ed Hulton and [[Alan Weston]]. They first came to wide public attention by inventing modern day [[bungee jumping]], by making the first modern jumps on 1 April 1979, from the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]], [[Bristol, England]]. They followed the Clifton Bridge effort with a jump from the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (including the first female bungee jump by Jane Wilmot), and with a televised leap from the [[Royal Gorge]] Suspension Bridge in [[Colorado]], sponsored by and televised on the popular [[United States|American]] television program ''[[That's Incredible!]]'' [[Bungee jumping]] was treated as a novelty for a few years, then became a craze for young people, and is now an established industry for thrill seekers.
The Club also pioneered a surrealist form of skiing, holding three events at [[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], in which competitors were required to devise a sculpture mounted on skis and ride it down a mountain. The event reached its limits when the Club arrived in St. Moritz with a London [[double-decker bus]], wanting to send it down the ski slopes, and the Swiss resort managers refused.

Other Club activities included expedition [[hang gliding]] from active [[volcano]]es; the launching of giant (60&amp;nbsp;ft) plastic spheres with pilots suspended in the centre ([[zorbing]]); [[microlight]] flying; and [[BASE jumping]] (in the early days of this sport).

In recent decades the term ''extreme sport'' was further promoted after the [[Extreme Sports Channel]], Extreme.com launched and then the X Games, a multi-sport event was created and developed by [[ESPN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-364109.html |title=extreme sports |year=2007 |publisher=[[Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023120444/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-364109.html |archivedate=2008-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15836448.html |title=Generation Ex – the Extreme Games, a competition for people with exceptional athletic talents |year=1994 |author=Josh Krulewitz |work=American Fitness |via=[[HighBeam]]|subscription=yes |accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first X Games (known as 1995 Extreme Games) were held in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Mount Snow]], and [[Vermont]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589555/Extreme_Sports.html |publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia |title=Extreme Sports – Encarta |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwc2bMeg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589555/Extreme_Sports.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutXGames&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expn.go.com/intl/s/about.html |title=About International X Games |year=2002 |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829202819/http://expn.go.com/intl/s/about.html |archivedate=2008-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain extreme sports clearly trace back to other extreme sports, or combinations thereof. For example, [[windsurfing]] was conceived as a result of efforts to equip a [[surfing|surfboard]] with a [[Sailing|sailing boat's]] propulsion system (mast and sail). [[Kitesurfing]] on the other hand was conceived by combining the propulsion system of [[kite buggying]] (a [[parafoil]]) with the bi-directional boards used for [[wakeboarding]]. [[Wakeboarding]] is in turn derived from [[snowboarding]] and [[waterskiing]].

== Marketing ==
[[File:Hanggliding03042006.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hang glider]] launching from [[Mount Tamalpais]]]]
Some contend&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE5DD133DF93BA35751C0A96E958260 "Extreme Sport, Extreme Chic, Extreme Hype"], ''New York Times'', February 8, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one has as much to do with marketing as with the level of danger involved or the adrenaline generated. For example, rugby union is both dangerous and adrenaline-inducing but is not considered an extreme sport due to its traditional image, and because it does not involve high speed or an intention to perform [[stunt]]s (the aesthetic criteria mentioned above) and also it does not have changing environmental variables for the athletes.

== Motivation ==
[[File:Snowboarder cornice at sugarbowl.jpg|right|thumb|Snowboarder drops off a cornice.]]
A feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce an [[adrenaline]] rush in participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |date=August 1, 2002 |title='Generation Y' Drives Increasingly Popular... |publisher=AmericanSportsData.com |accessdate=2008-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162957/http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the medical view is that the rush or high associated with the activity is not due to adrenaline being released as a response to fear, but due to increased levels of [[dopamine]], [[endorphin]]s and [[serotonin]] because of the high level of physical exertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Konkel|first1=Lindsey|title=Extreme Psychology|url=http://scienceline.org/2009/07/health-konkel-extreme-sports-risk-psychology/|website=ScienceLine.org|publisher=New York University|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a recent study suggests that the link to adrenaline and 'true' extreme sports is tentative.&lt;ref&gt;Brymer, Eric and Gray, Tonia, ''Extreme Sports: A Challenge to Phenomenology''. University of Wollongong, Australia, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The study defined 'true' extreme sports as a leisure or recreation activity where the most likely outcome of a mismanaged accident or mistake was death. This definition was designed to separate the marketing hype from the activity.

Eric Brymer&lt;ref&gt;Brymer, Eric, ''Extreme Dude: A Phenomenological Perspective on the Extreme sports experience ''. University of Wollongong, Australia, 2005 {{cite web|url=http://www.library.uow.edu.au/adt-NWU/public/adt-NWU20060508.145406/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721115425/http://www.library.uow.edu.au/adt-NWU/public/adt-NWU20060508.145406/index.html |archivedate=2008-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also found that the potential of various extraordinary human experiences, many of which parallel those found in activities such as meditation, was an important part of the extreme sport experience. Those experiences put the participants outside their [[comfort zone]] and are often done in conjunction with [[adventure travel]].

Some of the sports have existed for decades and their proponents span generations, some going on to become well known personalities. Rock climbing and [[ice climbing]] have spawned publicly recognizable names such as [[Edmund Hillary]], [[Chris Bonington]], [[Wolfgang Güllich]] and more recently [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]]. Another example is surfing, invented centuries ago by the inhabitants of [[Hawaii]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Mortality==
[[File:Wingsuit-01.jpg|thumb|[[Wingsuit flying]] is a recent activity.]]
Extreme sports by their nature can be extremely dangerous, conducive to fatalities, near-fatalities and other serious injuries, and sometimes consist in treading along the brink of death. This imminent and inherent danger in these sports has been considered a somewhat necessary part of its appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://articles.philly.com/2013-02-03/sports/36723401_1_extreme-sports-snowmobile-backflip |title = In extreme sports, the X-factor is death |last = Smallwood |first = John |accessdate= 11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is partially a result of pressure for athletes to make more money and provide maximum entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://money.msn.com/now/post.aspx?post=1ef3fc34-dc7b-4421-974f-d3b7b37e8006 |title = Recent deaths draw attention to extreme sports |last = Kennedy |first = Bruce |accessdate= 11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disabled community==
Disabled people participate in extreme sports. Nonprofit organizations such as Adaptive Action Sports seek to increase awareness of the participation in action sports by members of the disabled community, as well as increase access to the adaptive technologies that make participation possible and to competitions such as The X Games.{{Advert inline|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Adaptive-Sports.html|title=''Ability Magazine: Adaptive Action Sports - Amy Purdy"'' (2010)|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/x-games.html|title=''Ability Magazine: X Games - Adaptive Sports"'' (2010)|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
Extreme sports is a sub-category of sports than are described as any kind of sport "of a character or kind farthest removed from the ordinary or average".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/14931/|title = A Phenomenological Investigation of the Experience of Taking Part in 'Extreme Sports'|last = Willig|first = Carla|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Health Psychology|doi = 10.1177/1359105307082459|pmid = |access-date =|volume=13|pages=690–702}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of sports often carry out the potential risk of serious and permanent physical injury and even death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/55275/|title = Extreme sports are good for your health: A phenomenological understanding of fear and anxiety in extreme sport.|author1=Brymer, E. |author2= Schweitzer, R. |last-author-amp=yes |date = 2013 |origyear=2012|journal = Journal of Health Psychology|doi = 10.1177/1359105312446770|pmid = |access-date = |volume=18 |pages=477–487}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these sports also have the potential to produce drastic benefits on mental and physical health.

Health is an individual's state of mental and physical well-being in which they are maximising their daily potential. It is divided into two main categories: mental and physical.

Mental health is a cognitive state of well-being, in this state the individual is aware of his or how own potential and is able to; cope with stresses of normal life and work productively, as well as willing to give their contribution to his or her community in a beneficial way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/mental_health/en/|title = Mental Health|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical health can be defined as a state of complete physical well-being in which an individual is mechanically fit to perform their daily activities and duties without any problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cheshireeast.gov.uk/social_care_and_health/health_advice/physical_health.aspx|title = Physical Health|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme sports trigger the release of the hormone adrenaline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = X-games: Are you equipped for the extreme? (high-risk sports).|last = Globus|first = S|date = 1997|journal = Current Health 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very powerful hormone as it can cause human beings to perform tremendous stunts of many sorts. However, with a bad mix of other hormones it can lead people to execute terrible actions. It is believed that the implementation of extreme sports on mental health patients improves their perspective and recognition of aspects of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Final Destination''''' is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] composed of five films, comic books and novels. It is based on an unproduced [[spec script]] by [[Jeffrey Reddick]], originally written for ''[[The X-Files]]'' television series, and was distributed by [[New Line Cinema]]. All five films center around a small group of people who escape impending death when one individual (the protagonist of each film) has a sudden [[Precognition|premonition]] and warns them that they will all die in a terrible [[mass-casualty incident|mass-casualty accident]]. After avoiding their foretold deaths, the survivors are killed one by one in bizarre accidents caused by an unseen force creating complicated chains of cause and effect, resembling [[Rube Goldberg machine]]s in their complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conrich|first1=Ian|title=Puzzles, Contraptions and the Highly Elaborate Moment: The Inevitability of Death in the Grand Slasher Narratives of the Final Destination and Saw Series of Films|journal=Style and Form in the Hollywood Slasher Film|date=2015|pages=106–117|doi=10.1057/9781137496478_8|url=https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137496478_8|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is noteworthy among other films in the horror genre in that the antagonist is not a stereotypical slasher or other physical being, but [[Death (personification)|Death]] personified, subtly manipulating circumstances in the environment with a design on claiming anyone who escapes their fated demise.

In addition to the films, a novel series, which includes the novelizations of the first three films, was published throughout 2005 and 2006 by [[Black Flame (publisher)|Black Flame]]. A one-shot comic book titled ''Final Destination: Sacrifice'' was released alongside select DVDs of ''Final Destination 3'' in 2006, and a comic series titled ''Final Destination: Spring Break'' was published by [[Zenescope Entertainment]] in 2007.

===Overview===
====Final Destination====
In the original ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'', high school student [[Alex Browning]] ([[Devon Sawa]]) boards Volee Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for a field trip to [[Paris]], France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition that the plane will explode in mid-air, killing everyone on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics, and a fight breaks out, which leads to several passengers being left behind, including [[Clear Rivers]] ([[Ali Larter]]), Carter Horton ([[Kerr Smith]]), Billy Hitchcock ([[Seann William Scott]]), Valerie Lewton ([[Kristen Cloke]]), Terry Chaney ([[Amanda Detmer]]), and Tod Waggner ([[Chad Donella]]), who witness the plane explode moments later. Afterwards, the survivors begin to die one by one through a series of bizarre accidents, and Alex attempts to find a way to "cheat" Death's plan before it is too late. Six months later, Alex, Clear, and Carter travel to Paris to celebrate their survival, believing they have finally cheated Death; however, after Carter is crushed by a giant neon sign, they realize that Death's plan is still in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Wong, James (Director)|title=[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final Destination 2====
''[[Final Destination 2]]'', picking up one year after the first film, features college student Kimberly Corman ([[A. J. Cook (actress)|A. J. Cook]]) heading to [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] for spring break with her friends Shaina, Dano, and Frankie ([[Sarah Carter]], Alex Rae, and [[Shaun Sipos]]). En route, Kimberly has a premonition of a huge car [[multiple-vehicle collision|pile-up]] on Route 23, killing everyone involved. She stalls her SUV on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including state trooper Thomas Burke ([[Michael Landes]]), Eugene Dix ([[Terrence C. Carson|T.C. Carson]]), Rory Peters ([[Jonathan Cherry (actor)|Jonathan Cherry]]), Kat Jennings ([[Keegan Connor Tracy]]), Nora and Tim Carpenter ([[Lynda Boyd]] and James Kirk), Evan Lewis ([[David Paetkau]]), and pregnant Isabella Hudson ([[Justina Machado]]). While Officer Burke questions Kimberly, the pile-up occurs as she predicted. In the days following the accident, the survivors begin to die one by one in a series of bizarre accidents. After learning about the explosion of Flight 180, Kimberly teams up with Clear Rivers, the only survivor of Flight 180, to try to save a new group of people from Death. This time the survivors are told that only "new life" can defeat Death, and they must stay alive long enough for Isabella to have her baby. It is later revealed that Isabella was never meant to die in the pile-up, and Kimberly drowns herself in a lake so that she can be resuscitated by emergency staff, thus granting her "new life"; saving her and Officer Burke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Ellis, David R. (Director)|title=[[Final Destination 2]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final Destination 3====
''[[Final Destination 3]]'', set five years after{{#tag:ref|''Final Destination 3'' is set in 2005. Kevin Fischer's statement to Wendy Christensen outside their school that the Flight 180 explosion from the first film occurred "six years ago" is a continuity error, as the first film is set in 2000.|group="note"}} the explosion of Flight 180 and four years after the pile-up on Route 23, has high school student Wendy Christensen ([[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]) visiting an amusement park for grad night with her friends Kevin Fischer ([[Ryan Merriman]]), Jason Wise ([[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]]), and Carrie Dreyer ([[Gina Holden]]). As Wendy and her friends board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that the ride will crash, killing everyone on board. When Wendy panics a fight breaks out and several people leave or are forced off the ride before the accident occurs, including Kevin, Wendy's younger sister Julie ([[Amanda Crew]]), Ian McKinley ([[Kris Lemche]]), Perry Malinowski (Maggie Ma), Erin Ulmer ([[Alexz Johnson]]), Lewis Romero ([[Texas Battle]]), Frankie Cheeks ([[Sam Easton]]), and Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin ([[Chelan Simmons]] and [[Crystal Lowe]]). When the survivors start to die one by one in a series of strange accidents, Wendy and Kevin set out to save those who remain after they learn of the events of the first two films. Most of their attempts are futile, with the exception of Julie and themselves, leading them to believe they have cheated Death. However, the three "coincidentally" cross paths five months later and are caught in a horrifying subway accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Wong, James (Director)|title=[[Final Destination 3]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Final Destination====
In &lt;!-- The film's title is "The Final Destination", not "Final Destination 4" --&gt;''[[The Final Destination]]'', set nine years after the explosion of Flight 180, eight years after the pile-up on Route 23 and four years after the Devil's Flight disaster, college student Nick O'Bannon ([[Bobby Campo]]) visits the McKinley Speedway for a study break with his friends Lori Milligan, Janet Cunningham, and Hunt Wynorski. While watching the race, Nick has a premonition that a race car crash will send debris into the stands, causing the stadium to collapse on the guests. When Nick panics a fight breaks out and several people leave before the accident occurs, including, his friends Lori ([[Shantel VanSanten]]), Janet ([[Haley Webb]]), and Hunt ([[Nick Zano]]), security guard George Lanter ([[Mykelti Williamson]]), and spectators Jonathan Groves (Jackson Walker), Andy Kewzer ([[Andrew Fiscella]]), Samantha Lane ([[Krista Allen]]), Carter Daniels ([[Justin Welborn]]), and Nadia Monroy ([[Stephanie Honoré]]). Once again, the survivors are killed in a series of strange accidents except for Janet, who is rescued just moments before her death. This leads the remaining survivors to believe that they have cheated Death, until Nick has another premonition of a disastrous explosion at a shopping mall, which he manages to prevent, saving himself, Lori, and Janet. Two weeks later, Nick realizes the mall disaster vision was only meant to lead them to where Death needed them to be and all three are killed by a runaway semi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Ellis, David R. (Director)|title=[[The Final Destination]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final Destination 5====
In ''[[Final Destination 5]]'', set two months before the explosion of Flight 180, Sam Lawton ([[Nicholas D'Agosto]]) is on his way to a corporate retreat with his colleagues. While they cross the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone on it. Sam manages to persuade several of his co-workers to get off the bridge before the accident occurs, including Molly Harper ([[Emma Bell]]), Nathan Sears ([[Arlen Escarpeta]]), Peter Friedkin ([[Miles Fisher]]), Dennis Lapman ([[David Koechner]]), [[Olivia Castle]] ([[Jacqueline MacInnes Wood]]), Isaac Palmer ([[P. J. Byrne]]), and Candice Hooper (Ellen Wroe). After Candice and Isaac die in bizarre accidents, Sam is warned that Death is still after the survivors and told that if he wants to live he must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and claim their remaining lifespan. Olivia and Dennis are killed before they have a chance to save themselves, but Nathan claims the lifespan of a co-worker when he accidentally causes his death in a warehouse accident. Peter attempts to kill Molly, jealous that she survived instead of Candice. He eventually gains the lifespan of an investigating agent, but is killed by Sam before he can kill Molly. Sam and Molly later board a plane to Paris, which is later revealed to be Flight 180 from the first film. Unable to get off the plane, both are killed in the resulting explosion. The landing gear is sent flying towards New York City and crashes into a cocktail bar, killing Nathan, since the co-worker whose life he claimed had a terminal illness and was due to die "any day now".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Quale, Steven (Director)|title=[[Final Destination 5]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
''Final Destination'' was written by [[Jeffrey Reddick]] after having "read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, 'Don’t take the flight tomorrow, I have a really bad feeling about it.'". The woman switched flights and the plane she was originally supposed to take crashed. Originally having written the script as an episode of ''[[The X Files]]'', Reddick decided to turn the script into a feature-length film at the behest of one of his [[New Line Cinema]] colleagues. After reading his spec script, New Line Cinema hired Reddick to write the screenplay; [[James Wong (filmmaker)|James Wong]] and [[Glen Morgan]] were later brought on board to help with the script, making alterations to comply with their standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Albin |first1=Andrea |title=[Special Feature] ‘Final Destination’: Not So Final After All! |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/25828/special-feature-final-destination-not-so-final-after-all/ |publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |access-date=14 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042727/http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/25828/special-feature-final-destination-not-so-final-after-all/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 |date=12 August 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
The first three films received mixed reviews. The fourth film received mostly negative reviews. The fifth film received mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="mc-fd5" /&gt; The franchise has been praised for its innovative premise, of the invisible abstract concept of Death killing people, instead of a usual slasher killer; the death sequences have also been praised for their creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrow|first1=Brendan|title=Is 'Final Destination' the Best Horror Franchise in History?|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3386435/final-destination-best-horror-franchise-history/|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts 6 and 7 Already in the Cards?|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/42265/exclusive-tony-todd-talks-final-deatination-5-parts-6-and-7-already-cards|work=Dread Central|access-date=22 April 2011|date=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 23, 2011, when asked whether he would be directing a sequel, Steven Quale elaborated, "Who knows. Never say never. I mean, it'll be up to the fans. We'll see how this one performs internationally, and if it makes as much money as the fourth one, I'm sure Warner Brothers will want to make another one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni14465558/|title=Steven Quale on Final Destination 6|date=23 August 2011|website=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
===Novels===
Throughout 2005, publishing company [[Black Flame (publisher)|Black Flame]] released a series of ''Final Destination'' books which faithfully follow the premise of the films, with each involving a group of people who find themselves targeted by Death after surviving a catastrophe of some sort due to a character experiencing a precognitive vision. Their first five novels all featured original stories, with the first novel, entitled ''Dead Reckoning'', has [[punk rock]]er Jessica Golden saving herself and several others from the collapse of Club Kitty in [[Los Angeles]], earning Death's ire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = Natasha | title = Final Destination: Dead Reckoning | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-03-15 | isbn = 1844161706}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Destination Zero'', also set in LA, has magazine employee Patricia Fuller and few others survive a train bombing and afterward, while being stalked by Death, Patti learns this is not the first time her family has been hunted by the entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McIntee | first = David | title = Final Destination: Destination Zero | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-03-15 | isbn = 1844161714}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''End of the Line'' has a group of [[New York City]] [[New York City Subway|subway]] crash survivors, led by twins Danny and Louise King, trying to escape Death, who uses an unknowing agent to hasten its acquisition of the survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levene | first = Rebecca | title = Final Destination: End of the Line | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-06-07 | isbn = 1844161765}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dead Man's Hand'' a group meant to die in the crash of a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] glass elevator are stalked by both Death and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the latter believing the group's savior Allie Goodwin-Gaines was responsible for the elevator crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roman | first = Steven | title = Final Destination: Dead Man's Hand | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-09-13 | isbn = 1844161773}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Looks Could Kill'' has beautiful New York model Stephanie "Sherry" Pulaski stopping her friends from boarding a [[yacht]] when she has a vision of it exploding, but is left horribly disfigured and comatose by flying debris moments afterward when her vision comes true; eventually awakening the embittered Stephanie makes a deal with Death, aiding it in claiming her friends in exchange for having her good looks restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Collins | first = Nancy | title = Final Destination: Looks Could Kill | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-11-29 | isbn = 1844163164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the run of the original series of books Black Flame released novelizations of the first three films in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = Natasha | title = Final Destination | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2006-01-03 | isbn = 1844163172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Collins | first = Nancy | title = Final Destination 2 | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2006-01-31 | isbn = 1844163180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Faust | first = Christa | title = Final Destination 3 | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2006-01-03 | isbn = 1844163199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Flame's last ''Final Destination'' novel was ''Death of the Senses'' released in mid-2006. Taking place in New York the book has a homeless man named Jack Curtis saving policewoman Amy Tom from a maniac after having a vision of Amy's death; Amy's attacker is later revealed to be a serial killer who was meant to murder six other people (representing the first [[sense|five senses]] and [[Extrasensory perception|a sixth]]) who Death begins targeting as Jack and Amy rush to find and warn the intended victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McDermott | first = Andy | title = Final Destination: Death of the Senses | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2006-08-01 | isbn = 1844163857}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, due to a printing error, only available for a short period of time before being recalled, leaving only a few copies in circulation. A tenth novel, titled ''Wipeout'' and written by Alex Johnson, was planned, but cancelled; the book would have featured a pair of surfers and several others, after surviving a plane crash in Hawaii, being hunted by Death and the survivor of another disaster, an unstable soldier who had nearly died in an ambush in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = Alex | title = Final Destination: Wipeout | publisher = Black Flame | date = | isbn = 1844164098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic books===
The first ''Final Destination'' comic book, titled ''Sacrifice'', was published by [[Zenescope Entertainment]] and came packaged with a limited-edition DVD of ''Final Destination 3'', sold exclusively at [[Circuit City Corporation|Circuit City]] stores. The premise of the story involves the survivor of a terrible accident and his friend Jim, who continually experiences images of other people's deaths, isolating himself from the rest of the world to escape the visions that torment him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zenescope &amp; Circuit City Offer Exclusive "Final Destination" Comic |url=http://www.cbr.com/zenescope-circuit-city-offer-exclusive-final-destination-comic/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=14 July 2017 |archivedate=14 July 2017 |date=13 June 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714210224/http://www.cbr.com/zenescope-circuit-city-offer-exclusive-final-destination-comic/ |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zenescope later released a five-issue miniseries, titled ''Final Destination: Spring Break'', which involves a group led by Carly Hagan being stalked by Death after surviving a hotel fire and becoming stranded in [[Cancún|Cancún, Mexico]]. The miniseries was later released in a trade paperback collection, which included the ''Sacrifice'' comic as bonus content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Final Destination Trade Paperback Spring Break |url=https://www.zenescope.com/comics/2-final-destination/issues/57 |publisher=[[Zenescope Entertainment]] |access-date=14 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001131151/https://www.zenescope.com/comics/2-final-destination/issues/57 |archivedate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of '''flag throwing''' dates back to [[medieval]] [[guild]]s (principally in Italy, Germany and Flanders). A guild's banner or [[flag]] was considered a symbol of purity, and as such it was not allowed to touch the ground.

There are two major categories of flag throwing: '''classical''' and '''acrobatical'''.  In classical flag throwing, the flag is turned left and right around the body in a standing posture.  In acrobatical flag throwing, the thrower uses both hands to move the flag in a sitting, laying, or kneeling posture.

It is the first part in a new series of films produced by [[Musée d'Orsay]], and tells the story of a French family as seen through the eyes of a Chinese student. The film was shot in August and September 2006 on location in Paris. This is [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]]'s first non-Asian film. It references the classic 1956 French short ''[[The Red Balloon]]'' directed by [[Albert Lamorisse]].

The film opened the ''Un Certain Regard'' section of the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2007.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4436044/year/2007.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Le voyage du ballon rouge|accessdate=2011-08-24|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Suzanne, a [[puppeteer]], lives with her young son Simon in an apartment in [[Paris]]. While Suzanne is busy with producing her new Chinese puppet play based on an ancient Chinese text (求妻煮海人), she hires a Chinese film student Song as Simon's new nanny.  For her college project - a homage to [[Albert Lamorisse]]'s famous 1956 film ''[[The Red Balloon]]'' - Song starts to film Simon. She develops a good relationship with mother and son, and translates for Suzanne's masterclass with a Chinese puppet master. 

While Simon's older sister Louise is about to graduate from a high school in Brussels, Suzanne plans for Louise to apply for colleges in Paris. For that, she tries to evict her downstairs tenant Marc, who has repeatedly failed to pay his rent, while arguing on the phone with Pierre, Simon's father, who has absented himself to Canada for two years to write a novel and who is rarely in touch. Simon visits the Musée d'Orsay on a school trip, where his class is shown ''The Ball'', a painting by [[Félix Vallotton]] in which a child chases a red ball.

==Critical reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 80% of 87 sampled critics and 90% of top critics gave the film positive reviews. The average rating is 6.9 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Le Voyage du Ballon Rouge (The Flight of the Red Balloon) (2007) |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flight_of_the_red_balloon/ |work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher = [[Flixster]] |accessdate = January 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Hoberman, writing in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' was particularly appreciative of the film stating, "Flight of the Red Balloon is contemplative but never static, and punctuated by passages of [[Cinéma pur|pure cinema]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-04-01/film/floating-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Stables of [[Sight &amp; Sound]] also highly praised the film, "Finding a serene and contemplative beauty in the quotidian world has long been Taiwanese master-minimalist Hou Hsiao Hsien's stock in trade.... Hou brings the same depth and deliberation to the film's Parisian exterior....  ultimately, it is cinema that is the film's sacred repository of memory and creativity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/4261|title=BFI {{!}} Sight &amp; Sound {{!}} Flight of the Red Balloon (2006)|last=Institute|first=The British Film|website=old.bfi.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader likes the film as &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;A relatively slight but sturdy work by Taiwanese master Hou Hsiao-hsien, this slice of contemporary urban life more or less does for Paris what his Cafe Lumiere did for Tokyo, albeit with less minimalism and more overt emotion''.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''

On the other hand, Duane Byrge of Hollywood Reporter was not impressed. "The imagery of the classic movie, where a spirited red balloon wafts unpredictably over Paris, never even attempts to reach a metaphorical height, nor does it even engage us compositionally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flight_of_the_red_balloon/reviews/?type=top_critics|title=Le Voyage du Ballon Rouge (The Flight of the Red Balloon) - Movie Reviews - Rotten Tomatoes|website=www.rottentomatoes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who play video games regularly are split roughly equally between male and female, but men are more likely to call themselves a 'Gamer.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/gaming-and-gamers/|title=Gaming and Gamers|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|date=2015-12-15|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Go Play One 2010 - P1370638.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A woman playing Go Play One in 2010]]
A female gamer, or gamer girl, is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.&lt;ref name="Theesa.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Facts and Figures"/&gt;
According to a 2015 Pew survey, 6% of women in the United States identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men, and 48% of women and 50% of men play video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duggan |first1=Maeve |title=Who plays video games and identifies as a “gamer” |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/who-plays-video-games-and-identifies-as-a-gamer/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=17 September 2018 |date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term "girl gamer" is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a [[reappropriation|reappropriated term]], while others see it as nondescriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group.&lt;ref name="Heather Barefoot"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/10699-In-Defense-of-the-Casual-Gamer | title=In Defense of the Casual Gamer | publisher=Escapist magazine | date=30 October 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2014 | author=Heather Barefoot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotypes==
Although men and women play roughly the same number of games, there is a [[stereotype]] that women are not considered ¨True Gamers¨ because they tend to play more [[Casual game|casual games]] which do not require much skill and dedication. This stereotype exists due to the fact that at a professional level, most of the teams competing are composed of men, thus, overshadowing the girl gamers who could compete at the same level but are not able to get the same amount of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-016-0678-y|title=SpringerLink|last=|first=|date=|website=db16.linccweb.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for games media, games industry analysts, and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories. These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming, sometimes by primary type of game played, and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors. There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories, though many attempts have been made to formalize them. An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows.

*''Newbie'': ''[[Newbie]]'', (commonly shortened to "noob", "n00b", or "newb") is a slang term for a [[wikt:novice|novice]] or [[wikt:newcomer|newcomer]] to a certain game, or to gaming in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masonry/Misc/welaish.html |title=Masonry on the Internet |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/words-online-gaming-opinions-books-newbs.html|title=Gamer Speak for Newbs|work=Forbes|author=Anna Vander Broek|date=2009-04-23|accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Casual gamer'': The term ''casual gamer'' is often used for gamers who primarily play [[casual games]], but can also refer to gamers who play less frequently than other gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/04/30/core-and-casual-whats-the-difference/|title=Core and Casual: What’s the difference?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casual gamers may play games designed for ease of gameplay, or play more involved games in short sessions, or at a slower pace than hardcore gamers.&lt;ref name="Heather Barefoot"/&gt; The types of game that casual gamers play vary, and they are less likely to own a dedicated video game console.&lt;ref&gt;Magrino, Tom, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6178563.html?tag=result;title;1 GameStop: Casual gamers spurring hardcore holiday sales]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072417/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6178563.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B1 |date=July 11, 2011 }}, GameSpot, Sep 11, 2007, Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyes, Emma, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result;title;0 GDC '08: Are casual games the future?]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711000000/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 |date=July 11, 2011 }}, ''GameSpot'', Feb 18, 2008, Accessed May 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of casual games include ''[[The Sims]]'' and ''[[Nintendogs]]''.&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; Casual gamer demographics vary greatly from those of other video gamers, as the typical casual gamer is older and more predominantly female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_6695921|title=Women driving 'casual game' boom|first=Troy|last=Wolverton|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=2007-08-23|accessdate=2007-10-13

James Hursthouse, the founder of Roadhouse Interactive, credits the evolution of devices towards tablets and touch-screen interfaces, whereas [[Jon Radoff]] of [[Disruptor Beam]] compares the emergence of mid-core games to similar increases in media sophistication that have occurred in media such as [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/9/4604088/the-rise-of-midcore-gaming|title=Core gamers, mobile games and the origins of the midcore audience|publisher=Polygon|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrogamer===

A retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play, and often enough collect, [[retro games]]—older video games and [[arcade game]]s. They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]]. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]], or on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/game/gars-07142004.ars|title=NES Classics: retro gaming, at a price: Page 1|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-04-14|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification in taxonomies===

A number of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gaymers-Difference-Makes-Video-Players-ebook/dp/B0192KWP06/182-5342459-6520231|title=Gaymers: the Difference a 'Y' Makes: How (and Why) to Make Video Games LGBT Players Care About|last=Nowak|first=Paul S.|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Prince Pocket Press|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bartle taxonomy of player types]] classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:
* [[Achiever]]s, who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters, collecting all rewards and [[game badge]]s.
* [[Explorers]], who like to discover all areas within the game, including [[Secret level|hidden areas]] and [[Glitch|glitches]], and expose all game mechanics.
* Socializers, who prefer to play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself.
* Beaters, who thrive on competition with other players.
* Completionists, who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types. They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it.
The [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described aesthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avatar==
{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}
{{See also|Player character}}
An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Similarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.

==Clans and guilds==
A [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).

==Identity==
{{See also|Gamergate controversy}}
The identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the "true gamer" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to "[[cinemaphile]]".&lt;ref name="escapistPublisherNote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;
People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play "enough" to qualify.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term "gamer", even though they may play regularly.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newmediaDoYou"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

In August 2014 began a controversy linked to gamer identity, named [[Gamergate controversy]]. The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a [[culture war]] over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The [[Gamergate controversy]] concerns issues of [[Sexism in video gaming|sexism]] and [[progressivism]] in video game culture, stemming from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]] #GamerGate.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of [[feminism]] on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===Demographics===
[[File:Hillary Rodham Clinton playing a Nintendo Game Boy video game on the flight from Austin en route to Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hillary Clinton]] playing a [[Nintendo Game Boy]] video game on a flight]]
Games are stereotypically associated with young males, but the diversity of the audience has been increasing over time.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-10-30-platform-not-gender-drives-gamer-differences-eedar|last=Nofziger|first=Heather|title=Platform, not gender, drives gamer differences
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype exists even among a majority of women who play video games regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/public-debates-about-gaming-and-gamers/|title=2. Public debates about gaming and gamers|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|date=2015-12-15|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among players using the same category of device (e.g., console or phone), patterns of play are largely the same between men and women. Diversity is driven in part by new hardware platforms.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"/&gt; Expansion of the audience was catalyzed by [[Nintendo marketing#Demographic shifts|Nintendo's efforts to reach new demographics]].&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; Market penetration of [[smartphones]] with gaming capabilities further expanded the audience,&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; since in contrast to consoles or high-end PCs, mobile phone gaming requires only devices that non-gamers are likely to already own.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"/&gt;

While 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female [[Pc game|PC gamers]] in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers.&lt;ref name="pcgamerFemale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-find-that-female-pc-gamers-outnumber-males/|title=Researchers find that female PC gamers outnumber males|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superdataWhyAll"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/why-all-gamers-matter/|title=Why ALL gamers matter — my view as a female games analyst|date=28 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotations of "gamer" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.&lt;ref name="nytimesShunLabel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/technology/personaltech/women-who-play-games-shun-gamer-label.html|last=McPhate|first=Mike|work=The New York Times|title=Women Who Play Games Shun ‘Gamer’ Label}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers, with 19% of [[hispanics]] identifying as gamers, compared to 11% of [[African-Americans]] and 7% of [[whites]].&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt; The competitive [[fighting game]] scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant.&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/2/6/5361004/fighting-game-diversity|last=Bowman|first=Rich|work=Polygon|title=Why the Fighting Game Community is Color Blind}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed to its origin in arcades, where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]].&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"/&gt; Only 4% of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt;

===Casualization===
Casualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences, especially women or the elderly.&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarrazin|first=Vincent|date=October 7, 2011|url=http://www.inaglobal.fr/en/video-games/article/casualisation-video-games|title=The Casualisation of Video Games|work=ina global|publisher=[[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]]|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some developers, hoping to attract a broader audience, simplify or remove aspects of [[gameplay]] in established genres and franchises.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"/&gt; Compared to seminal titles like ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]]'', more recent mass-market action games like the [[Call of Duty]] series are less sensitive to player choice or skill, approaching the status of [[interactive movie]]s.&lt;ref name="eurogamerDoom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-06-22-years-on-doom-retains-the-ability-to-shock|last=Stewart|first=Keith|work=The Guardian|title=22 years on, Doom retains the ability to shock}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press rarely calls attention to depth or features found in [[retro games]] but missing from new releases.&lt;ref name="gamasutraAmnesiac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20141009/227370/Amnesiac_Heroes_Why_are_we_abandoning_gaming_history.php|last=Pepe|first=Felipe|work=Gamasutra|title=Amnesiac Heroes: Why are we abandoning gaming history?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay, meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/1201/articles/kirkpatrick|title=Constitutive tensions of gaming's field: UK gaming magazines and the formation of gaming culture|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Graeme|work=Gamestudies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Brendan Keogh]], these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance. He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences, and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; Belying these trends, games including ''[[The Sims]]'' or ''[[Minecraft]]'' have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnathonSwift/20140110/208440/quotDumbing_downquot.php|last=Swift|first=Johnathon|work=Gamasutra|title=Dumbing down}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research, girls who play Minecraft are "just as 'hardcore' as the next guy over who plays ''[[Counter-Strike]]''"&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/17/more-women-play-video-games-than-boys-and-other-surprising-facts-lost-in-the-mess-of-gamergate/|last=Harwell|first=Drew|work=The Washington Post|title=More women play video games than boys, and other surprising facts lost in the mess of Gamergate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreunen says being in control of a game's environment appeals equally to boys and girls.&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"/&gt; [[Leigh Alexander (journalist)|Leigh Alexander]] argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.&lt;ref name="edgeDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |last=Alexander |first=Leigh |work=Edge |title=Too many gamers think diversity means dumbing down – it’s time to forget that outmoded view |date=August 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713174818/http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |archivedate=July 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Graphics were created by Marek Píša. Píša and Viktor Bocan participated in writing the screenplay. Sounds and music were the work of William Foldes. All characters are voiced by comedian Zdeněk Izer, a notable Czech impersonator, besides some female characters. The game has the same humorous style seen across Czech adventures such as [[Polda]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/52702/DPTX_2010_2_11230_0_322985_0_111952.pdf?sequence=1|title=Historie a kontext produkce počítačových

According to Miroslav Mrňa, the idea of a sequel was brought up by JRC, then an exclusive distributor for the first game; the developers found this proposition interesting so pursued it. Developments began in late December 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/miroslav-mrna-o-horkem-lete-2-dgd-/Magazin.aspx?c=A000131_mirekmrnahl2b_bw|title=Miroslav Mrňa o Horkém Létě 2|last=Ticháček|first=Petr|date=January 4, 2000|website=iDNES.cz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team consisted of one scriptwriter, two programmers, three graphic artists and two musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/mirek-mrna-o-priprave-horkeho-leta-2-duh-/Magazin.aspx?c=A000131_miramrnahl2a_bw|title=Mirek Mrňa o přípravě Horkého Léta 2|last=Polách|first=Zdeněk|date=April 12, 1999|website=iDNES.cz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrna described the development and production process of the game in detail for iDNES.cz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zpravy.idnes.cz/jak-se-vytvarelo-horke-leto-2-dgn-/zahranicni.aspx?c=991107_214105_pocnovinky_ond|title=Jak se vytvářelo Horké léto 2|last=Mrňa|first=Miroslav|date=November 8, 1999|website=iDNES.cz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Horke Leto 2, a watercolour-style design was made for the backgrounds, which were painted by hand then scanned into the computer.

While developers from Centauri Production wanted to make a second sequel to the game, they were unable to obtain the rights to the name "Horke Leto" or the main character Honza, however the title was still designed as a spiritual sequel.

==Plot and gameplay==
In ''Horké léto'', the player takes control of teenager Honza Majer, who must rescue his family after they were captured by cannibals. In ''Horké léto 2'', Honza Majer must retrieve the Purple Salamander artefact from the bandit One-Eye Dingo. ''Žhavé léto 3 ½'' sees the player take control of Honza's grandfather, the hapless protagonist Johnny Majer, in the 1920s as he verses the Mafia in the age of the prohibition. Set in the gangster age of the 1930s, the player takes control of the handsome street rat Johnny who inherits a casino, only to discover that there is a plot to expropriate it.&lt;ref name="adventuregamers.com" /&gt;

The first two games are point and click adventures controlled by the mouse. The third is mainly a point and click adventure with elements of stealth, fighting, driving, and shoot ‘em up.

==Critical reception==
===Horké léto===
Refresher.cz deemed it an average game, but noted that it didn't stop it from becoming a domestic hit.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Doupe.cz wrote the game is one of the best Czech adventures that every player should play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doupe.zive.cz/clanek/horke-leto-aneb-majer-v-akci|title=Horké léto aneb Majer v akci|last=Gric|first=Kamil|date=June 21, 2001|website=Doupe.cz|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excalibur suggests that while the graphics and gameplay were nothing special, it was the dubbing into local languages that captured the imagination of Czecheslovakia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; PC Tuning deemed it one of the 10 best Czech games of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pctuning.tyden.cz/multimedia/hry-a-zabava/28514-top-10-nejlepsich-ceskych-her-vsech-dob?start=2|title=Top 10 nejlepších českých her všech dob|last=Jiříková|first=Lucie|date=November 27, 2013|website=PCTuning.cz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refresher thought it was the 20th best Czech title, praising its  funny dialogues and first-class dubbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://refresher.cz/25610-Vybrali-jsme-ty-nejlepsi-ceske-a-slovenske-hry-Shodnes-se-s-nasi-top-dvacitkou|title=Vybrali jsme ty nejlepší české a slovenské hry.

===Horké léto 2===
Upon a preview, Bonusweb hoped that the game's humour would outweigh its average graphics and animations making it an above-average Czech title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/horke-leto-2-cxg-/Preview.aspx?c=A000130_horkeleto2pre_bw|title=Horké léto 2 preview|last=Ticháček|first=Petr|date=July 25, 1999|website=iDNES.cz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonusweb.cz compared the title to [[Polda 2]], and ultimately decided that despite its limitations it was worth a play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/horke-leto-2-cxg-/Recenze.aspx?c=A000213_horkeleto2_bw|title=Horké Léto 2|date=13 December 1999|website=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game received mixed reviews from critics who enjoyed the game's artistic style and story but disliked its gameplay and interface.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5777">A '''hype man''', in [[hip hop music]] and [[rapping]], is a backup rapper and/or singer who supports the primary rappers with exclamations and interjections and who attempts to increase the audience's excitement with call-and-response chants.&lt;ref name=Hilltop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehilltoponline.com/life-style/the-role-of-the-hype-man-in-hip-hop-1.464291 |title=The Hilltop - The Role of The 'Hype Man' In Hip-Hop |publisher=Thehilltoponline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717003938/http://www.thehilltoponline.com/life-style/the-role-of-the-hype-man-in-hip-hop-1.464291 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Grant, 2006, ''The Official Dictionary of Unofficial English'', McGraw-Hill Professional, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hip Hop: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture, Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Kool Moe Dee".

Retrieved 2010-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Music writer Mickey Hess expands the term as follows: "a hype man is a figure who plays a central but supporting role within a group, making his own interventions, generally aimed at hyping up the crowd while also drawing attention to the words of the [[Master_of_ceremonies#Hip_hop|MC]]".&lt;ref name=IconsofHipHop&gt;Hess, Mickey, 2007, ''Icons of Hip Hop: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture'', Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the role of the hype man in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'', [[Royce da 5'9"]] describes how a hype man can contribute to a live performance: "a lot of my verses [can] be so constant with the flow [that] I'd need somebody to help me."&lt;ref name="autogenerated304"&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lateef the Truthspeaker|Lateef]] has stated, "You're gonna have to have somebody say something somewhere to give you a breath... usually it's just a matter of getting somebody to hit some line or some word in a line—that's all you really need."&lt;ref name="autogenerated304"/&gt;

==Origins==
Early [[hip hop]] hype men included Cowboy and Creole of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]].&lt;ref name= Hilltop/&gt;&lt;ref name=IconsofHipHop/&gt; [[Kool Moe Dee]] calls Creole “the original hype man”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thafoundation.com/moedee.htm |title=Kool Moe Dee |publisher=Thafoundation.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Public Enemy 4.jpg|thumb|right|American rapper [[Flavor Flav]] hyping up a crowd in May 2008]]
The quintessential hype man, for many fans and musicians of the era, was [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s hype man [[Flavor Flav]], whose exuberant approach to the art in the group's recordings and videos made him, arguably, the first household-name hype man, a figure more famous than many MCs. He established many of the conventions of the craft, such as an outlandish sense of style (epitomized by his wearing of large clocks around his neck) and a vocal style that contrasted dramatically with that of the MC (his rasping high voice was a counterpoint to [[Chuck D]]'s booming baritone).

==Examples==&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD MORE WITHOUT RELIABLE CITATIONS --&gt;

Examples of hype men include [[Freaky Tah]] of the [[The Lost Boyz|Lost Boyz]], [[Memphis Bleek]] for [[Jay-Z]], and [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] and [[Mr. Porter]] of [[D12]] for [[Eminem]].&lt;ref name="IconsofHipHop" /&gt; ''Icons of Hip Hop'' also notes that some producers, such as [[Sean Combs|Diddy]], [[Lil Jon]], [[Swizz Beatz]], and [[Jermaine Dupri]], "have transitioned from a hype man role to become [[rapper]]s and stars in their own right".&lt;ref name="IconsofHipHop" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9410">'''J-Setting''' is a style of dance popularized by the '''Prancing J-Settes''', a popular collegiate female dance team of the [[Jackson State University]]'s [[Sonic Boom of the South]] marching band. It originated in the late 1970s from African-Americans in the [[Jackson, Mississippi]], area of the United States.

This dance style is characterized by a lead and follow format where one dancer initiates a series of high-energy dance moves, and the other dancers join in the movement. J-Setting features specific dance steps based on Prancing J-Settes marching techniques including the "J-Sette Walk," the "Salt and Pepper," the "Strut," and the "Tip Toe". In particular, the "Salt and Pepper" is a type of prance step for which the Prancing J-Settes are named and known. It is a high-knee lift or "high step" style of marching. Alternating legs lift with a bent knee to bring the foot up to the height of the opposite knee before returning the foot to the ground.

The JSU Prancing J-Settes typically march and perform in rows organized by height. J-Setting dancers also typically perform in a line or in multiple lines.  While performing, dancers may also change dance formation similar to the way that marching bands change formation during shows on football fields.

The J-Setting style of dress is modeled after the dance uniforms of the JSU Prancing J-Settes.  It normally includes a one or two piece [[bodysuit]] or form-fitting garment that covers the torso and crotch; and hosiery with knee high boots on the legs.  However, other types of garments are also worn during a performance.

==History and background==
{{original research|section|date=April 2015}}
In 1970, Shirley Middleton and the other [[majorettes]] of the Jackson State University Marching Band met with then JSU president, Dr. John A. Peoples, to request that they be permitted to "put down their batons." The JSU President agreed; and as the majorette sponsor, Middleton assembled 18 female students to become the first Jaycettes (currently called J-Settes). Middleton, a formally trained ballet dancer, established technical performance standards for the J-Settes, as well as, standards for academic and personal behavior for its members when they were not performing. Dr. Jimmie James, Jr., then Chair of the JSU Department of Music, described the new dance team as "the thrill of a thousand eyes." During Middleton's tenure, performances included dance routines to songs such as "James Brown's "Make it Funky," and "Hot Pants" as performed by the JSU Marching Band.

Prior to 1975, Hollis Pippins, a former baton twirler for the JSU marching band, sometimes assisted J-Settes director Shirley Middleton, with choreography. In addition to performing with the JSU marching band, he performed on "Soul Train" and "Putting on the Hits" national television shows; and on "Black Gold", a local TV show. In 1975, Narah Oatis was appointed the sponsor of the Prancing J-Settes. Under her leadership, the "J-Sette Walk" and other signature marching steps were developed, and performances included an appearance on the "30th Anniversary of Motown" television show in 1990.

During the late 1970s, African American gay men who were fans of The Prancing J-Settes regularly attended the dance team's practice sessions, and performances at college football games and other events. Young gay men brought the J-Settes dance style back to their home towns, and to gay nightclubs like Club City Lights in Jackson, Mississippi; Club Skittles Baton Rouge; Incognito, Allusions, and 901 in Memphis; and Club 708 in Atlanta.

Although the Prancing J-Settes is a female dance team, in 1997 male JSU baton twirler DeMorris Adams performed with the J-Settes in place of an injured female member. However, the Prancing J-Settes have not confirmed this and, in fact, some have stated that it is not true. There is also no footage to substantiate this claim.

By the mid 2000s, J-Setting became popular in clubs such as: Club Candy'z, Splash [[Baton Rouge]]; Club Metro [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]]; Woodward, Tom Philips Post [[Detroit]]; Club 2020 [[Houston]]; Club Rush/ Chap [[Atlanta]]; Club Crystal's [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]]; Central Station [[Shreveport]]; and The Brick [[Dallas]].  Also several [[black gay pride]] events host organized J-Sette battles.

==Mainstream media attention==
In 1990, the Prancing J-Settes performed the J-Settes style of marching and dancing on the "30th Anniversary of Motown" television show. The dance team appeared as part of the JSU Marching Band in performances to "I Heard it through the Grapevine"and other songs. A video of part of this performance is available on YouTube.&lt;ref name="Motown 30th Anniversary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZU0tTSS8qQ|title= Motown 30th (Part 1) |accessdate= 2014-03-22|author= Welcome to my channel|date= 2010-09-09|publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Prancing J-Settes performed the J-Settes marching and dancing style on the "34th NAACP Image Awards" television show. The dance team appeared as part of the JSU Marching Band in performances with comedian "Cedric the Entertainer" and "Sugar Bear of E.U." A video of part of this performance is available on YouTube.&lt;ref name="34th NAACP Image Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CzbDtyyUc|title=34th NAACP Image Awards|accessdate= 2014-03-22|author=Jackson State University|date= 2009-08-18|publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, both [[Beyoncé]]'s "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" and "[[Diva (Beyoncé song)|Diva]]" music videos included a J-Setting style dance routine.&lt;ref name="Single Ladies Music Video"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1EFMoRFvY|title=Single Ladies|accessdate= 2014-03-22|author=BeyonceVevo|date= 2009-10-02|publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diva Music Video"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNM5HW13_O8|title=Diva|accessdate= 2014-03-22|author=BeyonceVevo|date= 2009-10-02|publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choreographer Frank Gatson is credited with introducing the J-Setting dance style to Beyoncé.

J-Setting troupes compete in dance-offs at gay cultural events.  These groups of young gay men and women imitate the JSU Prancing J-Settes marching and dance style and dress.  
These dance groups perform in costumes that are similar in appearance to the JSU J-Settes uniforms; including sequined one- and two-piece [[leotard]]s, with long flowing capes, sheer stockings and white marching boots. Some of the popular J-Setting teams include: Jackson's Male Prancing J-Settes (MPJ); Memphis Elite; Atlanta's J-Phi; Texas Southern Heat; Texas Teasers of Dallas; D.M.B. of Atlanta; Atlanta Toxic; Jus Blaze; Dallas Diamonds; Baton Rouge Xtreme; Detroit Danz Zone; Nashville's Music City All-Starz; Capitol City Dolls International; Prancing Elites; Shreveport Pussy Cat Dolls; and Grambling, La.'s X-Men.

The competitions seen in Lifetime's [[Bring It! (TV series)|Bring It!]] were inspired by J-Setting competitions.

Beginning April 22, 2015, the [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] channel began broadcasting a 12-episode documentary series entitled ''[[The Prancing Elites Project]]'', focusing on the J-Setting group from [[Mobile, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;Tre'velle Anderson, [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-prancing-elites-oxygen-docu-series-20150423-story.html "Prancing Elites spread message of acceptance in Oxygen docu-series"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Specker, [http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/04/laughter_and_hope_as_the_pranc.html "Laughter and hope, as 'The Prancing Elites Project' premieres"], ''[[Al.com]]'', April 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Prancing Elites had begun to attract national attention after a complimentary [[Twitter|Tweet]] from [[Shaquille O'Neal]] in June 2013, which led to an appearance on the syndicated talk show ''[[The Real (TV series)|The Real]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan C. Martin, [https://www.vice.com/read/the-passion-of-the-prancing-elites "The Passion of the Prancing Elites"], ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', January 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a released documentary entitled "When The Beat Drops", chronicled the progression of J-Setting and its impact on black gay culture (primarily in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/09/when-the-beat-drops-documentary/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://instinctmagazine.com/post/gay-documentary-when-beat-drops-spotlights-bucking-scene-flourishing-us-south&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ley de Responsabilidad Social en Radio Television y Medios Electrónicos.pdf|thumb|250px|Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television.]]
The '''Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television''' ('''''Ley de Responsabilidad Social en Radio y Televisión''''' known as the '''''Ley Resorte''''') is a [[Venezuela]]n law, adopted by the [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]] and in force since 7 December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnv.gov.ve/noticias/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=26&amp;t=11240 Ley Resorte... ¿censura o necesidad?]&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to establish a legal framework for the social responsibility of radio and television broadcasters, national and independent producers of radio and TV programming, and viewers and listeners in the dissemination and reception of transmitted information.

Its objectives, stated in Article 3, are: “[securing] respect for freedom of expression and information without censorship”; “[furthering] the actual exercise of and respect for human rights”; “[facilitating] the broadcasting of information and materials intended for minors”; “[furthering] the broadcasting of national productions and [encouraging] the development of the national audiovisual industry”; “[facilitating]the dissemination of the values of the Venezuelan culture”; and “[furthering]public participation.”

Article 4 of the law allows the use of indigenous languages in programs directed specifically to indigenous peoples, and makes it a requirement to provide subtitles or sign language translation in informative programs for people with auditory disabilities.

Article 14 supports national production of TV and radio content - including music - by requiring broadcasters to transmit at least 10 hours of Venezuelan-made content every day.

The government called it a "building block for the modernization of the country's communications sector", whereas the opposition believes it increases state control over the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sumate.org/democracia-retroceso/cap4_en_1.htm Are the media really independent?] [[Súmate]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Human Rights Watch, the law "severely threatens press freedom in Venezuela", and "[i]ts vaguely worded restrictions and heavy penalties are a recipe for self-censorship by the press and arbitrariness by government authorities." 

==Features==
The law's purpose is to instruct the Venezuelan television networks to air cultural content and to establish schedules for each category of the series and programs. The rating for each program is based on four content types: ''Language'', ''health'', ''sex'', and ''violence''; when a program is about to be broadcast, these content issues can either be announced with their respective "level measure" or not, depending on the channel's way to show the advice. Also, depending on the schedule and the advised contents, the program may either be suitable, in need of parental guidance or non-suitable for young children and teenagers. It is also specified if the series is a national production (made by the channel), an independent national production (made by a separate company) or an international production (a foreign program).

Likewise, every network is instructed to air the government's teasers, their political campaigns and to interrupt the usual schedule when national announcements by the President of the Republic, known as ''Cadenas'' ("Chains", referring to the fact that ''every'' radio and TV network must air simultaneously these announcements) are about to be broadcast.

'''Legend''' is a [[Folklore genre|genre of folklore]] that consists of a [[narrative]] featuring human actions perceived or believed both by teller and listeners to have taken place within human history. Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and possess certain qualities that give the tale [[verisimilitude (literature)|verisimilitude]]. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of "possibility," but may include [[miracle]]s. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh, vital, and [[realism (arts)|realistic]]. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Folkloristics |year=1995 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=United States of America |isbn=0-253-32934-5 |pages=7 |author=Georges, Robert; Owens, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brothers Grimm]] defined legend as [[Folklore|folktale]] historically grounded.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Krapf, ''Beneath the Cherry Sapling: Legends from Franconia'' (New York: Fordham University Press) 1988, devotes his opening section to distinguishing the [[genre]] of legend from other narrative forms, such as [[fairy tale]]; he "reiterates the Grimms' definition of legend as a folktale historically grounded", according to Hans Sebald's review in ''German Studies Review'' '''13'''.2 (May 1990), p 312.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern [[folklore|folklorist]]'s professional definition of ''legend'' was proposed by Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990:&lt;ref&gt;Tangherlini, "'It Happened Not Too Far from Here...': A Survey of Legend Theory and Characterization" ''Western Folklore'' '''49'''.4 (October 1990:371–390) p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Legend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly ecotypified&lt;ref&gt;That is to say, specifically located in place and time.&lt;/ref&gt; historicized narrative performed in a conversational mode, reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation of folk belief and collective experiences and serving as a reaffirmation of commonly held values of the group to whose tradition it belongs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Etymology and origin==
[[File:Holger danske.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Holger Danske]], a legendary character]]

''Legend'' is a [[loanword]] from [[Old French]] that entered English usage circa 1340. The Old French noun ''legende'' derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''legenda''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', s.v. "legend"&lt;/ref&gt; In its early English-language usage, the word indicated a narrative of an event. The word ''legendary'' was originally a noun (introduced in the 1510s) meaning a collection or corpus of legends.&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{OEtymD|legendary|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|legendry}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word changed to ''legendry'', and ''legendary'' became the adjectival form.&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt;

By 1613, English-speaking [[Protestant]]s began to use the word when they wished to imply that an event (especially the story of any [[saint]] not acknowledged in [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'') was fictitious. Thus, ''legend'' gained its modern connotations of "undocumented" and "[[wikt:spurious|spurious]]", which distinguish it from the meaning of ''[[chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Collinson. ''Elizabethans'', "Truth and Legend: The Veracity of John Foxe's Book of Martyrs" 2003:151–77, balances the authentic records and rhetorical presentation of Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'', itself a mighty force of Protestant legend-making. Sherry L. Reames, ''The Legenda Aurea: a reexamination of its paradoxical history'', 1985, examines the "Renaissance verdict" on the Legenda, and its wider influence in skeptical approaches to Catholic [[hagiography]] in general.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, [[Jacob Grimm]] described the [[fairy tale]] as "poetic, legend historic."&lt;ref&gt;''Das Märchen ist poetischer, die Sage, historischer'', quoted at the commencement of Tangherlini's survey of legend scholarship (Tangherlini 1990:371)&lt;/ref&gt; Early scholars such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Wehrhan|2=de|3=Karl Wehrhan|preserve=1}}&lt;ref&gt;Wehrhan ''Die Sage'' (Leipzig) 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Ranke]]&lt;ref&gt;Ranke, "Grundfragen der Volkssagen Forshung", in Leander Petzoldt (ed.), ''Vergleichende Sagenforschung'' 1971:1–20, noted by Tangherlini 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Will Erich Peuckert]]&lt;ref&gt;Peuckert , ''Sagen'' (Munich: E Schmidt) 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; followed Grimm's example in focussing solely on the literary narrative, an approach that was enriched particularly after the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;This was stimulated in part, Tangherlini suggests, by the 1962 congress of the International Society for Folk Narrative Research.&lt;/ref&gt; by addressing questions of performance and the anthropological and psychological insights provided in considering legends' social context. Questions of categorising legends, in hopes of compiling a content-based series of categories on the line of the [[Aarne–Thompson]] folktale index, provoked a search for a broader new synthesis.

In an early attempt at defining some basic questions operative in examining folk tales, {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Ranke|2=de|3=Friedrich Ranke|preserve=1}} in 1925&lt;ref&gt;Ranke, "Grundfragen der Volkssagenforschung", ''Niederdeutsche Zeitschrift für Volkskunde'' '''3''' (1925, reprinted 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; characterised the folk legend as "a popular narrative with an objectively untrue imaginary content"  a dismissive position that was subsequently largely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Perdue Jt., reviewing [[Linda Dégh]] and Andrew Vászony's essay "The crack on the red goblet or truth and the modern legend" in Richard M. Dorson, ed. ''Folklore in the Modern World'', (The Hague: Mouton)1978, in ''The Journal of American Folklore'' '''93''' No. 369 (July–September 1980:367), remarked on Ranke's definition, criticised in the essay, as a "dead issue". A more recent examination of the balance between oral performance and literal truth at work in legends forms Gillian Bennett's chapter "Legend: Performance and Truth" in Gillian Bennett and Paul Smith, eds. ''Contemporary Legend'' (Garland) 1996:17–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the highly structured folktale, legend is comparatively amorphous, [[Helmut de Boor]] noted in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;de Boor, "Märchenforschung", ''Zeitschrift für Deutschkunde'' '''42''' 1928:563–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative content of legend is in realistic mode, rather than the wry [[irony]] of folktale;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lutz Röhrich]], ''Märchen und Wirklichkeit: Eine volkskundliche Untersuchung'' (Wiesbaden: Steiner Verlag) 1956:9–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm Heiske&lt;ref&gt;Heiske, "Das Märchen ist poetischer, die Sage, historischer: Versuch einer Kritik", ''Deutschunterricht'''''14''' 1962:69–75..&lt;/ref&gt; remarked on the similarity of [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] in legend and folktale and concluded that, in spite of its realistic [[Literary mode|mode]], legend is not more historical than folktale.

In ''Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft'' (1928), [[Ernst Bernheim]] asserted that a legend is simply a longstanding [[rumour]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernheim, ''Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft''(Berlin: de Gruyter) 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] credited the staying-power of some rumours to the persistent cultural state-of-mind that they embody and capsulise;&lt;ref&gt;Allport, ''The Psychology of Rumor'' (New York: Holt, Rinehart) 1947:164.&lt;/ref&gt; thus "[[Urban legend]]s" are a feature of rumour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bengt af Klintberg]], "Folksägner i dag" ''Fataburen'' 1976:269–96.&lt;/ref&gt; When Willian Jansen suggested that legends that disappear quickly were "short-term legends" and the persistent ones be termed "long-term legends", the distinction between legend and rumour was effectively obliterated, Tangherlini concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, "Legend: oral tradition in the modern experience", ''Folklore Today, A Festschrift for William Dorson'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press) 1972:265–72, noted in Tangherlini 1990:375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian ''legenda''==
{{main article|Legendary material in Christian hagiography}}

In the narrow Christian sense, ''legenda'' ("things to be read [on a certain day, in church]") were [[hagiographical]] accounts, often collected in a legendary. Because saints' lives are often included in many miracle stories, ''legend'', in a wider sense, came to refer to any story that is set in a historical context but that contains [[supernatural]], divine or fantastic elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09121a.htm ''Literary or Profane Legends'']. Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hübner Bürkner Genoveva.jpg|thumb|The mediaeval legend of [[Genevieve of Brabant]] connected her to [[Treves]].]]

[[Hippolyte Delehaye]] distinguished legend from [[mythology|myth]]: "The ''legend'', on the other hand, has, of necessity, some historical or topographical connection. It refers imaginary events to some real personage, or it localizes romantic stories in some definite spot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/delehaye-legends.html Hippolyte Delehaye, ''The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography'' (1907)], Chapter I: Preliminary Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;

From the moment a legend is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary qualities begin to fade and recede: in ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'',  [[Washington Irving]] transformed a local Hudson River Valley legend into a literary anecdote with [[Gothic novel|"Gothic" overtones]], which actually tended to diminish its character as genuine legend.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Stories that exceed the boundaries of "[[Realism (arts)|realism]]" are called "[[fable]]s". For example, the [[talking animal]] formula of [[Aesop]] identifies his brief stories as fables, not legends. The parable of the [[Prodigal Son]] would be a legend if it were told as having actually happened to a specific son of a historical father. If it included a [[donkey]] that gave sage advice to the Prodigal Son it would be a fable.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Legend may be transmitted orally, passed on person-to-person, or, in the original sense, through written text. [[Jacob de Voragine]]'s ''Legenda Aurea'' or "The Golden Legend" comprises a series of ''vitae'' or instructive  biographical narratives, tied to the [[liturgical calendar]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. They are presented as lives of the saints, but the profusion of miraculous happenings and above all their uncritical context are characteristics of [[hagiography]]. The ''Legenda'' was intended to inspire extemporized homilies and sermons appropriate to the [[saint]] of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy R. Tangherlini, "'It Happened Not Too Far from Here...': A Survey of Legend Theory and Characterization" ''Western Folklore'' '''49'''.4 (October 1990:371–390).

==Urban legend==
[[File:Union Graveyard II.jpg|thumb|The tale of the White Lady who haunts Union Cemetery is a variant of the [[Vanishing hitchhiker]] legend.]]
{{main|Urban legend}}

The [[vanishing hitchhiker]] is the best-known [[urban legend]] in America, traceable as far back as 1870, but it is found around the world including in Korea and Russia. In the legend, a young girl in a white dress picked up alongside of the road by a passerby. The unknown girl in white remains silent for the duration of her ride, thanks the driver, and quietly gets out at her destination. When the driver turns to look back, the girl has vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Gillian. (1998). ''The Vanishing Hitchhiker at Fifty-Five''. ''[[Western Folklore]]''.

'''Light poetry''' or '''light verse''' is [[poetry]] that attempts to be humorous.  Light poems are usually brief, can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature [[word play]] including [[pun]]s, adventurous rhyme, and heavy [[alliteration]]. Typically, light verse in English is formal verse, although a few [[free verse]] poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition.

While light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]] or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned "serious" poets, such as Horace, Swift, Pope, and Auden, also excelled at light verse.

This page lists [[Las Vegas Valley]] [[lounge music]] performers.

==Origins of Las Vegas nightlife==
The pioneers of the Las Vegas lounge scene were [[The Mary Kaye Trio]] with [[Mary Kaye]]. Although the lounge existed in Las Vegas hotels, it was not until the trio started the "Dusk til Dawn"{{clarify|date=November 2012|reason=a club?  an act?}} that the nightlife existed in Las Vegas.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}  Many credit [[Louis Prima]] as the original, but the trio started it five years before Prima came to Vegas. Prima and [[Keely Smith]] followed the trio in the origins of Las Vegas nightlife.

'''Monolayic theatre''' refers to a [[play (theatre)|play]] that is a [[monologue]], meaning it is by one character, but what is typically done is that a [[Theatre director|director]] will use several characters to portray the emotions and actions of the person telling the monologue. An example of this is ''[[Pool, No Water]]'' by [[Mark Ravenhill]].

Monolayic script is a piece of text which has no distinctive [[Player character|characters]]; this means that the director has to separate the text to give the desired effect of the play. Even though the text is all one long speech, like a monologue, characters and [[characterisation]] can be chosen from the text, as each of the lines are very different thus giving the [[actor]] a character to work with. The script seems to be all spoken by one person, however when the play is performed or the lines are divided, it seems that the person the monologue is for never actually speaks.

The advantages of monolayic theatre are that the director can be very creative and give the play a very personal response, as it was divided up from their own imagination. Also it gives the director the chance to think of the characters they want in within the performance. However the disadvantages of monolayic theatre is that it is very time consuming as it must take a lot of research into characters and a lot of time to divide the lines. Monolayic theatre is often performed with one [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]], to give a sense of flow and ongoing within the play.  In the example above, ''Pool, No Water'' is performed with just a white tile background, this is to symbolize the bottom of the swimming pool and the cleanliness of the hospital ward, which is where most of the play is set.

Another aspect of the performance is that the actors rarely, if ever, leave the stage.

'''''Most Extreme Elimination Challenge''''' ('''''MXC''''') is an [[United States|American]] [[comedy]] [[television]] program that aired on [[Paramount Network|Spike TV]] from 2003 to 2007. It is a re-purpose of footage from the [[Japan]]ese [[game show]] ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]'' which originally aired in Japan from 1986 to 1990. The re-purposed "MXC" created a completely new premise, storyline and characters.   The MXC re-purpose created two teams competing against each other à la a typical Saturday afternoon network football game broadcast, with players trying to win points for their teams by surviving through different challenges.  In the original program the Count and his underlings would follow the progress of the players as they moved through the course. In the re-purpose Count Takeshi became veteran network announcer Vic Romano and the count's flunky became young upstart Kenny Blankenship. 

''Most Extreme Elimination Challenge'' was created and produced by RC Entertainment, Inc. (Paul Abeyta and Peter Kaikko) in Los Angeles, California and Larry Strawther (a writer and producer on a number of network sitcoms).  The three were friends who had worked together at Merv Griffin Productions in the late 1970s. Strawther was the staff on the ''[[Dance Fever]]'' pilot which Abeyta took over as Executive Producer the following season, while Strawther stayed with ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. Between jobs they would occasionally try to create their own projects. One of these was the 1990s talk show spoof ''[[Night Stand with Dick Dietrick]]''.  MXC is the property of both Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) and RC Entertainment. The 2004 special episode ''MXC Almost Live'' is the property of Viacom International, which was filmed in [[Orlando, Florida]] by the producers of ''MXC''.

==Episodes==
{{main|List of Most Extreme Elimination Challenge episodes}}
{{:List of Most Extreme Elimination Challenge episodes}}

The premise of ''Most Extreme Elimination Challenge'' (as distinct from ''Takeshi's Castle'') is a game show that is hosted by the eccentric characters Vic Romano (Vic Wilson) and Kenny Blankenship (Chris Darga), along with the field marshal Captain Tenneal ([[John Cervenka]]) and the field reporter Guy LeDouche ([[John Cervenka]]). The announcer ([[John Cervenka]]) would begin each episode with this standard introduction. 

{{Quote|"''What are these people running from? They're not! They're running TO the World's Toughest Competition in Town!''"}}

When the show was transitioning away from its full name, it briefly added "''Most Extreme Elimination Challenge!''" to the end of the opening.

Eventually the opening introduction was changed to:

{{Quote|"''Get fired up for MXC! The world's most toughest competition in town!''"}}

Usually, two or three teams of contestants compete in several turn-based and head-to-head challenges. The only episode done without a competitive team base was the first episode ever made, which was simply centered around the stereotypical antics of college girls. Even though this was the first episode made,&lt;ref&gt;DVD Audio Commentary for Season 1, Episode 7&lt;/ref&gt; it was the seventh episode of season one to air. Most other competitive teams do not truly have a real-life rivalry (e.g., Season 1, Episode 2 "Donors vs Addicts"), while others such as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] vs [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] vs [[Third party (politics)|Third Party]] do.

The contestants compete in a variety of challenges, usually four per episode, but occasionally as many as six. The challenges are extremely hard, and a majority of the contestants fail to complete the challenges. Throughout the show, painful failures to complete challenges are reviewed by Vic and Kenny in the "''MXC'' Impact Replay" (briefly given sponsor names like the "Snickers Satisfies Replay" and the "[[Slim Jim (snack food)|Slim Jim]] Snap of the Day"), which is essentially a sports-themed playback feature. Occasionally, the Impact Replay is used for Kenny's pleasure, in looking at the female contestants, items, or random events in the series which he finds funny or disappointing. Contestants who do complete a challenge earn one or two points for their team (maybe even more). The team with the most points at the end of the episode wins the competition. At the end of each episode, Kenny counts down the ten "Most Painful Eliminations of the Day", which usually focus on the events shown in the Impact Replay, but sometimes includes random events that involved the main or recurring characters.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Kenny and Vic, along with any other people around them at the end of the show, all end the episode by saying: "Don't get eliminated!"

===''MXC Almost Live'' and other special episodes===
On April 22, 2004, Spike TV aired a special edition of the show to start the third season, featuring [[skateboard]]er [[Tony Hawk]] and [[snowboard]]er [[Tara Dakides]]. The special was taped at the [[Universal Orlando Resort]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] using students from nearby colleges and appropriately dubbed '''''MXC Almost Live'''''. The special edition is not based on the original ''Takeshi's Castle'' footage, but only has some added in for Vic, Ken, the Captain, and Guy LeDouche. Actors were hired to play those who would replace the roles of the latter two, named "Major Babe" (Michelle Sorrell) and "Gip LeDouche" (Eric Esteban). While everyone in the episode is American, everything said by any contestants besides Hawk and Dakides is still dubbed.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Three other special episodes aired, all from Season 2, including a special nighttime episode, a "Monsters vs. Mascots" episode, and a special winter episode.

Spike initially held a contest in 2005 or 2006 where the winner would have his name and the name of five of his friends used in an episode of MXC and would also receive a viewing party of said episode for up to 50 people at a place of his choice.  However, this contest never fully materialized and is assumed to have been canceled for unknown reasons.

==Characters==
''Most of the characters and contestants on MXC are voiced by the producers and series' writers: Victor Wilson, Christopher Darga, [[John Cervenka]], and [[Mary Scheer]] who did all of the female voices.''{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Main characters===
*'''Vic Romano''' (Victor Wilson provides his dub voice), is the co-host and play-by-play commentator. In Takeshi's Castle, Vic's character is Count Takeshi himself, the main character of the show. In MXC, Vic is level-headed, has a dark past of alcohol abuse, failed marriages, and various addictions, and generally treats ''MXC'' as a serious competition. Vic was once also a professional baseball player who became addicted to "everything", including every type of drug, alcohol, and easy women. He once was an airline pilot during his stint of alcohol abuse, but states: "Luckily, nobody noticed." Notable catchphrases include "Right you are, Ken!", "Indeed!", and "Kenny!", which is usually followed by him smacking Kenny's head with a paper fan, in response to Kenny's commentary of the action. The character is played by Japanese actor and movie director [[Takeshi Kitano]], who also created the original series MXC is based on, ''Takeshi's Castle.''
*'''Kenny Blankenship''' (Chris Darga provides the dub voice) is Vic's co-host and [[color commentator]]. Blankenship is a high-school dropout whose uncle owns the network. Kenny's character is very unprofessional about hosting, far less serious about the job than Vic's character is. Despite his non-professional, simplistic stand-point, he claims to make ten times the amount that Vic does because of his uncle being one of the network bosses. Kenny has also been stated to own a condo complex from all the money that he earns from hosting and drives a Volkswagen Jetta. During hosting, Kenny usually spends his time commenting on the sexual appeal of the female competitors and how much he likes beer, pizza and seeing the majority of competitors wipe out. Kenny's character was originally played by comedian [[Hideo Higashikokubaru|Sonomanma Higashi]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
*'''Captain Tenneal''' ([[John Cervenka]] provides the dub voice), whose name comes from the 1970s musical act [[Captain &amp; Tennille]], is the field marshal who conducts the contestants through each challenge with a sharp "Get it on!" Near the beginning of each ''MXC'' episode, he is seen addressing the contestants as a group, asking whether some broad assertion relating to one of the topics in the episode is true. After the contestants raise their hands to show agreement, the Captain usually declares "Well, you're wrong!", but on one occasion, the "Cops vs. Cons" episode of Season 1, he actually agreed with the contestants. He'll sometimes defend his opinion by saying, "Of course I'm right, I'm the Captain!" After further explanation and give-and-take with individual contestants, he bellows "Let's Go!" and leads the contestants forward to begin playing the games. Captain Tenneal is played by [[Hayato Tani]].
*'''Guy LeDouche''' (pronounced "gee" as in "geezer"; [[John Cervenka]] provides the dub voice) is the MXC field reporter. He is portrayed wearing a [[pith helmet]] and his personality is that of a flamboyant, perverted man of suggested [[France|French]] descent who has a questionable sexual orientation, as he makes passes to many of the contestants he interviews, regardless of gender. Some situations, which usually involve some violence directed at Guy, he will respond with, "Guy like!" In addition to this, he is seen to have a romantic interest in Captain Tenneal, always calling him "Skipper". He has other family member interviewers who show the same behavior, such as "Lyndon" (which plays off wacky political figure [[Lyndon LaRouche]]), "Geek", "Giddy", "Gip", "Goon", "Gawp", and "Gawk", along with females named "Gay", "Grandmama", "Gab", "Gin", "Gidget", and "Gal", with an unrelated reporter named Al Frankincense. Guy is played by [[Junji Inagawa]]. The family (and Al) is voiced by John Cervenka (male) and [[Mary Scheer]] (female).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Guy, and his family members, along with interviewing contestants, will also announce the games that will be played in each episode, and will sometimes explain one or more of the games' objectives.

===Recurring characters===
The following are characters who have established a semi-consistent name. However, their names may change to fit in with a show's theme or style of game.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

*''Danny Glands'' ([[John Cervenka]] provides the dub voice) (a play on the name of long-time [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] entertainer [[Danny Gans]]) is an ''MXC'' staffer who works in many of the games. His primary responsibilities include asking questions in ''Finger It'' (later renamed ''Hand Job''), knocking down contestants in ''Brass Balls'', and launching the soccer balls in ''Dirty Balls''. Also known as ''Jimmy Junk'', ''Sugar Ramos Phiss'', ''Golden Shower Boy'', ''Barry Sosa'', and ''Spin''. The original actor is early 1980s [[J-Pop]] star [[Michiru Jo]]; he is notably skinny, and his lack of appealing physique is often played for laughs, emphasized by his voice actor who adopts a nasal, nerdy tone.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
*''Skanki'' is a {{convert|16|ft|m|0|sing=on}} samurai who punishes contestants that fail to complete the ''Wall Bangers'' game.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
*''Chief Otto Parts'' (a parody of the [[Chief Auto Parts]] auto supply store chain) is an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] who taunts the contestants in ''Rotating Surfboard of Death''.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
*''Em on Em'' (a spoof of rapper [[Eminem]], as well as a play on the [[pornographic film]] term "m on m", or man on man) is an apparently gay set of twin [[rapper]]s dressed in [[rainbow]] ponchos and [[bowler hat]]s. Main games include ''Tumbling Dominos of Doom'' and ''Irritable Bowl Syndrome''. Also known as "Babe and Ruth" "Bud and Pud", and "Jessie and Jackson" among others. They are played by identical twins Shoji and Shoichi Kinoshita. In one of the episodes, there was a contestant named [[Eminem|Marshall Mathers]], the real name of Eminem.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
*The ''[[Baba ghanoush|Babaganoosh]] Family'' is a family of contestants from the [[Middle East]] who appear in nearly every episode. The last name "Babaganoosh" became a popular running gag throughout the series.  It comes from Chris Darga's Lebanese heritage where babaganoush is a popular entree.
*The ''Brown [[Spider]]'' taunts contestants in various games, including ''Wall Buggers'' and ''Dash to Death''. Usually played by [[Brad Lesley]] (also known as Brad Leslie).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_dpGH_ubik |title=Wall Bangers (Wall Buggers) 1 – Most Extreme Elimination Challenge (MXC) |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-12-26 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dash to Death"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rVYpavgiF0 |title=The Best of the Best of MXC – Dash to Death |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Herbie the Steamy Pile'' is a strange, brown creature who taunts and sprays fallen contestants with a fire-extinguisher in ''Buck Off!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn_bY_eDptM |title=Buck Off 1 – Most Extreme Elimination Challenge (MXC) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Zygote Brothers'' are identical characters that appear in the game ''Dash to Death''. They attempt to distract the contestants and knock them into the water as they run through the obstacle course.&lt;ref name="Dash to Death"/&gt;
*''Sporky'' is a character featured in the game ''Dash to Death''. Hiding inside a jail cell near the "spinner" obstacle, Sporky taunts contestants as they pass by.

Although uncredited, [[Jamie Alcroft]] was the announcer for the first four episodes of ''MXC'' before [[John Cervenka]] took over that role for the remainder of the series.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Production==
In the show, the contestants' names are usually names of celebrities, network bosses, or family members and friends of the producers or voice actors. Several recurring names appear in the show; the most common family name is ''Babaganoosh'', since the producers of ''MXC'' were given short deadlines for producing episodes, therefore giving them limited time to write the scripts. Babaganoosh comes from Darga as his family is from the Middle East, where [[Baba ghanoush]] is the name of a local eggplant dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=March 11th, 2012 |url=http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2012/03/baba-ganoush.html |title=The Grammarphobia Blog: The spicy history of baba ganoush |publisher=Grammarphobia.com |date=2012-03-11 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the production of the show, the network bosses stated that they did not want the producers to repeat games from episode to episode, but the producers ignored this, knowing 1) they didn't have the rights to enough episodes at the time to not repeat, but 2) some of the games (especially "Log Rollers" and "Sinkers or Floaters") to be interesting and funny every time.   Some fan-favorite and recurring games included ''Log Drop'', ''Wall Bangers'', ''Dope on a Rope'', ''Rotating Surfboard of Death'', and ''Sinkers and Floaters'', amongst many others. Due to the high viewership and popularity of ''MXC'' in the United States, several of the original Japanese actors whose acting careers were failing at the time ''MXC'' aired in the United States got massive career re-boots because of the U.S. fan base.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

While the basic premise of ''MXC'' is that of a legitimate game show, its true premise is that of a comedy not intended to be taken literally. All original audio was stripped from each show for legal reasons, and all audio was added by producer-writers and an audio technician, leaving none of the original audio from ''Takeshi's Castle.'' The script is completely unrelated to the original Japanese dialogue; Both Abeyta and Strawther's original notes deliberately avoided any references to Japanese or Asian culture.  The characters could be from Iowa.  Some thought the only Japanese-related, albeit loosely, term used for the show was the name ''Most Extreme Elimination Challenge'', which has a Japanese-like naming style. But Strawther noted that the title – pitched by Abeyta – was a spoof on network buying tendencies of the time – "Extreme sports were big and the term was being thrown around everywhere.  We thought it was funny to use "Most Extreme."  All the producers and writers admit that they had no knowledge of what the contestants or actors were originally saying during the filming of ''Takeshi's Castle''. ''MXC'''s early scripts spoofed [[popular culture|pop culture]], or mocked various celebrities, athletes, sports announcers, politicians, with the occasional sexual pun. In later seasons, with network encouragement, sexual puns and references took on a much larger role, to the dismay of some of the show's producers who felt the cheap jokes led to its demise earlier than necessary.  Contestants are given seemingly incongruous but humorous names and occupations based on their team and physical appearance (e.g. Sal Bloomberg from [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]], a meat handler team member in the Season 1 episode "Meat Handlers vs. Cartoon Voice Actors", aka "Network Boss"). In addition, the various challenges are all given humorous names, such as ''Sinkers &amp; Floaters'' or ''Wall Bangers''. Any water or mud used in a challenge is given humorous names from Kenny and Vic, notably "septic sludge", with Kenny usually following it with a more specific name (e.g. "runoff from a local chili cook off").   The footage for a single episode of ''MXC'' can come from multiple episodes of ''Takeshi's Castle'', and occasionally the same footage, including challenges, will be used in multiple episodes with different character names and dialogue. Unlike international editions of ''Takeshi's Castle'', the original text that appeared on screen is left as is, with the characters often playing off of it.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Production Team Trivia: All four of the Producers / Performers / Writers on the series are alums of the famous ''[[Groundlings]]'' in Hollywood: [[John Cervenka]], Christopher Darga, [[Mary Scheer]], and Victor Wilson.  The creators/Exec Producers Paul Abeyta and Larry Strawther had worked together at Merv Griffin Productions in the late 1970s.  Strawther had worked on the company's pilots for the re-boot of [[Jeopardy!]] and [[Dance Fever]] in 1978.  When both shows sold Strawther went with Jeopardy as its head writer and Abeyta came over Merv's talk show to exec produce [[Dance Fever]]. Kaikko worked for Dance Fever's  distributor 20th-Century Fox and while overseeing that show he struck up a longtime friendship and business partnership with Abeyta. Strawther went on to write and produce network sitcoms, including ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]'', ''[[Night Court]]'' and ''[[My Sister Sam]]'' and some movies like ''[[Without a Clue]]'', but between jobs he would work with Abeyta and Kaikko on spec projects that seemed like they would be fun.

==Lawsuits==
The American gameshow ''[[Wipeout (2008 U.S. game show)|Wipeout]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was accused of being "a blatant copycat" of shows such as ''Takeshi's Castle'' and ''Most Extreme Elimination Challenge'', and a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit was filed by Tokyo Broadcasting System against ABC in late 2008, claiming the obstacle-course game show closely resembled several Japanese shows. It alleged ''Wipeout'' violated its copyrights to shows such as ''Takeshi's Castle'' and ''[[Ninja Warrior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/081007/gnj0810071200020-n1.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211072527/http://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/081007/gnj0810071200020-n1.htm |date=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese network later sued Dutch entertainment giant [[Endemol]], which produces ''Wipeout''.

The companies settled the case on November 30, 2011, after meeting with a federal magistrate judge in Los Angeles. No settlement terms were filed with the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/wipeout-copyright-lawsuit-abc-endemol-276301 |title=ABC, Endemol Settle 'Wipeout' Copyright Lawsuit With Japanese Broadcaster |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=2011-12-24 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Performing arts}}
'''Music''' is an art form and [[culture|cultural]] activity whose medium is sound organized in time. In general [[definitions of music]] will include common elements such as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs [[melody]] and [[harmony]]), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], and [[articulation (music)|articulation]]), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]] (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different [[Music genre|styles or types]] of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and vocal techniques ranging from singing to [[rapping]]; there are solely [[Instrumental music|instrumental pieces]], [[a capella|solely vocal pieces]] (such as songs without instrumental [[accompaniment]]) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muse]]s").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368891 |title=Mousike, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus |publisher=perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See [[glossary of musical terminology]].

In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or [[Culture|cultural]] activity include the creation of works of music ([[song]]s, tunes, [[symphony|symphonies]], and so on), the [[Music criticism|criticism of music]], the [[Musicology|study of the history of music]], and the [[Aesthetics of music|aesthetic examination of music]]. [[Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Indian philosophers|Indian philosophers]] defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the [[harmony of the spheres]]" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer [[John Cage]] thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no [[noise]], only sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1E3BF930A2575BC0A964958260 |title=John Cage, 79, a Minimalist Enchanted With Sound, Dies |last=Kozinn |first=Allen |authorlink=Allan Kozinn |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 August 1992 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Grosse Fuge]]'' [[string quartet]] in 1825,&lt;ref&gt;Watson 2009, 109–10.&lt;/ref&gt; early [[jazz]] in the beginning of the 1900s&lt;ref&gt;Reiland Rabaka. ''Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the [[Hip Hop Movement]]''. Lexington Books, 2012. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hardcore punk]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Manabe, Noriko. ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima''. Oxford University Press, 2015. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of music, including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], [[art music]], [[Liturgical music|music written for religious ceremonies]] and [[work song]]s such as [[chantey]]s. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played [[Musical improvisation|improvisational music]] such as [[jazz]], and [[avant-garde]] styles of [[aleatory|chance-based]] [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries.

Music can be divided into [[music genre|genres]] (e.g., [[country music]]) and genres can be further divided into [[subgenre]]s (e.g., [[country blues]] and [[pop country]] are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Within [[the arts]], music may be classified as a [[performing arts|performing art]], a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a [[rock concert]] or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a [[theatre music|dramatic work]] (a [[music theater]] show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, [[CD player]], [[smartphone]] or as [[film score]] or TV show.

In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in  [[religious ritual]]s, [[rite of passage]] ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., [[dance club|dancing]]) and cultural activities ranging from amateur [[karaoke]] singing to playing in an amateur [[Funk|funk band]] or singing in a community [[choir]]. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a [[youth orchestra]], or work as a professional musician or singer. The [[music industry]] includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, [[jazz]] band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and [[sound engineer]]s), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings and [[sheet music]] and scores to customers.

==Etymology==
[[File:Muses sarcophagus Louvre MR880.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including [[the arts]].]]
The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muses]]").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and [[the arts]] and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the ''Online Etymological Dictionary'', the term "music" is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from [[Old French]] ''musique'' (12c.) and directly from [[Latin]] ''musica'' "the art of music," also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish ''musica'', Italian ''musica'', [[Old High German]] ''mosica'', German ''Musik'', Dutch ''muziek'', Danish ''musik'')." This is derived from the "...Greek ''mousike (techne)'' "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses," from Mousa "Muse" (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In [[classical Greece]], [the term "music" refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and [[lyric poetry]]."&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=music |title=music |publisher=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a form of art or entertainment==
[[File:Photo récital 028.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|{{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Gabriel Ferlan|fr}} performing at a 2008 concert at the collège-lycée Saint-François Xavier]]
Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through [[sheet music]] scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the [[sheet music]] of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home [[tape recorder]]s in the 1980s and [[digital music]] in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or [[playlist]]s of their favourite songs and take them with them on a [[Cassette player|portable cassette player]] or MP3 player. Some music lovers create [[mix tape]]s of their favorite songs, which serve as a "self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved."&lt;ref&gt;Kirszner, Laurie G. (January 2012). ''Patterns for College Writing''. Bedford/St. Martin's. p. 520. {{ISBN|978-0-312-67684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere. [[Professional musician]]s are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or [[filmmaking|film production]] companies, and [[music school]]s. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or [[session musician]]s, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take [[music lesson|lessons]] with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community [[concert band]]s and community orchestras.

A distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in [[popular music]] forms such as rock, where [[Bootleg recording|illegally taped live concerts]] are prized by music lovers. In the [[jam band]] scene, live, improvised [[jam session]]s are preferred to studio recordings.

===Composition===
{{Main|Musical composition}}
[[File:Coffee and synths. KayoDot album "Hubardo" recording, 2013-06-13.jpg|thumb|People composing music in 2013 using [[electronic keyboard]]s and computers.]]
[[File:Michel Richard Delalande engraving BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|French [[Baroque music]] composer [[Michel Richard Delalande]] (1657–1726), pen in hand.]]
"Composition" is the act or practice of creating a song, an [[instrumental music]] piece, a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of [[music notation]], such as a [[sheet music|sheet music "score"]], which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the [[lead sheet]], which sets out the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[chord progression]]. In classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.

Even when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or [[musical phrasing|phrasing]] of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although a musical composition often uses [[musical notation]] and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the [[blues]], a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutosławski]]. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze.

The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].

===Notation===
{{Main|Musical notation}}
[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sheet music is written representation of music. This is a [[homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of a traditional piece entitled "[[Adeste Fideles]]", in standard two-staff format for mixed voices. {{audio|Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.mid|Play}}]]
In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a [[melody]], are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a "slow blues" or a "fast swing", which indicates the tempo and the genre.  To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of [[music theory]], [[harmony]] and the [[performance practice]] associated with a particular song or piece's genre.

Written notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as [[sheet music]] or, for individuals with computer [[scorewriter]] programs, as an image on a [[computer screen]]. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres requiring [[musical improvisation]], the performer often plays from music where only the [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g., [[jazz]] or [[country music]]).

In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the [[lead sheet]], which notates the melody, chords, [[lyrics]] (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. [[Fake book]]s are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit [[rhythm section]] members to improvise an [[accompaniment]] part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz "[[big band]]s." In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in [[tablature]] (often abbreviated as "tab"), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the [[lute]], a stringed, fretted instrument.

===Improvisation===
{{Main|Musical improvisation}}
[[Musical improvisation]] is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or chord progression. Improvisation is the act of instantaneous composition by performers, where compositional techniques are employed with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]], in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines and accompaniment parts. In the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments and [[basso continuo]] keyboard players improvised [[chord voicing]]s based on [[figured bass]] notation. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso [[cadenza]]s during concerts. However, in the 20th and early 21st century, as "common practice" Western [[art music]] performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role. At the same time, some modern composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In [[Indian classical music]], improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.

===Theory===
{{Main|Music theory}}
Music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the [[language]] and [[Musical notation|notation]] of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the [[parameter (music)|parameters]] or elements of music – rhythm, [[harmony]] ([[Diatonic function|harmonic function]]), [[melody]], structure, [[Musical form|form]], and [[Texture (music)|texture]]. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boretz |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Boretz |title=Meta-Variations: studies in the foundations of musical thought… |publisher=Open Space |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who study these properties are known as music theorists. Some have applied [[acoustics]], [[human physiology]], and [[psychology]] to the explanation of how and why music is [[perceive]]d.

==Elements==
{{main|Aspect of music}}
Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of "element" being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. Below is a list of the three official versions of the "elements of music":

In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: "appropriate [[musical notation]]s" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the "elements of music" to the "inter-related dimensions of music". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.&lt;ref&gt;Gov.uk. (2013). ''National curriculum in England: music programmes of study''. Retrieved 6 January 2016, from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-music-programmes-of-study&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "the elements of music" is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the "rudimentary elements of music" and the "perceptual elements of music".

===Rudimentary elements===
In the 1800s, the phrases "the elements of music" and "the rudiments of music" were used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Clementi, M. (1974). Introduction to the art of playing on the piano forte: Da Capo Pr. Cohen, D., &amp; Dubnov, S. (1997). [[Gestalt phenomena]] in musical texture: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niecks, F. (1884). A concise dictionary of musical terms. The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular, 25(498), 473. doi: 10.2307/3357513&lt;/ref&gt;  The elements described in these documents refer to aspects of music that are needed in order to become a musician, Recent writers such as Estrella &lt;ref&gt;Estrella, E. (2015). The Elements of music. Retrieved 15 Jan. 2015, 2015, from http://musiced.about.com/od/beginnerstheory/a/musicelements.htm&lt;/ref&gt; seem to be using the phrase "elements of music" in a similar manner. A definition which most accurately reflects this usage is: "the rudimentary principles of an art, science, etc.: the elements of grammar."&lt;ref&gt;Element. (n.d.). In Dictionary.com unabridged.   Retrieved 10 Jun 2015, from  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/element&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's curriculum switch to the "inter-related dimensions of music" seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.

===Perceptual elements===
Since the emergence of the study of [[psychoacoustics]] in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we ''hear'' music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book ''Psychology of Music'',&lt;ref&gt;Seashore, C. E. (1938). ''Psychology of music'': New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; identified four "psychological attributes of sound". These were: "pitch, loudness, time, and timbre" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). He did not call them the "elements of music" but referred to them as "elemental components" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: "Pitch" and "timbre" match exactly, "loudness" links with dynamics and "time" links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase "the elements of music" links more closely with ''Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary'' definition of an element as: "a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods"&lt;ref&gt;Webster, N. (Ed.) (1947) Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary. Clevelend Ohio: The World Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.

Although writers of lists of "rudimentary elements of music" can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.

===Analysis of styles===
[[File:George Clinton 2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. Pictured are the influential funk musicians [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament Funkadelic]] in 2006.]]
Some styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. To give one example, while [[Bebop]]-era [[jazz]] makes use of very complex chords, including [[altered dominant]]s and challenging [[chord progression]]s, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, [[funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. While Romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire Baroque dance suites for [[harpsichord]] from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. To give another example, while some [[art music]] pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] are very long, some pop songs are just a few minutes long.

===Description of elements===

====Pitch and melody====
[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is "higher" or "lower" than another musical sound, note or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high [[piccolo]] note or [[whistling]] tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a [[bass drum]]. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]]. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano  than to try to discern the pitch of a [[crash cymbal]] that is struck.
[[File:Popgoesweasel.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|The melody to the traditional song "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]"  {{audio|Pop Goes the Weasel.ogg|Play}}]]

A [[melody]] (also called a "tune") is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or [[key (music)|key]] of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C; these are the "[[white notes]]" on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, [[Bebop]]-era jazz from the 1940s and [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many [[chromatic note]]s (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the "white notes" and "black notes" and unusual scales, such as the [[whole tone scale]] (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}}). A low, deep musical line played by bass instruments such as double bass, electric bass or [[tuba]] is called a [[bassline]].

====Harmony and chords====
[[File:Sol7 accordo chitarra G7 guitar chord.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|When musicians play three or more different [[Musical note|notes]] at the same time, this creates a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. In [[Western culture#Music|Western music]], including classical music, pop music, rock music and many related styles, the most common chords are [[triad (music)|triads]]– three notes usually played at the same time. The most commonly used chords are the [[major chord]] and the [[minor chord]]. An example of a major chord is the three pitches C, E and G. An example of a minor chord is the three pitches A, C and E. (Pictured is a [[guitar player]] performing a chord on a guitar).]]
[[Harmony]] refers to the "vertical" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time to create a [[chord (music)|chord]]. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor [[tonality]] ("keys"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the "home note" or [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820–1900) often contains multiple keys, as does [[jazz]], especially [[Bebop]] jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or "home note" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.

====Rhythm====
Rhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] animates time in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]], which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as [[Waltz]] time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the [[backbeat]] used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or [[common time]]) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the [[snare drum]], a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the [[rhythm section]], which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], double bass) and a drum kit player.

====Texture====
[[Musical texture]] is the overall sound of a piece of music or song.  The texture of a piece or sing is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between [[part (music)|parts]] or lines of music:
* [[monophony]]: a single [[melody]] (or "tune") with neither instrumental [[accompaniment]] nor a [[harmony part]]. A mother singing a [[lullaby]] to her baby would be an example.
* [[heterophony]]: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] to the melody. Two [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]]s playing the same [[traditional music|traditional]] fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody a bit and each add different ornaments.
* [[polyphony]]: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. [[Choir|Choral]] music written in the [[Renaissance music]] era was typically written in this style. A [[round (music)|round]], which is a song such as "[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]", which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is a simple example of polyphony.
* [[homophony]]: a clear melody supported by [[chord (music)|chordal]] [[accompaniment]]. Most Western [[popular music]] songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.

Music that contains a large number of independent [[Part (music)|parts]] (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a "thicker" or "denser" texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo [[flute]] melody accompanied by a single cello).

====Timbre or "tone color"====
Timbre, sometimes called "color" or "tone color" is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Harnsberger, Lindsey. "Articulation." ''Essential Dictionary of Music''. Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. Los Angeles, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440&amp;nbsp;Hz A note sounds different when it is played on [[oboe]], piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different [[embouchure]]s), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., [[gut string]]s versus [[steel strings]]). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).

The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the [[spectrum]], [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] and [[overtone]]s of a note or musical sound. For [[music technology (electric)|electric]] instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and [[electric piano]], the performer can also change the tone by adjusting [[Graphic equalizer|equalizer controls]], tone controls on the instrument, and by using [[effects unit|electronic effects units]] such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedals. The tone of the electric [[Hammond organ]] is controlled by adjusting [[Hammond organ#Drawbars|drawbars]].

====Expression====
[[File:20110921-FSIS-RBN-6084 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Singers add expression to the melodies they sing using many methods, including changing the tone of their singing, adding [[vibrato]] to certain notes, and emphasizing important words in the lyrics.]]
Expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], by adding effects such as [[vibrato]] (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., [[ritardando]] or [[Tempo|accelerando]], which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or [[fermata]]s on a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more [[legato]], which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter).

Expression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato,  etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements in order to convey "an indication of mood, spirit, character etc." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=the definition of expression |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/expression |website=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burton |first1=Russell |title=The elements of music: What are they, and who cares? |journal=Educating for Life. ASME XXth National Conference Proceeding. Australian Society for Music Education. |date=2015 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be considered an important rudimentary element of music.

From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in [[verse-chorus form]], which is based around a sequence of [[verse (popular music)|verse]] and [[chorus (song)|chorus]] ("refrain") sections, with new [[lyrics]] for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of [[strophic form]], sometimes in conjunction with the [[twelve bar blues]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as "a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1=Percy Scholes |title=The Oxford Companion to Music |edition=10 |year=1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Form |ref=CITEREFScholes1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of common forms of Western music include the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]], [[Canon (music)|canon]], [[strophic]], [[theme and variations]], and [[rondo]].
Scholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and [[fugue]] (although musicologist [[Alfred Mann (musicologist)|Alfred Mann]] emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Alfred |title=The Study of Fugue |year=1958 |publisher=W.W.Norton and Co. Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Where a piece cannot readily be broken down into sectional units (though it might borrow some form from a poem, story or [[Programme music|programme]]), it is said to be [[through-composed]]. Such is often the case with a [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]], [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]], [[etude]] (or study), [[symphonic poem]], [[Bagatelle (music)|Bagatelle]], [[impromptu]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as "sectional, developmental, or variational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keil |first=Charles |title=Urban blues |year=1966 |isbn=978-0-226-42960-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sectional form
This form is built from a sequence of clear-cut units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wennerstrom |first=Mary |editor=Wittlich, Gary |title=Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music |year=1975 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-049346-0 |chapter=Form in Twentieth Century Music |ref=CITEREFDeLone1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be referred to by letters but also often have generic names such as [[Introduction (music)|introduction]] and [[Coda (music)|coda]], exposition, development and [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], verse, chorus or [[refrain]], and [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Introductions and codas, when they are no more than that, are frequently excluded from formal analysis. All such units may typically be eight measures long. Sectional forms include:

;Strophic form
This form is defined by its "unrelieved repetition" ('''AAAA'''...).

;Medley

[[Medley (music)|Medley]], [[Potpourri (music)|potpourri]] is the extreme opposite, that of "unrelieved variation": it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections ('''ABCD'''...), sometimes with repeats ('''AABBCCDD'''...).  Examples include orchestral [[overture]]s, which are sometimes no more than a string of the best tunes of the musical theatre show or opera to come.

;Binary form
[[File:Binary form.png|thumb|Binary form in major and minor keys. Each section must be at least three phrases long.&lt;ref&gt;White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p. 50. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

This form uses two sections ('''AB'''...), each often repeated ('''AABB'''...). In 18th-century Western classical music, "simple binary" form was often used for dances and carried with it the convention that the two sections should be in different [[musical key]]s but same rhythm, duration and tone. The alternation of two tunes gives enough variety to permit a dance to be extended for as long as desired.
b
;Ternary form
This form has three parts. In Western classical music a simple ternary form has a third section that is a recapitulation of the first ('''ABA'''). Often, the first section is repeated ('''AABA'''). This approach was popular in the 18th-century operatic [[aria]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and was called ''[[da capo]]'' (i.e. "repeat from the top") form. Later, it gave rise to the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar song]], with the '''B''' section then often referred to as the "middle eight". A song has more need than a dance of a self-contained form with a beginning and an end of course.

;Rondo form
This form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called "episodes". It may be asymmetrical ('''ABACADAEA''') or symmetrical ('''ABACABA'''). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a "development" of it. A similar arrangement is the [[ritornello]] form of the Baroque [[concerto grosso]]. [[Arch form]] ('''ABCBA''') resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme. It is normally used in a round.

;Variational form
Variational forms are those in which variation is an important formative element.

'''[[Theme and Variations]]:''' a [[theme (music)|theme]], which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only "section" and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A, B, A, F, Z, A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the [[Passacaglia]] and [[Chaconne]], was that of the [[ground bass]] – a repeating bass theme or ''basso [[ostinato]]'' over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning [[polyphony|polyphonic]] or [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] threads, or improvising [[division (music)|divisions]] and [[descant]]s. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form ''par excellence'' of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The [[Rondo]] is often found with sections varied ('''AA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''') or ('''ABA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A''').

;Developmental form
Developmental forms are built directly from smaller units, such as [[motif (music)|motifs]]. A well-known Classical piece with a motif is [[Beethoven's fifth symphony]], which starts with three short repeated notes and then a long note. In Classical pieces that are based on motifs, the motif is usually combined, varied and worked out in different ways, perhaps having a symmetrical or arch-like underpinning and a progressive development from beginning to end. By far the most important developmental form in Western classical music is [[Sonata form]].
This form, also known as ''sonata'' form, first movement form, compound binary, ternary and a variety of other names,{{Such as?|Sep2011}} developed from the binary-formed dance movement described above but is almost always cast in a greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions of ''Exposition, Development'' and ''Recapitulation''. Usually, but not always, the "A" parts ([[Exposition (music)|Exposition]] and [[Recapitulation (music)|Recapitulation]], respectively) may be subdivided into two or three [[theme (music)|themes]] or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the "B" part (the [[musical development|development]]) – thus e. g. (AabB[dev. of a and/or b]A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;ab&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+coda). This developmental form is generally confined to certain sections of the piece, as to the middle section of the first movement of a sonata, though 19th-century composers such as Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner made valiant efforts to derive large-scale works purely or mainly from the motif.

===Early history===
[[File:Flûte paléolithique (musée national de Slovénie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.45|A bone flute which is over 41,000 years old.]]

[[Prehistoric music]] can only be theorized based on findings from [[paleolithic]] archaeology sites.

[[Chinese classical music]], the traditional art or court music of China, has a history stretching over around three thousand years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or musical genres. Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12) as does European-influenced music.

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture have discovered common links in theatrical and musical activity between the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] and those of later [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a "social phenomenon called [[litany]]," a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, "Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the "father of all such as handle the harp and pipe," the Pentateuch is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts that follow, a curious thing happens. "One finds in the biblical text," writes Alfred Sendrey, "a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet Samuel was the patriarch of a school, which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy David appears on the scene as a minstrel to King Saul."&lt;ref name=JRT/&gt;

The [[Medieval Music|medieval]] era (476 to 1400), which took place during the [[Middle Ages]], started with the introduction of [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. [[Musical notation]] was used since Ancient times in [[Ancient Greece|Greek culture]], but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the [[Catholic church]] so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the [[monophony|monophonic]] [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called [[Gregorian chant]].&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], and [[Walther von der Vogelweide]].

[[Renaissance music]] (c. 1400 to 1600) was more focused on secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.

The [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe; and during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.&lt;ref name="sdsu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Lucio Vivaldi]].

The music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] should not be confused with Classical music in general, a term which refers to Western [[art music]] from the 5th century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods).  Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the [[Baroque music]] which preceded it. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the [[fortepiano]], the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the Baroque era [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] as the main keyboard instrument.

Importance was given to [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the concerto, and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used [[chamber music]] and orchestra became more standardized. In place of the [[basso continuo]] group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a [[string quartet]] would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The Baroque era improvised chord-playing of the continuo keyboardist or lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800.

One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being  permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as opera and [[oratorio]] became more popular.

The best known composers of Classicism are [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.

===Romanticism===

[[Romantic music]] (c. 1810 to 1900) from the 19th century had many elements in common with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as [[Wagner]] and [[Brahms]] attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.

Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music, exploring new styles and themes.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

In the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound "colours". The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and the [[industrial revolution]] helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do [[urban culture|urban]] society. It also saw a new diversity in [[theatre music]], including [[operetta]], and [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] and other forms of musical theatre.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===20th and 21st century music===
{{Main|20th-century music}}

In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other common instruments, such as violin. With [[20th-century music]], the invention of new [[music technology (electric)|electric technologies]] such as [[radio broadcasting]] and the [[mass market]] availability of [[gramophone record]]s meant that [[sound recording]]s of songs and pieces heard by listeners (either on the radio or on their record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music, because whereas in the 19th century, the focus on sheet music restricted access to new music to the middle class and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments, in the 20th century, anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[big band]]s right in their own living room. This allowed lower-income people, who would never be able to afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. It also meant that people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.

The focus of [[art music]] in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of [[World War I]] influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. [[Traditional music]] styles such as [[jazz]] and [[folk music]] were used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the [[multitrack recording]] system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.

[[Jazz]] evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century, rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of [[Music of Africa|African]] and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of [[blue note]]s, [[improvisation]], [[polyrhythm]]s, [[syncopation]], and the [[swung note]].&lt;ref&gt;Alyn Shipton, ''A New History of Jazz'', 2nd. ed., Continuum, 2007, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock music is a genre of [[popular music]] that developed in the 1960s from 1950s [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], and [[country music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19838/m1/ |title=Show 55 – Crammer: A lively cram course on the history of rock and some other things |show=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong [[Backbeat (music)|back beat]] laid down by a [[rhythm section]] of electric bass guitar, drums, and keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, [[analog synthesizer]]s and digital ones and computers since the 1990s. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its "purest form," it "has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody."

Performance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or when a piano piece, electric guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other [[Part (music)|musical part]] is played by musicians. In classical music, a musical work is written in [[music notation]] by a composer and then it is performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a [[cover song]], they can make changes to it such as adding a [[guitar solo]] to or inserting an introduction.

A performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)—which is the norm in classical music, with jazz [[big band]]s and many popular music styles–or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] over a [[chord progression]] (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small [[jazz]] and [[blues]] groups. Rehearsals of orchestras, [[concert band]]s and [[choir]]s are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung and/or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Improvisation is the creation of a musical idea–a melody or other musical line–created on the spot, often based on scales or pre-existing melodic [[riff]]s.

Many cultures have strong traditions of solo performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in [[Bali]], include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organised performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical music festivals or [[music competition]]s. [[Chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works.

===Oral and aural tradition===
Many types of music, such as traditional [[blues]] and [[folk music]] were not written down in [[sheet music]]; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down [[oral history|orally]], from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song "[[Playing by ear (music)|by ear]]". When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as "traditional" or as a "folk song". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song.

===Ornamentation===
{{Main|Ornament (music)}}
[[File:Trill example ornaments.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|In a score or on a performer's music part, this sign indicates that the musician should perform a [[trill (music)|trill]]—a rapid alternation between two notes. {{audio|Trill example ornaments.mid|Play}}]]
In music, an "ornament" is a decoration to a melody, bassline or other musical part. The detail included explicitly in the [[Musical notation|music notation]] varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th centuries required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th centuries, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody. However, performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments to add interest to the music, such as [[Trill (music)|trills]] and [[Turn (music)#Turn|turns]].

In the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, [[accent (music)|accentuation]], and [[Rest (music)|pauses]] (among other devices) to obtain this "expressive" performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece.

==Philosophy and aesthetics==
{{Main|Philosophy of music|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Boldini, Woman in Red.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A painting by Boldini of a woman playing the piano]]
Philosophy of music is a subfield of philosophy. The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]].
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:
* What is the [[definition of music]]? (What are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions?
* What is meaning in relation to music?

In ancient times, such as with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether music can express meaning. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a scale called [[just intonation]].

It is often thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in ''the Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state. (Book VII)

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

==Psychology==
{{Main|Music psychology}}
Modern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical [[behavior]] and [[experience]].&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |page=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this field and its subfields are primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]]. In addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes, music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], skill, [[intelligence]], creativity, and [[social behavior]].

===Cognitive neuroscience of music===
{{Main|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
[[File:Brodmann 41 42.png|right|upright=1.15|thumb|The [[primary auditory cortex]] is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution.]]
Cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

===Cognitive musicology===
{{Main|Cognitive musicology}}
Cognitive musicology is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[computer model|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laske |first=Otto |title=Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-30632-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;Laske, O.

Cambridge: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. Biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs.&lt;ref&gt;Graci, C. (2009–2010) A brief tour of the learning sciences featuring a cognitive tool for investigating melodic phenomena. ''Journal of Educational Technology Systems'', 38(2), 181–211.&lt;/ref&gt; This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. By using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Hamman, M., 1999.

===Psychoacoustics===
{{Main|Psychoacoustics}}
{{Further|Hearing (sense)}}
Psychoacoustics is the scientific study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] responses associated with sound (including [[speech]] and music). It can be further categorized as a branch of [[psychophysics]].

===Evolutionary musicology===
{{Main|Evolutionary musicology}}

Evolutionary musicology concerns the "origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution", and "music evolution and human evolution".&lt;ref name="Brown, Merker, Wallin"&gt;Wallin, Nils L./Björn Merker/Steven Brown (1999): "An Introduction to Evolutionary Musicology."

===Culture in music cognition===
{{Main|Culture in music cognition}}
{{See also|Ethnomusicology}}

An individual's culture or [[ethnicity]] plays a role in their [[music cognition]], including their [[Psychology of music preference|preferences]], [[Music and emotion|emotional reaction]], and [[music-related memory|musical memory]]. Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults' classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features.&lt;ref name="Soley 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soley |first=G. |last2=Hannon |first2=E.

Many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory, community-based activity.&lt;ref&gt;Grazian, David. "The Symbolic Economy of Authenticity in the Chicago Blues Scene." in Music Scenes: Local, Translocal, and Virtual. ed. Bennett, Andy and Richard A. Peterson. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 2004. pp. 31–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Elizabeth Ball (2010). [https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&amp;context=open_access_etds Portland's Independent Music Scene: Formation of Community Identities and Alternative Urban Cultural Landscapes], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert, forming a [[music community]], which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a "[[high culture]]" and "[[low culture]]." "High culture" types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.

Other types of music—including, but not limited to, jazz, blues, [[soul music|soul]], and [[country music|country]]—are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between "high" and "low" musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced "art music" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between "high" and "low" musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the [[socioeconomic]]s standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-"art" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, [[Punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], or [[ska]] may be very complex and sophisticated.

When composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, [[serialism]], [[bebop]]-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and [[electronica]] have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Such themes are examined in the sociology of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called [[sociomusicology]], is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of [[ethnomusicology]].

===Role of women===
{{Main|Women in music}}
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|right|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]].]]
Women have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], singers, conductors, [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements, events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.

Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol. 4, no. 1 (2014) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s pop-music scene, "[l]ike most aspects of the...music business, [in the 1960s,] songwriting was a male-dominated field. Though there were plenty of female singers on the radio, women ...were primarily seen as consumers:... Singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument, writing songs, or producing records simply wasn't done."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Erika White |url=http://www.rebeatmag.com/music-history-primer-3-pioneering-female-songwriters-of-the-60s/ |title=Music History Primer: 3 Pioneering Female Songwriters of the '60s &amp;#124; REBEAT Magazine |publisher=Rebeatmag.com |date=2015-01-28 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young women "...were not socialized to see themselves as people who create [music]."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"/&gt;

Women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, [[Music producer|music producing]], and [[sound engineering]]. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women [[musicology|musicologists]], women became involved in [[music education]] "...to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song |page= 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "...too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "...to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"&gt;http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |date=2016-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt;
According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jessica Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most recorded artists is [[Asha Bhosle]], an Indian singer best known as a playback singer in Hindi cinema.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Media and technology==
{{Further|Computer music|Music technology}}

[[File:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Music production in the 2000s using a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with an electronic keyboard and a [[multi-monitor]] set-up.]]
The music that composers make can be heard through several media; the most traditional way is to hear it live, in the presence of the musicians (or as one of the musicians), in an outdoor or indoor space such as an amphitheatre, [[concert hall]], [[cabaret]] room or [[theatre music|theatre]]. Since the 20th century, live music can also be broadcast over the radio, television or the Internet, or [[sound recording|recorded]] and listened to on a [[CD player]] or Mp3 player. Some musical styles focus on producing a sound for a performance, while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played "live." Recording, even of essentially live styles such as rock, often uses the ability to edit and splice to produce recordings that may be considered "better" than the actual performance.

[[Music technology|Technology]] has had an influence on music since prehistoric times, when cave people used simple tools to bore holes into bone flutes 41,000 years ago. Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the [[printing press]] in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder piano and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. In the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as [[sound film|talking pictures]] emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |title=American Federation of Musicians/History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405035855/http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |archivedate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and [[theater organ]]ists were common at first-run theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard (1985), p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled "Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever"&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/ "Canned Music on Trial"] part of [[Duke University]]'s ''Ad*Access'' project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992 in the United States, and the 1979 revised [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in the United Kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and Internet in a form that is commonly known as [[Music-On-Demand]].

In many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often communal. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] or watching a music video, became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century.

Sometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a disc jockey uses [[gramophone record|disc records]] for [[scratching]], and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. Computers and many [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] can be programmed to produce and play [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) music. Audiences can also ''become'' performers by participating in [[karaoke]], an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.

===Internet===

The advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via [[streaming video]] and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], in his book ''[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]]'', suggests that while the traditional economic model of [[supply and demand]] describes scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. [[Data storage device|Digital storage]] costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole recording inventory available online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become economically viable to offer music recordings that very few people are interested in. Consumers' growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of thousands of [[niche market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (2006). The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. Hyperion. {{ISBN|1-4013-0237-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of the Internet arose with [[Virtual community|online communities]] and [[social media]] websites like YouTube and Facebook, a [[social networking service]]. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], in their book ''[[Wikinomics]]'', there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a "[[prosumer]]" role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of [[mashup (music)|mashes]], [[remix]]es, and music videos by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tapscott |first=Don |authorlink=Don Tapscott |author2=Williams, Anthony D. |authorlink2=Anthony D.

==Business==

{{Main|Music industry}}

The music industry refers to the businesses connected with the creation and sale of music. It consists of songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces, music producers and [[sound engineer]]s who record songs and pieces, record labels and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishers]] that distribute recorded music products and [[sheet music]] internationally and that often control the rights to those products. Some music labels are "[[independent record label|independent]]," while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international [[media conglomerate|media groups]]. In the 2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on MP3 players, iPods, or computers, and of trading music on [[file sharing]] websites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business. Many smaller independent [[CD store]]s went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of CDs, and many labels had lower CD sales. Some companies did well with the change to a digital format, though, such as Apple's [[iTunes]], an [[online music store]] that sells digital files of songs over the Internet.

===Intellectual property laws===
{{Main||Royalty_payment#Music_royalties}}
In spite of some [[international copyright treaties]], determining which music is in the [[public domain]] is complicated by [[:Category:copyright law by country|the variety]] of national [[copyright law]]s that may be applicable.  [[US copyright law]] formerly protected printed music published after 1923 for 28 years and with renewal for another 28 years, but the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made renewal automatic, and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] changed the calculation of the copyright term to 70 years after the death of the creator. Recorded sound falls under [[mechanical licensing]], often covered by a confusing patchwork of state laws; most [[cover version]]s are licensed through the [[Harry Fox Agency]]. [[Performance rights]] may be obtained by either performers or the performance venue; the two major organizations for licensing are [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]. Two online sources for [[public domain music]] are [[International Music Score Library Project|IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project)]] and [[Choral Public Domain Library|Choral Public Domain Library (CPDL)]].

==Education==

===Non-professional===
{{Main|Music education}}
[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] violin recital with students of varying ages]]
The incorporation of some music or singing training into general education from [[Preschool education|preschool]] to [[Higher education|post secondary education]] is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, [[counting]], listening, and cooperation while also promoting understanding of [[language]], improving the ability to [[memory|recall]] information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Woodall and Ziembroski, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing [[hymn]]s and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as [[choir]]s (a group of singers), [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s, jazz bands, or orchestras. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private [[music lesson]]s after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about [[musical notation]] for [[musical scale]]s and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.

At the university level, students in most arts and [[humanities]] programs can receive [[Credit (education)|credit]] for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the [[history of music]], or a [[music appreciation]] course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta|Indonesian Institute of the Arts]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the [[music of Africa]] or Bali (e.g. [[Gamelan]] music).

===Professional training===

His bass has a low C extension with a metal "machine" with buttons for playing the pitches on the extension.]]
Individuals aiming to become professional musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, music teachers and practitioners of other music-related professions such as [[music history]] professors, [[sound engineer]]s, and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by colleges, universities and [[music conservatory|music conservatories]].  Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions, as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities, which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments), music history, music theory, music composition, [[music education]] (for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and, in some cases, conducting. On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., [[sound recording]]).

While most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music, there are a number of universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as [[jazz]] or [[popular music]] musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]]. Two important schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are [[McGill University]] and [[Humber College]]. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as [[heavy metal music]], [[country music]] or [[blues]] are less likely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas in colleges or universities. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing and/or playing in many bands (often beginning in amateur bands, [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s), studying recordings available on CD, DVD and the Internet and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal [[mentoring]] or regular [[music lesson]]s. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube "how-to" videos have enabled many singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with [[vocal coach]]es and [[singing teacher]]s.

====Undergraduate====
[[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate]] [[academic degree|university degrees]] in music, including the [[Bachelor of Music]], the Bachelor of Music Education, and the Bachelor of Arts (with a major in music) typically take about four years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can seek employment or go on to further study in music graduate programs. Bachelor's degree graduates are also eligible to apply to some graduate programs and [[professional school]]s outside of music (e.g., [[public administration]], [[business administration]], [[library science]], and, in some jurisdictions, [[teachers college|teacher's college]], [[law school]] or [[medical school]]).

====Graduate====
Graduate music degrees include the [[Master of Music]], the Master of Arts (in musicology, music theory or another music field), the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice (singing) or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a [[Dissertation|thesis]], is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, music theory or ethnomusicology.

The PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the [[Quadrivium]] of the seven [[liberal arts|Liberal Arts]] and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative Quadrivium, music, or more accurately [[harmonic]]s, was the study of rational proportions.

====Musicology====
[[Musicology]], the academic study of the subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: [[systematic musicology]], [[Music history|historical musicology]], and comparative musicology or [[ethnomusicology]]. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into [[music theory]], [[music history]], and [[ethnomusicology]]. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of [[psychoacoustics]]. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, [[music history]], and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD degrees.

====Music theory====
[[Music theory]] is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[anthropology]]. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the [[common practice period]], or [[Tonality|tonal music]]. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take many other forms. [[Set theory (music)|Musical set theory]] is the application of mathematical [[set theory]] to music, first applied to [[Atonality|atonal music]]. ''Speculative music theory'', contrasted with ''analytic music theory'', is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example [[musical tuning|tuning systems]], generally as preparation for composition.

====Zoomusicology====
[[Zoomusicology]] is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, "do animals have music?" [[François-Bernard Mâche]]'s ''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion'' (1983), a study of "ornitho-musicology" using a technique of [[Nicolas Ruwet]]'s ''Langage&lt;!--Langage=parlance or mode of speech--&gt;, musique, poésie'' (1972) [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic segmentation analysis]], shows that [[Bird vocalization|bird songs]] are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that "in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human."

====Ethnomusicology====
{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}
[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ethnomusicologist [[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief for the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] (1916)]]
In the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, which is known as classical music. The history of music in non-Western cultures ("[[world music]]" or the field of "ethnomusicology"), which typically covers music from
Africa and Asia is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different [[musical instrument|instruments]], techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for propaganda purposes, as was the case with [[Chinese opera]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

There is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the [[definition of music]]. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or "art" music), and popular music (or [[Contemporary commercial music|commercial music]] – including non-Western styles of rock, [[country music|country]], and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these "big two" classifications, (such as [[folk music]], [[world music]], or [[jazz]]-related music).

As world cultures have come into [[Globalization|greater global contact]], their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style contains elements from [[Folk Music of England|Anglo]]-[[Music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], Irish, [[Music of Germany|German]] and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic "[[melting pot]]" society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' are claimed by both opera and the [[Broadway musical]] tradition. Many current music festivals for non-Western music include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.

[[Music of India|Indian music]], for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]], [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]], and [[Dhrupad]] styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in [[South India]].

==Music therapy==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|right|A music therapist from a "Blues in the Schools" program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]
[[Music therapy]] is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, [[Exercise and music|support physical exercise]], and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.

One of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in [[Al-Farabi]]'s (c. 872–950) treatise ''Meanings of the Intellect'', which described the therapeutic effects of music on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haque |first1=Amber |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |url= |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [363] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' argued that music and dance were critical in treating [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], especially [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3,480, "Music a Remedy"&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that music has an "excellent power ...to expel many other diseases" and he called it "a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy." He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to "make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout."&lt;ref&gt;Ismenias the Theban, Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now thy do those, saith Bodine, that are
troubled with St. Vitus's Bedlam dance.

[[Albert Einstein]] had a lifelong love of music (particularly the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/einstein&amp;music.pdf |title=Einstein and his love of music |last=Foster |first=Brian |magazine=Physics World |date=2005 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; once stating that life without playing music would be inconceivable to him. In some interviews Einstein even attributed much of his scientific intuition to music, with his son Hans recounting that "whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or into a difficult situation in his work, he would take refuge in music, and that would usually resolve all his difficulties." Something in the music, according to Michele and Robert Root-Bernstein in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', "would guide his thoughts in new and creative directions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/imagine/201003/einstein-creative-thinking-music-and-the-intuitive-art-scientific-imagination |title=Einstein On Creative Thinking: Music and the Intuitive Art of Scientific Imagination|author1-last=Root-Bernstein|author1-first=Michele|author2-last=Root-Bernstein|author2-first=Robert |magazine=Psychology Today |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Einstein considered Mozart's music to reveal a universal harmony that Einstein believed existed in the universe, "as if the great Wolfgang Amadeus did not 'create' his beautifully clear music at all, but simply discovered it already made. This perspective parallels, remarkably, Einstein’s views on the ultimate simplicity of nature and its explanation and statement via essentially simple mathematical expressions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/06/the_musical_mind_of_albert_einstein.html |title=The Musical Mind of Albert Einstein: Great Physicist, Amateur Violinist and Devotee of Mozart |website=Open Culture |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review suggests that music may be effective for improving subjective sleep quality in adults with insomnia symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jesperson |first=Kira |date=13 August 2015 |title=Music for insomnia in adults |journal=The Cochrane Library |volume= |issue=8 |pages= CD010459|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010459.pub2 |pmid=26270746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Music is also being used in clinical rehabilitation of cognitive and motor disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322792.php|title=Why does bass make you want to dance?|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Student from UNY reading short story by Evi Idawati 2015-06-08 06.jpg|thumb|A student of [[Yogyakarta State University]] performing a dramatic reading of a short story]]
'''Oral Interpretation''' is a dramatic art, also commonly called "interpretive reading" and "dramatic reading", though these terms are more conservative and restrictive.  In certain applications, oral interpretation is also a theatre art – as in reader's theatre, in which a work of literature is performed with manuscripts in hand or, more traditionally, using stools and music stands; and especially chamber theatre, which dispenses with manuscripts and uses what may be described as essentialist costuming and stage lighting, and suggestive scenery.

The term is succinctly defined by [[Paul Campbel]]l (''The Speaking and Speakers of Literature''; Dickinson, 1967) as the "oralization of literature"; or more eloquently, if less intelligibly, by Charlotte Lee and Timothy Gura (''Oral Interpretation''; Houghton-Mifflin, 1997) as "the art of communicating to an audience a work of literary art in its intellectual, emotional, and aesthetic entirety".  Historically essential to Charlotte Lee's definition of oral interpretation is the fact the performer is "reading from a manuscript".  This perspective, once the majority view, has long since become the minority opinion on the question; so that whether one is or is not reading from a manuscript, the art retains the same name.

Voice and movement technique is ''opsis'' ("spectacle") while oral interpretation is, conceptually, ''melopoiia'' ("music technique").

Because oral interpretation is an essential dramatic element in all performance art (even dance, in which the oral element is most typically a silent element), all actors, singers, storytellers, etc., are ''interpreters'' – but not all interpreters are necessarily actors, or singers, or storytellers, and so on.  When, for example, the writer [[David Sedaris]] reads one of his stories on stage, or when [[Leonard Cohen]] performs one of his lyric poems, they are both engaged in the art of oral interpretation.  But Sedaris is no actor, and even Cohen himself would say that ''he'' is no singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohencentric.com/2015/06/22/rarely-viewed-video-leonard-cohen-on-his-atrocious-voice-dylan-lead-belly-ice-t-songwriting-love-wheres-the-beef/|title=1992 Video: Leonard Cohen On His Atrocious Voice, Dylan, Ice-T, Songwriting, Love &amp; Where's The Beef|date=22 June 2015|work=cohencentric.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there is a historic and purely academic argument as to whether oral interpretation and drama/theatre performance are different names for the same thing or whether they are completely different art forms.  This argument is almost exclusively found at colleges and universities whose theatre programs evolved in departments historically or currently called "English and Speech", "Speech and Dramatic Arts" or "Communication and Theatre Arts".  The argument is rarely heard in theatre programs that did not evolve out of English and/or Speech Communication departments, such as those associated with schools/colleges of music.

In high schools across the United States, Oral Interpretation is a very highly valued competition event, particularly in the mid-western states, such as Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota.  Students select a work of literature, make a cutting of the literature to fit a time limit of 10 minutes, and perform it in several rounds at tournaments across their state. The piece must be from a published, worthwhile piece of literature, with the exception of Readers Theatre. The categories of said event are as follows:
* Serious Prose—Interpretation of a work of prose literature with a serious basis. Single-person event.
* Humorous Interp—Interpretation of any published work of comedic literature. Single-person event
* Dramatic Interp—Interpretation of a dramatic play with a serious nature. Single-person event.
* Poetry—Interpretation of a published work of poetry. Single-person event.
* Non-Original Oratory—Interpretation of an oratorical speech that has been previously delivered. Single-person event.
* Duo Interpretation—Interpretation of a piece of literature where two Interpers are involved. The pair may not look at nor touch each other, and must deliver the piece in the direction of the audience. This category has the most stringent rules.
* Readers Theatre—A theatrical interpretation performance where 3-6 people participate. They may perform an original piece, or they may take a cutting from a work of literature. This category has the least amount of rules.

Prestige pictures are largely the province of major [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film studios—such as [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Warner Bros.]]—that produce numerous films every year.

As a [[Philosophy of education|teaching methodology]], process drama developed primarily from the work of [[Brian Way]], [[Dorothy Heathcote]] and [[Gavin Bolton]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1979) ''Towards a theory of drama in education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1984) ''Drama as education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1992) ''New Perspectives on Classroom Drama''. Nelson Thornes Ltd., London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. and Dorothy Heathcote (1995) ''Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education (Dimensions of Drama Series)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt; and through the work of other leading [[drama]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Norah and Juliana Saxton (1987) ''Teaching Drama: A Mind of Many Wonders.'' Trans-Atlantic Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neelands, Jonothan and Tony Goode (2000) ''Structuring Drama Work: A handbook of available forms in theatre and drama''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Cecily (1995) ''Drama Worlds: A Framework for Process Drama (The Dimensions of Drama)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, John (1992) ''The Process of Drama: Negotiating Art and Meaning.'' Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrice Baldwin|Baldwin, Patrice]] (1991) ''Stimulating drama: Cross curricular approaches to drama in the primary school.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecily O'Neill]] describes process drama being used to explore a problem, situation, theme or series of related ideas or themes through the use of the artistic medium of unscripted drama. Process drama was described by O'Mara (1999) as" a dynamic way of working that requires teachers to reflect-in-action",&lt;ref&gt;O'Mara, Joanne. 1999. Unravelling the Mystery: A Study of Reflection-in-Action in Process Drama Teaching.Thesis (PhD Doctorate), Griffith University, Brisbane. Accessible at: https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/items/427f6837-6772-8177-ddc0-5a341ddb544d/1/ &lt;/ref&gt; constantly dealing with unique situations that require novel approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Schön, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in dramatic play, where normally developing children in every [[culture]] in the world will create their own imagined worlds, often with the co-participation of an [[empathy|empathetic]] adult (usually the parent) in role.

Process drama in school settings usually involves the whole class working with the teacher in role in a made-up [[scenario]].  When they are working in process drama, the students and teachers work together to create an imaginary dramatic world within which issues are considered and problems can be solved. In this world they work together to explore problems and issues such as, "How do communities deal with change?", "How do we accept other people into our community?" or themes such as environmental [[sustainability]], betrayal, truth and other [[ethical]] and moral issues. Sometimes the work may begin as light-hearted, but the teacher always layers more dramatic tension and complexity into the work as the teacher is aiming for a [[pedagogical]] outcome. Students learn to think beyond their own points of view and consider multiple perspectives on a topic through playing different roles. For instance, if the issue being discussed is logging a forest, they may play the [[Lumberjack|loggers]], people who live in the forest community and [[environmentalist]]s. Playing a range of positions encourages them to be able to recast themselves as the "other" and to consider life from that viewpoint, thereby creating complexity and enabling us to explore multiple dimensions of the topic.  Process drama does what the character [[Atticus Finch]] advocates: the ability to work for [[social justice]] comes from the ability to understand another perspective—to be able to try on someone else's shoes and walk around in them for a while. Process drama allows us to "try on" other people's shoes, to walk the paths they tread and to see how the world looks from their point of view.

Process drama is also suggested as a tool to promote literacy development through opportunities for dramatic play in early childhood settings within which children speak for a range of purposes in role.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ping-Yun.

An '''entertainment promoter''' works in entertainment industries, including music and sports, as an individual or organization in the business of [[Promotion (marketing)|marketing and promoting]] live, or [[pay-per-view]] and similar, events, such as [[concert]]s/[[gig (musical performance)|gigs]], [[sports]] events, [[festival]]s, [[rave]]s, and [[nightclub]] performances.

== Description ==

=== Business model ===
Promoters are typically engaged as [[independent contractor]]s or representative companies by entertainment venues, earning a pre-arranged fee, or a share of revenues (colloquially known as a "cut" and "share of the house"), or both. A share of revenues is often a simple percentage of admission fees (called "the door") and/or food and drink sales, with many variations possible, such as minimums or maximums, allowances for various expenses, or limitations (such as only alcohol sales after midnight). Other promoters operate independently, renting venues for a fixed fee, or under a [[revenue sharing]] arrangement with the venue holder, thus keeping larger profits from successful events. One common arrangement for small venues is for the promoter to earn all of the admissions fees, while the venue retains all food and drink revenue.

Some venues have exclusive arrangements with a single promotion company, others work with multiple promoters on a rotating schedule (one night per week, for example), or on an event-by-event basis. Promoters often work together — either as equal partners, or as [[subcontractor]]s to each other's events. Several promoters may work together for a special event, such as a large [[New Year's Eve]] party in a hotel ballroom. They may also engage [[freelance]] hosts for their social influence; these amateur promoters market the events to their circle of friends and/or [[social media]] followers, in exchange for special treatment and/or free admission to the event and at times, and may form or be included in [[street team]]s that promote events at other live venues.

Minimally, an event promoter manages [[publicity]] and [[advertising]]. Depending on the arrangement, they may also handle [[security]], [[Ticket (admission)|ticket sales]], event admission (door policies), decorations, and booking of other entertainers. Many promoters are [[DJ]]s or [[musician]]s themselves, and may perform at their own events. Some bloggers and individuals with a large following on social media may consider themselves as promoters and charge fees promotional service via their social media platform(s), or through their efforts. 

Many musicians and artists act as de facto promoters for their own concerts, either directly or through their manager or [[Talent agent|booking company]]. Historically, promotion has been a [[cottage industry]], with companies operated by one or several well-connected charismatic individuals, often working part-time.  However, with the rise of corporate ownership of live entertainment assets, several large companies have emerged in the field.

=== Contracts and disputes ===
There are often disputes over money in the promotions industry because it is largely cash business with a history of corruption and uneven [[recordkeeping]].  In addition there are many [[accounting]] complexities to manage, particularly for large events: revenue, expenses, and  oversight of [[parking]], [[Cloakroom|coat checks]], [[Concession (contract)|concession]] vendor sales (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[compact disc|CDs]] and [[t-shirt]]s), [[box office]] so-called "[[convenience fee]]s", [[in kind]] trades, promotional give-away items used to lure guests (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;free drinks), costs for [[insurance]], [[janitor|cleaning]] staff, and so on. One area of frequent contention are [[quid pro quo]] [[cross-promotion]]s, where the promoter or some other party connected with the venue will obtain a favor (for example, a price discount) in exchange for giving a future favor to the vendor. If the existence of the scheme, or the relationship between the parties, is undisclosed this may become a form of [[bribery]].  Another opportunity for misunderstanding are the various "lists" of guests who will be admitted for free or with VIP treatment, and the "door policy" used by bouncers to decide who will be admitted and at what price. To deal with these complexities event contracts can become quite long and detailed.  Whether written or not, these arrangements tend to favor the party with the greater sophistication or the more control over the production of the event. Even the most detailed, professionally written and negotiated contracts can become the subject of lawsuits over interpretation.

Because nightclubs are often associated with drug and alcohol consumption, rowdiness, and other late-night behavior, promoters may become entangled in various criminal disputes as well.

=== Methods ===
Promoters bring crowds through a variety of methods.  The most direct are [[guerrilla marketing]] techniques such as plastering [[posters]] on outdoor walls, [[flyposting]], and distributing [[handbills]] on windows of cars parked in entertainment districts. Promoters also keep mailing lists, usually [[email list]]s, of their preferred guests and their wider list of potential customers. Recently, many promoters have taken advantage of online technology such as [[online social network]]s and event listing sites to handle publicity, invitations, mailing lists, and so on. Clubs and promoters are among leaders in [[SMS]] text message advertising to their own lists as well as sponsored snippets on third-party lists for daily content to subscribers. Many fans promote events,products through their Facebook/Twitter/Myspace on their own free will.

Promoters often build a [[brand]] out of their own personalities and the parties they host, marketing the events under a consistent name, style, type of program, and social experience that downplays the branding of the venue or artist.  They may develop a loyal clientele that will follow them from one location to another.

=== Image promotion and VIP hosting ===

In cosmopolitan cities with large affluent populations, there are upscale venues that employ the services of a special kind of promoter called an image promoter.  The role of the image promoter is to bring celebrities or fashion models to high end venues and host them at a VIP table.  In order to entice models and celebrities to come to the venue, the image promoter is provided with a VIP table and complementary alcohol.  High end venues use the presence of models and celebrities to market their venue to an affluent clientele which may often only obtain admittance to the venue through agreeing to spend a certain amount of money on alcohol at the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycnightadventures.com/20/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130082532/http://www.nycnightadventures.com/20/ |archivedate=2013-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., trivia nights are sometimes used as fundraisers for nonprofit organizations, and these are very common in the [[Greater St. Louis]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/st-louis-non-profits-turn-to-trivia-fundraisers/63-523843338 St. Louis non-profits turn to trivia fundraisers]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
The pub quiz was established in the UK in the 1970s, mainly by a company called [[ Burns and Porter]], to get people in to pubs on quieter nights. Popularity grew and grew over the next few years from just 30 teams to 10,000 playing each week in a Burns and Porter quiz. &lt;ref name="Pub challenge"/&gt; Redtooth runs an annual Great British Pub Quiz challenge, with more than 600 pubs taking part in 2012.&lt;ref name="Pub challenge"/&gt;

A 2009 study put the number of regular weekly pub quizzes in the UK at 22,445,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpquiz.co.uk/special-features/399-pub-quiz-statistics.html |title=Pub quiz Statistics |publisher=dpquiz.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one website has counted approximately 2,000 regular weekly quizzes in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triviareviews.com |title=TriviaReviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May 2017 the first ever online pub quiz took place, run by Primordial Radio in the United Kingdom. It used existing technologies of a [[YouTube]] live stream and the answer sheet by survey monkey.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

== Format ==
Pub quizzes (also known as live trivia, or table quizzes) are often weekly events and will have an advertised start time, most often in the evening.

While specific formats vary, most pub quizzes depend on answers being written in response to questions which may themselves be written or announced by a quizmaster.

One format for quizzing is called "[[infinite bounce]]". This format is generally used when the number of teams in the quiz is large – usually around 8–10. Every question is addressed to the team succeeding the team that answered the previous question. If no team answers the question, the next question is addressed to the team succeeding the team to whom the previous question was addressed.

Generally someone (either one of the bar staff or the person running the quiz) will come around with pens and quiz papers, which may contain questions or may just be blank sheets for writing the answers on.  A mixture of both is common, in which case often only the blank sheet is to be handed in.  Traditionally a member of the team hands the answers in for adjudication to the quiz master or to the next team along for marking when the answers are called.

=== Teams ===
It is up to the quizzers to form teams, which are generally based on tables, though if one table has a large group around it they may decide to split up. Some pubs insist on a maximum team size (usually between six and ten).  The team members decide on a team name, often a supposedly humorous phrase or pun, which must be written on all papers handed in.

People often have to pay to participate – ranging from around 50p to £5 per person. This is often pooled to provide prize money. Many pub quizzes require no payment at all, as the event is simply a way to get paying customers into the venue, typically on less busy nights of the week.

=== Questions ===
The person asking the questions is known as the quizmaster. Quizmasters also mark and score answers submitted by teams, although formats exist where teams will mark each other's answer sheets.

The questions may be set by the bar staff or landlord, taken from a quiz book, bought from a specialist trivia company, or be set by volunteers from amongst the contestants. In the latter case, the quiz setter may be remunerated with drinks or a small amount of money.

Often questions may be drawn from the realm of 'everybody knows' trivia, therefore leading to controversies when the answers are false or unverifiable. In addition, as the quizzes are not formal affairs, slight errors in wording may lead to confusion and have led to a 2005 court case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winterman |first=Denise |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4168275.stm |title=Not just a trivia matter |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-01-13 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK.

=== Rounds ===
There may be between one and more than half a dozen rounds of questions, totalling anything from 10 to upwards of 80 questions. Rounds may include the following kinds (most common first):

* Factual rounds – these are usually spoken, either over a [[public address]] system or just called out.  Common topics include:
** General knowledge – covering the topics listed below (if they are not in a separate round) and also topics such as history, [[geography]] and [[science]] and [[nature]]. There may well be more than one of these rounds.
** [[Sport]] – comprising the statistics and minutiae of popular, well-known sports and general facts about others.
** [[Entertainment]] – [[film|movies]], [[television|TV]] shows and music (see also below).
** True or False – questions to which the answer is True or False.
* Picture round – these use [[photocopy|photocopied]] or computer-printed hand-outs and consist of pictures to be identified, such as photos of famous people (possibly snapped out of context, or else partially obscured) or logos of companies (without tell-tale lettering), famous places or objects pictured from a strange angle.
* Who Am I? – A series of clues to the identity of a famous person (or thing). Clues are given in order of descending difficulty. The earlier a team can identify the correct answer, the more points they are awarded.
* [[Music]] round – these consist of excerpts (often only the [[introduction (music)|intro]] or other non-vocal segment) of songs played over the PA system. Usually the teams must identify the song and also the singer or band (sometimes the year the song was released is also required). Variations include the inclusion of film [[soundtrack]]s and TV theme tunes (requiring the title), and/or [[classical music]] (also requiring the composer). Some venues cannot play a music round because they do not have the proper licensing from performers rights organizations such as Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI), the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), Society of European Stage Authors and Composers (SESAC) and Global Music Rights (GMR)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.restaurant.org/Manage-My-Restaurant/Operations/Regulatory-back-office/11-questions-about-music-licensing&lt;/ref&gt;.  
* Audio round - similar to music rounds, but sound clips are played from movies, television shows, [[YouTube]] videos, etc. 
* [[Puzzle]] rounds – generally on a hand-out sheet. These may consist of [[crossword puzzle]]s, [[anagram]]s, [[Ditloid]]s, [[Rebus|Dingbats]] and basic [[mathematics]] problems.
* Novelty rounds – themed round a specific word or name (e.g. all the questions relate to a famous Norman); 'connections', where the last answer in the round provides a link to all the previous answers; true or false; and various others to break up the general stream of questions.

=== Bonus rounds ===
In some quizzes teams are able to select one or two rounds as "jokers", in which their points will be doubled (or otherwise multiplied). Teams  usually select their joker rounds before the start of the quiz, although some rounds may be excluded. Teams who consider themselves to be particularly strong on certain subjects can improve their chances with a good joker round, but risk wasting the joker if the questions are unexpectedly difficult. The idea of using a joker in a game may come from the BBC television programme ''[[It's a Knockout]]''.

Some quizzes include a bonus question, in which a single answer is required with one or more clues given each round making the answer progressively easier to solve. In some variants, the first team to hand in the correct answer wins either a spot prize or additional points to their total score. In others, the questions continue until all teams have the correct answer with each team been given progressively fewer  additional points the longer it takes them to submit the correct answer.

=== Jackpots ===
Some quizzes add a small, separate round of questions to the end of a regular quiz, with the chance to win a jackpot. Each week an amount of money is added to the jackpot, and if no team answers the questions correctly, the money rolls over to the next quiz. The maximum amount of the jackpot may be limited by local gaming regulations.

Cash jackpots may be won by a variety of methods including one-off questions and dance-offs.

=== Marking ===

In some cases, the papers are marked  by the bar staff.  Alternatively, teams may have to mark their own answers and the handed-in papers are consulted only to check that prize claimants have not cheated by altering their answers. Another method is to have teams swap papers before marking, though this can be divisive.

One or two points are scored for each correct answer; some quizzes allow half marks for "nearly right" answers (such as a celebrity's surname when their full name was required). In some quizzes, certain questions score higher marks, particularly if they are unusually difficult.

=== Cheating ===

With the mass use of [[mobile phone]]s and mobile internet access, cheating has become a problem for some pub quizzes, with covert calls and texts made in the toilets, recent newspapers and magazines brought along especially for the event, [[List_of_sports_idioms#R|ringers]] and so on. Though a maximum number of members set for teams may help to prevent large numbers of people collaborating, groups posing as several distinct teams are quite common. Some quizzes now ban the use of mobiles and nullify the score of any team found to be cheating. Though more prevalent where large sums of money are at stake, cheating can be observed even for relatively low stakes.

Some quizzes also now ban re-entry to the pub after the quiz has started, in order to prevent team members from using public internet stations, public telephones and mobile devices out of sight of the quizmaster. Generally, though, a pub runs its quiz alongside its normal operation, making such a measure impractical.

=== Prizes ===

Prizes are awarded to the highest scoring team, and often to runners-up. Prizes are usually one of the following:

* alcoholic drinks: a case of [[beer]] or some money on a bar tab to spend at that pub are common.
* cash: if money was charged for entry into the quiz, this is often pooled to form prize money. This may all go to the winning team. Alternatively, there may be a separate short set of questions or even a single 'jackpot' question to win the cash; if no team gets the right answer, the money is typically rolled over, making a larger prize the next week.
* vouchers: such as cinema discount-coupons, food discounts, or even drinks vouchers for use at the bar holding the quiz.
* drink-related promotional items from a [[brewery]], such as [[t-shirt]]s and [[pint glass|beer glass]]es advertising their products.
* miscellaneous or novelty prizes, such as chocolate or cheap toys. The winning team may get first choice to pick a prize from a range on offer.

== Technology ==
In a digital pub quiz wireless handsets replace the more usual pen and paper. A computer receives and records the answers from each team's handset and the results are exported to a spreadsheet at the end of the quiz. A time limit can be set for each question (e.g. 60 seconds) and it is possible to determine which team answers in the fastest time for spot prizes and tiebreaks.

== Commercial projects ==
As the pub quiz concept spread to the US in the 1990s, several companies formed to provide services to bars and restaurants organizing quizzes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stumptrivia.com/stump-trivia-news.html |title=Stump!

== Leagues and competitions ==

A [[quiz league]] is an organisation that runs quizzes, normally in pubs, though such competitions are distinct from the standard pub quiz as they will normally involve two teams and often include a number of individual questions. No prizes are normally awarded at such a league match, but prizes and kudos may go to the quiz team winning a league or a [[Wiktionary:Knockout|knockout]] competition. The National Trivia Association runs a nationwide contest involving various pub trivia games played around the US.

Teams from throughout a region, county, state or country meet annually for more prestigious competitions, with greater prizes. Representative teams may either be the best team from each pub, or a team selected from the best individuals.

Believe it or Not Quiz Events in New Zealand have held an annual Champion of Champions quiz in [[Auckland]] since 1999. Initially open to teams from pubs within the greater Auckland region, it is now open to teams from throughout New Zealand. In practice, travel costs prevent most teams from the lower [[North Island]] and the [[South Island]] participating, although [[Christchurch]], [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Wellington]] have all provided teams.

The Australasian Pub Quiz Championships takes place annually since 2018. Open to teams from pubs and clubs from across Australia and New Zealand, the 2018 Championships is simultaneously run in Sydney, Canberra and Wellington in late April.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

In the United States National Trivia Association presents "The Riddle", a finals event open to eligible teams who play the official NTA "Quizzo!" live trivia game. Approximately a thousand players attended the 2008 event in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

== World record ==
The largest pub quiz, according to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]'', was the "Quiz for Life", held at the Flanders Expo Halls in [[Ghent]], Belgium, on 11 December 2010 with 2,280 participants.

== In popular culture ==
*Pub quizzes have appeared in the [[British sitcoms]] ''[[Minder (TV series)]]'', ''[[Bottom (TV series)| Bottom]]'', ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]'', ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' and ''[[Early Doors]]'', amongst others. 
*A January 2013 episode of ''[[Anger Management (TV series)|Anger Management]]'' features [[Charlie Sheen]]'s character involved in a game of 'bar trivia,' by Brainstormer. 
*The New Zealand television drama ''[[Nothing Trivial]]'' centres around five characters who meet regularly at a pub quiz.
*The [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] game show ''Quiz Night'' with [[Stuart Hall (presenter)|Stuart Hall]] was based on this concept.  The set on which the show took place had a bar theme to it; contestants and the host even drank beer while doing the show.
*The Irish television drama ''[[Trivia]]'' from 2011-2012 focuses on the captain of a pub quiz team.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Story==
&lt;!--This is appliable for the first two seasons of the anime series, but starting from season 3 the story has changed--&gt;
In a strange magical world of Little Fairilu live the Fairilus: small magical fairies representing flowers, insects and other entities who all born from the Fairilu Seed. Each Fairilu is born with its own key, the Fairilu Key, that can open magical doors, casting magic spells. If the Fairilu finds the right door, it can finally mature into a full-fledged fairy. The doors also link to the human world. Fairilus must study and go to school to learn about the world in which they live, while meeting new friends.

===1st &amp; 2nd Series===
The anime series focuses on Lip, a newly-born Flower Fairilu, and her friends in Little Fairlu. The series follows Lip's overall life in Little Fairilu while making new friends and learning from everything around her, growing up day after day. It also tells about the Fairilu friends' adventures in the human world, where they can meet their human partners who support their dreams and are willing to help each other fulfill them.

===3rd Series===
The anime tells about a human girl called Arisu Hanazono, who by chance discovered a magical pendulum and book, summoning Fairilus. She is a girl with many worries, but by meeting the friendly Fairilus and traveling into their homeworld, Little Fairilu, she gets a chance to solve her problems and change herself.

{{Performing arts}}
'''Shadowgraphy''' or '''ombromanie''' is the art of performing a story or show using images made by hand shadows. It can be called "cinema in silhouette". Performers are titled as a shadowgraphist or shadowgrapher.

The art has declined since the late 19th century when electricity became available to homes because light bulbs and electric lamps do not give off good shadows and because cinema and television were becoming a new form of entertainment. Shadows are greatly defined by candlelight; therefore hand shadows were common in earlier centuries.

The modern art of hand shadows was made popular by the French entertainer [[Félicien Trewey]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quick-change-artistry.com/shadowgraphy.html Quick Change Artistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized the art by making silhouettes of famous personalities.

== Origin ==
Since shadows have existed since the existence of objects obstructing light, it is hard to say when the art was first used by humans for entertainment. It could have been practiced by ancient or later humans, but it probably originated in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Art of Hand Shadows by Albert Almoznino&lt;/ref&gt; The French entertainer Félicien Trewey was interested in the art of Chinese [[shadow puppet]]ry called Ombres Chinoises, which means "Chinese shadows". He popularized the art of hand shadows when he developed shadows of famous silhouettes. It then became popular in [[Europe]] in the 19th century.

== Prevalence ==
Although the art is popular amongst different kinds of entertainers it seems prominent amongst magicians, because it was popularized by a magician who inspired many other magicians.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.geniimagazine.com/wiki/index.php/Shadowgraphy Shadowgraphy - MagicPedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Félicien Trewey perfected the widely known elephant, bird, and cat hand shadows&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/4/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and created some of his own such as The Volunteer, [[Robinson Crusoe]], The Jockey, The Rope Dancer and more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/6/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Trewey joined with [[Alexander Herrmann]] who most likely learned it from him. David Tobias Bamberg most likely learned it from Alexander who then passed it down to his son [[Okito]] (Tobias Leendert Bamberg) who then passed it down to ''his'' son [[David (Fu Manchu) Bamberg|Fu Manchu]] (David Theodore Bamberg). Fu Manchu passed his skill to Marcelo Contento, one of his apprentices, who became famous worldwide for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MUM Magazine, March 2000|last=|first=|publisher=Society of American Magicians|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=26|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contento died before he could pass it on to his son.

Other magicians who used hand shadows in their act include [[David Devant]], [[Edward Victor]], and the duo [[Max Holden (magic)|Holden and Graham]] in which Holden was famous for his "Monkey in the Belfry" shadow.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"/&gt;

== Tools ==

=== Hands ===
[[File:Gale's Guernsey shadowgraphy.jpg|thumb|right|An 1889 advertisement with examples of hand shadows]]
The hands and fingers are exercised and different finger positions are practiced to help aid in forming shadows.

=== Light source ===
The light source to be used should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light proceeding from the smallest possible point.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, ''Modern Conjuring For Amateurs'', that the best source of light is the [[electric arc]], which Almoznino agrees to the small [[arc lamp]], and the second best being the [[limelight]] (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists is the use of [[acetylene gas]] (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or [[carbide lamp]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.

=== Blank surface ===
Albert Almoznino suggests to use a white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of [[muslin]] or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a [[rear projection screen]], but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Performance ==
The performer sits or stands between the light source and the blank surface, while having the option to perform in front of the performance surface or behind it, with each having different advantages. The performer has another option to perform from the left or the right of the light source. The farther the hands are from the light, the smaller the shadows will be, while the closer the hands are to the light, the larger the shadows will be. Also, the closer the hands are to the blank surface, the sharper the shadows will be. Trewey suggests that the most convenient distance for the light from the hands is four feet while the hands from the performance surface should be about six feet. The performer should always watch their shadows instead of their hands.

Movement helps give the shadows character and brings them to life. Some shadows are performed with accessories attached to the hands or fingers to achieve movements or images not applicable to hands alone.

==Series overview==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===Super Sentai Series===
In every Super Sentai Series, the protagonists are a team of people who – using wrist-worn or hand-held devices – transform into superheroes and gain superpowers – color-coded uniforms, [[signature weapon]]s, sidearms, and fighting skills – to battle a group of evil beings that threaten to take over the Earth. In a typical episode, the heroes thwart the enemies' plans and defeat an army of enemy soldiers and the [[Villain of the week|monster of the week]] before an enlarged version of the monster confronts them, only to be defeated again when the heroes fight it with their [[mecha]]. Each Super Sentai Series is set in its own [[fictional universe]]; various TV, video and film specials feature a team-up between one or more teams.

The series was created by [[Shotaro Ishinomori]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} then known for the 1971–1973 ''[[Kamen Rider]]'' TV series and the long-running manga ''[[Cyborg 009]]''. He developed the first two Super Sentai Series ''[[Himitsu Sentai Gorenger]]'', which ran from 1975 to 1977, and ''[[J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai]]'', released in 1977. [[Toei Company]] put the franchise on hiatus in 1978,{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} collaborating with [[Marvel Comics]] to produce a live action ''[[Spider-Man (Toei TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series, which added giant robots to the concept of ''tokusatsu'' shows. The giant robot concept was carried over to Toei and Marvel's next show, ''[[Battle Fever J]]'', released in 1979, and was then used throughout the Super Sentai Series.

===''Power Rangers''===
{{Main|Power Rangers}}
In 1993, American production company [[Saban Entertainment]] adapted 1992's ''Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger'' into ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' for the [[Fox Kids]] programming block, combining the original Japanese action footage with new footage featuring American actors for the story sequences. Since then, nearly every ''Super Sentai'' series that followed became a new season of ''Power Rangers''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Some countries, such as France, Brazil, Thailand, and the Philippines, switched from broadcasting ''Super Sentai'' to ''Power Rangers''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In 2002, Saban sold the ''Power Rangers'' franchise to [[Disney]]'s [[Buena Vista (brand)|Buena Vista]] division,{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} who owned it until 2010, broadcasting ''Power Rangers'' on [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]], [[ABC Family Channel]], [[Jetix]], and [[Toon Disney]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} On 12 May 2010, Saban bought the franchise back from Disney, moving the show to the [[Nickelodeon]] network for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=Saban re-acquires rights to ‘Rangers’|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/news/saban-re-acquires-rights-to-rangers-1118019212/|website=Variety|accessdate=12 May 2010|date=12 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418121206/http://variety.com/2010/film/news/saban-re-acquires-rights-to-rangers-1118019212/|archivedate=18 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May 2018, toy company [[Hasbro]] announced they had acquired the ''Power Rangers'' franchise from Saban Capital Group for $522 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arrant|first1=Chris|title=SABAN Sells POWER RANGERS for $522 Million|url=https://www.newsarama.com/39721-power-rangers-sold-to-hasbro.html|website=Newsarama|accessdate=May 8, 2018|language=en|date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|''Unofficial Sentai Akibaranger''|非公認戦隊アキバレンジャー|Hikōnin Sentai Akibarenjā}} is a Toei-produced parody series that premiered in April 2012 on [[TV Asahi|BS Asahi]] and [[Tokyo MX]]. ''Akibaranger'' is made for adult fans who were fans of the Super Sentai Series as children. The story features three [[otaku]] who live in the [[Akihabara]] district of Tokyo who receive technology from a scientist to fight an evil threat that at first only exists in their delusions, but eventually starts materializing itself in the real world. Like ''Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger'', ''Akibaranger'' features guest appearances by veteran Super Sentai actors (as themselves rather than their characters), and voice actors and musicians who have worked in anime and ''tokusatsu''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} A second season aired in April 2013.

'''''The Soup''''' &lt;!--do NOT change to was--&gt;is&lt;!--per Wikipedia guidelines--&gt; an American television series that aired weekly on [[E!]] from July 1, 2004 until December 18, 2015. The program was a [[spin-off (media)|revamped]] version of ''[[Talk Soup]]'' that focused on recaps of various [[popular culture]] and television moments of the week. The show was hosted by comedian [[Joel McHale]], who provided [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] and [[satire|satirical]] commentary on the various clips. On November 18, 2015, ''The Soup'' was cancelled by E! and its last episode aired December 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/18/the-soup-canceled-e-joel-mchale|title=The Soup canceled: Joel McHale to host final show on Dec. 18|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]'s EW.com|date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, 2018, ''[[The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale]]'', a [[spiritual successor]] to ''The Soup'', premiered on [[Netflix]].

==History==
''The Soup'' started on July 1, 2004 as the "What The...? Awards", but the name was changed to maintain name recognition with ''[[Talk Soup]]''.&lt;ref name="seattletimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2002011472_joelmchale22.html|title=From Mercer Island, jumping into ''The Soup''|publisher=The Seattle Times|first=Nicole|last=Brodeur|date=2004-08-23|accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2013, ''The Soup'' debuted a new graphics package, including a new logo designed by Newspeak Agency.

Starting June 2, 2014, ''The Soup'' began airing live episodes. Originally only to last for one month, the program has since become a live show.

On November 18, 2015 ''The Soup'' was cancelled, the number of episodes that were to be produced was later reduced by one. A decision was made not to air the episode that had been filmed and intended to air the same day as the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] due to multiple references to "killing Baby [[Hitler]]". As the episode was pre-filmed, it later aired on November 27, likely replacing a clip show due to it being [[Black Friday (shopping)|the day after Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/thesoup/photos/a.10150143094305874.332544.12637555873/10153685321840874/?type=3|title=The Soup - Timeline Photos|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The show features the host, Joel McHale, on a [[Chroma key|green-screened]] set with a screen to his right. The show is broken up into various segments that focus on themes such as reality television shows or shows on E!. McHale introduces each clip, which is then played. He then comments on the clip before moving on to the next one. There is a live audience on the show, composed of a small group of E! employees, their family and friends, along with the typical production personnel. The audience is involved in the show, laughing and cheering along with the clips.

Although the show is scripted, a large portion of it is ad-libbed.&lt;ref name="ew-interview"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20184375,00.html | title=The Q&amp;A: ''Soup'' Guy Joel McHale Answers Your Questions | first=Mandi | last=Bierly | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=2008-03-14 | accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2008, a blog was started for ''The Soup'' on E!'s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/132968-E_Unveils_Revamped_Web_Site.php | title=E! Unveils Revamped Web Site | first=Larry | last=Barrett | date=2008-04-22 | accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regular characters===
''The Soup'' has its own cast of recurring characters. They include Mankini (a man wearing a bikini top and pants played by Dominic DeLeo, who is also a writer and producer for the show), a dancing maxipad ([[Tess Rafferty]], a supervising producer and the only female writer on ''The Soup''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zukey Staff|title=Interview: Tess Rafferty|url=http://zulkey.com/zulkey_test/2012/11/the-tess-rafferty-interview.html|accessdate=24 November 2016|work=Zukey|date=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  two nerds who dress as ''[[Star Wars]]'' characters, an intern named Matt whom McHale shoots with a gun (often with the shooting [[sound effect]] purposefully played out of sync, or even played with other objects or with just fingers), Jewbacca ([[Chewbacca]]'s lawyer), and "[[Spaghetti Cat]]", a cat eating spaghetti from ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]''. Additionally, Tom McNamara, The Soup's [[stage manager]] and former stage manager on ''[[Talk Soup]]'', and Kelly Levy (''née'' Andrews), the show's former announcer and a producer, have made appearances on the show, with Kelly portraying [[Courtney Stodden]]. Executive producer Edward Boyd's [[chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]] '''Lou''' is used regularly in segment openings, most notably the "Clip of the Week", and elsewhere in the show. He also appeared with Joel at the show's intro, which showed them watching a different TV show each week, until the intro was changed in early 2010.  The current intro juxtaposes brief clips introduced by announcer [[Anndi McAfee]] and a "reaction" by another clip, wildly out of context.

==Regular features==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Soup Set.png|250px|right|thumb|The set of ''The Soup'' with previous logo used until 2013]] --&gt;
The show has a number of segments that focus on various genres of television shows. Regular segments include:
* "Chat Stew", which features clips from talk shows. Joel introduces the segment with either, "Let's have some chat stew, shall we?" or a reference to the previous clip being used for chat stew. Previously, the intro clip indicates a crockpot showing different talk shows in bubbles inside is shown with a rock intro, then the words CHAT STEW hit the top, cracking it. The  introduction is voiced by producer Kelly Andrews (who also does the show's introduction voice overs) saying, "So meaty." Audience members sometimes reply with a groan or "Ew." As of 2013, a new intro card shows a kettle sucking up all the TV sets that broadcast different talk shows, then regurgitates them back out. The rock intro and the "So meaty." audios are kept.
* "Chicks, Man" which focuses on female celebrity news. Joel introduces clip with, "Let's talk about chicks, man." and a slightly deep male voice repeats, "Chicks, man." while a picture of baby [[Bird|chicks]] appears on the screen.
* "Reality Show Clip Time!", which features clips from current [[reality television|reality shows]]. Joel introduces segment with, "It's reality show clip time." (or sometimes total gibberish or other stuff), and the words REALITY SHOW CLIP TIME appear on the screen over a quick rock riff.
* "Let's Take Some E!", a segment featuring clips from other programs shown on E!, jokingly described by McHale as a contractual obligation. The name of the segment (along with its intro) is a reference to the [[party drug]] [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]], which is commonly known as "E".
* The show ends with the "Clip of the Week", a clip considered to be the best clip shown on TV in the past week.  After Joel finishes joking about the next-to-last clip, he introduces this one with "...which brings us to our Clip of the Week."

===Other segments===
''The Soup'' has also featured other recurring segments:
* "What's Pissing Off [[Steve Edwards (talk show host)|Steve Edwards]] This Week?" features clips from [[KTTV]]'s ''[[Good Day L.A.]]'' in which something or somebody makes Steve Edwards upset in the clip. Another episode featured a parody of the segment, "What's Exciting [[Rick Dickert]] This Week?"
* "Tales from Home Shopping" features clips from home shopping channels such as [[QVC]] or [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]].
* "Oprah's Vajayjay" features clips and or related to Oprah's discussions about the female anatomy.
* "What the Kids Are Watching", whose intro started with a boy and a girl watching TV, and ended with the sound of those children crying uncontrollably, showcases unusual and weird clips from children's shows and commercials aimed at children, such as  ''[[Yo Gabba Gabba!]]''. Two spinoff segments have been produced based on the segment: "What the Old Folks Are Watching", which no longer airs, does the same for content geared toward older people, and "What Your Boyfriend's Looking At" features clips of shows targeting males with Kelly Andrews asking "Are you even listening to me?!" to which a man in the audience nearly always responds with, "No!"
* Segments featuring clips from international programs have also been featured, such as "Clippos Magnificos" (which features Spanish programs), "Souper Fantastic Ultra Wish Time!" (which features Japanese programs), and the "International House of Soup."
* "Cyber Smack" featured the best viral videos from the internet. This segment eventually spun-off as ''[[Web Soup]]''.
* "My Stories" shows clips from daytime soap operas, such as ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. A running gag on the show includes increasingly unrelated and random music being played with the segment's title card.
* "Miley Cyrus News" documents stories involving [[Miley Cyrus]], which always begins with producer Kelly Andrews yelling "It's Miley!" Variations include stories involving [[Britney Spears]] in which a highly modulated voice exclaims, "It's Britney, bitch!" or [[Lindsay Lohan]] news in which an overly hoarse and unenthusiastic voice states, "It's Lindsay".
* "Local Newsbreak" features embarrassing clips from local newscasts
* "Ad Nauseam" pokes fun at commercials, often with McHale misusing the product after the clip is done.
* "The Mail Nurse" showcases [[viral videos]] found on the Internet, and opens with Joel in a nurse's outfit seductively saying "It's time to check your RAM" as his nurse's cap clumsily slides off his head.  McHale often comments on how much he hates this intro.
* "Stay Out of It [[Nick Lachey]]" features clips from ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' with cast members saying "Stay out of it Nick Lachey"
* "Gay Shows" features clips from [[LGBT]]-related television shows such as ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]''. The segment is introduced with a title card featuring ultra-masculine things such as monster trucks and motorcycles while a heavy rock guitar solo plays. The title card ends with a gruff male voice saying the segment's name.
* "Gay Shows: Alaska Edition" features clips from Alaskan reality shows such as ''[[Gold Rush Alaska]]''. The segment has the same introduction as "Gay Shows" except that it has pictures of bears added to the intro.
* "Take A Look At Myke Hawke" involves clips from [[Mykel Hawke]]'s shows.  Typically Joel pronounces his name "my [[human penis|cock]]" and make several [[phallic]]-themed jokes while introducing the clip.
* "Gavel Bangin'" is a segment where reality courtroom shows are mocked, especially Nancy Grace's ''Swift Justice''. The title sequence is accompanied with ''The Soup'' voiceover's sexy voice saying, "All rise."
* [[Charlie Sheen]] News: Features news topics regarding Charlie Sheen. Introduced with a clip of Sheen saying, "Everything's good, everything's good."
* "RRRrrr with [[Brian Williams]]" showcases various clips from Williams' [[NBC]] show "[[Rock Center with Brian Williams|Rock Center]]". The segment opens with an angry cat popping up suddenly, and a person imitating the cat growling.
* "Unlikely Voice of Reason" involves a clip in which a much-ridiculed character such as [[Greg Kelly]] or [[Stephanie Pratt]] says something unexpected and intelligent.
* "Clippos Magnificos" which shows clips from the melodramatic [[telenovelas]] shown on Spanish language television.The clips are introduced with an image of a [[piñata]] while [[The  Mexican Hat Dance]] plays in the background.The piñata explodes and a man with a strong [[Spanish language|Spanish]] accent says "Are you serious?". McHale will then mention the name of the show and say "which I'm pretty sure means...", then give a ridiculous, comic translation of the show's title in English.

==Recurring jokes==
The show has a number of recurring jokes and segments. One of the most frequent jokes is Joel McHale making fun of [[Ryan Seacrest]]. He usually comments on Seacrest's height, sexuality, clothing, busy work schedule, income, or demeanor.

Joel has also spoofed other actors, most notably ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' leading man [[David Caruso]], who plays Lieutenant [[Horatio Caine]]. He usually makes fun of the character's tendency to always put on his sunglasses and say corny one-liners at the start of every episode (followed by the first 2–3 seconds of the opening sequence). Joel also will sometimes spoof a person after a clip.

Joel also jokes about how self-centered [[Tyra Banks]] is on [[The Tyra Banks Show|her self-titled talk show]].  More jokes are Joel making fun of Spencer Pratt's "creepy flesh colored beard" as well as the ages of [[Larry King]] and [[Regis Philbin]] and how they are still alive.  Also, McHale often comically berates or abuses "interns" for the show, usually ending with a poorly timed (or sometimes completely out-of-place) audio clip of a gun firing after McHale uses a prop gun on them. McHale has often attempted to "shoot" Mankini, but with no effect.

The [[Spaghetti Cat]] from ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]'' has been used a number of times, usually with a model of the cat rolling in, looking at Joel, and then rolling back out.

Joel has often made fun of [[Bruno Tonioli]]'s flamboyancy while giving comments on ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' stating that he was reading excerpts from his romance novel ''Jazz Hands and Cold Feet''.

''The Soup'' makes jokes at the A&amp;E TV Series, ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]''. Whenever Joel would introduce a clip from the show, a sound clip would say "That's Right It's Steven Seagal", followed by Joel drinking a Steven Seagal ''[[energy drink]]'' that would humorously float into frame.

Due to NFL Coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]]'s recent appearance on ''[[Survivor: Nicaragua|Survivor]]'', Joel usually mentions his "Extenze-enhanced penis", followed by a clip of Johnson saying, "I do."

===Clips===
A number of clips have been repeatedly shown on ''The Soup''. One clip features [[Oprah Winfrey]] saying "My [[vagina|va-jay-jay]] is painin'!" while hanging from a harness at the Miraval resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28vajayjay.html | title = What Did You Call It? | work=The New York Times | first = Stephanie | last = Rosenbloom | date = 2007-10-28 | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another clip involves [[Whitney Houston]] yelling "Kiss My Ass!" at her husband. McHale has mentioned that this clip is one of his favorites.&lt;ref name="ew-interview" /&gt; Still another clip that is often shown is of ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s news correspondent [[Ann Curry]] starting her report by saying, "Good morning, good morning everybody, in the news this morning, good morning", which Olbermann mimicked on his appearance on the July 25, 2008 show. Joel often shows a clip of [[Kendra Wilkinson]] from ''[[The Girls Next Door]]'' laughing. When someone mentions marriage on the show, they will often show a clip of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] screaming "Marriage?! Noooooo!" Shorter clips are sometimes used as interjections. Clips of  [[Danny Noriega]] ("I guess some people weren't likin' it!"), and more recently, [[Tatiana Del Toro]] giggling uncontrollably, have been used as part of McHale's reactions to clips. Recent favorites include [[Gary Busey]] exclaiming "I'm going to pull your [[endocrine system]] out of your body", [[Tila Tequila]] yelling out "A pig's vagina!", [[Michelle Galdenzi]] from ''[[Scream Queens (2008 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'' saying "and by record, I mean vagina.", ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'' contestants [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)#Jase|Jase Wirey]] and [[List of Big Brother 10 HouseGuests (U.S.)#Michelle|Michelle Costa]] "talking" to one another using animal and computer sounds, respectively; "[[Tetrazzini|Chicken Tetrazzini]]" clip from ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]'', Spencer Pratt from ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'' whispering "That's the problem", Billy Bush saying "It's Gross", and Kate Gosselin squealing in a chirpy/grating-sounding voice "Come and Getcher POPcoooooorn!". Recently, the [[Jeffrey Osborne]] song, "[[On the Wings of Love (Jeffrey Osborne song)|On the Wings of Love]]", has been used to mock the current season of ''[[The Bachelor (US TV series)|The Bachelor]]''. Vonda, a woman featured on the [[TruTv]] show ''Over the Limit'' has been featured saying, "Dunka Doo Balls." This clip has become a new favorite. Recently, a clip from ''[[Fantasia for Real]]'' featuring Fantasia's Aunt Bunny saying, "Gurl Please", has become a new favorite. Also, a clip of "Ma" from TruTV's ''[[Ma's Roadhouse]]'' saying "He's a douchebag," after Joel ask what she thinks of a less than favourable man, such as [[Mel Gibson]], has come into use. Another clip of [[Ryan Seacrest]] saying, "Hell no, say what", has been used as reactions to clips. Calvin Tran, a contestant on Bravo's ''[[The Fashion Show (U.S. TV series)|The Fashion Show]]'', has recently been featured in a clip saying, "Oh, here go Hell Come." Frequently following ''Good Day New York'' clips, McHale will ask [[Greg Kelly]] to explain how something works, and this will follow with a clip of Kelly shrugging and saying, "Science".

===Edited clips===
''The Soup'' will often make blatant and obvious edits to clips of shows, often killing off characters (as in their versions of ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]'' and ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'') or splicing McHale and other characters into the shows. McHale will often punctuate the clip by saying "We doctored that."  However, if a clip was shown that may have made the audience think that it was edited by ''The Soup'' for broadcast while watching it, McHale would state before hand "We did not doctor this."

===Original content===
Original skits are integrated into the show as responses or jokes to clips. Fake movie trailers and advertisements are created as spoofs to segments or clips. Among the movies spoofed are ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (in reference to McHale's appearance in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''), '' [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', '' [[Made of Honor]]'', ''[[Righteous Kill]]'', ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia]]'', '' [[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]'', '' [[Quarantine (2008 film)|Quarantine]]'',  (which McHale spoofed with QuaranTween about [[Disney Channel]] celebrities), ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]'', ''[[Fast &amp; Furious]]'', and a [[Tyler Perry]] movie.

==International broadcasts==

Episodes of this nature have been produced on topics such as models and modeling shows, fights on television, and talk shows, two "Chicks, Man/Ladies, Ladies, Ladies" specials focusing on reality TV females, a show about love and marriage called "Love and Other Burning Sensations", and most recently, a show dedicated to television programs that have had recurring appearances on ''The Soup'' (the "shows [they] just cannot quit"). During the holiday seasons, two-part episodes showcasing the best clips of the year are aired (Clipdowns).

==Reception==
''The Soup'' started off as a relatively quiet show, but became one of the most popular programs on E!. By 2006 it was the third highest rated show on the network.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/arts/television/29rhod.html | title = His Pointed Looks Speak Louder Than Punch Lines | work=The New York Times | first = Joe | last = Rhodes | date = 2006-10-29 | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
Since E! is owned by Comcast Entertainment Group, their now-defunct sibling networks aired tailored versions for their networks, including [[Style Network|Style]], [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] and [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]], all taped in the same studio and utilizing the same crew.

===''The Dish''===
{{Main|The Dish (TV series)}}
On August 16, 2008, Style premiered ''The Dish'', hosted by [[Danielle Fishel]]. The show focused more on celebrity, magazine, and [[fashion industry]] trends, along with style and fashion-related reality programs in more detail, including ''[[Project Runway]]'' and various shows on the shopping channels, [[HGTV]] and [[DIY Network]]. It was cancelled on March 20, 2011, two months after the merger of NBC and Comcast was complete. It was thought{{By whom|Reason = Was this press speculation or just Internet chatter?|date=May 2015}} the cancellation was the direct result of former competitors [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] and [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] coming under common NBCUniversal ownership with Style; the two networks and their programming had been among the major comedic targets of ''The Dish''.

===''Sports Soup''===
{{Main|Sports Soup}}
On September 15, 2008, E! parent Comcast Entertainment Group announced another spin-off, this time sports-related, of the series, which aired on the group's sports network, Versus (now known as [[NBC Sports Network]] since 2012), called ''[[Sports Soup]]'' and was hosted by [[Matt Iseman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992162.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2565 | work=Variety | title=E! heats up 'Sports Soup' | first=Michael | last=Schneider | date=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Debuted on October 14, the program once aired twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Later, production was reduced to weekly at 10 pm ET on Tuesdays (or later depending on the end of ''[[NHL on Versus]]'' or other sports coverage). It was cancelled on July 15, 2010.

===''Web Soup''===
{{Main|Web Soup}}
A third version, airing on G4, titled ''Web Soup'', hosted by [[Chris Hardwick]] debuted June 7, 2009 at 9 pm ET. This version is more of a blend of the commentary and reaction portions of ''The Soup'' and two other G4 programs; ''Whacked Out Videos'' and the ''Around the Net'' viral video segment which opens ''[[Attack of the Show]]''. This show ended after its 3rd season on July 20, 2011.

===''Celebrity Soup''===
{{Main|Celebrity Soup}}
''Celebrity Soup'' was the [[List of British television programmes based on American television series|British version of the American show]] hosted by comedian [[Iain Lee]]. Unlike ''The Soup'', ''Celebrity Soup'' airs 19 episodes in a season, instead of year-round like in the United States. It had some of the same features as the original (i.e. "Chat Stew"), but also has its own running gags and features. The series had a similar set, with a window overlooking London's [[Big Ben]] instead of [[Hollywood]], as in the U.S. original.

===''The Soup Investigates''===
{{Main|The Soup Investigates}}
''The Soup Investigates'' was a spin-off of The Soup. It features most of the same crew, including Joel McHale as the host. In the spin-off, the reporters go looking for potentially funny celebrity news stories. It is a spoof of [[investigative journalism]].

It is similar to "[[break a leg]]" and reflects a [[superstition]] that wishing someone "good luck" is in fact bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6DUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |title=It's a superstitious world: Of black cats, lucky numbers, broken mirrors... |last=Libby |first=Steve |work=The Rotarian |date=July 1985 |pages=30–31 |volume=147 |number=1 |issn=0035-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNhaO6gHeSoC&amp;pg=PA203 |page=203 |title=Kids Take the Stage: Helping Young People Discover the Creative Outlet of Theater |last1=Peterson |first1=Lenka |last2=O'Connor |first2=Dan |publisher=Random House Digital |year=2006 |isbn=0-8230-7746-2 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWDrgGosVcwC&amp;pg=PT24 |page=24 |last=Helterbran |first=Valeri R. |title=Exploring Idioms: A Critical-Thinking Resource for Grades 4–8 |publisher=Maupin House Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=1-934338-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
''Toi toi toi'' was an idiom used to ward off a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]] or [[Curse|hex]], often accompanied by [[knocking on wood]] or spitting. The origin is a threefold warning of the devil (Teufel, pr. toi-fell) in German dialect:

''No’ kommt mer in’s Teu-Teu-Teufelskuchen bey ihm. '''Now we come into the De-De-Devil's Kitchen!'''''

Also from [[Rotwelsch]] ''tof'' and from [[Yiddish]] ''tov'' ("good", derived from the Hebrew טוב and with phonetic similarities to the Old German ''tiuvel'' "Devil").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/15158/ |title=Spit Your Way To Safety: Toi, toi, toi! |publisher=Forward Association, Inc. |date=11 February  2009 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spitting idea===

A separate explanation sees "toi toi toi" as the onomatopoeic rendition of spitting three times, a [[Spitting#Spitting as a protection against evil|common practice in many parts of the world]] to ward off evil spirits. Saliva traditionally had demon-banishing powers.

'''Toilet humour''' or '''scatological humour''' is a type of [[off-colour humour]] dealing with [[defecation]], [[urination]] and [[flatulence]], and to a lesser extent [[vomiting]] and other body functions. It sees substantial crossover with sexual humour, such as [[dick joke]]s.

Toilet humour is popular among a wide range of ages,&lt;ref&gt;For example, David Alperts (who is no spring chicken) is commonly considered this humor forms number one fan.&lt;/ref&gt; but is especially popular with children and teenagers, for whom cultural [[taboo]]s related to acknowledgement of waste excretion still have a degree of novelty. The humour comes from the rejection of such taboos, and is a part of modern culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Poop-Culture-America-Grossest-National/dp/193259521X Poop Culture: How America is Shaped by its Grossest National Product] by Dave Praeger {{ISBN|1-932595-21-X}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples can also be found in earlier literature, including ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].

==Song==
Toilet humour is also found in song and rhyme, particularly schoolboy songs. Examples of this are found in [[Mozart and scatology]], and variants of the German folk schoolboys' song known as the ''Scheiße-Lied'' (English: "Shit-Song")&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Fischer ''Kinderreime im Ruhrgebiet: Reime, Lieder, Spiellieder'' 1991 Page 121  "Scheiße auf der Kirchturmspitze Fällt demll Pastor auf die Mütze. 2.

'''''Trivial Pursuit''''' is a [[board game]] from [[Canada]] in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer [[trivia|general knowledge]] and [[popular culture]] questions.

Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]]al tie-ins (such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' movies).

==History==
The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal in [[Quebec]], by Canadian [[Chris Haney (Trivial Pursuit)|Chris Haney]], a photo editor for Montreal's ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'', and [[Scott Abbott]], a sports editor for ''[[The Canadian Press]]''.&lt;ref name="Trivial Pursuit History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/trivialpursuit.htm |title=Trivial Pursuit History |publisher=ideafinder.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finding pieces of their ''[[Scrabble]]'' game missing, they decided to create their own game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bl_trivia_pursuit.htm |title=The History of '&amp;#39;Trivial Pursuit'&amp;#39; |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1981.&lt;ref name="Trivial Pursuit History"/&gt;

In [[North America]], the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of TRIVIAL PURSUIT|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/trivialpursuit.htm|website=The Great Idea Finder|accessdate=12 November 2016|date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights to the game were initially licensed to [[Selchow and Righter]] in 1982, then to [[Parker Brothers]] (now part of [[Hasbro]]) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the [[Virgin Group]]; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[CBC News]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2008/03/31/trivial-sale.html |title=Trivial Pursuit sells for a non-trivial sum: $80 million US |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2004}}, nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of [[Elroy, Wisconsin]] produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the "Games Hall of Fame" by [[Games (magazine)|''Games'' magazine]]. An online version of ''Trivial Pursuit'' was launched in September 2003.&lt;ref name=ward&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Ward |url=http://www.urlwire.com/news/092903.html |title=Trivial Pursuit Launches Online Version |publisher=Urlwire.com |date=29 September 2003 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Trivialpursuit Token.jpg|thumb|A ''Trivial Pursuit'' playing piece, with all six wedges filled]]
The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of ''Trivial Pursuit'', these are [[Geography]] (blue), [[Entertainment]] (pink), [[History]] (yellow), Arts &amp; [[Literature]] (originally brown, later purple), [[Science]] &amp; [[Nature]] (green), and [[Sports]] &amp; Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die.

Playing pieces used in ''Trivial Pursuit'' are round and divided into six sections, similar to a [[cheese spread|cheese triangle]]. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stelfox|first1=Hilarie|title=Tried and tested family games for Christmas|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/13-board-games-keep-family-12326946|work=Huddersfield Examiner|date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress.

During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal "hub" space. At the end of each spoke is a "category headquarters" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, his turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say "roll again," giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a "wild" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his choice. Questions must be answered without any outside assistance. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board.

Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his playing piece, he must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.

==Editions==
[[File:Trivial Pursuit.jpg|thumb|Board and pieces of Trivial Pursuit.]]
{{Main article|List of Trivial Pursuit editions}}
Over the years, numerous editions of ''Trivial Pursuit'' have been produced, usually specializing in various fields. The original version is known as the ''Genus'' edition (or ''Genus I''). Several other general knowledge editions (such as ''Genus II'') have followed. Some include, Junior Edition (1985), All-Star Sports, Baby Boomers, 1980s, All About the 80s, and 1990s.

In the United Kingdom, ''Trivial Pursuit'' players complained that the 2006 version of the game was "[[dumbing down|dumbed down]]" in comparison to previous editions, with easier questions and more focus on celebrities and show business.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1537151/Trivial-brain-teasers-enrage-games-fans.html |title=Trivial 'brain-teasers' enrage game's fans |work=[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]] |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=17 December 2006 |first1=Beth |last1=Jones |first2=Julie |last2=Henry |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==

===Fred Worth lawsuit===
In October 1984, Fred L. Worth, author of ''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'', ''Super Trivia'', and ''Super Trivia II'', filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of ''Trivial Pursuit''. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even to the point of reproducing typographical errors and [[fictitious entry|deliberately placed misinformation]]. One of the questions in ''Trivial Pursuit'' was "What was [[Columbo (character)|Columbo]]'s first name?" with the answer "Philip". That information had been [[Fictitious entry|fabricated to catch]] anyone who might try to [[Copyright infringement|violate his copyright]].&lt;ref name=overend&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOYKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2U8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4598%2C4685968| publisher=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Courier]]| location=[[Prescott, Arizona]]| title=Trivial Suit| date=25 October 1984| last=Overend| first=William| accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventors of ''Trivial Pursuit'' acknowledged that Worth's books were among their sources, but argued that this was not improper and that facts are not protected by copyright. The district court judge agreed, ruling in favor of the ''Trivial Pursuit'' inventors. The decision was appealed, and in September 1987 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] upheld the ruling.&lt;ref name=9cir&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Worth v. Selchow &amp; Righter Company |vol=827 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=596 |court=9th Cir. |date=1987 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/827/569/3179/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Worth asked the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to review the case, but the Court declined, denying [[certiorari]] in March 1988.&lt;ref name=supreme&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Worth v. Selchow &amp; Righter Co. |vol=485 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=977 |date=1988 |url=http://wy.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac./SCT/1988/19880328_0041517.SCT.htm/qx}} (''cert. denied.'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Wall lawsuit===
In 1994, David Wall of [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality|Cape Breton, Nova Scotia]], launched a lawsuit against the game's creators. He claimed that in the fall of 1979, he and a friend were hitchhiking near [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]], when they were picked up by Chris Haney. Wall claimed that he told Haney about his idea for the game in detail, including the shape of the markers.

Wall's mother testified she found drawings of his that looked like plans for a ''Trivial Pursuit''-like game, but the drawings had since been destroyed. Wall's friend, who was allegedly hitchhiking with him that day, never testified. Haney said he never met Wall.

Over the years, there was much legal wrangling, notably around whether the suit should be decided by a judge or jury. On June 25, 2007, the [[Nova Scotia Supreme Court]] ruled against Wall.&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/26/1962864.htm |title=Hitchhiker loses Trivial Pursuit rights battle | work=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corporation News]] |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of ''Trivial Pursuit'', hosted by [[Wink Martindale]], aired on [[ABC Family|The Family Channel]] in the [[United States]] from 1993 to 1995 ([[Jay Wolpert]] had attempted a pilot in 1987, but it was not picked up). A [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] version entitled ''[[Trivial Pursuit: America Plays]]'' aired from 2008 to 2009 and hosted by [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]. In September 2004, [[Roger Lodge]] hosted a sports trivia game show on [[ESPN]] entitled ''ESPN Trivial Pursuit'', which aired five episodes.

[[BBC Television]] produced a ''Trivial Pursuit'' [[game show]] based on the game in the [[UK]] hosted by [[Rory McGrath]]. Another British version (with rules/format similar to the Wink Martindale version, and also using the same theme tune as the Wink Martindale version) was hosted on [[Challenge TV|The Family Channel (now Challenge)]] by [[Tony Slattery]]. [[Birgit Lechtermann]] hosted a version for [[VOX (TV channel)|VOX]] in [[Germany]] from 1993 to 1994.

In 1988, a made-for-television movie entitled ''Breaking all the Rules: The Creation of Trivial Pursuit'' aired. Treated largely as a comedy, the movie featured the music of [[Jimmy Buffett]] and portrayed the creators of the game as three beer-loving Canadians.

In [[Spain]], a version of the show called ''Trivial Pursuit: Spain Plays'' premiered in September 2008 on [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]].&lt;ref name=antenna3&gt;{{cite news| title=Trivial deals, new gameshow for Debmar-Mercury| url=http://www.c21media.net/trivial-deals-new-gameshow-for-debmar-mercury/?ss=trivial+pursuit+spain| publisher=C21 Media| last=Grant| first=Jules| date=6 April 2008| accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arcade game===
In 1984, [[Bally Sente]] released a ''Trivial Pursuit'' arcade game.&lt;ref name=arcade&gt;{{cite web| title=Trivial Pursuit| url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10199| publisher=International Arcade Museum| accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the board game, several variants were also released.

===Home computer games===
British software company [[Domark]] released a home computer version (billed as ''Trivial Pursuit: The Computer Game'') for multiple formats during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="page6"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.page6.org/archive/issue_26/page_24.htm |title=Issue 26 - Trivial Pursuit| publisher=Page 6| date=March–April 1987| last=Davison| first=John S. |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cpcpower"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cpc-power.com/index.php?page=detail&amp;onglet=jaquette&amp;num=2297| title=Trivial Pursuit Edition Genus |publisher=cpc-power.com |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zxsoftware"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zxsoftware.co.uk/gamedetails.php?id=6555|title=ZXSoftware.co.uk|publisher=ZXSoftware.co.uk|date=|accessdate=2012-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309145154/http://www.zxsoftware.co.uk/gamedetails.php?id=6555|archivedate=2013-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lemon64"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D3125 |title=Trivial Pursuit: Commodore-Genus Edition |publisher=Lemon64.com |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version included pictorial and musical questions&lt;ref name="ysorig"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuit.htm |title=Trivial Pursuit |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |date=November 1986 |first=Gwen |last=Hughes |accessdate=2014-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618224434/http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuit.htm |archive-date=2014-06-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was otherwise mostly faithful to the mechanics of the original board game.

Later, Domark released another version called ''Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning'', also across multiple formats.&lt;ref name="lemon64new"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D3475 |title=Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning |publisher=Lemon64.com |date=1988 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ysnew"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuitanewbeginning.htm |title=Trivial Pursuits - A New Beginning |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |date=January 1989 |first=Phil |last=South |accessdate=2014-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619011101/http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuitanewbeginning.htm |archive-date=2014-06-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This version featured a plot about the dying Earth&lt;ref name="incredibly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://incrediblystrangegames.com/post/1166003331/trivial-pursuit-a-strange-new-beginning |title=Trivial Pursuit: A Strange New Beginning |publisher=Incredibly Strange Games |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and significantly altered gameplay mechanics.&lt;ref name="ysnew"/&gt;

[[Hasbro Interactive]] released a "Millennium Edition" in 1999 with three different modes, and different categories:
*''Classic Pursuit'': Played just like the board game.  A "QUICKPLAY" option was also available, where, to speed the game up, every question would be a wedge question.  Up to six can play.  The winner is the first one to earn all six wedges, land back in the center hub by exact count, and then give a correct answer.
*''Party Pursuit'': Up to three can play.  The computer randomly spins categories until there are three to choose from.  A correct answer by the first player to buzz in earns the wedge; a wrong answer gives the opposition a chance, as well as take away any wedges earned in a category.  The first player to earn all six wedges wins the game.  After 20 questions, the computer begins selecting categories for the players.
*''Point Pursuit'': Same as ''Party Pursuit,'' except point scores are kept, and questions range from 250 to 1,000 points.  Players can also wager any or all of their scores on one final question.  Bonus points are earned for a wedge and for how much or how little time it took to answer a question.

There are also three different ways to answer the questions:
*Multiple choice, where players choose from numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4;
*Spelling accuracy: loose, where imperfect spelling is accepted by the program;
*Spelling accuracy: strict, where spelling must be precise.

This game featured a total of seven voice-overs, one host, and one for each of the six categories: People &amp; Places (blue wedge), Arts &amp; Entertainment (pink wedge), History (yellow wedge), Science &amp; Nature (brown wedge), Sports &amp; Leisure (green wedge), and Wild Card (orange wedge).

===Online game===
In 2003, Bolenka Games released an online game of ''Trivial Pursuit'' on the now-defunct website Uproar.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20031118005445/en/Trivial-Pursuit-Online-Games-Brings-Worlds-Popular|title=Trivial Pursuit Online Games Brings World's Most Popular Trivia Game to Uproar.com|date=November 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040204013755/http://www.uproar.com/promos/trivialpursuit/ Trivial Pursuit on Uproar]&lt;/ref&gt;where it features five editions such as: ''Genius'', ''Silver Screen'', ''Music'', ''1980s'' and ''TV''.

===Video games===
Trivial Pursuit was released for a number of home video systems, including [[Sega CD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Trivial Pursuit|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=70 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wii]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[PlayStation 4]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ign.com/games/hasbro-game-channel-trivial-pursuit-live/ps4-20022843 Trivial Pursuit Live! on PlayStation 4], ign.com&lt;/ref&gt; The board game was also adapted into a mobile game called ''[[Trivia Crack]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4462">'''Wanda Webb Holloway''' (born 1954) is a woman from [[Channelview, Texas]], known for attempting to hire a hitman to kill the mother of her daughter's junior high school [[cheerleading]] rival. The plan ultimately failed when the man she asked to perform the hit turned her in to the authorities.

==Background==
Holloway had an intense desire for her daughter Shanna to be a cheerleader. In 1991,  when Shanna narrowly missed out on a spot on her junior high school squad, Holloway asked her ex-brother-in-law, Terry Harper, to hire a [[hitman]] to kill Verna Heath, mother of the 14-year-old girl who had beaten her into the squad. Holloway believed that Heath's daughter would be so devastated by her mother's death that she would drop out of the cheerleading team, thereby giving the spot to Shanna. 

However, unknown to Holloway, Harper had gone straight to the police after Holloway approached him; she was arrested the next day.

==First trial==
Key evidence in the case for the prosecution, headed by Mike Anderson, came down to tapes provided by Terry Harper along with his testimony. These tapes revealed the words of Holloway offering her diamond earrings in exchange for never seeing Verna Heath in Channelview again. The defense lawyer, Troy McKinney, argued that Holloway’s ex-husband, Tony Harper, had conspired with his brother to frame Holloway. McKinney pointed to the divorce between Tony Harper and Wanda Holloway in 1980 and an ensuing custody battle over their children. 

Holloway was convicted of [[solicitation]] of [[capital murder]] in the 1991 trial and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.  However, the conviction was overturned when it was discovered one of the jurors was on [[probation]] for a drug-related felony and should have never been allowed to serve on the jury; a mistrial was declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/3484/Wanda-Holloway-Trial-1991-Plea-Agreement-Ends-Second-Trial.html |title=Wanda Holloway Trial: 1991 - Plea Agreement Ends Second Trial |last=Smith |first=Tom |access-date= October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second trial==
Holloway hired a new defense lawyer, Jack Zimmerman. This time Wanda Holloway admitted to the crime, pleading "no contest" (''[[nolo contendere]]''), and Zimmerman successfully negotiated a plea deal for Holloway.

On September 9, 1996, state district court judge George Godwin sentenced Holloway to ten years in prison, with a fine of $10,000.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news|last=Pesce|first=Carolyn|title='Pompon mom' gets 15 years|newspaper=USA Today|date= September 2, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; On top of this, Holloway settled a civil suit filed by the Heath family. On October 2, 1994, Holloway agreed to pay a total of $150,000 to the victims. It was decided in court that $70,000 would be given to Verna and her husband, $30,000 to the children of Verna, and $50,000 to cover the legal expenses of the case.

==Early release==
Holloway was released on March 1, 1997 after serving just six months of her sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|title=Deadly rivals agree payout|newspaper=The Times|date=October 7, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judge ordered her to serve the remaining 9.5 years on probation, and to complete 1,000 hours of [[community service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michelle|last=Koiden|url=http://www.texnews.com/texas97/mom030197.html|title='Cheerleader mom' freed after serving six months|newspaper=[[Abilene Reporter-News]]|date=March 1, 1997|accessdate=May 26, 2011|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090811085108/http://texnews.com/texas97/mom030197.html|archivedate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ixion.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|[[José Ribera]]'s grittily realistic ''Ixion'', 1632 ([[Museo del Prado]]).]]

In a [[literary]] context, a '''wheel of fire''' may refer to the chain of tortuous or dire consequences that result from a single action.

==In mythology==
The Wheel of Fire originates in [[Greek mythology|Greek mythology]] as the punishment for [[Ixion]], who was bound to a wheel of fire for lusting after [[Zeus]]'s wife, [[Hera]].

==In literature==
The Wheel of Fire is part of the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] reading of a [[tragedy]] (e.g., plays), which includes the central [[character flaw|flaw]] within a character. In Shakespeare's tragedy ''[[Othello]]'', the flaw in [[Othello (character)|Othello himself]] is his vulnerability to jealousy and his tendency to believe [[Iago]], who is manipulating Othello into believing his wife is unfaithful. As a result of this flaw Othello loses a loyal friend, murders his wife, and is driven insane before eventually committing suicide. In this scenario the Wheel of Fire begins with the action of Othello trusting Iago and consequently the other events occur.

The Wheel of Fire is most commonly applied to the [[protagonist]] within a tragedy (i.e. the hero) and may aim to provoke sympathy from the audience when the hero falls from grace (this purging of emotions is known as ''[[catharsis]]''), though it also adds dramatic interest to the performance.

The Wheel of Fire is also the title of [[G. Wilson Knight]]'s book on Shakespearean tragedy.

In Shakespeare's ''King Lear'', Lear states: "But I am bound upon a wheel of fire, / That mine own tears do scald like molten lead".{{OR|date=August 2018}}{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===In Tolkien===
In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the [[One Ring]] is described as a "wheel of fire".

:"I begin to see it in my mind all the time, like a great wheel of fire." -- [[Frodo Baggins]] speaking to [[Samwise Gamgee]].

Also: "A crouching shape, scarcely more than the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure robed in white, but at its breast it held a wheel of fire." -- A description of [[Gollum]] and Frodo, respectively, as seen by Samwise.
