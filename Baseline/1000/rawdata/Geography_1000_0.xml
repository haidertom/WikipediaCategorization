The '''Borden Base Line''' is a historic  survey line (7.42 miles, {{convert|39009.73|ft|m}} long) running north/south through [[Hatfield, Massachusetts|Hatfield]] and [[South Deerfield, Massachusetts]]. It was completed in 1831, and is now on the [[List of historic civil engineering landmarks]].

The base line measurement was the first project of its kind undertaken in America, and essential for Massachusetts' pioneering Trigonometrical Survey, performed under chief engineer Robert Treat Paine. Its careful measurement was critical, since the accuracy of the whole triangulation network depended on it.

The base line was measured with greater accuracy than previously possible by using a new measuring device invented by [[Simeon Borden]], which employed a bi-metallic measuring instrument to provide constant readings despite temperature variations. His apparatus was {{convert|50|ft|m}} long, enclosed in a tube, and employed with four compound microscopes.

Borden was a highly competent engineer whose ability was widely recognized. Indeed, the entire project became generally known as the Borden Survey. He measured the base line with a nominal accuracy of better than one part in 5 million. As Professor A. D. Butterfield has written, "The work performed and results obtained far surpassed in magnitude and attainment of any previous work of this kind in America."

It appears that the north end of the baseline lies just south of the intersection of today's Route 116 and Route 5 in [[South Deerfield, Massachusetts]]. According to the Valley Historians, the south end is still marked by a copper plug set into a boulder, located in the back yard of the house at 30 Bridge Street, [[Hatfield, Massachusetts]].

COGO was originally a subsystem of [[MIT]]'s Integrated Civil Engineering System ('''ICES'''), developed in the 1960s. Other ICES subsystems included STRUDL, BRIDGE, LEASE, PROJECT, ROADS and TRANSET, and the internal languages ICETRAN and CDL. Evolved versions of COGO are still widely used.

Some basic types of elements of COGO are points, spirals, lines and horizontal curves (circular arcs).

More complex elements can be developed such as alignments or chains which are made up of a combination of points, curves or spirals.

'''Cold and heat adaptations in humans''' are a part of the broad adaptability of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Adaptations in humans can be [[Physiological adaptations|physiological]], [[Genetics|genetic]], or [[Culture|cultural]], which allow people to live in a wide variety of [[climate]]s. There has been a great deal of research done on developmental adjustment, [[acclimatization]], and cultural practices, but less research on genetic adaptations to cold and heat temperatures.

The human body always works to remain in [[homeostasis]]. One form of homeostasis is [[thermoregulation]]. Body temperature varies in every individual, but the average internal temperature is 37.0&amp;nbsp;°C (98.6&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767567894|title=Harrison's online|last=1949-|first=Longo, Dan L. (Dan Louis),|last2=1900-1978.|first2=Harrison, Tinsley Randolph,|publisher=McGraw-Hill|oclc=767567894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress from extreme external temperature can cause the human body to shut down. [[Hypothermia]] can set in when the core temperature drops to 35&amp;nbsp;°C (95&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Douglas J.A.|last2=Brugger|first2=Hermann|last3=Boyd|first3=Jeff|last4=Paal|first4=Peter|date=2012-11-15|title=Accidental Hypothermia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra1114208|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=367|issue=20|pages=1930–1938|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1114208|issn=0028-4793|pmid=23150960}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyperthermia]] can set in when the core body temperature rises above 37.5-38.3&amp;nbsp;°C (99.5-100.9&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Axelrod|first=Yekaterina K.|last2=Diringer|first2=Michael N.|title=Temperature Management in Acute Neurologic Disorders|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0733861908000236|journal=Neurologic Clinics|volume=26|issue=2|pages=585–603|doi=10.1016/j.ncl.2008.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laupland|first=Kevin B.|title=Fever in the critically ill medical patient|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181aa6117|journal=Critical Care Medicine|volume=37|issue=Supplement|pages=S273–S278|doi=10.1097/ccm.0b013e3181aa6117}}&lt;/ref&gt; These temperatures commonly result in mortality. Humans have adapted to living in these extreme climates primarily through culture and technology, such as the use of clothing and shelter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daanen|first=Hein A. M.|last2=Lichtenbelt|first2=Wouter D. Van Marken|date=2016-01-02|title=Human whole body cold adaptation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23328940.2015.1135688|journal=Temperature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=104–118|doi=10.1080/23328940.2015.1135688|issn=2332-8940|pmc=4861193|pmid=27227100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of cold and heat adaptations ==
Modern humans emerged from Africa approximately 40,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Evidence suggests that modern culture may have originated then, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Richard G.|date=2000-01-01|title=Archeology and the evolution of human behavior|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(2000)9:13.0.CO;2-A/abstract|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=17–36|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(2000)9:13.0.CO;2-A|issn=1520-6505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern humans spread into Europe and outcompeted [[Neanderthal]]s, which suggests that early modern humans were adaptable enough to live in various climates. This is supported in the variability selection hypothesis proposed by Richard Potts, which says that human adaptability came from environmental change over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potts|first=Richard|date=1998-01-01|title=Environmental hypotheses of hominin evolution|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(1998)107:27+3.0.CO;2-X/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=107|issue=S27|pages=93–136|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(1998)107:27+3.0.CO;2-X|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecogeographic rules ===
[[Bergmann's rule|Bergmann’s rule]] states that [[endotherm]]ic animal subspecies living in colder climates have larger bodies than that of the subspecies living in warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Marshall T.|date=1953-08-01|title=The Application of Ecological Rules to the Racial Anthropology of the Aboriginal New World*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1953.55.3.02a00020/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=55|issue=3|pages=311–327|doi=10.1525/aa.1953.55.3.02a00020|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with larger bodies are better suited for colder climates because larger bodies produce more heat due to having more cells, and have a smaller surface area compared to smaller individuals, which reduces heat loss. A study by Frederick Foster and Mark Collard found that Bergmann’s rule can be applied to humans when the latitude and temperature between groups differ widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=Frederick|last2=Collard|first2=Mark|date=2013-08-28|title=A Reassessment of Bergmann's Rule in Modern Humans|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072269|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=8|pages=e72269|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0072269|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3756069|pmid=24015229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allen's rule|Allen’s rule]] is a biological rule that says the limbs of an endotherm is either shorter in cold climates or longer in hot climates. Limb length affects the body’s surface area, which helps with thermoregulation. Shorter limbs help to conserve heat, while longer limbs help to dissipate heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Trenton W.|last2=Hilton|first2=Charles E.|date=2010-06-01|title=Body proportions of circumpolar peoples as evidenced from skeletal data: Ipiutak and Tigara (Point Hope) versus Kodiak Island Inuit|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21226/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=142|issue=2|pages=287–302|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21226|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall T. Newman argues that this can be observed in [[Eskimo]], who have shorter limbs than other people and are laterally built.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Marshall T.|date=1961-06-01|title=Biological Adaptation of Man to His Environment: Heat, Cold, Altitude, and Nutrition|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1961.tb31093.x/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=91|issue=3|pages=617–633|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1961.tb31093.x|issn=1749-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological adaptations ==
{{main|Thermoregulation in humans}}
Ambient air temperature affects how much energy investment the human body must make. The temperature that requires the least amount of energy investment is 21&amp;nbsp;°C (69.8&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The body controls its temperature through the [[hypothalamus]]. [[Thermoreceptor]]s in the skin send signals to the hypothalamus, which indicate when [[vasodilation]] and [[vasoconstriction]] should occur.

=== Cold ===
The human body has two methods of [[thermogenesis]], which produces heat to raise the core body temperature. The first is [[shivering]], which occurs in an unclothed person when the ambient air temperature is under 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26763611|title=Human adaptation and accommodation|last=1939-|first=Frisancho, A. Roberto,|date=1993-01-01|publisher=University of Michigan Press|oclc=26763611}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is limited by the amount of [[glycogen]] available in the body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The second is non-shivering, which occurs in [[brown adipose tissue]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890013690.pdf|title=Acclimatization to cold in humans|last=Kaciuba-Uscilko|first=Hannah|last2=Greenleaf|first2=John|date=April 1, 1989|website=ntrs.nasa.gov/|publisher=United States|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heat ===
The only mechanism the human body has to cool itself is by [[Perspiration|sweat]] [[evaporation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sweating occurs when the ambient air temperatures is above 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82&amp;nbsp;°F) and the body fails to return to the normal internal temperature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The evaporation of the sweat helps cool the blood beneath the skin. It is limited by the amount of water available in the body, which can cause dehydration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Acclimatization ===
When humans are exposed to certain climates for extended periods of time, physiological changes occur to help the individual adapt to hot or cold climates. This helps the body conserve energy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Cold ====
The [[Inuit]] have more blood flowing into their extremities, and at a hotter temperature, than people living in warmer climates. A 1960 study on the [[Alacalufe people|Alacaluf Indians]] shows that they have a resting metabolic rate 150 to 200 percent higher than the white controls used. [[Sami people|Lapps]] do not have an increase in metabolic rate when sleeping, unlike non-acclimated people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]] undergo a similar process, where the body cools but the metabolic rate does not increase.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Heat ====
Humans in Central Africa have been living in similar tropical climates for at least 40,000 years, which means that they have similar thermoregulatory systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study done on the [[Bantu peoples|Bantus]] of South Africa showed that Bantus have a lower sweat rate than that of acclimated and nonacclimated whites. A similar study done on Australian aborigines produced similar results, with aborigines having a much lower sweat rate than whites.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Culture ==
Social adaptations enabled early modern humans to occupy environments with temperatures that were drastically different from that of Africa. (Potts 1998). Culture enabled humans to expand their range to areas that would otherwise be uninhabitable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Cold ===
Humans have been able to occupy areas of extreme cold through clothing, buildings, and manipulation of fire. [[Furnace]]s have further enabled the occupation of cold environments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Australian aborigines only wear genital coverings for clothes, but studies have shown that the warmth from the fires they build is enough to keep the body from fighting heat loss through shivering.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Eskimos use well-insulated houses that are designed to transfer heat from an energy source to the living area, which means that the average indoor temperature for coastal Eskimos is 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;°C (50-68&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Heat ===
Humans inhabit hot climates, both dry and [[Humidity|humid]], and have done so for thousands of years. Selective use of clothing and technological inventions such as [[air conditioning]] allows humans to thrive in hot climates.

One example is the [[Bedouin|Chaamba Arabs]], who live in the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]. They wear clothing that traps air in between skin and the clothes, preventing the high ambient air temperature from reaching the skin.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Genetic adaptations ==
There has been very little research done in the genetics behind adaptations to heat and cold stress. Data suggests that certain parts of the [[human genome]] have only been [[Natural selection|selected]] for recently. Research on gene-culture interaction has been successful in linking agriculture and [[lactose]] tolerance. However, most evidence of links between culture and selection has not been proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laland|first=Kevin N.|last2=Odling-Smee|first2=John|last3=Myles|first3=Sean|title=How culture shaped the human genome: bringing genetics and the human sciences together|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrg2734|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=11|issue=2|pages=137–148|doi=10.1038/nrg2734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distances Between Ports''' (PUB 151) is a publication that lists the distances between major ports. Reciprocal distances between two ports may differ due to the different routes of currents and climatic conditions chosen. To reduce the number of listings
needed, junction points along major routes are used to consolidate routes converging from different directions.

This book can be most effectively used for [[passage planning|voyage planning]] in conjunction with the proper volume(s) of the [[Sailing Directions|Sailing Directions (Planning Guide)]]. It is corrected via the [[Notice to Mariners]].

The positions listed for ports are central positions that most represent each port. The distances are between positions shown for each port and are generally over routes that afford the safest passage. Most of the distances represent the shortest navigable routes, but in some cases, longer routes, that take advantage of favorable currents, have been used. In other cases, increased distances result from routes selected to avoid ice or other dangers to navigation, or to follow required separation schemes.

'''Edgelands''' are the transitional, [[Liminality|liminal]] areas of space to be found on the boundaries of country and town - with the spread of [[urbanisation]], an increasingly important facet of the twenty-first century world.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Walker - 2002 Aspects of Lincoln: Discovering Local History - Page 134 1473836131 "AN 'EDGE-LAND': THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WITHAM VALLEY EAST OF CANWICK ROAD by Dennis Mills THE TERM 'EDGE-LAND' has been coined recently for the concept of a neglected area on the fringe of a city. Frequently such ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of Edgelands was introduced by [[Marion Shoard]] in 2002, to cover the disorganised but often fertile hinterland between planned town and over-managed country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/our-beautiful-edgelands-a-dark-light-on-the-edge-of-town-2217071.html Our beautiful edgelands]&lt;/ref&gt;  However a century and a half earlier, [[Victor Hugo]] had already highlighted the existence of what he called "bastard countryside...ugly but bizarre, made up of two different natures, which surrounds certain great cities";&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Robert Macfarlane (writer)|Robert Macfarlane]], ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Richard Jeffries]] similarly explored the London edgeland in ''Nature near London'' (1883).
[[Alice Coleman]] (Kings College London, dept geography) in 2nd Land Use Survey of Great Britain, refers to  "rurban fringe". Indicating a similar landscape but with negative overtones.

Nevertheless it was only in the last decades of the twentieth century - as a distinct realm of Nature increasingly disappeared beneath the commodifying impact of globalising [[late capitalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Jameson]], ''The Jameson Reader'' (2002) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; - that the significance of the unstructured borderlands between organised town and organised country, part man-made, part natural,&lt;ref&gt;M. Pratt, ''My Wild Northumbria'' (2015) p. 176 and 208&lt;/ref&gt; both for wildlife and for human exploration, came into fuller focus. [[Psychogeography]] charted the London orbital, while bombsites, canal banks and brownfield sites were documented in poetry and prose, film and photography;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Macfarlane, ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and the borderlands as an untapped, transgressive resource became almost the object of a new cult.&lt;ref&gt;T.

'''Frederick Albert Cook''' (June 10, 1865&amp;nbsp;– August 5, 1940) was an American explorer, physician, and [[ethnographer]], noted for his claim of having reached the [[North Pole]] on April 21, 1908. This was nearly a year before [[Robert Peary]], who reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. Both men's accounts were disputed for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 2009, pp. 58–69.&lt;/ref&gt; His expedition did discover [[Meighen Island]], the only discovery of an island in the [[North American Arctic|American Arctic]] by a United States expedition.

In December 1909, after reviewing Cook's limited records, a commission of the [[University of Copenhagen]] ruled his claim unproven. In 1911, Cook published a memoir of his expedition, continuing his claim. His account of reaching [[Denali|Mount McKinley]]'s summit has also been discredited.

== Biography ==
Cook's birthplace is often listed as [[Callicoon, New York]], but he was actually born in [[Hortonville, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryce 1997, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were recent German immigrants who anglicized their name by adopting the phonetic version of their surname. He attended [[Columbia University]] and received his doctorate from [[New York University Medical School]] in 1890. Cook married Libby Forbes in 1889. She died two years later. In 1902, on his 37th birthday, he married Marie Fidele Hunt. They had two daughters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/frederick-albert-cook-explorer-and-physician-usa-his-news-photo/501373901|title=Ruth and Helene Cook|work=Haeckel Collection|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and divorced in 1923.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Early expeditions ===
Cook was the surgeon on [[Robert Peary]]'s Arctic expedition of 1891–1892, and on the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] of 1897–1899. He contributed to saving the lives of its crew members when their ship—the {{RV|Belgica|1884|2}}—was ice-bound during the winter, as they had not prepared for such an event. It became the first expedition to winter in the Antarctic region. To prevent [[scurvy]], Cook went hunting to keep the crew supplied with fresh meat.

In 1897, Cook twice visited [[Tierra del Fuego]], where he met Anglican missionary [[Thomas Bridges (Anglican missionary)|Thomas Bridges]]. They studied the [[Ona people|Ona]] and [[Yahgan]], with whom Bridges had worked for two decades, during which time he had prepared a manuscript on their language's grammar and a dictionary of more than 30,000 words. Cook borrowed the manuscript for reference but failed to return it before Bridges' death in 1898. Several years later, he tried to publish the dictionary as his own.&lt;ref name="parson"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/21/104935739.pdf "Cook Tried to Steal Parson's Life Work"]. ''New York Times'', May 21, 1910. Accessed October 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mount McKinley summit ===
[[File:Fakepeak.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Alleged photo of McKinley's summit, now known as [[Fake Peak]]]]
In 1903, he led an expedition to [[Mount McKinley]] during which he circumnavigated the Denali range. He made a second journey in 1906, after which he claimed to have achieved the first summit of its peak with one other expedition crew member. Other members, including Belmore Browne, whom Cook had left on the lower mountain, immediately but privately expressed doubt. Cook's claims were not publicly challenged until 1909 when the dispute with Peary over the North Pole claim erupted, with Peary's supporters claiming Cook's McKinley ascent was also fraudulent.

Contrary to [[Hudson Stuck]] in 1913, Cook had not taken photographs from atop McKinley. His alleged photo of the summit was found to have been taken on [[Fake Peak|a small outcrop on a ridge beside the Ruth Glacier]], 19 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf "An aerial photograph by Bradford Washburn"]. ''DIO''. '''7''' (2). p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1909, [[Ed Barrill]], Cook's sole companion during the 1906 climb, signed an affidavit denying that they had reached the summit. In the late 20th century, historians found that he was paid by Peary supporters to do so. (Henderson writes that this fact was covered up at the time, but Bryce says that it was never a secret.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). p. 129. note 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until a month before, Barrill had consistently asserted that he and Cook had reached the summit. His 1909 affidavit included a map correctly locating what became called [[Fake Peak]], featured in Cook's "summit" photo, and showing that he and Cook had turned back at the Gateway.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf ''DIO'']. '''7''' (2). p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climber [[Bradford Washburn]] has gathered data, repeated the climbs, and taken new photos to evaluate Cook's 1906 claim. Between 1956 and 1995, Washburn and Brian Okonek identified the locations of most of the photographs Cook took during his 1906 Denali foray and took new photos at the same spots. In 1997 Bryce identified the locations of the remaining photographs, including Cook's "summit" photograph;&lt;ref&gt;Compare rock-by-rock the left side of Cook's 1906 "summit" photo to the corresponding parts of the 1957 photo by Adams Carter and Bradford Washburn. Photos juxtaposed in Bryce, R. (1999). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). p. 116. Compare also the background features in Cook's "summit" photo versus those in his own photo taken a few minutes later (towards the same direction) from the top of Fake Peak: Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf ''DIO'']. '''7''' (2). figure 4 versus figure 18; detailed-blowup comparisons in figures 6 and 8.&lt;/ref&gt; none were taken anywhere near the summit. Washburn showed that none of Cook's 1906 photos were taken past the "Gateway" (north end of the Great Gorge), 12 horizontal bee-line miles from Denali and 3 miles below its top.

An expedition by the Mazama Club in 1910 reported that Cook's map departed abruptly from the landscape at a point when the summit was still 10 miles distant. Critics of Cook's claims have compared Cook's map of his alleged 1906 route with the landscape of the last 10 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf ''DIO'']. '''7''' (3). pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Cook's descriptions of the summit ridge are variously claimed to bear no resemblance to the mountain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Dishonorable Dr. Cook: Debunking the Notorious Mount McKinley Hoax | first = Bradford | last = Washburn | authorlink = Bradford Washburn |author2=Peter Cherici | year = 2001 | location = Seattle | publisher = Mountaineers Books | oclc = 47054650}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to have been verified by many subsequent climbers.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (2005) p.282&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1970s, climber [[Hans Waale]] found a route which fit Cook's narrative and descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf Bryce (1997) ''DIO''] p.73&lt;/ref&gt; Three decades later, in 2005 and 2006, this route was successfully climbed by a group of Russian mountaineers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shparo.com/Cook/Cook_main.htm "Following the traces of Dr. Frederick Cook"], SH Paro&lt;/ref&gt;

No evidence of Cook's purported journey between the "Gateway" and the summit has been found. His claim to have reached the summit is not supported by his photos' vistas, his two sketch maps' markers, and peak-numberings for points attained,&lt;ref&gt;Bryce. (1997). ''DIO'' pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; nor by his compass bearings, barometer readings, route-map or camp trash. However, samples of all such evidence have been found short of the Gateway.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1999). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Pole ===
[[File:Frederick Cook's 1909 arctic expedition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Photo allegedly taken at, or near, the North Pole]]
After the Mount Denali expedition, Cook returned to the [[Arctic]] in 1907. He planned to attempt to reach the [[North Pole]], although he did not announce his intention until August 1907, when he was already in the Arctic. He left [[Annoatok]], a small settlement in the north of [[Greenland]], in February 1908. Cook claimed that he reached the pole on April 22, 1908, after traveling north from [[Axel Heiberg Island]], taking with him only two Inuit men, Ahpellah and Etukishook. On the journey south, he claimed to have been cut off from his intended route to Annoatok by open water. Living off local game, his party was forced to push south to [[Jones Sound]], spending the open water season and part of the winter on [[Devon Island]]. From there they traveled north, eventually crossing [[Nares Strait]] to Annoatok on the Greenland side in the spring of 1909. They said they almost died of starvation during the journey.

Cook and his two companions were gone from Annoatok for 14 months, and their whereabouts in that period is a matter of intense controversy. In the view of Canadian historian [[Pierre Berton]] (Berton, 2001), Cook's story of his trek around the Arctic islands is probably legitimate. Other writers have relied on later accounts told by Cook's companions to investigators, who seemed to present another view.

There are striking similarities between Ahpellah and Etukishook's sketched route of their journey south, and the route taken by the fictional shipwrecked explorers in [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[The Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]''. For example, the route the two Inuit traced on a map goes over both the Pole of Cold and the wintering site of the fictional expedition. Both expeditions went to the same area of [[Jones Sound]] in hopes of finding a whaling ship to take them to civilization. For details, see Osczevski (2003).

Cook's claim was initially widely believed, but it was disputed by Cook's rival polar explorer [[Robert Peary]], who claimed to have reached the North Pole in April 1909. Cook initially congratulated Peary for his achievement, but Peary and his supporters launched a campaign to discredit Cook. They enlisted the aid of socially prominent persons outside the field of science, such as [[American football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|coach]] [[Fielding H. Yost]] (as related in [[Fred Russell]]'s 1943 book, ''I'll Go Quietly'').

[[File:Picture of Frederick Cook.jpg|thumb|Cook in arctic gear]]
Cook never produced detailed original navigational records to substantiate his claim to have reached the North Pole. He said that his detailed records were part of his belongings, contained in three boxes, which he left at Annoatok in April 1909. He had left them with [[Harry Whitney]], an American hunter who had traveled to Greenland with Peary the previous year due to the lack of manpower for a second sledge-journey 700 miles south to [[Upernavik]]. When Whitney tried to bring Cook's boxes with him on his return to the USA on Peary's ship ''Roosevelt'' in 1909, Peary refused to allow them on board. As a result, Whitney left Cook's boxes in a cache in Greenland. They were never found.

On December 21, 1909, a commission at the [[University of Copenhagen]], after having examined evidence submitted by Cook, ruled that his records did not contain proof that the explorer reached the Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/12/22/101752152.pdf | title=University Finds That Cook's Papers Contain no Proof That He Reached the North Pole | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 22, 1909 | format=PDF | accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Peary refused to submit his records for review by such a third party, and for decades the [[National Geographic Society]], which held his papers, refused researchers access to them.)

Cook intermittently claimed he had kept copies of his sextant navigational data, and in 1911 published some.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, F. (1911). ''My Attainment of the Pole''. pp. 258, 274. Cook's first account of what he left with Whitney did not mention data, and Whitney knew of no data in what was left with him. See Rawlins, 1973, pp. 87, 166, 301–302.&lt;/ref&gt; These have an incorrect solar diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlins (1972). ''[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]]''. Oslo University. '''26'''. pp. 135–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahwelah and Etukishook, Cook's Inuit companions, gave seemingly conflicting details about where they had gone with him. The major conflicts have been resolved in the light of improved geographical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Osczevski, R. J. (2003). ''Arctic''. '''56''' (4).&lt;/ref&gt; Whitney was convinced that they had reached the North Pole with Cook, but was reluctant to be drawn into the controversy.

The Peary expedition's people (primarily [[Matthew Henson]], who had a working knowledge of Inuit, and George Borup, who did not) claimed that Ahwelah and Etukishook told them they had only traveled a few days from land. A map allegedly was drawn by Ahwelaw and Etukishook correctly located and accurately depicted then-unknown [[Meighen Island]], which strongly suggests that they visited it as they claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Osczevski, R. J. (2003). "Frederick Cook and the Forgotten Pole". ''Arctic''. '''56''' (2). pp. 207–217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawlins, 1973, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A genuine Cook discovery, Meighen Island, is the only island discovered by a United States expedition in the American arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#mvmn Discoveries: "Meighen Island"], DIOI&lt;/ref&gt; For more detail see Bryce (1997) and Henderson (2005).

The conflicting claims of Cook and Peary prompted [[Roald Amundsen]] to take extensive precautions in navigation during his [[South Pole]] expedition so there could be no doubt concerning attainment of the pole if successful. Amundsen also had the advantage of traveling over a continent. He left unmistakable evidence of his presence at the South Pole, whereas any ice on which Cook might or might not have camped would have drifted many miles in the year between the competing claims.

At the end of his 1911 memoir, Cook wrote: "I have stated my case, presented my proofs. As to the relative merits of my claim, and Mr. Peary's, place the two records side by side. Compare them. I shall be satisfied with your decision."

== Reputation ==
Cook's reputation never recovered. While Peary's North Pole claim was widely accepted for most of the 20th century, it has been discredited by a variety of reviewers, including the National Geographic Society, which long supported him. Cook spent the next few years defending his claim and threatening to sue writers who said that he had faked the trip. Researching the complicated story of the conflicting claims, the writer Robert Bryce began to see how the men's personalities and goals were in contrast, and set them against the period of the [[Gilded Age]].&lt;ref name="ringle"/&gt; He believes that Cook, as a physician and ethnographer, cared about the people on his expedition and admired the Inuit. Bryce writes that Cook "genuinely loved and hungered for the real meat of exploration-mapping new routes and shorelines, learning and adapting to the survival techniques of the Eskimos, advancing his own knowledge-and that of the world-for its own sake."&lt;ref name="ringle"&gt;[http://www.surveyhistory.org/the_polar_controversy_resolved1.htm Ken Ringle, review: "''Cook &amp; Peary - The Polar Controversy Resolved''"], ''Backsights'', 1997, published by Surveyors Historical Society, accessed 3 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, he could not find supporters to help finance the expeditions without a goal that was more flashy. There was tremendous pressure on each man to be the first to reach the Pole, in order to gain support for continued expeditions.

=== Fraud trial ===
In 1919, Cook started promoting startup oil companies in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. In April 1923, Cook and 24 other Fort Worth oil promoters were indicted in a federal crackdown on fraudulent oil company promotions. Three of Cook's employees pleaded guilty, but Cook insisted on his innocence and was put on trial. Joining him in the trial was his head advertising copywriter, S. E. J. Cox, who had been previously convicted of mail fraud in connection with his own oil company promotions.

Among other deceptive practices, Cook was charged with paying dividends from stock sales, rather than from profits. Cook's attorney was former politician [[Joseph Weldon Bailey]], who clashed frequently with the judge. The jury found Cook guilty on 14 counts of fraud, and, in November 1923, Judge Killits sentenced Cook and 13 other oil company promoters to prison terms. Cook drew the longest sentence, 14 years 9 months. His attorney appealed the verdict, but the conviction was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;Olien, R. (1989). "Doctor Frederick A. Cook and the Petroleum Producers' Association". ''Journal of the West''. '''28''' (4). pp. 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
Cook was imprisoned until 1930. [[Roald Amundsen]], who believed he owed his life to Cook's extrication of the ''Belgica'', visited him several times.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Cook was [[pardon]]ed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1940, ten years after his release and shortly before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 5. He was interred at the Chapel of [[Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5059">The '''Gazetteer of Australia''' is an index or dictionary of the location and spelling of geographical names across [[Australia]]. Geographic names include towns, suburbs and roads, plus geographical features such as hills, rivers, and lakes.

The index is compiled by the [[Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping]] (ICSM) from determinations made by state, territory, and [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] agencies. 

The authorities that work on geographic names in Australia are as follows:

'''Geo-Enable''' is a [[neologism]], a [[portmanteau]] of [[Geospatial]] or [[Geographic]] and [[Enablement (disambiguation)|Enablement]]. Associated words include Geo-Enablment and Geo-Enabling.

As a verb it is increasingly used in the fields of [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS), Web Development, Mobility, [[Information Management]] (IM) and [[Information technology|IT]]. Similar to the terms 'Web-Enabled' or 'GPS-Enabled' - 'Geo-Enable' suggests the application of location or geospatial information as part of business processes or using 'location intelligence' to augment non-spatial [[information systems]] and/or [[Business Intelligence]] (BI).

Geospatial Enablement can be thought of as the integrated use of Geographic Information, as opposed to using Geographic Information within a geographic and technology-centric environment of something such as a [[GPS]] or GIS.

A definition given by GeoEnable Ltd is:

'Geo-Enablement n.:
1. Embedding and leveraging the power of location and geography within workflows and business processes.
2. The act of deriving and utilising geography within non-spatial information.
3. The state of being enabled using location information.' &lt;ref name="Geo-Enablement"&gt;GeoEnable. ''What is Geo-Enablement?'' GeoEnable Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition by the US Government is:

'To geo-enable is to apply geospatial capabilities to a business process in order to establish the authoritative spatial location of business data, and enable contextual spatial analysis.' &lt;ref name="GeospatialPlatform2010"&gt;US Government. ''Modernization Roadmap for the Geospatial Platform (Version 4.0)''. US Department of the Interior &amp; Federal Geographic Data Committee, March 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2494">'''Geographic contiguity''' is the characteristic in [[geography]] of political or geographical land divisions, as a group, not being interrupted by other land or water. Such divisions are referred to as being ''contiguous.''  In the [[United States]], for example, the "[[Contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]]" excludes [[Hawaii]] and [[Alaska]], which do not share borders with other [[U.S. state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/imf/sites/NWI_CONUS/CONUS_metadata/CONUS_Layers.html Wetlands Metadata for the Lower 48 States, US Fish and Wildlife Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105143231/http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/imf/sites/NWI_CONUS/CONUS_metadata/CONUS_Layers.html |date=5 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of geographical contiguity might include the "contiguous European Union" excluding member states such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Malta and Cyprus (these being non-contiguous), or the "contiguous United Kingdom" referring to all parts of the country excepting Northern Ireland (it being geographically non-contiguous).

Two or more contiguous [[Municipality|municipalities]] can be consolidated into one, or one municipality can consist of many noncontiguous elements. For example, the [[Financially Distressed Municipalities Act]] allows the commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] to merge contiguous municipalities to reduce [[financial distress]].

Geographic contiguity is important in [[biology]], especially [[range (biology)|animal ranges]]. For a particular species, its habitat may be a '[[contiguous range]]', or it might be broken, requiring periodic, typically seasonal migrations (see: [[Disjunct distribution]]). The same concept of contiguous range is true for human transportation studies in an attempt to understand census geography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Reference/COGG/LongDescription_e.cfm?GEO_LEVEL=5&amp;REFCODE=1&amp;LANG=E Census Metropolitan Area, Statistics Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217115704/http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Reference/COGG/LongDescription_e.cfm?GEO_LEVEL=5&amp;REFCODE=1&amp;LANG=E |date=17 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also comes into play with electoral geography and politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/217 The Electoral Geography of Weimar Germany: Exploratory Spatial Data Analyses of Protestant Support for the Nazi Party, by John O'Loughlin]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="722">'''Geographic targeting'''  is a viable way for [[resource allocation]], especially  to  alleviate poverty in a country. In this context, public expenditure and policy interventions can be deployed to reach the neediest people in the poorest areas.&lt;ref&gt;Nawar, Abdel-Hameed (2007) "From Marina to Kom-Ombo: A Note on Poverty in Egypt," Cairo University, manuscript, August&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbank.org/html/prdph/lsms/research/povline/pl_n10.pdf World Bank Poverty Line]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographical targeting for poverty alleviation employs a variety of techniques, such as database, and [[geographic information systems]] to construct [[poverty map]]s.

A '''high water mark''' is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a [[flood]], but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges.&lt;ref&gt;J. Curtis Weaver and Thomas J. Zembrzuski, Jr., "August 31, 1993, Storm Surge and Flood of Hurricane Emily on Hatteras Island, North Carolina", in Charles A. Perry, L. J. Combs, ''Summary of floods in the United States, January 1992 through September 1993'' (1995), U.S. Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper 2499, p. 260, stating: Documentation of notable coastal floods provides scientists and flood-plain managers with useful data and technical information for an improved understanding of the hazard and for improved management of flood-prone areas. Of particular importance is documentation of the duration of flooding (and rates of rise and recession of floodwaters), maximum flood elevations and depths, and delineation of the extent of storm-surge flooding.&lt;/ref&gt; High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kahneman, ''Thinking, Fast and Slow'' (2011), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level [[Information sign|sign]] or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy McTigue, James M. Symons, ''The Water Dictionary: A Comprehensive Reference of Water Terminology'' (2011), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

A high water mark is not necessarily an actual physical mark,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S. Flushman, ''Water Boundaries: Demystifying Land Boundaries Adjacent to Tidal Or Navigable Waters'' (2001), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is possible for water rising to a high point to leave a lasting physical impression such as floodwater staining. A landscape marking left by the high water mark of ordinary tidal action may be called a '''strandline''' and is typically composed of debris left by high tide. The area at the top of a [[beach]] where [[marine debris|debris]] is deposited is an example of this phenomenon. Where there are [[tide]]s, this line is formed by the highest position of the tide, and moves up and down the beach on a [[Tide#Analysis|fortnightly cycle]].&lt;ref name="Durham"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.durhambiodiversity.org.uk/pdfs/habitats/Strandline.pdf |publisher=Durham Biodiversity Partnership |title=Strandline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debris is chiefly composed of [[decomposition|rotting]] [[seaweed]], but can also include a large amount of [[litter]], either from [[ship]]s at sea or from [[sewage]] outflows.&lt;ref name="NCDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.gov.uk/media/adobe/7/k/Strandline.pdf |publisher=[[North Cornwall District Council]] |title=Strandlliines |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018204101/http://www.ncdc.gov.uk/media/adobe/7/k/Strandline.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological significance==
The strandline is an important [[habitat]] for a variety of [[animal]]s. In parts of the [[United Kingdom]], [[sandhopper]]s such as ''[[Talitrus saltator]]'' and the [[seaweed fly]] ''[[Coelopa frigida]]'' are abundant in the rotting seaweed, and these invertebrates provide food for [[wader|shore birds]] such as the [[Eurasian rock pipit|rock pipit]], [[turnstone]]&lt;ref name="NCDC"/&gt; and [[pied wagtail]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theheritagecoast.co.uk/natural_world/ecology_of_portland_harbour/strand_line.htm |title=Strand Line |author=Gunnleyg Eldevig &amp; Andrew Flack |publisher=[[The Heritage Coast]] |work=Ecology of Portland Harbour}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mammal]]s such as [[European hare|brown hares]], [[red fox|foxes]], [[vole]]s and [[mouse|mice]].&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt;

==Legal significance==
One kind of high water mark is the '''ordinary high water mark''' or '''average high water mark''', the high water mark that can be expected to be produced by a body of water in non-flood conditions. The ordinary high water mark may have legal significance and is often being used to demarcate [[property law|property]] [[boundary (real estate)|boundaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S. Flushman, ''Water Boundaries: Demystifying Land Boundaries Adjacent to Tidal Or Navigable Waters'' (2001), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinary high water mark has also been used for other legal demarcations. For example, a 1651 analysis of laws passed by the English Parliament notes that for persons granted the title [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the English Seas]], "the Admirals power extended even to the high water mark, and into the main streams".&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Bacon, ''The Continuation of an Historicall Discourse, of the Government of England until the end of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth'' (1651), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the high water mark is also significant because the [[United States Constitution]] gives Congress the authority to legislate for waterways, and the high water mark is used to determine the geographic extent of that authority. Federal regulations (33 CFR 328.3(e)) define the "ordinary high water mark" (OHWM) as "that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Electronic Code of Federal Regulations|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=2fcc86a0ae4919652ccaf4d67829679d&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=33:3.0.1.1.35&amp;idno=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of Section 404 of the [[Clean Water Act]], the OHWM defines the lateral limits of federal jurisdiction over non-tidal water bodies in the absence of adjacent wetlands. For the purposes of Sections 9 and 10 of the [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]], the OHWM defines the lateral limits of federal jurisdiction over traditional navigable waters of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USACE 2005 OHWM Regulatory Guidance Letter|url=http://www.usace.army.mil/Portals/2/docs/civilworks/RGLS/rgl05-05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OHWM is used by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and other federal agencies to determine the geographical extent of their regulatory programs. Likewise, many states use similar definitions of the OHWM for the purposes of their own regulatory programs.

In 2016, the Court of Appeals of Indiana ruled that land below the OHWM (as defined by common law) along Lake Michigan is held by the state in trust for public use. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Gunderson v. State of Indiana, Indiana Department of Natural Resources'', Court of Appeals of Indiana, Opinion 46A03-1508-PL-1116, December 7, 2016| url=http://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/pdf/12071601msm.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], the definition of the Mean High Water Mark is '...the line of the medium high tide between the highest tide of each
lunar month (the springs) and the lowest each lunar month (the Neaps) averaged over the year.' (http://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/tidal_interface/compendium_full_may03.pdf)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26989">{{distinguish|ICAO airport code|text=|selfref=}}
An '''IATA airport code''', also known as an '''IATA location identifier''', '''IATA station code''' or simply a '''location identifier''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/codes|title=IATA - Codes - Airline and Airport Codes Search|first=|last=IATA|website=www.iata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a three-letter code designating many [[airport]]s around the world, defined by the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA). The characters prominently displayed on [[bag tag|baggage tags]] attached at airport check-in desks are an example of a way these codes are used.

The assignment of these codes is governed by IATA Resolution 763, and it is administered by IATA headquarters in [[Montreal]]. The codes are published semiannually in the IATA Airline Coding Directory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/coding|title=IATA - Airline Coding Directory|first=|last=IATA|website=www.iata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IATA also provides codes for [[railway]] stations and for airport handling entities. A [[list of airports]] sorted by IATA code is available. A [[List of IATA-indexed railway stations|list of railway station codes]], shared in agreements between airlines and rail lines such as [[Amtrak]], [[SNCF|SNCF French Rail]], and [[Deutsche Bahn]], is available. Many railway administrations have their own list of codes for their stations, such as the [[list of Amtrak station codes]].

==History and conventions==
Airport codes arose out of the convenience that it brought pilots for location identification in the 1930s. Initially, pilots in the United States used the two-letter code from the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) for identifying cities. This system became unmanageable for cities and towns without an NWS identifier, thus a three-letter system of airport codes was implemented. This system allowed for 17,576 permutations, assuming all letters can be used in conjunction with each other.&lt;ref name=sky&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport ABCs: An Explanation of Airport Identifier Codes|year=1994|url=http://www.skygod.com/asstd/abc.html|work=Air Line Pilot|publisher=Air Line Pilots Association|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, airport codes are named after the first three letters of the city in which it is located—[[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport|ATL]] for [[Atlanta]], [[Singapore Changi Airport|SIN]] for [[Singapore]], [[Silvio Pettirossi International Airport|ASU]] for [[Asunción]], [[Benito Juárez International Airport|MEX]] for [[Mexico City]], [[Denver International Airport|DEN]] for [[Denver]]; [[Istanbul Atatürk Airport|IST]] for [[Istanbul]]; or a combination of the letters in its name, [[Newark Liberty International Airport|EWR]] for [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla International Airport|GDL]] for [[Guadalajara]], [[O. R. Tambo International Airport|JNB]] for [[Johannesburg]], [[Hong Kong International Airport|HKG]] for [[Hong Kong]], [[Salt Lake City International Airport|SLC]] for [[Salt Lake City]] and [[Warsaw Chopin Airport|WAW]] for [[Warsaw]]. Some airports in the United States retained their NWS codes and simply appended an X at the end, such as [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] for [[Los Angeles]], [[Portland International Airport|PDX]] for [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|PHX]] for [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;

Sometimes the airport code reflects pronunciation, rather than spelling, such as [[Nadi International Airport|NAN]], which reflects the pronunciation of "Nadi" as {{IPA-fj|ˈnandi|}} in [[Fijian language|Fijian]], where "d" is realized as the [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasalized stop]] {{IPA|[ⁿd]}}.

For many reasons, some airport codes do not fit the normal scheme described above. Some airports, for example, cross several municipalities or regions, and mix the letters around, giving rise to DFW for [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|'''D'''allas–'''F'''ort '''W'''orth]], DTW for [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|'''D'''e'''t'''roit–'''W'''ayne County]], LBA for [[Leeds Bradford International Airport|'''L'''eeds '''B'''radford ('''A'''irport)]], MSP for [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport|'''M'''inneapolis–'''S'''aint '''P'''aul]], and RDU for [[Raleigh–Durham International Airport|'''R'''aleigh–'''Du'''rham]].

{{citation needed span|text=Canada originally used two letters for identification of a weather reporting station in the 1930s. Additionally, preceding the two-letter code, was placed a Y (meaning "yes") where the reporting station was co-located with an airport, a W (meaning "without") where the reporting station was not co-located with an airport, and a U where the reporting station was co-located with an [[Non-directional beacon|NDB]]. An X was used if the last two letters of the code had already been taken by another Canadian ident, and a Z was used if the locator could be confused with a U.S. three letter ident.|date=April 2018}}

===Cities with multiple airports===
In large metropolitan areas, airport codes are often named after the airport itself instead of the city it serves, while another code is reserved which refers to the city itself. For instance:

* [[Berlin]] (BER)&amp;nbsp;– [[Berlin Tegel Airport]] (TXL) and [[Berlin Schönefeld Airport]] (SXF), and the under construction [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] (BER)
* [[Bucharest]] (BUH)&amp;nbsp;– [[Henri Coandă International Airport|Otopeni]] (OTP) is named after the town of [[Otopeni|'''Ot'''o'''p'''eni]] which the airport is located, while the city also has another airport inside the city limits, [[Aurel Vlaicu International Airport|Băneasa]] (BBU).
* [[Buenos Aires]] (BUE)&amp;nbsp;– [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Ezeiza]] (EZE) is named after the suburb in [[Ezeiza Partido]] which the airport is located, while [[Aeroparque Jorge Newbery]] (AEP) is in the city proper.
* [[Chicago]] (CHI)&amp;nbsp;– [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]] (ORD), named after '''Or'''chard Fiel'''d''', the airport's former name, and [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway]] (MDW)
* [[Jakarta]] (JKT)&amp;nbsp;– [[Soekarno–Hatta International Airport|Soekarno–Hatta]] (CGK) is named after '''C'''en'''gk'''areng, the [[Cengkareng|district in which the airport is located]], while the city also has another airport, [[Halim Perdanakusuma Airport|Halim Perdanakusuma]] (HLP). JKT had referred to the city's former airport, [[Kemayoran Airport]] which is now closed.
* [[London]] (LON)&amp;nbsp;– [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] (LHR), [[Gatwick]] (LGW), [[London City Airport|London City]] (LCY),&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]] (STN), [[Luton Airport|Luton]] (LTN) and [[London Southend Airport|Southend]] (SEN)
* [[Milan]] (MIL)&amp;nbsp;– [[Milan–Malpensa Airport|Malpensa]] (MXP), [[Linate Airport|Linate]] (LIN) and [[Orio al Serio Airport|Orio al Serio]] (BGY)
* [[Miami]] (MIA)&amp;nbsp;– [[Miami International Airport|Miami]] (MIA), [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport|Fort Lauderdale]] (FLL), [[Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]] (PBI)

* [[New York City]] (NYC)&amp;nbsp;– [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy]] (JFK, formerly Idlewild (IDL)), [[La Guardia Airport|La Guardia]] (LGA), and [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Liberty]] (EWR)
* [[Osaka]] (OSA)&amp;nbsp;– [[Kansai International Airport|Kansai]] (KIX) and [[Osaka International Airport|Itami]] (ITM, formerly OSA)
* [[Paris]] (PAR)&amp;nbsp;– [[Orly Airport|Orly]] (ORY), [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Charles de Gaulle]] (CDG), [[Paris–Le Bourget Airport]] (LBG) and [[Beauvais–Tillé Airport]] (BVA)
* [[Rio de Janeiro]] (RIO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Galeão Airport|Galeão]] (GIG) and [[Santos Dumont Airport|Santos Dumont]] (SDU)
* [[Rome]] (ROM)&amp;nbsp;– [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport|Fiumicino]] (FCO) and [[Ciampino Airport|Ciampino]] (CIA)
* [[São Paulo]] (SAO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Congonhas Airport|Congonhas]] (CGH), [[São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport|Guarulhos]] (GRU) and [[Viracopos International Airport|Campinas]] (VCP)
* [[Sapporo]] (SPK)&amp;nbsp;– [[New Chitose Airport|Chitose]] (CTS) and [[Okadama Airport|Okadama]] (OKD)
* [[Seoul]] (SEL)&amp;nbsp;– [[Incheon Airport|Incheon]] (ICN) and [[Gimpo Airport|Gimpo]] (GMP, formerly SEL)
* [[Stockholm]] (STO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Stockholm–Arlanda Airport|Arlanda]] (ARN), [[Stockholm–Bromma Airport|Bromma]] (BMA), [[Stockholm Skavsta Airport|Nyköping–Skavsta]] (NYO) and [[Stockholm Västerås Airport|Västerås]] (VST)
* [[Tokyo]] (TYO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Haneda Airport|Haneda]] (HND) and [[Narita Airport|Narita]] (NRT)
* [[Toronto]] (YTO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Pearson]] (YYZ), [[Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport|Bishop]] (YTZ), [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport|Hamilton]] (YHM), and [[Region of Waterloo International Airport|Waterloo]] (YKF)
* [[Washington, D.C.]] (WAS)&amp;nbsp;– [[Dulles International Airport|Dulles]] (IAD), [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Reagan]] (DCA), and [[Baltimore–Washington International Airport|Baltimore–Washington]] (BWI)

Or using a code for the city in one of the major airport and then assign another code to another airport:
* [[Bangkok]] (BKK)&amp;nbsp;– [[Suvarnabhumi Airport|Suvarnabhumi]] (BKK) and [[Don Mueang International Airport|Don Mueang]] (DMK)
* [[Beijing]] (BJS)&amp;nbsp;– [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Capital]] (PEK) and [[Nanyuan Airport|Nanyuan]] (NAY)
* [[Dallas]] (DFW)&amp;nbsp;- [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] (DFW) and [[Dallas Love Field]] (DAL)
* [[Dubai]] (DXB)&amp;nbsp;– [[Dubai International Airport|International]] (DXB) and [[Al Maktoum International Airport|Al Maktoum]] (DWC)
* [[Houston]] (HOU)&amp;nbsp;- [[William P. Hobby Airport]] (HOU) and [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] (IAH)
* [[Johannesburg]] (JNB)&amp;nbsp;– [[O. R. Tambo International Airport|O. R. Tambo (formerly Jan Smuts)]] (JNB) and [[Lanseria International Airport|Lanseria]] (HLA)
* [[Kiev]] (IEV)&amp;nbsp;– [[Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany)]] (IEV) and [[Boryspil International Airport]] (KBP)
* [[Kuala Lumpur]] (KUL)&amp;nbsp;– [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Sepang]] (KUL) and [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport|Subang]] (SZB)
* [[Medellín]] (MDE)&amp;nbsp;– [[José María Córdova International Airport|José María Córdova]] (MDE) and [[Olaya Herrera Airport|Olaya Herrera]] (EOH)
* [[Nagoya]] (NGO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Chubu Centrair International Airport|Centrair]] (NGO) and [[Nagoya Airfield|Komaki]] (NKM)
* [[Shanghai]] (SHA)&amp;nbsp;– [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Pudong]] (PVG) and [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport|Hongqiao]] (SHA)
* [[Taipei]] (TPE)&amp;nbsp;– [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|Taoyuan]] (TPE) and [[Taipei Songshan Airport|Songshan]] (TSA)
* [[Tehran]] (THR)&amp;nbsp;– [[Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport|Imam Khomeini]] (IKA) and [[Mehrabad International Airport|Mehrabad]] (THR)

When different cities with the same name each have an airport, the airports need to be assigned different codes. For example,
* [[Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM) is in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], United States and [[Birmingham Airport]] (BHX) is in [[Birmingham]], England, United Kingdom.
* [[Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport]] (SJC) is in [[San Jose, California]], United States and [[Juan Santamaría International Airport]] (SJO) is in San José, Costa Rica.
* [[Portland International Jetport]] (PWM) is in [[Portland, Maine]], while [[Portland International Airport]] (PDX) is in [[Portland, Oregon]].

Sometimes, a new airport is built, replacing the old one, leaving the city's new "major" airport code to no longer correspond with the city's name. The original airport in Nashville, Tennessee was built in 1936 as part of the Works Progress Administration and called Berry Field with the designation, BNA. A new facility known as Nashville International Airport was built in 1987 but still uses BNA. This is in conjunction to rules aimed to avoid confusion that seem to apply in the United States, which state that "the first and second letters or second and third letters of an identifier may not be duplicated with less than 200 [[nautical mile]]s separation."&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; Thus, Washington D.C. area's three airports all have radically different codes: IAD for [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington–Dulles]], DCA for [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington–Reagan]] (District of Columbia Airport), and BWI for [[Baltimore Airport|Baltimore]] (Baltimore–Washington International, formerly BAL).&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; Since HOU is used for [[William P. Hobby Airport]], the new [[Houston–Intercontinental]] became IAH.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; The code BKK was originally assigned to [[Don Mueang International Airport|Bangkok–Don Mueang]] and was later transferred to [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]], while the former adopted DMK. [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport|Shanghai–Hongqiao]] retained the code SHA, while the newer [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Shanghai–Pudong]] adopted PVG. The opposite is true for [[Berlin]], the airport [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Berlin–Tegel]] uses the code TXL, while its smaller counterpart [[Berlin Schönefeld Airport|Berlin–Schönefeld]] uses SXF; the new [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] is going to have the code BER. Hamburg (HAM) and Hannover (HAJ) are less than 100 NM apart and still use the same first and middle letter, indicating that this rule might be followed only locally.

===Cities or airports changing names===
Many cities retain historical names in their airport codes, despite the fact that their official name or its official spelling or transliteration is now different:
* in [[Armenia]]: [[Shirak Airport|LWN]] for [[Gyumri]] (formerly Leninakan)
* in [[Bangladesh]]: [[Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport|DAC]] for [[Dhaka]] (formerly [[Dacca]])
* in [[Canada]]: [[Iqaluit Airport|YFB]] for [[Iqaluit]] (formerly Frobisher Bay)
* in [[China]]: [[Beijing Capital International Airport|PEK]] for Beijing (formerly Peking), [[Tianjin Binhai International Airport|TSN]] for [[Tianjin]] (formerly Tientsin), [[Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport|CKG]] for [[Chongqing]] (formerly Chungking), [[Qingdao Airport|TAO]] for [[Qingdao]] (formerly Tsingtao), and [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport|CAN]] for [[Guangzhou]] (formerly Canton). The older IATA codes follow [[Chinese postal romanization]], introduced in 1906, officially abolished in 1964 and in use well into the 1980s, while gradually superseded by [[Pinyin]]
* in [[Greenland]]:  most airports, including [[Kangerlussuaq Airport|SFJ]] for [[Kangerlussuaq]] (formerly Søndre Strømfjord) and [[Nuuk Airport|GOH]] for [[Nuuk]] (formerly Godthåb)
* in [[India]]: BLR for Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport|BOM]] for [[Mumbai]] (formerly [[Bombay]]), [[Kolkata Airport|CCU]] for [[Kolkata]] (formerly [[Calcutta]]), and [[Chennai International Airport|MAA]] for [[Chennai]] (formerly [[Madras]])
* in [[Indonesia]]: [[Radin Inten II Airport|TKG]] for [[Bandar Lampung]] (formerly Tanjung Karang), [[Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport|UPG]] for [[Makassar]] (formerly Ujung Pandang). In addition, when the [[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System]] was introduced in 1972, a few older IATA codes retained the previous spelling: [[Sultan Iskandar Muda International Airport|BTJ]] for [[Banda Aceh]] (formerly Banda Atjeh), [[Sentani International Airport|DJJ]] for [[Jayapura]] (formerly Djajapura), [[Adisutjipto International Airport|JOG]] for [[Yogyakarta]] (formerly Jogjakarta)
* in [[Kazakhstan]]: [[Astana International Airport|TSE]] for [[Astana]] (formerly Tselinograd), [[Aktau Airport|SCO]] for [[Aktau]] (formerly Shevchenko), [[Atyrau Airport|GUW]] for [[Atyrau]] (formerly Guryev), [[Taraz Airport|DMB]] for [[Taraz]] (formerly Dzhambyl), [[Semey Airport|PLX]] for [[Semey]] (formerly Semipalatinsk)
* in [[Kyrgyzstan]]: [[Manas International Airport|FRU]] for [[Bishkek]] (formerly Frunze)
* in [[Moldova]]: [[Chișinău International Airport|KIV]] for [[Chișinău]] (formerly Kishinev)
* in [[Montenegro]]: [[Podgorica Airport|TGD]] for [[Podgorica]] (formerly Titograd)
* in [[Myanmar]]: [[Yangon International Airport|RGN]] for [[Yangon]] (formerly Rangoon)
* in [[Russia]]: [[Pulkovo Airport|LED]] for [[St. Petersburg]] (formerly Leningrad), [[Strigino International Airport|GOJ]] for [[Nizhny Novgorod]] (formerly Gorky), [[Koltsovo Airport|SVX]] for [[Yekaterinburg]] (formerly Sverdlovsk), [[Kurumoch International Airport|KUF]] for [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] (formerly Kuybyshev), [[Beslan Airport|OGZ]] for [[Vladikavkaz]] (formerly Ordzhonikidze) and others
* in [[Tajikistan]]: [[Khujand Airport|LBD]] for [[Khujand]] (formerly Leninabad)
* in [[Turkmenistan]]: [[Turkmenbashi International Airport|KRW]] for [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan|Türkmenbaşy]] (formerly Krasnovodsk); [[Turkmenabat Airport|CRZ]] for [[Türkmenabat]] (formerly Chardzhev)
* in [[Ukraine]]: [[Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany)|IEV]] for [[Kiev]]; [[Luhansk International Airport|VSG]] for [[Luhansk]] (formerly Voroshilovgrad); [[Kropyvnytskyi Airport|KGO]] for [[Kropyvnytskyi]] (formerly Kirovograd); [[Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport|LWO]] for [[Lviv, Ukraine|Lviv]] (formerly Lwów while part of Poland until 1939, and still called Lvov in Russian); [[Ivano-Frankivsk International Airport|IFO]] for [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] (in Soviet times spelt in Russian as Ivano-Frankovsk);
* in [[Vietnam]]: [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport|SGN]] for [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (formerly Saigon)

Some airport codes are based on previous names associated with a present airport, often with military heritage.  These include as Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]], which is assigned ORD, based on its old name of Orchard Field, before it was expanded and renamed O'Hare in the mid-1950s. Similarly, [[Orlando International Airport]] uses MCO, based on the old McCoy Air Force Base, which was converted to joint civilian/military use and renamed Orlando Jetport at McCoy in the early 1960s and finally Orlando International in the early 1980s. Other airport codes are similarly not immediately obvious in origin, and each have their own peculiarities. Nashville uses [[Nashville Airport|BNA]] (Berry Field, henceforth ''B''erry ''N''ashville ''A''irport), [[Knoxville]] uses [[McGhee Tyson Airport|TYS]], for [[Charles McGhee Tyson]], whose family donated the land for the first airport in Knoxville, and [[Kahului]] (the main gateway into [[Maui]]) uses [[Kahului Airport|OGG]], while [[Spokane International Airport]] goes by GEG. Most of these are named after individuals.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; In Asia, codes that do not correspond with their city's names include [[Niigata (city)|Niigata]]'s [[Niigata Airport|KIJ]], [[Nanchang]]'s [[Nanchang Airport|KHN]], [[Pyongyang]]'s [[Pyongyang International Airport|FNJ]], and [[Kobe]]'s [[Kobe Airport|UKB]].

Some airports are identified even in colloquial speech by their airport code. The most notable examples are LAX and JFK.

===National policies===
Since the [[U.S. Navy]] reserved "N" codes and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] has [[Call signs in North America|reserved rights for "W" and "K"]], certain U.S. cities which begin with these letters had to adopt "irregular" airport codes: EWR for Newark, [[Norfolk International Airport|ORF]] for [[Norfolk, Virginia]], EYW for [[Key West, Florida]], and [[Napa County Airport|APC]] for [[Napa, California]].&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; This "rule" does not apply outside the United States: [[Karachi]] is KHI, [[Warsaw]] is WAW, [[Nagoya]] is NGO. In addition, since "Q" was used for international communications, cities with "Q" beginning their name also had to find alternate codes, as in the case of [[Qiqihar]] (NDG), [[Quetta]] (UET) and [[Quito]] (UIO).

IATA codes should not be confused with the [[Location identifier#FAA identifier|FAA identifiers]] of US airports. Most FAA identifiers agree with the corresponding IATA codes, but some do not, such as [[Saipan International Airport|Saipan]] whose FAA identifier is GSN and its IATA code is SPN, and some coincide with IATA codes of non-US airports.

Most large airports in Canada have codes that begin with the letter "Y", although not all "Y" codes are Canadian (for example, YUM for Yuma, Arizona) and not all Canadian airports start with the letter "Y" (for example ZBF for Bathurst, New Brunswick). Many Canadian airports have a code that starts with W, X or Z, but none of these are major airports. When the Canadian transcontinental railways were built, each station was assigned its own two letter Morse code. VR was Vancouver, TZ Toronto, QB Quebec, WG Winnipeg, SJ St. Johns, YC Calgary, OW Ottawa, EG Edmonton, etc. When the Canadian government established airports, it used the existing railway codes for them as well. If the airport had a weather station, authorities added a "Y" to the front of the code, meaning "Yes" to indicate it had a weather station, or some other letter to indicate it did not. When international codes were created in cooperation with the United States, because "Y" was seldom used in the US, Canada simply used the weather station codes for its airports, changing the "Y" to a "Z" if it conflicted with an airport code already in use. The result is that most major Canadian airport codes start with "Y" followed by two letters in the city's name: [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|YOW]] for [[Ottawa]], [[Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport|YWG]] for [[Winnipeg]], [[Calgary International Airport|YYC]] for [[Calgary]], and [[Vancouver International Airport|YVR]] for [[Vancouver]], whereas other Canadian airports append the two letter code of the radio beacons that were the closest to the actual airport, such as [[Gander International Airport|YQX]] in [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]] and [[Prince George Airport|YXS]] in [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]].

Four of the ten provincial capital airports in Canada have ended up with codes beginning with YY, including YYZ for Toronto, Ontario, YYJ for Victoria, British Columbia, YYT for St. John's, Newfoundland, and YYG for Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Canada's largest airport is YYZ for [[Toronto–Pearson International Airport|Toronto–Pearson]] (YTZ was used for Toronto City Airport, so YYZ is the station code for a village called Malton, which is where Toronto Pearson International Airport is actually located). YUL is used for [[Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Montréal–Trudeau]] (UL was the ID code for beacon in the city of Kirkland, now the location of Montréal–Trudeau). While these codes make it difficult for the public to associate them with a particular Canadian city, some codes have become popular in usage despite their cryptic nature, particularly at the largest airports. Toronto's YYZ code has entered pop culture in the form of [[YYZ_(instrumental)|a popular rock song]] utilizing the "YYZ" Morse code signal. Some airports have started using their IATA codes as marketing brands. [[Calgary International Airport]] has begun using its airport code YYC as a marketing brand and name for the airport authority web site (yyc.com),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YYC: Calgary Airport Authority |url=http://www.yyc.com/|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Vancouver International Airport]] advertises as YVR (yvr.com).

Numerous New Zealand airports use codes which contain a letter Z, to distinguish them from similar airport names in other countries. Examples include [[Hamilton Airport (New Zealand)|HLZ]] for [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Queenstown Airport|ZQN]] for [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]], and [[Westport Airport (New Zealand)|WSZ]] for [[Westport, New Zealand|Westport]].

===Lack of codes===
It is also noteworthy that there are several airports with scheduled service that have not been assigned ICAO codes that do have IATA codes. For example, several airports in Alaska that have scheduled commercial service, such as [[Stebbins Airport]] or [[Nanwalek Airport]], using [[Location identifier|FAA codes instead]]. There are also airports with scheduled service for which there are ICAO codes but not IATA codes, such as [[Nkhotakota Airport]]/[[Tangole Airport]] in [[List of airports in Malawi|Malawi]] or [[Chōfu Airport]] in Tokyo, Japan. Also several minor airports in [[Russia]] (e.g. [[Omsukchan Airport]]) which instead use [[Location identifier|internal Russian codes]] for booking. Flights to these airports can't be booked through the international air booking systems (or have luggage transferred all the way), instead booked through the airline or a domestic booking system. Thus, neither system completely includes all airports with scheduled service.

The '''international date line&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In this article, the convention used is to capitalize "Date Line" (or "International Date Line") when it refers to the ''standard'' [[International Date Line]], but to use small letters to refer to possible construct(s) under Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt;  in Judaism''' is used to demarcate the change of one calendar day to the next in the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]]. The Jewish calendar defines days as running from sundown to sundown rather than midnight to midnight. So in the context of Judaism, an international date line demarcates when the line of sundown moving across the Earth's surface stops being the sundown ending and starting one day and starts being the sundown ending and starting the following day.

However, the conventional [[International Date Line]] is a relatively recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved from time to time depending on the needs of different interested parties. While it is well-understood why the conventional date line is located in the Pacific Ocean, there are not really objective criteria for its exact placement within the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[International Date Line|main article]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that the conventional International Date Line can (or should) be used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the ''[[Jewish law|halakhic]]'' date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law.

==Location of the date line==

===Theoretical basis for the discussion===
Many of the opinions about the ''halakhic'' date line are structured as a response to the question of what days someone should observe as [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]]. Shabbat occurs every seven days at any location on earth. It is normally thought to occur on Saturday—or more precisely, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at nightfall. But if the ''halakhic'' date line is not identical to the conventional Date Line, it is possible that what is Saturday with respect to the conventional Date Line is not Saturday with respect to the ''halakhic'' date line, at least in some places.

There are several opinions regarding where exactly the ''halakhic'' date line should be according to Jewish law, and at least one opinion that says that no ''halakhic'' date line really exists.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name="taarich"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taplin |first1=Rabbi Yisroel |authorlink1=Yisroel Taplin |title=Sefer Taarich Yisroel |date=1998–1999 |location=Lakewood, NJ |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |language=Hebrew|postscript=,}} which is summarized in English at {{cite web |title=Kitzur Taarich Yisroel: The Dateline in Halacha |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |website=www.datelineinhalacha |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map&gt;[http://www.star-k.org/articles/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IDL_Map.pdf The International Dateline in Halacha (Star-K)(map)], 170 kB&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|90}}'''1. ''90 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' The concept of a ''halakhic'' date line is mentioned in the ''[[Baal HaMeor]],'' a 12th-century Talmudic commentary,&lt;ref name=kashrus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/493/a-travelers-guide-to-the-international-dateline/ |last=Heber|first=Rabbi Dovid|title=A Traveller's Guide To The International Dateline |publisher=Star-k.org |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbeinu Zecharya Halevi, ''Baal Hameor'', Tractate Rosh Hashana, 20b&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to indicate that the day changes in an area where the time is six hours ahead of [[Jerusalem]] (90 degrees east of Jerusalem, about 125.2°E, a line now known to run through [[Australia]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]] and [[Russia]]). This line, which he refers to as the ''K'tzai Hamizrach'' (the easternmost line), is used to calculate the day of [[Rosh Hashanah]], the Jewish New Year. According to some sources it is alluded to in both the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Eruvin (Talmud)|Eruvin]]) and in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]].  The ''[[Kuzari]]'' of [[Yehuda Halevi]], also a 12th-century work, seems to agree with this ruling.

Later decisors like the ''[[Chazon Ish]]'' (twentieth century) fundamentally agree with this ruling. However, they recognize practical issues associated with the pure use of a line of longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2°E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in [[Changchun]], China.&lt;ref&gt;To be precise, at a point 1.11 km east of Xihu Rd. See [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=43.84%2C125.2#map=12/43.8400/125.1999 location on OpenStreetMaps.]&lt;/ref&gt; If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by crossing the street. To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rules{{refn|Cited in Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich /&gt; at footnote 16 of the web page.}}&lt;ref name="RJJ"&gt;This is rejected by the [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik|Brisker Rav]] (see {{cite journal|last1=Pahmer|first1=David|title=The International Date Line and Related Issues|journal=RJJ Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society|date=1990|volume=XXI|pages=60–83|url=http://download2.yutorah.org/1991/1053/735807.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=}} at page 69), who rules that the use of this meridian is absolute.&lt;/ref&gt; that the contiguous land masses to the east of that line of longitude are considered secondary (''tafel'') to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2°E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]] are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and [[Indonesia]] would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''2. ''180 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky]] ruled that the International Date Line is 180 degrees east of Jerusalem.  That would mean that the date line, rather than being near 180°, would be at 144.8°W.  By this view, places east of the conventional International Date Line but west of 144.8°W—[[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]] and a variety of archipelagos in the Pacific—would observe Shabbat on the local Friday instead of the local Saturday.

It is possible (but not certain) under this view to apply the principal of ''tafel'' described above as well. In that event, mainland Alaska would be east of the date line, but the [[Aleutian Islands]] would be west of the date line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''3. ''Mid-Pacific.''''' A variety of decisors{{refn|''Inter alia,'' Rabbis David Shapira, B. Rabinowitz Thumim, the ''Atzei Sodeh,'' and the ''Alai Yonah.'' These decisors do not necessarily rule identically to each other.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Rabbi Yehuda|title=The Sabbath, the International Date Line and Jewish Law|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1736567/jewish/|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} rule that the date line runs in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, close to (but not necessarily the same as) the conventional International Date Line. According to this point of view, all of the major populated areas of the Pacific (such as New Zealand, Japan, Alaska and Hawaii) observe Shabbat on local Saturday (that is, consistent with the conventional International Date Line). Only certain Pacific islands, generally having few or no permanent Jewish residents, might not observe Shabbat on local Saturday.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;

'''4. ''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' According to Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Kasher]], there is no clear tradition or Talmudic source dictating any of the preceding opinions as binding. For that reason, and consistent with a [[History of responsa in Judaism|responsum]] of the [[Radbaz]], Rabbi Kasher starts with the default law that a Jew not knowing the proper day for Shabbat should count days from the last time s/he observed Shabbat, and that every seven days is Shabbat. In his view, established Jewish communities are presumed to have fixed their calendars according to this principle. Therefore, Shabbat in an established community is whatever day the community has established. Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]] and Rabbi [[Zvi Pesach Frank]] apparently agree with this position.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name=gewirtz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gewirtz|first1=William L.|title=Zemannim: On the Introduction of New Constructs in Halakhah|journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal|date=2012–13|volume=16|pages=153–172|jstor=23596060}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} This position does not in and of itself require a formal date line to be established, and Rabbi Kasher does not seem to think that it is necessary to do so. But the ''de facto'' result of this position is consistent with the conventional International Date Line, at least anywhere there is an established Jewish community.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{refn|Rabbi Shurpin&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{rp|Note 14}} and Gewirtz&lt;ref name=gewirtz/&gt;{{rp|Note 4}} provide treatments as to how [[International Date Line#Historical alterations|changes in the location of the International Date Line]] might affect its use as a ''de facto'' standard in Jewish Law.}}

===Practical rulings===
In practice, the conventional International Date Line (or another mid-Pacific line near it) is the ''de facto'' date line under Jewish law, at least for established Jewish communities. The communities of Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jccjapan.or.jp/ Jewish Community of Japan], [http://www.jcckobe.org/ Jewish Community of Kansai]&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chc.org.nz/ Canterbury Hebrew Congregation], [http://ahc.org.nz/category/events/ Auckland Hebrew Congregation]&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sofmaarav.org/ Congregation Sof Maarav], [http://www.mauijews.org/#!events/c17et Jewish Congregation of Maui]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French Polynesia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Andrew|title=Shabbat in Tahiti paradise|url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/shabbat-in-tahiti-paradise/14535|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Australian Jewish News|date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; all observe Shabbat on local Saturday ''(i.e.,'' Friday night until Saturday night). No known Jewish community observes Shabbat on a day other than local Saturday.&lt;ref name=jta&gt;The one arguable exception is [[Samoa]], which moved from the east side of the International Date Line to the west side around New Year's Day 2012. The [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] located one relatively observant Jewish individual living on Samoa, who said at the time that he would follow the lead of local [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] churches and light Shabbat candles on Saturday night. (See {{cite news|last1=Soclof|first1=Adam|title=Samoa time warps into Shabbat|url=http://www.jta.org/2012/01/03/the-archive-blog/samoa-time-warps-into-shabbat|accessdate=27 April 2016|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=3 January 2012|postscript=.)}} However, the practice of a single individual may not be sufficient to establish a community practice in Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that practical conclusion is reached in two different ways, resulting in somewhat different practice patterns in each case.

'''''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' As noted above, according to this point of view, Shabbat is simply observed on the date previously established as Shabbat by the local community—uniformly, local Saturday&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;—without any need for any further observance. This appears to be the default practice for residents of such places as Japan, New Zealand and Hawaii. At minimum, it is difficult to find evidence of other practices by residents of those areas.&lt;ref name=worker&gt;See, as an anecdotal example, {{cite web|title=The international dateline and halacha|url=http://jewishworker.blogspot.com/2005/09/international-dateline-and-halacha.html|website=The Jewish Worker|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=;}} search the page for "NZ".&lt;!--This is a blog, and the pertinent comment was in the responses, not in the blog post itself. As a source, it doesn't really qualify as a RS, and it is intended to be illustrative, rather than definitive. But there is little in the way of reliable evidence, which is not surprising given that one is essentially trying to prove a negative.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Taken to a fully logical conclusion, ''no fixed date line'' means that anyone in a location without an established tradition of which day is Shabbat should always depend on his own personal count of days. It is not clear whether this can currently apply to someone traveling on his or her own to an island in the Western Pacific without an established tradition. (See, for example, Rabbi Shurpin {{refn|name=chabad}} at the end of the section "The Samoa issue".) However, it seems clear that at minimum one construes an "established community" relatively broadly. So while Japan, for example, has only a scattered handful of synagogues, their uniform practice of observing Shabbat on Saturday seems sufficient to fix Saturday as the established day for Shabbat anywhere in Japan.}}

'''''Establishment of a date line by a majority among three halakhic positions.''''' The travelers' guide of the [[Star-K]] kosher supervision service, compiled according to the rulings of its rabbinic administrator, Rabbi [[Moshe Heinemann]], uses the following approach,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; which is also cited by others. According to this approach, the [[#90|first three numbered sections above]] constitute three valid, parallel, ''halakhic'' rulings. Shabbat is consequently fully observed on whichever day is consistent with the majority view among those opinions (two out of three). However, out of respect to the minority view of the third ruling, and with an eye toward not desecrating Shabbat, [[Melacha|Torah-level prohibitions]] are to be avoided on the day consistent with the minority view, although that day is otherwise considered a weekday. According to this rule, practice is as follows: 
* In New Zealand and Japan, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to the majority opinion (sections 2 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 1 above), Shabbat is on the local Sunday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Sunday. Nevertheless, on Sunday, one should pray the regular weekday prayers, donning [[tefillin]] during morning prayers.
* In Hawaii and French Polynesia, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to majority opinion (sections 1 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 2 above), Shabbat is on the local Friday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Friday. Friday prayers are weekday prayers, and preparation for Shabbat must be done with an eye to avoiding Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; 
* In principle, a zone of pure doubt exists in approximately the area of 169°W–177°E,&lt;ref name=map/&gt; including places like [[Tonga]], Samoa and [[American Samoa]]. The rulings of the ''Mid-Pacific'' group above are not perfectly consistent in this area,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; so there is no possibility of an unambiguous "two out of three" consensus here. Rabbi Dovid Heber of the Star-K suggests that in such locations one might need to observe Shabbat fully for two days every week.&lt;ref name="heber2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heber|first1=Rabbi Dovid|title=How to Keep This Shabbos in Samoa? STAR-K Tells Us How (Samoa &amp; Tokelau To Cross International Date Line)|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/113307/how-to-keep-this-shabbos-in-samoa-star-k-tells-us-how-samoa-tokelau-to-cross-international-date-line.html|website=The Yeshiva World News|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Star-K's international kosher supervision staff follows this approach, and there is evidence that some other travelers also do.&lt;ref name=worker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Dateline|url=http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.jewish.avodah/26561|website=avodah@aishdas.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities suggesting this approach often advise travelers to avoid the zone of doubt entirely near weekends, or to consult with a competent rabbinical authority directly.&lt;ref name=heber2/&gt;

==Crossing the halakhic date line==
The issues discussed in the previous section apply ''per se'' to individuals or communities in fixed locations. However, the act of crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) introduces a number of additional issues under Jewish law. Questions potentially affected include:&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;
{{div col}}
*Crossing the line into or out of Shabbat or a holiday, or a [[Ta'anit|rabbinic fast day]], while already aboard an airplane or a ship
*Determining what prayers to say (and when) while in transit
*Lighting candles on [[Hanukkah]]
*[[Counting of the Omer]], and consequently fixing the day for [[Shavuot]]
*[[Niddah|Counting days until relations are permitted following menstruation]]
*Fixing the date for [[Brit Milah]], [[Pidyon Haben]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]
{{div col end}}
In some cases, crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) has a specific impact on practice or prohibitions under Jewish law. In others, an individual's count of days (by the experience of sunset and sunrise) is the determining factor, regardless of the crossing of the date line. Details around specific questions, cases and rulings of Jewish law are beyond the scope of this article.{{refn|See Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich" /&gt;, which covers these questions in some detail. The author notes that there are consensus opinions about some—but not all—of these issues.}}

==Considerations for astronauts==
Before Israeli astronaut [[Ilan Ramon]] flew on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] in 2003, he decided (after consultation with rabbis) to observe Shabbat according to time in his last residence, [[Kennedy Space Center|Cape Canaveral]], since he would be crossing the date line and observing sunset many times per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ask the rabbi: Shabbat in space|date=18 January 2003|website=ohr.edu|publisher=[[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem]]|url=https://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/ask_the_rabbi/ask_the_rabbi/637|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|title=Ilan Ramon|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ilan-ramon|date=February 2, 2003|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=standard /&gt; [[Judith Resnik]], the first American Jewish astronaut in space, lit (electronic) Shabbat candles according to the time in [[Johnson Space Center|Houston, TX]], her home and the location of [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]].&lt;ref name=standard&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Astronauts|author=Warren Boroson|date=26 January 2015|website=Jewish Standard|url=http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/jewish-asttronauts/|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Long Range Kinematic (LRK)''' technology is a sophisticated kinematic method developed by Magellan (formerly Thales) Navigation that optimises the advantages of dual-frequency [[GPS]] operation. Other conventional methods use the dual-frequency only during initialisation. LRK makes solving ambiguities during initialisation easy and continuous dual-frequency kinematic operation possible at distances up to 40 kilometres.

Conventional dual-frequency kinematic operation is limited to about 10 kilometres, using a combined observation on GPS L1 and L2 frequencies to produce an initial wide lane solution, ambiguous to around 86 centimetres. During a second phase, the conventional kinematic method uses measurements from the L1 frequency only. This method only allows for kinematic operation as long as the de-correlation of atmospheric errors is compatible with a pure phase single-frequency solution.

Similar to the [[Kinematic Applications in Real Time|KART]] process, LRK is a simple and reliable method that allows any initialisation mode, from a static or fixed reference point, to On The Fly ambiguity resolution, when performing dual-frequency GPS positioning. LRK technology reduces initialisation times to a few seconds by efficiently using L2 measurements in every mode of operation. LRK maintains optimal real-time positioning accuracy to within a centimetre at a range up to 40-50 kilometres, even with a reduced number of visible satellites.

A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined [[landform]]s such as (ice-capped) [[mountains]], [[hills]], [[water bodies]] such as [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, ponds and the [[sea]], living elements of [[land cover]] including indigenous [[vegetation]], human elements including different forms of [[land use]], buildings and [[structure]]s, and transitory elements such as [[lighting]] and [[weather]] conditions.

Combining both their physical origins and the [[Culture|cultural]] overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and [[national identity]]. The character of a landscape helps define the self-image of the people who inhabit it and a sense of place that differentiates one region from other regions. It is the dynamic backdrop to people’s lives. Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a [[English landscape park|landscape park]], or [[wilderness]].

The [[Earth]] has a vast range of landscapes, including the icy landscapes of [[polar region]]s, [[mountain]]ous landscapes, vast arid [[desert]] landscapes, [[island]]s and [[coast]]al landscapes, densely [[forest]]ed or [[wooded]] landscapes including past [[boreal forests]] and [[tropical rainforests]], and [[agricultural]] landscapes of [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] regions.

The activity of modifying the visible features of an area of land is referred to as ''[[landscaping]]''.

==Definition and etymology==
[[File:Stanisław Masłowski (1853-1926), Autumn landscape in Rybiniszki, 1902.jpeg|left|thumb|Autumn landscape in [[Riebini|Rybiniszki]], [[Latvia]], [[watercolor]] by [[Stanisław Masłowski]], 1902 ([[National Museum in Warsaw]], Poland)]]
There are several definitions of what constitutes a landscape, depending on context. In common usage however, a landscape refers either to all the visible features of an area of land (usually rural), often considered in terms of [[aesthetic]] appeal, or to a pictorial representation of an area of countryside, specifically within the genre of [[landscape painting]]. When people deliberately improve the aesthetic appearance of a piece of land—by changing contours and vegetation, etc.—it is said to have been [[Landscaping|landscaped]],&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; though the result may not constitute a landscape according to some definitions.

The word ''landscape'' (''landscipe'' or ''landscaef'') arrived in [[England]]—and therefore into the [[English language]]—after the fifth century, following the arrival of the [[Anglo-Saxons]]; these terms referred to a system of human-made spaces on the land. The term ''landscape'' emerged around the turn of the sixteenth century to denote a painting whose primary subject matter was natural scenery.&lt;ref name="olw1"&gt;[[Kenneth Olwig|Olwig K.R.]], Recovering the Substantive Nature of Landscape, ''Annals of the A.A.G''(1996),86,4,630-653&lt;/ref&gt; ''Land'' (a word from Germanic origin) may be taken in its sense of something to which people belong (as in England being the land of the English).&lt;ref name= "olwig3" /&gt; The suffix ''&amp;#8209;scape'' is equivalent to the more common English suffix ''&amp;#8209;ship.''&lt;ref name="olwig3"&gt;Olwig K.R., Representation and Alienation in the Political Landscape, ''cultural geographies'' (2005)12,19-40&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of ''&amp;#8209;ship'' are etymologically akin to Old English ''sceppan'' or ''scyppan'', meaning ''to shape''. The suffix ''&amp;#8209;schaft'' is related to the verb ''schaffen'', so that ''&amp;#8209;ship'' and ''shape'' are also etymologically linked. The modern form of the word, with its connotations of scenery, appeared in the late sixteenth century when the term ''landschap'' was introduced by Dutch painters who used it to refer to paintings of inland natural or rural scenery. The word ''landscape'', first recorded in 1598, was borrowed from a Dutch painters' term.&lt;ref&gt;Makhzoumi J. and Pungetti G., Ecological Landscape Design and Planning, Spon Routledge,(1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The popular conception of the ''landscape'' that is reflected in dictionaries conveys both a particular and a general meaning, the particular referring to an area of the Earth's surface and the general being that which can be seen by an observer. An example of this second usage can be found as early as 1662 in the [[Book of Common Prayer]]:
::Could we but climb where Moses stood,
::And view the landscape over.
::: (General Hymns, verse 536).&lt;ref&gt;Found via Google Ngram&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Kukle,Czech Republic..jpg|thumb|163x163px|Kukle, Czech Republic.]]

There are several words that are frequently associated with the word landscape:
* Scenery: The natural features of a landscape considered in terms of their appearance, esp. when picturesque: spectacular views of mountain scenery.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt;
* [[Setting (narrative)|Setting]]: In works of narrative (especially [[fiction]]al), it includes the [[time|historical moment in time]] and [[location (geography)|geographic location]] in which a [[storytelling|story]] takes place, and helps initiate the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] for a story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, p. 1, 65, 115, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Picturesque]]: The word literally means "in the manner of a picture; fit to be made into a picture", and used as early as 1703 (''Oxford English Dictionary''), and derived from an Italian term ''pittoresco'', "in the manner of a painter". [[William Gilpin (priest)|Gilpin]]’s ''Essay on Prints'' (1768) defined ''picturesque'' as "a term expressive of that peculiar kind of beauty, which is agreeable in a picture" (p. xii).
* A view: "A sight or prospect of some landscape or extended scene; an extent or area covered by the eye from one point" (OED).
* [[Wilderness]]: An uncultivated, uninhabited, and inhospitable region.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; See also [[Natural landscape]].
* [[Cityscape]] (also townscape): The urban equivalent of a landscape. In the [[visual arts]] a cityscape (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[Publishing|print]] or [[photograph]], of the physical aspects of a [[city]] or urban area.
* [[Seascape]]: A [[photograph]], [[painting]], or other [[work of art]] which depicts the [[sea]], in other words an example of [[marine art]].

==Physical landscape==

===Geomorphology: The physical evolution of landscape===
[[Geomorphology]] is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of [[topographic]] and [[bathymetric]] features  created by physical or chemical processes operating at or near Earth's surface. Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and [[landscape evolution model|numerical modeling]]. Geomorphology is practiced within [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[geodesy]], [[engineering geology]], [[archaeology]] and [[geotechnical engineering]]. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, M.A., 1991, ''Global Geomorphology'', Pearson Education Ltd,  {{ISBN|0-582-30156-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of [[Earth]] is modified by a combination of surface processes that sculpt landscapes, and geologic processes that cause [[tectonic uplift]] and [[subsidence]], and shape the [[coastal geography]]. Surface processes comprise the action of [[water]], [[wind]], [[ice]], [[wildfire|fire]], and living things on the surface of the Earth, along with chemical reactions that form [[soil]]s and alter material properties, the stability and rate of change of [[topography]] under the force of [[gravity]], and other factors, such as (in the very recent past) human alteration of the landscape. Many of these factors are strongly mediated by [[climate]]. Geologic processes include the uplift of [[mountain range]]s, the growth of [[volcano]]es, [[isostasy|isostatic]] changes in land surface elevation (sometimes in response to surface processes), and the formation of deep [[sedimentary basins]] where the surface of Earth drops and is filled with material [[erosion|eroded]] from other parts of the landscape.  The Earth surface and its topography therefore are an intersection of climatic, [[hydrology|hydrologic]], and [[biology|biologic]] action with geologic processes.

===Landscape ecology===
[[Landscape ecology]] is the science of studying and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems. This is done within a variety of landscape scales, development spatial patterns, and organizational levels of research and policy.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and sustainability science. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2008. Landscape ecology. In: S. E. Jorgensen (ed), Encyclopedia of Ecology. Elsevier, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape is a central concept in landscape ecology. It is, however, defined in quite different ways. For example:&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T., Trepl, L. and V. Vicenzotti, V. 2012: What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions. Landscape Research online first.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carl Troll]] conceives of landscape not as a mental construct but as an objectively given ‘organic entity’, a ‘‘harmonic individuum of space’’.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, C. 2007: The geographic landscape and its investigation. In: Wiens, J.A., Moss, M.R., Turner, M.G. &amp; Mladenoff, D.J. (eds): Foundation papers in landscape ecology. New York, Columbia University Press:71–101 [First published as: Troll, C. 1950: Die geographische Landschaft und ihre Erforschung. Studium Generale 3(4/5):163–181].&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Ernst Neef]]&lt;ref&gt;Neef, E. 1967: Die theoretischen Grundlagen der Landschaftslehre. Haack, Gotha; cf. Haase, G. and H. Richter 1983: Current trends in landscape research. GeoJournal 7(2):107–119.&lt;/ref&gt; defines landscapes as sections within the uninterrupted earth-wide interconnection of geofactors which are defined as such on the basis of their uniformity in terms of a specific land use, and are thus defined in an anthropocentric and relativistic way.

According to [[Richard Forman]] and [[Michael Godron]],&lt;ref&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron, M. 1981: Patches and structural components for a landscape ecology. BioScience 31(10):733–740; Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron 1986: Landscape ecology. Wiley, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; a landscape is a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems that is repeated in similar form throughout, whereby they list woods, meadows, marshes and villages as examples of a landscape’s ecosystems, and state that a landscape is an area at least a few kilometres wide.

Springer, New York:371–383.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes the traditional view expounded by [[Carl Troll]], Isaak S. Zonneveld, Zev Naveh, Richard T. T. Forman/Michel Godron and others that landscapes are arenas in which humans interact with their environments on a kilometre-wide scale; instead, he defines 'landscape'—regardless of scale—as "the template on which spatial patterns influence ecological processes".&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1999: The science and practice of landscape ecology.

In: Wiens, J.A. and M.R. Moss (eds): Issues and perspectives in landscape ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge:365–373.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some define 'landscape' as an area containing two or more [[ecosystem]]s in close proximity.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"&gt;Sanderson, J. and L. D. Harris (eds.).  2000.  Landscape Ecology: A Top-Down Approach.  Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrated landscape management===
[[Integrated landscape management]] is a way of managing a landscape that brings together multiple stakeholders, who collaborate to integrate policy and practice for their different land use objectives, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes.&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=J|last2=Deakin|first2=E|last3=Sunderland|first3=T|title=What are ‘Integrated Landscape Approaches’ and how effectively have they been implemented in the tropics: a systematic map protocol|journal=Environmental Evidence|date=2015|volume=4:2|url=http://www.cifor.org/library/5422/what-are-integrated-landscape-approaches-and-how-effectively-have-they-been-implemented-in-the-tropics-a-systematic-map-protocol/|issn=2047-2382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LSLB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denier|first1=L|last2=Scherr|first2=S|last3=Shames|first3=S|last4=Chatterton|first4=P|last5=Hovani|first5=L|last6=Stam|first6=N|title=The Little Sustainable Landscapes Book|date=2015|publisher=Global Canopy Programme|location=Oxford|url=http://globalcanopy.org/sustainablelandscapes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognises that, for example, one river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for smallholders and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; the way in which each one of these sectors pursues its goals can have impacts on the others. The intention is to minimise conflict between these different land use objectives and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; This approach draws on landscape ecology, as well as many related fields that also seek to integrate different land uses and users, such as [[watershed management]].&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt;

Proponents of integrated landscape management argue that it is well-suited to address complex global challenges, such as those that are the focus of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="SDG briefing"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landscapes for People Food and Nature|title=Integrated Landscape Management: The Means of Implementation for the Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Landscapes for People Food and Nature briefing|date=2015|url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ILM-for-the-SDGs-Two-Page-Statement-Sept-21-2015-FINAL-FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated landscape management is increasingly taken up at the national,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GMS Workshop on Landscape Approaches|url=http://www.gms-eoc.org/events/gms-workshop-on-landscape-approaches|website=Greater Mekong Subregion - Core Environment Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IINDC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Republic of Indonesia|title=Intended Nationally Determined Contribution|url=http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Indonesia/1/INDC_REPUBLIC%20OF%20INDONESIA.pdf|website=UNFCCC submissions}}&lt;/ref&gt; local&lt;ref&gt;Landscapes for People Food and nature case studies http://peoplefoodandnature.org/analysis/all-publications/case-studies/&lt;/ref&gt; and international level, for example the [[UN Environment Programme]] states that "UNEP champions the landscape approach de facto as it embodies the main elements of integrated ecosystem management".

===Landscape archaeology===

[[File:Medieval Ridge and Furrow above Wood Stanway - geograph.org.uk - 640050.jpg|220px|left|thumb|[[Medieval]] Ridge and Furrow above [[Wood Stanway]], [[Gloucestershire]], England.]]
Landscape archaeology or [[landscape history]] is the study of the way in which humanity has changed the physical appearance of the environment - both present and past. Landscape generally refers to both natural environments and environments constructed by human beings.&lt;ref name="Nicole"&gt;Branton, Nicole (2009) Landscape Approaches in Historical Archaeology: The Archaeology of Places. In International Handbook of Historic Archaeology, Majewski, Teresita and David Gaimster, eds. Springer:&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Natural landscape]]s are considered to be environments that have not been altered by humans in any shape or form.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;Hood, Edward J. (1996)  "Social Relations and the Cultural Landscape". In Landscape Archaeology:Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. Yamin, Rebecca and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds. Knoxville:The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cultural landscapes]], on the other hand, are environments that have been altered in some manner by people (including temporary structures and places, such as campsites, that are created by human beings).&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Spencer-Wood, Suzanne M. and Sherene Baugher. (2010) "Introduction to the Historical Archaeology of Powered Cultural Landscapes." International Journal of Historical Archaeology 14, pp. 463-474.&lt;/ref&gt; Among archaeologists, the term landscape can refer to the meanings and alterations people mark onto their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garden" /&gt;  As such, landscape archaeology is often employed to study the human use of land over extensive periods of time.&lt;ref name="garden"&gt;Gleason, Kathryn L. (1994). "To Bound and to Cultivate: An Introduction to the Archaeology of Gardens and Fields. In The Archaeology of Garden and Field. Miller, Naomi F. and Kathryn L. Gleason, eds. Philadelphia:University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erika Martin Seibert. [http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/guidance/NR_workshop_3-11-09/Archeol_and_landscapes_Erika.doc "Archaeology and Landscape"], Accessed December 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Landscape archaeology can be summed up by Nicole Branton's statement: 
:"the landscapes in landscape archaeology may be as small as a single household or garden or as large as an empire", and "although resource exploitation, class, and power are frequent topics of landscape archaeology, landscape approaches are concerned with spatial, not necessarily ecological or economic, relationships. While similar to [[settlement archaeology]] and ecological archaeology, landscape approaches model places and spaces as dynamic participants in past behavior, not merely setting (affecting human action), or artifact (affected by human action)".&lt;ref name="Nicole" /&gt;

===Cultural landscape===
[[File:Inside the Batad rice terraces.jpg|thumb|The Batad rice terraces, The [[Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras]], the first site to be included in the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] cultural landscape category in 1995.&lt;ref name=not-danger&gt;{{cite news|last=Malig|first=Jojo|title=Philippine rice terraces no longer in danger|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/06/26/12/philippine-rice-terraces-no-longer-danger|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The concept of [[cultural landscapes]] can be found in the European tradition of [[landscape art|landscape painting]].&lt;ref&gt;PANNELL, S (2006) Reconciling Nature and Culture in a Global Context: Lessons form the World Heritage List. James Cook University. Cairns, Australia. Page 62&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 16th century onwards, many European artists painted landscapes in favor of people, diminishing the people in their paintings to figures subsumed within broader, regionally specific landscapes.&lt;ref name="GIBS1989"&gt;GIBSON, W.S (1989) Mirror of the Earth: The World Landscape in Sixteenth-Century Flemish Painting.  Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographer [[Otto Schlüter]] is credited with having first formally used  "cultural landscape" as an academic term in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Schlüter argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) this would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ELKINS, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. ENTRIKEN, J. Nicholas &amp; BRUNN, Stanley D (Eds) Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC. Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;  He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (transl. original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (transl. 'cultural landscape') a landscape created by human culture. The major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.''

It was [[Carl O. Sauer]], a [[human geography|human geographer]], who was probably the most influential in promoting and developing the idea of cultural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York. Page 321-324.&lt;/ref&gt; Sauer was determined to stress the agency of culture as a force in shaping the visible features of the Earth’s surface in delimited areas. Within his definition, the physical environment retains a central significance, as the medium with and through which human cultures act.&lt;ref name ="SAUE1925"&gt;SAUER, C (1925) ''The Morphology of Landscape''. University of California Publications in Geography. Number 22. Pages 19-53&lt;/ref&gt;  His classic definition of a 'cultural landscape' reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultural landscape is fashioned from a [[natural landscape]] by a cultural group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape is the result.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A cultural landscape, as defined by the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Committee]], is the "cultural properties [that] represent the combined works of nature and of man."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2012) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention [http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide12-en.pdf]. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage Committee identifies three categories of cultural landscape, ranging from (i) those landscapes most deliberately 'shaped' by people, through (ii) full range of 'combined' works, to (iii) those least evidently 'shaped' by people (yet highly valued).  The three categories extracted from the Committee's Operational Guidelines, are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2005) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "A landscape designed and created intentionally by man";
# an "organically evolved landscape" which may be a "[[relict (geology)|relict (or fossil) landscape]]" or a "continuing landscape"; and
# an "associative cultural landscape" which may be valued because of the "religious, artistic or cultural associations of the natural element".

{{See also|Landscaping|Landscape design|Landscape architecture|Garden|Park}}
The [[Chinese garden]] is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the Imperial Family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world.  They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Baridon, ''Les Jardins - paysagistes, jardiners, poḕts''. p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, [[scholar's rock]]s, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Records of the 21st conference of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, describing Classical Chinese garden design and the gardens of Suzhou.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English landscape garden]], also called English landscape park or simply the 'English garden', is a style of parkland garden intended to look as though it might be a natural landscape, although it may be very extensively re-arranged.  It emerged in England in the early 18th century, and spread across Europe, replacing the more formal, symmetrical ''[[jardin à la française]]'' of the 17th century as the principal style for large parks and gardens in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe'', Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The English garden (and later [[French landscape garden]]) presented an idealized view of nature. It drew inspiration from paintings of landscapes by [[Claude Lorraine]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]], and from the classic [[Chinese gardens]] of the East,&lt;ref name=Boults/&gt; which had recently been described by European travellers and were realized in the Anglo-Chinese garden,&lt;ref name=Boults&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated History of Landscape Design|author=Boults, Elizabeth and Chip Sullivan|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2010|isbn=0-470-28933-3|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712 – 1778).

The English garden usually included a lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. The work of [[Capability Brown|Lancelot "Capability" Brown]] and [[Humphry Repton]] was particularly influential. By the end of the 18th century the English garden was being imitated by the French landscape garden, and as far away as St. Petersburg, Russia, in [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], the gardens of the future [[Emperor Paul]]. It also had a major influence on the form of the [[public parks]] and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Impelluso, ''Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes'', Mondatori Electra, Milan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape architecture===
[[File:Central park manhattan 2 New York photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Central Park]], [[New York City]], US, designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. ]]
[[Landscape architecture]] is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of [[botany]], [[horticulture]], the [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[geology]] and the [[earth sciences]], [[environmental psychology]], [[geography]], and [[ecology]]. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil [[infrastructure]] and the management of large [[wilderness]] areas or [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of degraded landscapes such as mines or [[landfill]]s. Landscape architects work on all types of structures and external space&amp;nbsp;– large or small, [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] and [[rural]], and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while paying attention to ecological [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].

For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and [[garden design]] for [[manor houses]], [[palace]]s and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] and at the [[Palace of Versailles]] for King [[Louis XIV of France]]. The first person to write of making a landscape was [[Joseph Addison]] in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in 1828 and was first used as a professional title by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in 1863. During the latter 19th century, the term [[landscape architect]] became used by professional people who designed landscapes. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] used the term 'landscape architecture' as a profession for the first time when designing [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], US. Here the combination of traditional landscape gardening and the emerging field of city planning gave landscape architecture its unique focus. This use of the term landscape architect became established after [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and others founded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) in 1899.

===Landscape and literature===

====The earliest landscape literature====
[[File:Damarri001.jpg|thumb|The [[Djabugay people|Djabugay]] language group's mythical being, ''Damarri'', transformed into a mountain range, is seen lying on his back above the [[Barron Gorge National Park|Barron River Gorge]], looking upwards to the skies, within north-east Australia's wet tropical forested landscape]]
Possibly the earliest landscape literature is found in [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|Australian aboriginal myths]]  (also known as [[Dreamtime]] or Dreaming stories, [[songlines]], or Aboriginal [[oral literature]]), the stories [[ritual|traditionally performed]] by [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C.

In the [[Western culture|West]] [[pastoral]] poetry represent the earliest form of landscape literature, though this literary genre presents an idealized landscape peopled by shepherds and shepherdesses, and creates "an image of a peaceful uncorrupted existence; a kind of [[fall of man|prelapsarian]] world".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, P. 644.&lt;/ref&gt; The pastoral has its origins in the works of the Greek poet [[Theocritus]] (c. 316 - c. 260 BC). The [[Romanticism|Romantic period]] poet [[William Wordsworth]] created a modern, more realistic form of pastoral with ''[[Michael (poem)|Michael, A Pastoral Poem]]'' (1800).&lt;ref&gt;Peter V. Marinetti, ''Pastoral''. London: Methuen, 1971, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early form of landscape poetry, [[Shanshui poetry]], developed in China during the third and fourth centuries A.D.&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"&gt;Yip, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

====Topographical poetry====
[[Topographical poetry]]  is a [[genre]] of poetry that describes, and often praises, a landscape or place. [[John Denham (poet)|John Denham]]'s 1642 poem "Cooper's Hill" established the genre, which peaked in popularity in 18th-century England. Examples of [[Topography|topographical]] verse date, however, to the [[Late Classical]] period, and can be found throughout the [[Medieval]] era and during the [[Renaissance]]. Though the earliest examples come mostly from continental Europe, the topographical poetry in the tradition originating with Denham concerns itself with the classics, and many of the various types of topographical verse, such as river, ruin, or hilltop poems were established by the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Aubin, Robert Arnold. ''Topographical Poetry in XVIII-Century England''. New York: The Modern Language Association of America, 1936, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Pope]]'s "Windsor Forest" (1713) and [[John Dyer]]'s "[[Grongar Hill]]' (1762) are two other familiar examples. [[George Crabbe]], the [[Suffolk]] regional poet, also wrote topographical poems, as did  [[William Wordsworth]], of which ''[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]]'' is an obvious example.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Cuddon, ''Dictionary of Literary Terms''. London: Penguin, 1999, p. 922&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Matthew Arnold]]'s "[[The Scholar Gipsy]]" (1853) praises the [[Oxfordshire]] countryside, and [[W. H. Auden]]'s "[[In Praise of Limestone]]" (1948) uses a [[limestone]] landscape as an allegory.&lt;ref name="France"&gt;{{cite journal|author=France, Alan W.|title=Gothic North and the Mezzogiorno in Auden's 'In Praise of Limestone'|journal=[[Renascence (journal)|Renascence]]|volume=42|issue=3|year=1990|pages=141–148|doi=10.5840/renascence199042319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subgenres of topographical poetry include the [[country house poems|country house poem]], written in 17th-century England to compliment a wealthy patron, and the [[prospect poem]], describing the view from a distance or a temporal view into the future, with the sense of opportunity or expectation.  When understood broadly as landscape poetry and when assessed from its establishment to the present, topographical poetry can take on many formal situations and types of places. Kenneth Baker, in his "Introduction to ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry'', identifies 37 varieties and compiles poems from the 16th through the 20th centuries—from [[Edmund Spenser]] to [[Sylvia Plath]]—correspondent to each type, from "Walks and Surveys," to "Mountains, Hills, and the View from Above," to "Violation of Nature and the Landscape," to "Spirits and Ghosts."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Kenneth, ed. ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry.'' New York: Faber and Faber, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common aesthetic registers of which topographical poetry makes use include [[pastoral]] imagery, the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], and the [[picturesque]], which include images of rivers, ruins, moonlight, birdsong, and clouds, peasants, mountains, caves, and waterscapes.

Though describing a landscape or scenery, topographical poetry often, at least implicitly, addresses a political issue or the meaning of [[nationalism|nationality]] in some way.  The description of the landscape therefore becomes a poetic vehicle for a political message.  For example, in John Denham's "Cooper's Hill," the speaker discusses the merits of the recently executed [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref&gt;John Denham, "Cooper's Hill", (ll.111-119)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Vision on Mount [[Snowdon]]'''

…………………………...and on the shore
I found myself of a huge sea of mist,
Which meek and silent rested at my feet.
A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved
All over this still ocean, and beyond,
Far, far beyond, the vapours shot themselves
In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes, Into the sea, the real sea, that seemed
To dwindle and give up its majesty,
Usurped upon as far as sight could reach.

&lt;/poem&gt;|source =from ''[[The Prelude]]'' (1805), Book 13, lines 41-51.&lt;br&gt;by [[William Wordsworth]]
}}
One important aspect of British [[Romantic poetry|Romanticism]]&amp;nbsp;– evident in painting and literature as well as in politics and philosophy&amp;nbsp;– was a change in the way people perceived and valued the landscape. In particular, after [[William Gilpin (priest)|William Gilpin]]'s ''Observations on the River Wye'' was published in 1770, the idea of the [[picturesque]] began to influence artists and viewers. Gilpin advocated approaching the landscape "by the rules of picturesque beauty,"&lt;ref&gt;Gilpin, William, quoted in Baker, Kenneth, ed. ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry.'' New York: Faber and Faber, 2000, p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasized contrast and variety. [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1757) was also an influential text, as was [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]' ''On the Sublime'' (early A.D., Greece), which was translated into English from the French in 1739. From the 18th century, a taste for the sublime in the natural landscape emerged alongside the idea of the sublime in language; that is elevated rhetoric or speech.&lt;ref&gt;In the late 17th century in England, [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]] brought attention to Longinus' argument for the emotive power of figurative language in poetry.&lt;/ref&gt; A topographical poem that influenced the Romantics, was [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]'s ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'' (1726–30).&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, Tim. ''Landscape, LIberty, and Authority: Poetry, Criticism, and Politics from Thomson to Wordsworth.''  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996., p.21'&lt;/ref&gt;
The changing landscape, brought about by the [[Industrial revolution|industrial]] and [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]]s, with the expansion of the city and depopulation of the countryside, was another influences on the growth of the [[Romantic movement]] in Britain. The poor condition of workers, the new class conflicts, and the pollution of the environment all led to a reaction against urbanism and industrialisation and a new emphasis on the beauty and value of [[nature]] and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. "Romanticism". Retrieved 30 January 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Britannica.com. Retrieved 24 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], as well a reaction against the scientific [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Casey, (October 30, 2008). ""Grecian Grandeurs and the Rude Wasting of Old Time": Britain, the Elgin Marbles, and Post-Revolutionary Hellenism". ''Foundations''. Volume III, Number 1. Retrieved 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[William Wordsworth]] was a major contributor to the literature of landscape,&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Drabble, ''A Writer's Britain'' (originally subtitled "Landscape in literature", 1979).  New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; as was his contemporary poet and novelist [[Walter Scott]]. Scott's influence was felt throughout Europe, as well as on major [[Victorian novel]]ists in Britain, such as [[Emily Bronte]], [[Mrs Gaskell]], [[George Eliot]], and [[Thomas Hardy]], as well as [[John Cowper Powys]] in the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottsabbotsford.co.uk/history/ |title=Walter Scott was the foremost literary figure of his days |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drabble,, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Drabble]] in ''A Writer's Britain'' suggests that Thomas Hardy "is perhaps the greatest writer of rural life and landscape" in English.&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
Among European writers influenced by Scott were Frenchmen [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]] and Italian [[Alessandro Manzoni]].&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p. 166; [http://www.france.fr/en/literature-and-french-language/alexandre-dumas-1802-1870.html/ "Alexandre Dumas": The official French site]&lt;/ref&gt; Manzoni's famous novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' was inspired by [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;From Georg Lukàcs, "The Historical Novel" (1969): "In Italy Scott found a successor who, though in a single, isolated work, nevertheless broadened his tendencies with superb originality, in some respect surpassing him. We refer, of course, to Manzoni's ''I Promessi Sposi'' (The Betrothed). Scott himself recognized Manzoni's greatness. When in Milan Manzoni told him that he was his pupil, Scott replied that in that case Manzoni's was his best work. It is, however, very characteristic that while Scott was able to write a profusion of novels about English and Scottish society, Manzoni confined himself to this single masterpiece."&lt;/ref&gt;

====North America====
Also influenced by Romanticism's approach to landscape was the American novelist [[Fenimore Cooper]], who was admired by [[Victor Hugo]] and Balzac and characterized as the "American [[Walter Scott|Scott]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Phillips|Phillips, 1913]], p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

====China====
Landscape in [[Chinese poetry]] has often been closely tied to Chinese landscape painting, which developed much earlier than in the West. Many poems evoke specific paintings, and some are written in more empty areas of the scroll itself. Many painters also wrote poetry, especially in the [[scholar-official]] or literati tradition.  Landscape images were present in the early ''[[Shijing]]'' and the ''[[Chuci]]'', but in later poetry the emphasis changed, as in painting]] to the ''[[Shan shui]]'' ({{zh|山水}} lit. "mountain-water") style featuring wild mountains, rivers and lakes, rather than landscape as a setting for a human presence.&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"/&gt;  [[Shanshui poetry]] {{CJKV|t=山水詩|s=山水诗}} developed in China during the third and fourth centuries AD&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"&gt;Yip, 130&lt;/ref&gt; and left most of the varied landscapes of China largely unrepresented. ''Shan shui'' painting and poetry shows imaginary landscapes, though with features typical of some parts of South China; they remain popular to the present day.

[[Fields and Gardens poetry]] ({{zh|t=田園詩|s=田园诗|p=tiányuán shī|w=t'ien-yuan-shih|l=fields and gardens poetry}}), in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]]) was a contrasting poetic movement which lasted for centuries, with a focused on the nature found in gardens, in backyards, and in the cultivated countryside. Fields and Gardens poetry is one of many [[Classical Chinese poetry genres]].  One of the main practitioners of the Fields and Gardens poetry genre was Tao Yuanming (also known as [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] (365–427), among other names or versions of names).&lt;ref&gt;Yip, 163-169&lt;/ref&gt; Tao Yuanming has been regarded as the first great poet associated with the Fields and Gardens poetry genre.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

====Landscape photography====

Many landscape photographs show little or no human activity and are created in the pursuit of a pure, unsullied depiction of [[nature]]&lt;ref name="Photography: A Cultural History 136"&gt;Mary Warner Marien (2006). ''Photography: A Cultural History''. Laurence King Publishing. Page 136.&lt;/ref&gt; devoid of human influence, instead featuring subjects such as strongly defined landforms, weather, and ambient light. As with most forms of art, the definition of a landscape photograph is broad, and may include urban settings, industrial areas, and [[nature photography]]. Notable landscape photographers include [[Ansel Adams]], [[Galen Rowell]], [[Edward Weston]], [[Ben Heine]], Mark Gray and [[Judges Postcards|Fred Judge]].

====Landscape painting====
{{Main article|Landscape painting|Aerial landscape art}}
[[File:Salomon van Ruisdael Deventer.jpg|left|thumb|[[Salomon van Ruisdael]], "View of Deventer" (1657). ]]
The earliest forms of art around the world depict little that could really be called [[Landscape painting|landscape]], although ground-lines and sometimes indications of mountains, trees or other natural features are included. The earliest "pure landscapes" with no human figures are [[fresco]]s from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Greece]] of around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 53. The only very complete example is now in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hunting scenes, especially those set in the enclosed vista of the reed beds of the [[Nile Delta]] from Ancient Egypt, can give a strong sense of place, but the emphasis is on individual plant forms and human and animal figures rather than the overall landscape setting. For a coherent depiction of a whole landscape, some rough system of perspective, or scaling for distance, is needed, and this seems from literary evidence to have first been developed in [[Ancient Greece]] in the [[Hellenistic]] period, although no large-scale examples survive. More [[Ancient Roman art|ancient Roman]] landscapes survive, from the 1st century BCE onwards, especially frescos of landscapes decorating rooms that have been preserved at archaeological sites of [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]] and elsewhere, and [[mosaic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese [[Ink and wash painting|ink painting]] tradition of [[shan shui]] ("mountain-water"), or "pure" landscape, in which the only sign of human life is usually a sage, or a glimpse of his hut, uses sophisticated landscape backgrounds to figure subjects, and landscape art of this period retains a classic and much-imitated status within the Chinese tradition.

Both the Roman and Chinese traditions typically show grand panoramas of imaginary landscapes, generally backed with a range of spectacular mountains – in China often with waterfalls and in Rome often including sea, lakes or rivers. These were frequently used to bridge the gap between a foreground scene with figures and a distant panoramic vista, a persistent problem for landscape artists.

A major contrast between landscape painting in the West and East Asia has been that while in the West until the 19th century it occupied a low position in the accepted [[hierarchy of genres]], in East Asia the classic Chinese mountain-water ink painting was traditionally the most prestigious form of visual art. However, in the West, history painting came to require an extensive landscape background where appropriate, so the theory did not entirely work against the development of landscape painting – for several centuries landscapes were regularly promoted to the status of history painting by the addition of small figures to make a narrative scene, typically religious or mythological.

[[Dutch Golden Age painting]] of the 17th century saw the dramatic growth of landscape painting, in which many artists specialized, and the development of extremely subtle realist techniques for depicting light and weather. The popularity of landscapes in the [[Netherlands]] was in part a reflection of the virtual disappearance of religious painting in a [[Calvinist]] society, and the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe combined with [[Romanticism]] to give landscapes a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century art than they had assumed before.

In England, landscapes had initially been mostly backgrounds to portraits, typically suggesting the parks or estates of a landowner, though mostly painted in London by an artist who had never visited the site. the English tradition was founded by [[Anthony van Dyck]] and other, mostly [[Flemish people|Flemish]], artists working in England. By the beginning of the 19th century the English artists with the highest modern reputations were mostly dedicated landscapists, showing the wide range of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] interpretations of the English landscape found in the works of [[John Constable]], [[J.M.W. Turner]] and [[Samuel Palmer]]. However all these had difficulty establishing themselves in the contemporary art market, which still preferred history paintings and portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74-75, 85-87&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Cole]] "The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State", US, 1836. ]]

In Europe, as [[John Ruskin]] said,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Modern Painters]]'', volume three, "Of the novelty of landscape".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] confirmed, landscape painting was the "chief artistic creation of the nineteenth century", and "the dominant art", with the result that in the following period people were "apt to assume that the appreciation of natural beauty and the painting of landscape is a normal and enduring part of our spiritual activity"&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romantic movement intensified the existing interest in landscape art, and remote and wild landscapes, which had been one recurring element in earlier landscape art, now became more prominent.  The German [[Caspar David Friedrich]] had a distinctive style, influenced by his [[Art of Denmark|Danish training]]. To this he added a quasi-mystical Romanticism. French painters were slower to develop landscape painting, but from about the 1830s [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and other painters in the [[Barbizon School]] established a French landscape tradition that would become the most influential in Europe for a century, with the [[Impressionist]]s and [[Post-Impressionist]]s for the first time making landscape painting the main source of general stylistic innovation across all types of painting.

In the [[United States]], the [[Hudson River School]], prominent in the middle to late 19th century, is probably the best-known native development in landscape art. These painters created works of mammoth scale that attempted to capture the epic scope of the landscapes that inspired them. The work of [[Thomas Cole]], the school's generally acknowledged founder, has much in common with the philosophical ideals of European landscape paintings — a kind of secular faith in the spiritual benefits to be gained from the contemplation of natural beauty. Some of the later Hudson River School artists, such as [[Albert Bierstadt]], created less comforting works that placed a greater emphasis (with a great deal of Romantic exaggeration) on the raw, even terrifying power of nature. The best examples of Canadian landscape art can be found in the works of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], prominent in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;"Landscapes" in [http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=Landscape&amp;PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454 Virtual Vault], an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Carr]] was also closely associated with the Group of Seven, though was never an official member. Although certainly less dominant in the period after World War I, many significant artists still painted landscapes in the wide variety of styles exemplified by [[Neil Welliver]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Milton Avery]], [[Peter Doig]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[David Hockney]] and [[Sidney Nolan]].

The term [[neo-romanticism]] is applied in British art history, to a loosely affiliated school of landscape painting that emerged around 1930 and continued until the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;It was first labeled in March 1942 by the critic [[Raymond Mortimer]] in the ''New Statesman''.&lt;/ref&gt; These painters looked back to 19th-century artists such as [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]], but were also influenced by French cubist and post-cubist artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[André Masson]], and [[Pavel Tchelitchew]] ({{harvnb|Clark and Clarke|2001}}; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2001}}). This movement was motivated in part as a response to the threat of invasion during World War II. Artists particularly associated with the initiation of this movement included [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Ivon Hitchens]], and especially [[Graham Sutherland]]. A younger generation included [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], [[Michael Ayrton]], [[John Craxton]], [[Keith Vaughan]], [[Robert Colquhoun]], and [[Robert MacBryde]] {{harv|Button|1996}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3961">'''Light dues''' are the charges levied on ships for the maintenance of [[lighthouse]]s and other [[navigation aid|aids to navigation]].

==British Isles==
Light dues are levied on commercial vessels and larger pleasure boats calling at ports in the [[British Isles]] and paid into the '''General Lighthouse Fund''' (GLF), which is under the stewardship of the UK's [[Department for Transport]] and is used to finance the lighthouse services provided by the three [[General Lighthouse Authority|General Lighthouse Authorities]] that cover all of the British Isles:
* [[Trinity House]] for England, Wales, Gibraltar and the Channel Islands
* [[Northern Lighthouse Board]] for Scotland and the Isle of Man
* [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]] for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland

The main principles of the light dues system are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/th/about/funding.html |title=Funding |publisher=Trinity House |date= |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The UK [[Department for Transport]] sets the level of light dues in the UK, which is reviewed annually, taking advice from the General Lighthouse Authorities and representatives of the shipping industry. The Irish [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport]] sets the level of light dues in the Republic of Ireland.
* In most cases, the rate charged is based on the net registered tonnage of the vessel. The current UK rate (from 1 May 2017) is 37.5 pence per net registered ton, with a maximum charge of £15,000 per voyage (equivalent to 40,000 tons); in Ireland it is 60 cent, with a maximum charge of 24,000Euro.
* A vessel pays light dues when it first calls at a port in the UK or Ireland; thereafter it is exempt from further payments for one month. Each vessel is charged for a maximum of nine voyages per annum.
* Vessels calling in the UK and Republic of Ireland are required to pay the rate applicable at the port where they are first liable to pay light dues. The nine voyage cap applies regardless of whether the port calls are in the UK or Ireland.
* Tugs and fishing vessels (of 10metres in length or more) make an annual payment based on the registered length of the vessel. Pleasure boats (of 20tons or more) make a monthly payment up to an annual maximum.

Increasing automation of aids to navigation in the British Isles has seen the rate of Light Dues fall in real terms over recent years. The first increase in the Light Dues rate for twenty years occurred in 2009. In 2010, with the rate at 41p, the UK Government announced that there would be no further increases for at least the next three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20101208 |title=Government support for the maritime industry and light dues update |publisher=Department for Transport |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate was then cut by one penny in each of 2014, 2015 and 2016, with a further half penny in 2017 to reach its current level of 37.5p.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/light-dues-2017-to-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, the UK Government announced it had reached agreement with the Irish Government that aids to navigation off the coast of the Republic of Ireland would be wholly funded from domestic sources there by 2015-16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110118 |title=UK and Irish Ministers agree reform for funding of Irish Lights |publisher=Department for Transport |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to the way light dues payments are enforced in the UK and Ireland were implemented from 1 April 2015 to give effect to this agreement. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/commissioners-of-irish-lights |title=Commissioners of Irish Lights |publisher=Department for Transport |date=2014-10-16 |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of countries by southernmost point''' on land.  Where borders are contested, the southernmost point under the control of a nation is listed, excluding points within [[Antarctica]] and its outlying islands south of 60°S.  A selection of dependent territories is listed, but not ranked.

The [[Solomon Islands]] currently exercises [[de facto]] sovereignty over Sikaiana, but the natives have claimed that it is legally a territory of the United States as the successor of the Kingdom of Hawaii.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36870">'''Major explorations''' of [[Earth]] continued '''after the [[Age of Discovery]]'''. By the early seventeenth century, vessels were sufficiently well built and their navigators competent enough to travel to virtually anywhere on the planet by sea. In the 17th century Dutch explorers such as [[Willem Janszoon|Willem Jansz]] and [[Abel Tasman]] explored the coasts of [[Australia]]. Spanish expeditions from Peru explored the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] and discovered archipelagos such as [[Vanuatu]] and the [[Pitcairn Islands]]. [[Luis Vaez de Torres]] chartered the coasts of [[New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]], and discovered the [[Torres Strait|strait]] that bears his name. European naval exploration mapped the western and northern coasts of Australia, but the east coast had to wait for over a century. Eighteenth century British explorer [[James Cook]] mapped much of [[Polynesia]] and traveled as far as [[Alaska]]. In the later 18th century the Pacific became a focus of renewed interest, with [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|Spanish expeditions]], followed by Northern European ones, reaching the coasts of northern British Columbia and Alaska.

Voyages into the continents took longer. The centers of [[the Americas]] had been reached by the mid-16th century, although there were unexplored areas until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Outback|Australia]]'s and [[Exploration of Africa|Africa]]'s deep interiors were not explored by Europeans until the mid- to late 19th and early 20th centuries, due to a lack of trade potential, and to serious problems with contagious [[tropical disease]]s in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]'s case. Finally, [[Antarctica]]'s interior [[History of Antarctica#Exploration|was explored]], with [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]]s reached in the 20th century.

==James Cook's Pacific Ocean exploration (1768–1779)==
[[File:Cook Three Voyages 59.png|thumb|350px|The routes of Captain James Cook's voyages. The first voyage is shown in '''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;''', second voyage in '''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;''', and third voyage in '''&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;'''. The route of Cook's crew following his death is shown as a dashed blue line.]]

British explorer [[James Cook]], who had been the first to map the North Atlantic [[Newfoundland (island)|island of Newfoundland]], spent a dozen years in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. He made great contributions to European knowledge of the area, and his more accurate [[nautical chart|navigational charting]] of large areas of the ocean was a major achievement.

Cook made three voyages to the Pacific, including the first European contact with the eastern coastline of [[Australia]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands]] (although [[oral tradition]] seems to point towards a far earlier Spanish expedition having achieved the latter), as well as the first recorded [[circumnavigation]] of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cook, James |volume=7 |pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook was the first European to have extensive contact with various people of the Pacific. He correctly concluded there was a relationship among all the people in the Pacific, despite their being separated by thousands of miles of ocean (see [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]]). In New Zealand the coming of Cook is often used to signify the onset of colonization.&lt;ref name="collingridge"&gt;per Collingridge (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="horwitz"&gt;per Horwitz (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; He also theorised that Polynesians originated from Asia, which was later proved to be correct by scientist [[Bryan Sykes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sykes|first=Bryan|title=[[The Seven Daughters of Eve]]|publisher=Norton Publishing: New York City, NY and London, England|isbn=0-393-02018-5|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook was accompanied by many scientists, whose observations and discoveries added to the importance of the voyages. Two botanists went on the first voyage, Englishman [[Joseph Banks]] and Swedish [[Daniel Solander]], between them collecting over 3,000 plant species. Banks became one of the strongest promoters of the settlement of Australia by the British, based on his own personal observations. Cook was also accompanied by artists. [[Sydney Parkinson]] completed 264 drawings before his death near the end of the first voyage; these were of immense scientific value to British botanists.&lt;ref name="collingridge" /&gt; Cook's second expedition included the artist [[William Hodges]], who produced notable [[Landscape art|landscape painting]]s of [[Tahiti]], [[Easter Island]], and other locations.

===Mapping and measuring===
To create accurate maps, [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] need to be known. [[Navigator]]s had been able to work out latitude accurately for centuries by measuring the angle of the sun or a star above the horizon with an instrument such as a [[backstaff]] or [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]. Longitude was more difficult to measure accurately because it requires precise knowledge of the time difference between points on the [[Surface of the Earth|surface of the earth]]. Earth turns a full 360 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] relative to the sun each day. Thus longitude corresponds to time: 15 degrees every hour, or 1 degree every 4 minutes.

Cook gathered accurate longitude measurements during his first voyage with the help of astronomer [[Charles Green (astronomer)|Charles Green]] and by using the newly published [[The Nautical Almanac|Nautical Almanac]] tables, via the [[lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] method — measuring the [[angular distance]] from the moon to either the sun during daytime or one of eight bright stars during night-time to determine the time at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], and comparing that to his [[Time zone|local time]] determined via the altitude of the sun, moon, or stars. On his second voyage Cook used the K1 chronometer made by [[Larcum Kendall]]. It was a copy of the [[Harrison Number Four#The longitude watches|H4 clock]] made by [[John Harrison]], which proved to be the first to keep accurate time at sea when used on the ship ''Deptford's'' journey to Jamaica, 1761–1762.

== Scientific Surveys in Central America and the Pacific==

=== Alexander von Humboldt (1799–1804) ===
[[File:Map Alexander von Humboldt expedition-en.svg|400px|thumb|Alexander von Humboldt's Latin American expedition]]
Between 1799 and 1804, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] a [[German people|German]] [[natural scientist|naturalist]] and [[List of explorers|explorer]], traveled extensively in [[Latin America]], under the protection of king [[Charles IV of Spain]]. Humboldt intended to investigate how the [[List of natural phenomena|forces of nature]] interact with one another and find out about the unity of nature.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} His expedition may be regarded as having laid the foundation of the sciences of [[physical geography]] and [[meteorology]], exploring and describing for the first time in a manner generally considered to be a modern scientific point of view.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

As a consequence of his explorations, von Humboldt described many geographical features and species of life that were hitherto unknown to Europeans and his quantitative work on [[botany|botanical]] [[geography]] was foundational to the field of [[biogeography]]. By his delineation of "isothermal lines", in 1817 he devised the means of comparing the climatic conditions of various countries, and to the detection of the more complicated law governing atmospheric disturbances in higher latitudes; he discovered the decrease in intensity of Earth's [[magnetic field]] from the poles to the equator. His attentive study of the [[volcano]]es of the [[New World]], showed that they fell naturally into linear groups, presumably corresponding with vast subterranean fissures, and he demonstrated the [[igneous rock|igneous]] origin of rocks.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He was one of the first to propose that the lands bordering the [[Atlantic Ocean]] were once joined (South America and Africa in particular). The details and findings of Humboldt’s journey were published in a set of 30 volumes over 21 years, his ''Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equatorial Regions of the New Continent''. Later, his five-volume work, ''[[Cosmos: A Sketch for a Physical Description of the Universe]]'' (1845), attempted to unify the various branches of scientific knowledge.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== Darwin and the second voyage of HMS Beagle (1831–1836) ===
[[Image:Voyage of the Beagle-en.svg|thumb|400px|alt=Route from Plymouth, England, south to Cape Verde then southwest across the Atlantic to Bahia, Brazil, south to Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, the Falkland Islands, round the tip of South America then north to Valparaiso and Callao. North west to the Galapagos Islands before sailing west across the Pacific to New Zealand, Sydney, Hobart in Tasmania, and King George's Sound in Western Australia. Northwest to the Keeling Islands, southwest to Mauritius and Cape Town, then northwest to Bahia and northeast back to Plymouth.|The voyage of the ''Beagle'']]
In December 1831 a British expedition departed under captain [[Robert FitzRoy]], on board the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], with the main purpose of making a [[hydrographic survey]] of the coasts of [[South America]] using calibrated chronometers and [[Astronomy|astronomical]] observations, producing charts for naval war or commerce. The [[longitude]] of [[Rio de Janeiro]] was to be found and also made geological survey of a circular coral [[atoll]] in the [[Pacific ocean]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

FitzRoy thought of the advantages of having an expert in [[geology]] on board, and sought a [[Gentleman scientist|gentleman]] [[natural history|naturalist]] who could be his companion. The young graduate, [[Charles Darwin]], had hoped to see the tropics before becoming a [[parson]], and took this opportunity. The ''Beagle'' sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] then carried out detailed hydrographic surveys, returning via [[Tahiti]] and [[Australia]], having circumnavigated the Earth. Originally planned to last two years, the expedition lasted almost five. Darwin spent most of this time exploring on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|Neve|1989|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the voyage he decided that he could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. By the end of the expedition he had already made his name as a geologist and [[fossil]] collector, and the publication of his journal, known as [[The Voyage of the Beagle]], gave him wide renown as a writer. At [[Punta Alta]] he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that [[species]] were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].

[[File:Malay Archipelago Racquet-tailed Kingfisher.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kingfisher]] as illustrated in [[The Malay Archipelago]]. Wallace collected more than 125,000 specimens, a thousand new [[species]] to science.]]

===Alfred Russel Wallace Amazon and Malay explorations (1848–1862)===
In 1848, inspired by the chronicles of earlier traveling naturalists&lt;ref&gt;Slotten ''The Heretic in Darwin's Court'' pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt; British naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]] left for [[Brazil]] with the intention of collecting insects and other animal specimens in the [[Amazon rainforest]]. Wallace charted the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on peoples, geography, flora, and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;Raby ''Bright Paradise'' pp. 89–95.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1852, while returning to the UK, the ship's cargo caught fire and all the specimens he had collected were lost.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slotten87-88"&gt;Slotten pp. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1854 to 1862, Wallace traveled again through [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] to collect specimens for sale and study nature. He collected more than 125,000 specimens, more than a thousand of them representing [[species]] new to science.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer In Darwin's Shadow pp. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; His observations of the marked differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the [[Wallace line]], that divides [[Indonesia]] into two distinct parts: one with animals closely related to those of Australia, and one in which the species are largely of Asian origin. He became an expert on [[biogeography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist Introduction|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/chsarwin.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating the basis for the [[ecozone|zoogeographic regions]] still in use today. While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on [[natural selection]].

His interest resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity, like deforestation and [[invasive species]]. In 1878, he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion in tropical climates, like the extensive clearing of [[rainforest]] for coffee cultivation in Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]) and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 352–353.&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of his travels were published in ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'' in 1869, one of the most popular and influential journals of scientific exploration published during the 19th century.

==Interior Africa exploration==
Africa's deep interiors were not explored by Europeans until the mid to late 19th and early 20th centuries; this being due to a lack of trade potential in this region, and to serious problems with contagious [[tropical disease]]s in sub-Saharan Africa's case.

===David Livingstone (1849–1855)===
In the mid-19th century, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missions were carrying on active [[Missionary|missionary work]] on the Guinea coast, in [[South Africa]] and in Zanzibar. Missionaries in many instances became explorers and pioneers. [[David Livingstone]], a Scottish missionary, had been engaged since 1840 in work north of the [[Orange River]]. In 1849, Livingstone crossed the [[Kalahari Desert]] from south to north and reached [[Lake Ngami]]. Between 1851 and 1856, he traversed the continent from west to east, discovering the great waterways of the upper [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]]. In November 1855, Livingstone became the first European to see the famous [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]], named after [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|the Queen of the United Kingdom]]. From 1858 to 1864, the lower Zambezi, the [[Shire River]] and [[Lake Malawi|Lake Nyasa]] were explored by Livingstone. Nyasa had been first reached by the confidential slave of [[António da Silva Porto]], a Portuguese trader established at [[Bié Province|Bié]] in Angola, who crossed Africa during 1853–1856 from Benguella to the mouth of the Rovuma. A prime goal for explorers was to locate the source of the River Nile. Expeditions by Burton and Speke (1857–1858) and Speke and Grant (1863) located [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Victoria]]. It was eventually proved to be the latter from which the Nile flowed.

Explorers were also active in other parts of the continent. Southern Morocco, the Sahara and the Sudan were traversed in many directions between 1860 and 1875 by [[Georg August Schweinfurth|Georg Schweinfurth]] and [[Gustav Nachtigal]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7312/ |title = Sahara and Sudan: The Results of Six Years Travel in Africa |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1879–1889 |accessdate = 2013-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These travellers not only added considerably to geographical knowledge, but obtained invaluable information concerning the people, languages and natural history of the countries in which they sojourned. Among the discoveries of Schweinfurth was one that confirmed Greek legends of the existence beyond Egypt of a "pygmy race". But the first western discoverer of the pygmies of [[Central Africa]] was [[Paul Du Chaillu]], who found them in the Ogowe district of the west coast in 1865, five years before Schweinfurth's first meeting with them. Du Chaillu had previously, through journeys in the Gabon region between 1855 and 1859, made popular in Europe the knowledge of the existence of the gorilla, whose existence was thought to be legendary.

[[Henry Morton Stanley]], who had in 1871 succeeded in finding and rescuing Livingstone (originating the famous line "Dr. Livingstone, I presume"), started again for Zanzibar in 1874.  In one of the most memorable of all exploring expeditions in Africa, Stanley circumnavigated Victoria Nyanza and Tanganyika. Striking farther inland to the Lualaba, he followed that river down to the Atlantic Ocean—which he reached in August 1877—and proved it to be the Congo.

===Serpa Pinto, Capelo and Ivens (1877–1886)===
Portuguese [[Alexandre de Serpa Pinto|Serpa Pinto]] was the fourth explorer to cross Africa from west to east and the first to lay down a reasonably accurate route between [[Bié Province|Bié]] (in present-day [[Angola]]) and Lealui. In 1877, [[Alexandre de Serpa Pinto|Serpa Pinto]] and Portuguese naval captains [[Hermenegildo Capelo|Capelo]] and [[Roberto Ivens|Ivens]] explored the southern African interior starting from [[Benguela]]. Capello and Ivens turning northward whilst Serpa Pinto continued eastward. He crossed the [[Cuando River|Cuando (Kwando)]] river in June 1878 and in August reached [[Lealui]], the [[Lozi people|Barotse]] capital on the Zambezi.

From 1884 to 1886 [[Hermenegildo Capelo]] and [[Roberto Ivens]] crossed [[Southern Africa]] between [[Portuguese West Africa|Angola]] and [[Portuguese East Africa|Mozambique]] to map the unknown territory of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]].  The choice of two marine officials for this achievement certainly appealed to the principles of maritime [[navigation]]. Between 1884 and 1885, Capelo and Ivens explored Africa interior, first between the coastline and [[Huíla Province|Huila]] plain and later through the interior of [[Quelimane]] in [[Mozambique]], continuing their hydrographic studies, updating registers, but also taking notes on the ethnographic and the linguistic characters they encountered. They established thus the so desired land route between the coasts of Angola and Mozambique, exploring vast regions of the interior located between these two territories. Their achievements were recorded in a two volume book titled: ''De Angola à Contra-Costa'' (''From Angola to the Other Coast'').

== Exploring the Arctic and Antarctic ==
Arctic and Antarctic seas were not explored until the 19th century.  Once the [[North Pole]] had been reached in 1909, several expeditions attempted to reach the [[South Pole]]. Many resulted in injury and death. The [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Roald Amundsen]] finally reached the Pole in December 1911, following a dramatic race with the [[English people|Englishman]] [[Robert Falcon Scott]].

===The Northwest Passage===
{{main|Northwest Passage}}
[[File:northwest passage.jpg|thumb|300px|Northwest Passage routes]]
The ''Northwest Passage'' is a sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Interest kindled in 1564 after [[Jacques Cartier]]'s discovery of the mouth of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], [[Martin Frobisher]] had formed a resolution to undertake the challenge of forging a trade route from England westward to India. In 1576 - 1578, he took three trips to what is now the Canadian Arctic in order to find the passage. [[Frobisher Bay]], which he discovered, is named after him. On August 8, 1585, under the employ of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] the English explorer [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] entered [[Cumberland Sound]], [[Baffin Island]]. Davis rounded Greenland before dividing his four ships into separate expeditions to search for a passage westward. Though he was unable to pass through the icy [[Arctic]] waters, he reported to his sponsors that the passage they sought is "a matter nothing doubtfull {{sic}},"{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and secured support for two additional expeditions, reaching as far as [[Hudson Bay]]. Though England's efforts were interrupted in 1587 because of [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]], Davis's favorable reports on the region and its people would inspire explorers in the coming century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the first half of the 19th century, parts of the Northwest Passage were explored separately by a number of different expeditions, including those by [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|John Ross]], [[William Edward Parry]], [[James Clark Ross]]; and overland expeditions led by [[John Franklin]], [[George Back]], [[Peter Warren Dease]], [[Thomas Simpson (explorer)|Thomas Simpson]], and [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]].  Sir [[Robert McClure]] was credited with the discovery of the Northwest Passage by sea in 1851&lt;ref name="arcticchronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/arctic/exploration.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120062816/http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/arctic/exploration.shtml |archivedate=2008-11-20 |title=ARCTIC EXPLORATION - CHRONOLOGY|accessdate=2006-10-19|publisher=Quark Expeditions|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he looked across [[McClure Strait]] from [[Banks Island]] and viewed [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. However, the strait was blocked by young ice at this point in the season, and not navigable to ships.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The only usable route, linking the entrances of [[Lancaster Sound]] and [[Dolphin and Union Strait]] was first used by John Rae in 1851. Rae used a pragmatic approach of traveling by land on foot and dogsled, and typically employed less than ten people in his exploration parties.&lt;ref name="dictbio"&gt;{{cite web |last=Richards |first=R. L. |url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=6386|title=John Rae|accessdate=2006-10-20|publisher=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northwest Passage was not completely conquered by sea until 1906, when the Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]], who had sailed just in time to escape creditors seeking to stop the expedition, completed a three-year voyage in the converted 47-ton herring boat ''[[Gjøa]]''. At the end of this trip, he walked into the city of [[Eagle, Alaska]], and sent a telegram announcing his success. His route was not commercially practical; in addition to the time taken, some of the waterways were extremely shallow.&lt;ref name="caencyclo2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/northwest-passage/ |title=Northwest Passage |accessdate=2006-10-20 |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |year=2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102171805/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0005816 |archivedate=2007-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northwest Passage, however, had been navigable in earlier centuries, too. The native peoples could navigate their kayaks through the canals, which would not have penetrable by large sail ships.&lt;ref&gt;CITATION: Dr. Aron Crowell. “Imagining Alaska in North Pacific America:  Native Peoples and their Material Culture” Oral Presentation in Imagining Anchorage Conference, Anchorage Alaska 18–20 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The North Pole (1909–1952)====
[[File:Peary_Sledge_Party_and_Flags_at_the_Pole.jpg|thumb|left|128px|[[Robert Peary]] and sledge party with flags at North Pole.  Peary has been claimed to be the first person to reach the north pole.]] 
 
While the South Pole lies on a continental [[antarctica|land mass]], the North Pole is located in the middle of the [[Arctic Ocean]] amidst waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice.

A number of expeditions set out with the intention of reaching the North Pole but did not succeed; that of British naval officer [[William Edward Parry]], in 1827, the American [[Polaris expedition]] in 1871, and Norwegian [[Fridtjof Nansen]] in 1895. American [[Frederick Cook|Frederick Albert Cook]] claimed to have reached the North Pole in 1908, but this has not been widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;See references on [[Frederick Cook]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conquest of the North Pole was for many years credited to American Navy engineer [[Robert Peary]], who claimed to have reached the Pole on April 6, 1909,&lt;ref name="arcticchronology" /&gt; accompanied by American [[Matthew Henson]] and four [[Inuit]] men named Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah. However, Peary's claim remains controversial.&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/arctic_the.jsp|title=ARCTIC, THE|accessdate=2006-10-19|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2004|work=Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caencyclo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/north-pole/|title=North Pole|accessdate=2006-10-20|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party that accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey included no one who was trained in navigation and could independently confirm his own navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole. He traveled with the aid of dogsleds and three separate support crews who turned back at successive intervals before reaching the Pole. Many modern explorers, contend that Peary could not have reached the pole on foot in the time he claimed.

The first undisputed sighting of the Pole was on May 12, 1926 by [[Norway|Norwegian]] explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] and his [[United States|American]] sponsor [[Lincoln Ellsworth]] from the [[airship]] ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]''. ''Norge'', though Norwegian owned, was designed and piloted by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Umberto Nobile]]. The flight  started from [[Svalbard]] and crossed the icecap to [[Alaska]]. Nobile, along with several scientists and crew from the ''Norge'', overflew the Pole a second time on May 24, 1928 in the airship ''[[Airship Italia|Italia]]''.  The ''Italia'' crashed on its return from the Pole, with the loss of half the crew.

[[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Joseph O. Fletcher]] and Lieutenant [[William Pershing Benedict|William P. Benedict]] finally landed a plane at the Pole on May 3, 1952, accompanied by the scientist [[Albert P. Crary]].

=== Antarctica exploration ===
{{Main|Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration|Farthest South}}
[[File:Expeditions in Antarctica before 1897.png|thumb|250px|Expeditions in Antarctica before the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]], 1897]]

Early Western theories believed that in the far south of the globe existed a vast continent, known as [[Terra Australis]]. The rounding of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and [[Cape Horn]] in the 15th and 16th centuries proved that ''Terra Australis Incognita'' ("Unknown Southern Land"), if it existed, was a continent in its own right. The basic geography of the Antarctic coastline was not understood until the mid-to-late 19th century.

It may safely be said that all the navigators who fell in with the southern ice up to 1750 did so by being driven off their course and not of set purpose. An exception may perhaps be made in favor of [[Edmond Halley]]'s voyage in [[HMS Paramour|HMS ''Paramour'']] for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic when he met the ice in [[52nd parallel south|52°&amp;nbsp;S]] in January 1700, but that latitude was his farthest south. A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer [[Pierre François Étienne Bouvet de Maisonneuve|Pierre Bouvet]] to discover the South Land described by a half legendary [[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville|sieur de Gonneyville]] resulted only in the discovery of [[Bouvet Island]] in 54°10′&amp;nbsp;S, and in the navigation of [[48th meridian west|48° of longitude]] of ice-cumbered sea nearly in [[55th parallel south|55°&amp;nbsp;S]] in 1730. In 1771, [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Trémarec|Yves Joseph Kerguelen]] sailed from [[France]] with instructions to proceed south from [[Mauritius]] in search of "a very large continent."  He lighted upon a land in [[50th parallel south|50°&amp;nbsp;S]] which he called South France, and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent.  He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land, and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed in disgust the Isle of Desolation, but in which posterity has recognized his courageous efforts by naming it [[Kerguelen Islands|Kerguelen Land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |inline=1 |title=Polar Regions |pages=961–962 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri21chisrich#page/938/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of [[Alexander Dalrymple]], a [[Hydrography|hydrographer]] who was nominated by the [[Royal Society]] to command the [[Transit of Venus]] expedition to [[Tahiti]] in 1769.  The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain [[James Cook]]. Sailing in 1772 with the ''Resolution'' and the ''Adventure'' under Captain [[Tobias Furneaux]], Cook first searched in vain for [[Bouvet Island]], then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in [[58th parallel south|latitude 58°&amp;nbsp;S]], and then 30° eastward for the most part south of [[60th parallel south|60°&amp;nbsp;S]], a higher southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel.  On 17 January 1773 the [[Antarctic Circle]] was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached {{nowrap|67° 15' S}} by {{nowrap|39° 35' E}}, where their course was stopped by ice.

The first land south of the [[60th parallel south|parallel 60° south latitude]] was discovered by the Englishman [[William Smith (mariner)|William Smith]], who sighted [[Livingston Island]] on 19 February 1819.

In 1820, several expeditions claimed to have been the first to have sighted Antarctica. The first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed down to three individuals. According to various sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1997/antpanel/antpan05.pdf |title=Antarctica —past and present |author=U.S. Antarctic Program External Panel |publisher=[[National Science Foundation|NSF]] |accessdate=2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/NSF/palmer.html |title=Nathaniel Brown Palmer |first=Guy G. |last=Guthridge |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=2007-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202101525/http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/NSF/palmer.html |archivedate=2006-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arcane.ucsd.edu/pstat.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828065910/http://arcane.ucsd.edu/pstat.html |archivedate=2006-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; three men all sighted Antarctica within days or months of each other: [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|Fabian von Bellingshausen]], a captain in the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Imperial Navy]]; [[Edward Bransfield]], a captain in the [[Royal Navy|British navy]]; and [[Nathaniel Palmer]], an American sealer out of [[Stonington, Connecticut]].  It is certain that on 28 January 1820 (New Style), the expedition led by [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|Fabian von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev]] on two ships reached a point within 20 miles (40&amp;nbsp;km) of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice-fields there. On 30 January 1820, Bransfield sighted [[Trinity Peninsula]], the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland, while Palmer sighted the mainland in the area south of Trinity Peninsula in November 1820.  Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered [[Peter I Island]] and [[Alexander Island|Alexander I Island]], the first islands to be discovered south of the circle.

Only slightly more than a year later, the first landing on the Antarctic mainland was arguably by the American Captain [[John Davis (sealer)|John Davis]], a sealer, who claimed to have set foot there on 7 February 1821, though this is not accepted by all historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/resources/infosheets/19.html |title=Summary of the Peri-Antarctic Islands |first=R.K. |last=Headland |publisher=Scott Polar Research Institute |accessdate=2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2009}}

==== The South Pole (1911)====
[[File:Aan de Zuidpool - p1913-160.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Amundsen's party at the South Pole, December 1911. From left to right: [[Roald Amundsen|Amundsen]], [[Helmer Hanssen|Hanssen]], [[Sverre Hassel|Hassel]] and [[Oscar Wisting|Wisting]] (photo by fifth member [[Olav Bjaaland|Bjaaland)]]]]

After the [[North Magnetic Pole]] was located in 1831, explorers and scientists began looking for the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. [[James Clark Ross]], a British naval officer, identified its approximate location, but was unable to reach it on his trip in 1841. Commanding the British ships ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'', he braved the pack ice and approached what is now known as the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], a massive floating [[ice shelf]] over {{convert|100|ft|m}} high.  His expedition sailed eastward along the southern Antarctic coast discovering mountains which were since named after his ships: [[Mount Erebus]], the most [[Volcano|active volcano]] on Antarctica, and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]].

Once the [[North Pole]] had been reached in 1909, several expeditions attempted to reach the [[South Pole]]. Many resulted in injury and death. The [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Roald Amundsen]] reached the Pole in December 1911, following a race with the [[English people|Englishman]] [[Robert Falcon Scott]].

The first attempt to find a route to the South Pole was made by British explorer [[Robert Falcon Scott]] on the [[Discovery Expedition]] of 1901–04. Scott, accompanied by [[Ernest Shackleton]] and [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]], set out with the aim of traveling as far south as possible, and on 31 December 1902, reached {{nowrap|82°16&amp;prime; S}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LDiGTYXZ9X4C&amp;pg=PA37 ''Science into Policy: Global Lessons from Antarctica'', p. 37], Paul Arthur Berkman, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Shackleton later returned to Antarctica as leader of the [[Nimrod Expedition]] in a bid to reach the Pole. On 9 January 1909, with three companions, he reached {{nowrap|88°23&amp;prime; S}} – 112 [[Mile|statute miles]] from the Pole – before being forced to turn back.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1ql3mx8xYgC&amp;pg=PA24 ''Antarctica'', p. 24], Paul Simpson-Housley, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The first humans to reach the South Pole were [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|Roald Amundsen and his party]] on December 14, 1911. Amundsen named his camp [[Polheim]] and the entire plateau surrounding the Pole ''[[Antarctic features named after Norwegian royals|King Haakon VII Vidde]]'' in honour of King [[Haakon VII of Norway]]. Robert Falcon Scott had also returned to Antarctica with his second expedition, the [[Terra Nova Expedition]], in a race against Amundsen to the Pole. Scott and four other men reached the South Pole on January 17, 1912, thirty-four days after Amundsen. On the return trip, Scott and his four companions all died of starvation and extreme cold.

In 1914 Ernest Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] set out with the goal of crossing Antarctica via the South Pole, but his ship, the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'', was frozen in [[Sea ice|pack-ice]] and sank 11 months later. The overland journey was never made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4794">'''Navigational instruments''' refers to the instruments used by nautical navigators and pilots as tools of their trade. The purpose of navigation is to ascertain the present position and to determine the speed, direction etc. to arrive at the port or point of destination.

==Charts and drafting instruments==
*'''[[Nautical chart|Charts]]''' are maps of the areas to be navigated with details specific to the marine environment.
*'''Computing aids''': used in the necessary mathematical calculations. Today electronic [[computers]] or [[calculators]] are used.  Other traditional aids used included tables (trigonometric, logarithms, etc.) and [[slide rules]].
*'''[[Caliper#Divider caliper|Dividers]]''' used for measuring lengths of lines and approximate lengths of non-linear paths on a chart.
*'''[[Nautical almanac]]''' used to determine the position in the sky of a celestial body after a sight has been taken.
*'''[[Parallel rulers|Parallel rules]]''' used for transferring a line to a parallel position.  Also used to compare the orientation of a line to a magnetic or geographic orientation on a [[compass rose]].

==Direct measuring==
*'''[[Chip log]] and [[hourglass|sand glass]]''' serve to measure the ship's speed through the water.
*'''[[Sounding line]]''' used to measure the depth of the water and to pick up samples from the bottom.

==Position finding instruments==

===Celestial navigation instruments===

These instruments are used primarily to measure the elevation or altitude of a [[celestial object]]:

*'''[[Back staff]]''', the best known of which is the Davis' quadrant.  It could measure the altitude of the sun without having the navigator directly observe the sun.
*'''[[Cross staff]]''', an older instrument long out of use.
*'''[[Kamal (navigation)|Kamal]]''' Very simple instrument used primarily by Arabian navigators. It consists of a small board with a knotted piece of twine through the center. The observer holds one of the knots in his mouth and extends the board away so that the edges make a constant angle with his eyes.
*'''[[Mariner's astrolabe]]''' Derived from the [[astrolabe]], it was developed in late 15th century and found use in the 16th to 17th centuries.  It was replaced by the [[back staff]] and later by the [[octant (instrument)|octant]] and [[sextant]].
*'''[[Quadrant (instrument)|Quadrant]]''' A very simple instrument which used a plumb bob.

These instruments are also used to measure the angular distance between objects:

*'''[[Octant (instrument)|Octant]]''', invented in 1731.  The first widely accepted instrument that could measure an angle without being strongly affected by movement.
*'''[[Sextant]]''', derived from the octant in 1757, eventually made all previous instruments used for the same purpose obsolete.

===Bearing instruments===
*'''[[Pelorus (instrument)|Pelorus]]''' used to determine bearings relative to the ship's heading of landmarks, other ships, etc.

===Compasses===
*'''[[Bearing compass]]''' used to determine magnetic bearings of landmarks, other ships or celestial bodies.
*'''[[Magnetic compass]]''' used to determine the magnetic heading of the ship.

===Timekeeping===
*'''[[Marine chronometer]]''' used to determine time at the [[prime meridian]] with great precision which is necessary when reducing sights in celestial navigation.
*'''[[Nocturnal (instrument)|Nocturnal]]''' used to determine apparent local time by viewing the [[Polaris]] and its surrounding stars.
*'''[[Sundial#Ring dials|Ring dial]]''' or '''astronomical ring''' used to measure the height of a celestial body above the horizon. It could be used to find the altitude of the sun or determine local time.  It let sunlight shine through a small orifice on the rim of the instrument.  The point of light striking the far side of the instrument gave the altitude or tell time.

All those mentioned were the traditional instruments used until well into the second half of the 20th century.  After World War II electronic aids to navigation developed very rapidly and, to a great extent, replaced more traditional tools. Electronic speed and depth finders have totally replaced their older counterparts.  [[Radar]] has become widespread even in small boats.  Some Electronic aids to navigation like [[LORAN]] have already become obsolete themselves and have been replaced by [[GPS]].

'''[[Olfactory]] navigation''' is a hypothesis put forward to explain navigation and homing of [[pigeons]], in particular the [[homing pigeon]].

There are two principal versions. Papi’s mosaic model proposes that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental odours, within a radius of 70-100 kilometres. Wallraff’s gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation by proposing the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients. However, the evidence to suggest that pigeons use an ‘olfactory map’ in order to home is not conclusive.

==Background==
[[Homing (biology)|Homing]] can be defined as the ability to return to a set point from potentially anywhere on the earth’s surface, including destinations that are unfamiliar.  There are two criteria needed to coordinate this task, a [[compass]] sense (a sense of direction) and a [[map]] sense (a sense of location).  It is the ability to return from unfamiliar locations that posed the question of what sensory cues are used to determine locational information as well as directional information.  It has been proposed that the compass sense can be derived from a number of perspectives. [[Homing (biology)#Magnetic orientation|Magnetic orientation]] as a mechanism for directional sense was first put forward in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Von Middendorff|first=A.|year=1859|title=Die Isepiptesen Rußlands|journal=Mémoires de l'Académie impériale des sciences de St. Pétersbourg |series=Series VI |volume=8|pages=1–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viguier |first=C.|year=1882|title= Le sens de l’orientation et ses organes chez les animaux et chez l’homme|journal=Rev. phil. France Etranger|volume=14|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wil96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiltschko|first=W.|author2=Wiltschko, R.|year=1996|title=Magnetic orientation in birds |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |pages=29–38 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/199/1/29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, the sun could be used as a compass in order to navigate home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kramer | first1 = G | year = 1959 | title = Recent experiments on bird orientation | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.1959.tb02396.x | journal = Ibis | volume = 101 | issue = | pages = 399–416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, however, Papi and his contemporaries reported that [[anosmic]] pigeons (''Columbia livia'') were severely impaired in orientation and homing performance.&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt;  On the basis of their results, the hypothesis of ‘olfactory navigation’ was proposed.

==Olfactory map==
Two models for olfactory navigation have been proposed, Papi’s ‘mosaic’ model&lt;ref name=papi90&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ioalè |first=P. |author2=Nozzolini, M. |author3=Papi, F.|year=1990|title=Homing pigeons do extract directional information from olfactory stimuli|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=26|pages=301–305|doi=10.1007/bf00171094}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wallraff’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans G. Wallraff|title=Das Navigationssystem der Vögel: ein theoretischer Beitrag zur Analyse ungeklärter Orientierungsleistungen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7w1AAAAMAAJ|date=January 1974|publisher=R. Oldenbourg |location=München, Wien|isbn=978-3-486-39631-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘gradient’ model.  Papi’s mosaic hypothesis advocates that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental [[odours]], within a radius of 70-100 kilometres.&lt;ref name=good01&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodenough|first=J.|year=2001|title=Perspectives on Animal Behaviour|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this information, it is possible to derive the ‘home’ direction when encountering these odours at a release site.  An example of associated wind-borne scents would be pine forests, coastlines and pollution from cities.  It is argued that pigeons first learn to associate specific odours with particular locations during exercise and training flights.  This model has the advantage that it requires the bird only to detect the presence or absence of a range of odours.  Therefore, homing is viable only if the release sites are within a proximity that can provide reliable wind-borne cues,&lt;ref name=hudson03&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=M.|year=2003|title=What evidence is there to support pigeons (''Columbia livia'') use an ‘olfactory map’ in order to home?|publisher=Sussex University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Papi (1990),&lt;ref name=papi90/&gt; argues the utilisation of olfactory information obtained during the outward journey.

Wallraff’s gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation via different means.  It proposes the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients.  The foundation for this navigational map is a spatial representation in which two or more environmental odours have a particular intensity.  Odour gradient differs along dissimilar directional axes and, therefore, the pigeon can compare the intensity of the scent at a particular location to its concentration at the home loft.  This mechanism in principle could operate over vast distances, but would require the detection and interpretation of minute differences in odour concentration.  However, a more poignant question is the existence of predictable odour gradients.  Meteorologists&lt;ref&gt;Becker &amp; van Raden (1986). cited in {{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = R | year = 1996 | title = The Function of Olfactory Input in Pigeon Orientation: Does it Provide Navigational Information or Play Another Role? | url = | journal = J. Exp. Biol. | volume = 199 | issue = | pages = 113–119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; deny that odour gradients, as required by this hypothesis, exist in nature.

==Empirical evidence==
The olfactory navigation hypothesis states that pigeons learn an odour map by associating smells perceived at the [[Dovecote|home loft]] with the directions from which they are carried by winds.  Therefore, attempts to manipulate the development of that have involved changing the direction of wind, shielding birds from winds of a certain direction and exposing the pigeons to artificial odorants.  The predication is that the experimental pigeons should learn an altered map and thus when released, they should fly according to their distorted perception.

Such an experiment was conducted,&lt;ref&gt;Papi F, Ioalé P, Fiaschi V, Benvenuti S, Baldaccini NE (1974) Olfactory navigation of pigeons: The effect of treatment with odorous air currents. J Comp Physiol 94:187–193&lt;/ref&gt; where two groups of pigeons were reared in separate, although identical [[Aviary|aviaries]] composed of bamboo.  Group one had air blown from the south containing olive oil and air from the north containing synthetic turpentine.  This was reversed for group two.  The pigeons were then released east of the loft; half had a drop of synthetic turpentine added to the bill, while the others were given a drop of olive oil.  Pigeons from group one exposed to olive oil flew north, contrary to birds sentient to synthetic turpentine, which flew south.  Consistent, but reversed results were found in group two.

However, it is important to note that there has been a failure to replicate these results in other countries, such as Germany, Italy and the United States, even when considerable effort has been made to employ identical procedures.&lt;ref name=able96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Able|first=K.P.|year=1996|title=The debate over olfactory navigation by homing pigeons |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |pages=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, further experiments&lt;ref&gt;Baldaccini, NE, Benvenuti S, Fiaschi V, Ioale P, Papi F (1978) Investigation of pigeon homing by means of deflector cages. In: Schmidt-Koenig K, [[William Tinsley Keeton|Keeton WT]] (eds) Animal migration, navigation, and homing. Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York, pp 78–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kiepenheuer|first1=J. |year=1978 |title=Pigeon homing: A repetition of the deflector loft experiment |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=393–395 |doi=10.1007/BF00303201 |jstor=4599182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waldvogel JA 1978"&gt;Waldvogel JA, Benvenuti S, Keeton WT, Papi F (1978) Homing pigeon orientation influenced by deflected winds at home loft. J Comp Physiol 128:297–301&lt;/ref&gt; applied two different methods – namely the placement of fans near the home coop in order to reverse wind direction and usage of deflector lofts to shift the apparent direction of the wind by 90°.  Deflector lofts comprised wooden or glass baffles, which deflected wind course and therefore any signature odours.  Findings were that pigeons raised in such lofts oriented themselves with a magnitude of a 90° error, known as the ‘deflector loft effect’.  The wind reversed experiments, too, exhibited results that favoured the olfactory hypothesis, with experimentals on average flying in the opposing direction of home, while the controls took the correct flight path, when released from the same site.

In replication of the deflector loft experiments, similar findings were produced,&lt;ref name="Waldvogel JA 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kiepenheuer |first1=J.|year=1979 |title=Pigeon homing: deprivation of olfactory information does not affect the deflector effect |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=11–22 |doi=10.1007/BF00293240}}&lt;/ref&gt; though when [[anosmic]] pigeons where employed, they displayed the same degree of error in orientation as had previously been observed.  Therefore, suggesting that the detection of odours may not have been associated with the defector loft effect.  Indeed, the flight directions could simply reflect a directional response to wind experienced in the loft or by “other non-odorous factors”, such as light reflection.&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt;&lt;ref name=able96/&gt;  Researchers support these suggestions&lt;ref&gt;Bang (1971) and Wenzel (1972) cited in Baker, R.R. (1984) Bird Navigation: The Solution of a Mystery. Hodder and Stoughton Educational&lt;/ref&gt; by noting the lack of highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions in seed-eating birds such as pigeons.  It could be argued, therefore, that pigeons are not dominated by olfactory landmarks when constructing a navigatory map.

Conflicting evidence, however, was produced&lt;ref name=papi90/&gt; when pigeons were housed in open cages and exposed to a fan produced air current carrying the scent of [[benzaldehyde]].  When released with exposure only to the natural air during transport and at the release site, both experimentals and controls were homeward oriented.  Contrary if their response were simply to wind direction.

A consistent feature of the olfaction experiments is that anosmic pigeons that are released from familiar sites are essentially unaffected.&lt;ref name=able96/&gt;  Perhaps a common fault of the olfactory mosaic and gradient model of olfactory navigation is that each model is over simplistic and that they do not sufficiently take account of other cues that may be of importance.

==Other sensory cues==
The Earth’s magnetic field is a potential map cue as the field varies in both strength and direction over the Earth’s surface&lt;ref name=walcott96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walcott|first=C.|year=1996|title=Pigeon homing: observations, experiments and confusions|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manipulations of the ambient magnetic field are rather difficult, although [[William Tinsley Keeton|Keeton]] (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keeton | first1 = W. T. | year = 1971 | title = Magnets interfere with pigeon homing | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 102–106 | doi=10.1073/pnas.68.1.102 | pmid=5276278 | pmc=391171}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ioalé (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ioalé |first=P. |year=1984 |title=Magnets and pigeon orientation |journal=Monitore Zoologico Italiano |volume=18 |pages=347–358 |doi=10.1080/00269786.1984.10736466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt; did report that magnets caused disorientation in pigeons when they were released under total overcast.  This first indication for magnetic compass orientation in homing was later supported by other studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walcott | first1 = C. | last2 = Green | first2 = R. P. | year = 1974 | title = Orientation of homing pigeons altered by a change in the direction of the applied magnetic field | url = | journal = Science | volume = 184 | issue = | pages = 180–182 | doi=10.1126/science.184.4133.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Visalberghi | first1 = E. | last2 = Alleva | first2 = E. | year = 1979 | title = Magnetic influences on pigeon homing | url = | journal = Biologica Bulletino | volume = 125 | issue = | pages = 246–256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which reversed the field around the head of the pigeon using battery operated [[magnetic coil|coils]].  Though the coils had little effect in clear conditions, their effect under overcast conditions was dependent on the direction of the current.  Another observation consistent with the idea of a geomagnetic map is the shift in the initial bearings of pigeons that occurs when the field increases during magnetic storms.&lt;ref name=good01/&gt;  In [[magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] too, pigeons are disoriented, even under sunny conditions.&lt;ref name=walcott96/&gt;

The predictable 15° movement per hour of the sun from east to west, signifies its potential as a celestial compass.  This is possible providing the time of day is known and is achievable by birds due to their internal biological clock.&lt;ref name=hudson03/&gt;  Experiments to test this hypothesis, using the migratory [[European Starling|European starling]], indicated that the direction of migration could be manipulated by reflecting the angle of the sun.&lt;ref name=good01/&gt;  This effect was reproduced using homing pigeons. Although this study is of value in demonstrating mechanisms other than olfaction in bird navigation, it does not refer to pigeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt-Koenig |first=K. |year=1958 |title=Experimentelle Einflußnahme auf die 24-Stunden-Periodik bei Brieftauben und deren Auswirkung unterbesonderer Berücksichtigung des Heimfindevermögens |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |volume=15 |pages=301–331 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1958.tb00568.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inconclusive evidence==
The fundamental question of olfaction map sense in pigeons is ‘can they smell?’  Available evidence suggests that pigeons lack highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions – yet empirical evidence has shown that the homing ability of pigeons can be compromised by interfering with the olfactory environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Having the nerve to home: trigeminal magnetoreceptor versus olfactory mediation of homing in pigeons |year=2006 |first1=A. |last1=Gagliardo |first2=P. |last2=Ioale |first3=M. 
|last3=Savini |first4=J.M. |last4=Wild |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=209 |pages=2888–2892 |doi=10.1242/jeb.02313 |pmid=16857872}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the variability in the effects of olfactory manipulations indicates that odours are not the sole cues on which navigation is based and that map sense appears to rely on a comparison of available cues.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Odour may still, however, be one of many navigational factors playing a highly variable role, though physical limitations and inconsistent findings render the olfactory hypothesis questionable.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the [[British Isles]], an '''ordnance datum''' or '''OD''' is a [[Geodetic_system#Vertical_data|vertical datum]] used by an ordnance survey as the basis for deriving altitudes on [[map]]s.  A [[spot height]] may be expressed as '''AOD''' for "above ordnance datum".  Usually mean sea level (MSL) is used for the datum.  In particular:

* In Great Britain, OD for the [[Ordnance Survey]] is '''ODN''' ('''Ordnance Datum Newlyn'''), defined as the MSL at [[Newlyn]] in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921. Prior to 1921, OD was taken from the level of the [[Victoria Dock (Liverpool)|Victoria Dock, Liverpool]] ('''ODL'''). The difference between the different data varies across the country; full details are available from the Ordnance Survey website (below).
* In [[Northern Ireland]], OD for the [[Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland]] is '''Belfast Ordnance Datum''', the MSL at Clarendon Dock, [[Belfast]] between 1951 and 1956.
* In the [[Republic of Ireland]], OD for the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]] is '''Malin Ordnance Datum''': the MSL at Portmoor Pier, [[Malin Head]], [[County Donegal]], between 1960 and 1969.&lt;ref name="osi"&gt;[http://www.osi.ie/gps/overview/irishgrid.asp Irish Grid Reference System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614230048/http://www.osi.ie/gps/overview/irishgrid.asp |date=2008-06-14 }} from OSI website&lt;/ref&gt;
** Prior to 1970, '''Poolbeg Ordnance Datum''' was used: the low water of [[spring tide]] at [[Poolbeg Lighthouse]], Dublin, on 8 April 1837.  Poolbeg OD was about 2.7 metres (9 feet) lower than Malin OD.&lt;ref name="osi"/&gt;

==Tunnel datum==
'''Tunnel datum''' is a datum based on an ordnance datum and used in designing tunnels which pass below sea level.
* for the [[London Underground]], a tunnel datum of ODN -100 m is used;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/victoria-Environmental-Statement-Main-Report.pdf|title=Victoria Station Upgrade Environmental Statement: Main Report |date=2007-11-15 |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |pages=2–6; §2.5.4, fn 2 |accessdate=2008-07-28 |format=PDF}}
&lt;/ref&gt; thus a depth of &amp;minus;60m AOD is 40m ATD (above tunnel datum)
* for the [[Channel Tunnel]], a tunnel datum of ODN &amp;minus;200 m is used;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Radcliffe |first=Eric |title=Engineering the Channel Tunnel |editor=Colin J Kirkland |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1995 |chapter=Control and Construction Surveys |isbn=0-419-17920-8 |page=53 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; thus a depth of &amp;minus;60 m is 140 m ATD

== Nature of geography ==

=== Geography is  ===

* an [[academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; a body of knowledge given to − or received by − a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialize in. Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities − not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called 'the world discipline'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Bonnett|first= Alastair |title =  What is Geography?|location= London|publisher = Sage|date = 2008|isbn =9781412918688}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[fields of science|field of science]] &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are many geography-related scientific journals.
** a [[natural science]] &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of natural environment (physical geography).
** a [[social science]] &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society (human geography).
* an [[interdisciplinary field]] &amp;ndash; a field that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions have emerged. Many of the branches of physical geography are also branches of Earth science.

== Branches of geography ==

As "the bridge between the human and physical sciences," geography is divided into two main branches:
*human geography
*physical geography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf|title = Geography: The Mother of Sciences|deadurl = yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030901102227/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf|archivedate = 1 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/1b.html |title=Elements of Geography|last= Pidwirny|first= M.|date=2006|work = Fundamentals of Physical Geography|edition = 2nd |publisher=Physicalgeography.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other branches include:
*integrated geography
*geomatics
*regional geography

All the branches are further described below...

=== Physical geography ===

* [[Physical geography]] &amp;ndash; examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation &amp; life, soil, water, and landforms are produced and interact.&lt;ref name="AAG"/&gt;

==== Fields of physical geography ====

* [[Geomorphology]] &amp;ndash; study of landforms and the processes that them, and more broadly, of the processes controlling the topography of any planet. Seeks to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics, and to predict future changes through a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling.
* [[Hydrology]] &amp;ndash; study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth, including the hydrologic cycle, water resources and environmental watershed sustainability.
** [[Glaciology]] &amp;ndash; study of glaciers, or more generally ice and natural phenomena that involve ice.
** [[Oceanography]] &amp;ndash; studies a wide range of topics pertaining to oceans, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries.
* [[Biogeography]] &amp;ndash; study of the distribution of species spatially and temporally. Over areal [[ecology|ecological]] changes, it is also tied to the concepts of species and their past, or present living '[[refugium (population biology)|refugium]]', their survival locales, or their interim living sites. It aims to reveal where organisms live, and at what abundance.&lt;ref&gt;Martiny JBH et al. [http://alrlab.pdx.edu/media/HughesBiogeoNature.pdf Microbial biogeography: putting microorganisms on the map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621194350/http://alrlab.pdx.edu/media/HughesBiogeoNature.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }} ''Nature: FEBRUARY 2006 | VOLUME 4''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Climatology]] &amp;ndash; study of [[climate]], scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of [[time]].&lt;ref&gt;Climate Prediction Center. [http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/outreach/glossary.shtml#C Climate Glossary.] Retrieved on 2006-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Meteorology]] is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere that focuses on weather processes and short term forecasting (in contrast with climatology).
* [[Pedology (soil study)|Pedology]] &amp;ndash; study of soils in their natural environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://natres.psu.ac.th/Link/SoilCongress/bdd/symp45/75-t.pdf | title = Soil Preservation and the Future of Pedology | author = Ronald Amundsen |accessdate = 2006-06-08|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; that deals with [[pedogenesis]], [[soil morphology]], and [[soil classification]].
* [[Palaeogeography]] &amp;ndash; study of what the geography was in times past, most often concerning the physical landscape, but also the human or cultural environment.
* [[Coastal geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology and oceanography) and the human geography (sociology and history) of the coast. It involves an understanding of coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement and weather, and also the ways in which humans interact with the coast.
* [[Quaternary science]] &amp;ndash; focuses on the Quaternary period, which encompasses the last 2.6 million years, including the last ice age and the Holocene period.
* [[Landscape ecology]] &amp;ndash; the relationship between spatial patterns of urban development and ecological processes on a multitude of landscape scales and organizational levels.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and sustainability science. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology.

==== Approaches of physical geography ====

* [[Quantitative geography]] &amp;ndash; [[Quantitative research]] tools and methods applied to geography. See also the [[quantitative revolution]].
* [[Systems approach]] &amp;ndash;

=== Human geography ===

* [[Human geography]] &amp;ndash; one of the two main subfields of geography, it is the study of human use and understanding of the world and the processes which have affected it. Human geography broadly differs from physical geography in that it focuses on the [[built environment]] and how space is created, viewed, and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy.&lt;ref name="AAG"&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is geography? |work=AAG Career Guide: Jobs in Geography and related Geographical Sciences |publisher=Association of American Geographers |url=http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html |accessdate=October 9, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006152742/http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fields of human geography ====

* [[Cultural geography]] &amp;ndash; study of cultural products and norms and their variations across and relations to spaces and places. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant, from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2=Domosh, Mona |author3=Rowntree, Lester | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Children's geographies]] &amp;ndash; study of places and spaces of children's lives, characterized experientially, politically and ethically. Children's geographies rests on the idea that children as a social group share certain characteristics which are experientially, politically and ethically significant and which are worthy of study. The pluralisation in the title is intended to imply that children's lives will be markedly different in differing times and places and in differing circumstances such as gender, family, and class. The range of focii within children's geographies include:
*** Children and the city
*** Children and the countryside
*** Children and technology
*** Children and nature,
*** Children and globalization
*** Methodologies of researching children's worlds
*** Ethics of researching children's worlds
*** [[Otherness of childhood]]
** [[Animal geographies]] &amp;ndash; studies the spaces and places occupied by animals in human culture, because social life and space is heavily populated by animals of many differing kinds and in many differing ways (e.g. farm animals, pets, wild animals in the city). Another impetus that has influenced the development of the field are ecofeminist and other environmentalist viewpoints on nature-society relations (including questions of animal welfare and rights).
** [[Language geography]] &amp;ndash; studies the geographic distribution of language or its constituent elements. There are two principal fields of study within the geography of language:
**# Geography of languages &amp;ndash; deals with the distribution through history and space of languages,&lt;ref&gt;Delgado de Carvalho, C.M. (1962). ''The geography of languages.'' In Wagner, P.L.; Mikesell, M.W. ''Readings in cultural geography.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 75-93.&lt;/ref&gt;
**# [[Linguistic geography]] &amp;ndash; deals with regional linguistic variations within languages.&lt;ref&gt;Pei, M. (1966). ''Glossary of linguistic terminology.'' New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, P. (1974). ''Linguistic change and diffusion: description and explanation in sociolinguistic dialect geography.'' Language in Society 3:2, 215-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trud3&gt;Trudgill, P. (1983). ''On dialect: social and geographical perspectives.'' Oxford: Basil Blackwell; New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trud2&gt;Trudgill, P. (1975). ''Linguistic geography and geographical linguistics.'' Progress in Geography 7, 227-52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dict&gt;Withers, Charles W.J. [1981] (1993). Johnson, R.J. ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', Gregory, Derek; Smith, David M., Second edition, Oxford: Blackwell, 252-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Sexuality and space]] &amp;ndash; encompasses all relationships and interactions between human sexuality, space, and place, including the geographies of LGBT residence, public sex environments, sites of queer resistance, global sexualities, sex tourism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rtxg/2000/00000002/00000002/art00002|title=Constructing tourism landscapes - gender, sexuality and space|first1=Annette|last1=Pritchard|first2=Nigel J.|last2=Morgan|date=1 January 2000|journal=Tourism Geographies|volume=2|issue=2|pages=115–139|doi=10.1080/14616680050027851}}&lt;/ref&gt; the geographies of prostitution and adult entertainment, use of sexualised locations in the arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wings.buffalo.edu/epc/authors/howe/syllabi/sexuality.html|title=Syllabus Poetics: Sexuality and Space in 17th - 19th Century American Literature, University at Buffalo|author=|date=|website=buffalo.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/1/4/9/2/p14928_index.html?phpsessid=43bac9979986e74e34d2496c52ebac62|title=Space and Modern (Homo)sexuality in Tsai Ming Liang's Films by Lyn Van Swol|author=|date=|website=allacademic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sexual citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.towson.edu/dherman/sexspace/sexhome.htm|title=Sexuality and Space, Course Syllabus Towson University|author=|date=|website=towson.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Religion geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the influence of geography, i.e. place and space, on religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Park|first=Chris|title=Routledge Companion to the Study of Religion|editor=Hinnells, J|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|chapter=Religion and geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Development geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the Earth's geography with reference to the standard of living and quality of life of its human inhabitants. Measures development by looking at economic, political and social factors, and seeks to understand both the geographical causes and consequences of varying development, in part by comparing More Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs) with Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs).
* [[Economic geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities across the world. Subjects of interest include but are not limited to the location of industries, economies of agglomeration (also known as "linkages"), transportation, international trade and development, real estate, gentrification, ethnic economies, gendered economies, core-periphery theory, the economics of urban form, the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and globalization.
** [[Marketing geography]] &amp;ndash; a discipline within marketing analysis which uses geolocation (geographic information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.&lt;ref name= "qr10"&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf "Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data"], Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in any aspect of the marketing mix – the product, price, promotion, or place (geo targeting).
** [[Transportation geography]] &amp;ndash; branch of economic geography that investigates spatial interactions between people, freight and information. It studies humans and their use of vehicles or other modes of traveling as well as how markets are serviced by flows of finished goods and raw materials.
* [[Health geography]] &amp;ndash; application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of health, disease, and health care, to provide a spatial understanding of a population's health, the distribution of disease in an area, and the environment's effect on health and disease. It also deals with accessibility to health care and spatial distribution of health care providers.
** [[Time geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the temporal factor on spatial human activities within the following constraints:
# Authority - limits of accessibility to certain places or domains placed on individuals by owners or authorities
# Capability - limitations on the movement of individuals, based on their nature. For example, movement is restricted by biological factors, such as the need for food, drink, and sleep
# Coupling - restraint of an individual, anchoring him or her to a location while interacting with other individuals in order to complete a task
* [[Historical geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and "real" geographies of the past, and seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved, by understanding how a place or region changes through time, including how people have interacted with their environment and created the cultural landscape.
* [[Political geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. Basically, the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.
** [[Electoral geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the relationship between election results and the regions they affect (such as the environmental impact of voting decisions), and of the effects of regional factors upon voting behavior.
** [[Geopolitics]] &amp;ndash; analysis of geography, history and social science with reference to spatial politics and patterns at various scales, ranging from the level of the state to international.
** [[Strategic geography]] &amp;ndash; concerned with the control of, or access to, spatial areas that affect the security and prosperity of nations.
** [[Military geography]] &amp;ndash; the application of geographic tools, information, and techniques to solve military problems in peacetime or war.
* [[Population geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places.
* [[Tourism geography]] &amp;ndash; study of travel and tourism, as an industry and as a social and cultural activity, and their effect on places, including the [[environmental impact of tourism]], the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism.
* [[Urban geography]] &amp;ndash; the study of urban areas, in terms of concentration, infrastructure, economy, and environmental impacts.

* [[Qualitative geography]] &amp;ndash; [[qualitative research]] tools and methods applied to geography.

=== Integrated geography ===

* [[Integrated geography]] &amp;ndash; branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. It requires an understanding of the dynamics of geology, meteorology, hydrology, biogeography, ecology, and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment.

=== Geomatics ===

* [[Geomatics]] &amp;ndash; branch of geography and the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, or spatially referenced information. It is a widespread interdisciplinary field that includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems, photogrammetry, and related forms of earth mapping.

=== Regional geography ===

[[Regional geography]] &amp;ndash; study of world regions. Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as its natural elements, human elements, and regionalization which covers the techniques of delineating space into regions. Regional geography breaks down into the study of specific regions.

[[Region]] &amp;ndash; an area, defined by physical characteristics, human characteristics, or functional characteristics. The term is used in various ways among the different branches of geography. A region can be seen as a collection of smaller units, such as a country and its political divisions, or as one part of a larger whole, as in a country on a continent.

==== Supercontinents ====

[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|300px|Earth may have had a single supercontinent called "[[Pangaea]]"]]

[[List of supercontinents]]
A ''supercontinent'' is a [[landmass]] comprising more than one [[continent]]al core, or [[craton]].

*[[Afro-Eurasia]] ''(formed 5 million years ago)
*[[Americas]] ''(formed 15 million years ago)
*[[Eurasia]] ''(formed 60 million years ago)

==== Continents ====

[[Continent]] &amp;ndash; one of several large [[landmass]]es on [[Earth]]. They are generally identified by [[Convention (norm)|convention]] rather than any specific criteria, but seven areas are commonly regarded as continents. They are:

::''1.'' [[Africa]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of Africa|outline]]) &amp;ndash;

===== Ecozone =====

[[Ecozone]]
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) developed a system of eight biogeographic realms (ecozones):
* [[Nearctic]] 22.9 mil. km² (including most of [[North America]])
* [[Palearctic]] 54.1 mil. km² (including the bulk of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]])
* [[Afrotropic]] 22.1 mil. km² (including [[Sub-Saharan Africa]])
* [[Indomalaya]] 7.5 mil. km² (including the [[Indian subcontinent|South Asian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]])
* [[Australasia ecozone|Australasia]] 7.7 mil. km² (including [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], and neighboring islands). The northern boundary of this zone is known as the [[Wallace line]].
* [[Neotropic]] 19.0 mil. km² (including [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]])
* [[Oceania ecozone|Oceania]] 1.0 mil. km² (including [[Polynesia]], [[Fiji]] and [[Micronesia]])
* [[Antarctic ecozone|Antarctic]] 0.3 mil. km² (including [[Antarctica]]).

===== Ecoregions =====

[[Ecoregion]]
Ecozones are further divided into ecoregions. The World has over 800 [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s. ''See [[Lists of ecoregions by country]].''

==== Natural geographic features ====

Natural geographic feature &amp;ndash; an ecosystem or natural landform.

===== Ecosystems =====

[[Ecosystem]] &amp;ndash; community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system. These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. 
* {{Annotated link|Biodiversity hotspot}}
* [[Ecozone]] &amp;ndash; broadest biogeographic division of the Earth's land surface, based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms. 
** [[Ecoprovince]] &amp;ndash; biogeographic unit smaller than an ecozone that contains one or more ecoregions.

{{See also|List of landforms}}

[[Landform|Natural landform]] &amp;ndash; terrain or body of water. Landforms are topographical elements, and are defined by their surface form and location in the landscape. Landforms are categorized by traits such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratum|stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type. Some landforms are artificial, such as certain islands, but most landforms are natural.

==== Artificial geographic features ====
Artificial geographic feature &amp;ndash; a thing that was made by humans that may be indicated on a map. It may be physical and exist in the real world (like a bridge or city), or it may be abstract and exist only on maps (such as the Equator, which has a defined location, but cannot be seen where it lies).

* {{annotated link|Human settlement|Settlement}}
** {{annotated link|Hamlet (place)}} &amp;ndash; rural settlement which is too small to be considered a village. Historically, when a hamlet became large enough to justify building a church, it was then classified as a village. One example of a hamlet is a small cluster of houses surrounding a mill.
** {{annotated link|Village}} &amp;ndash; clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet with the population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand (sometimes tens of thousands).
** {{annotated link|Town}} &amp;ndash; human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size a settlement must be in order to be called a "town" varies considerably in different parts of the world, so that, for example, many American "small towns" seem to British people to be no more than villages, while many British "small towns" would qualify as cities in the United States.
*** {{annotated link|Urban hierarchy}} &amp;ndash; ranks the structure of towns within an area.
**** {{annotated link|1st-order towns}} &amp;ndash; bare minimum of essential services, such as bread and milk.
**** {{annotated link|2nd-order towns}}
**** {{annotated link|3rd-order towns}}
**** {{annotated link|4th-order towns}}
** {{annotated link|City}} &amp;ndash; relatively large and permanent settlement. In many regions, a city is distinguished from a town by attainment of designation according to law, for instance being required to obtain articles of incorporation or a royal charter.
*** {{annotated link|Financial centre}}
*** {{annotated link|Primate city}} &amp;ndash; the leading city in its country or region, disproportionately larger than any others in the urban hierarchy.
*** {{annotated link|Metropolis}} &amp;ndash; very large city or urban area which is a significant economic, political and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections and communications.
*** {{annotated link|Metropolitan area}} &amp;ndash; region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.&lt;ref&gt;Squires, G. Ed. Urban Sprawl: Causes, Consequences, &amp; Policy Responses. The Urban Institute Press (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
*** {{annotated link|Global city}} &amp;ndash; city that is deemed to be an important node in the global economic system. Globalization is largely created, facilitated and enacted in strategic geographic locales (including global cities) according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of finance and trade.
*** {{annotated link|Megalopolis (city type)|Megalopolis}} &amp;ndash; chain of roughly adjacent metropolitan areas. An example is the huge metropolitan area along the eastern seaboard of the U.S. extending from Boston, Massachusetts through New York City; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland and ending in Washington, D.C..
*** {{annotated link|Eperopolis}} &amp;ndash; theoretical "continent city". The world does not have one yet. Will Europe become the first one?
*** {{annotated link|Ecumenopolis}} &amp;ndash; theoretical "world city". Will the world ever become so urbanized as to be called this?
* Engineered construct &amp;ndash; built feature of the landscape such as a [[highway]], [[bridge]], [[airport]], [[railroad]], [[building]], [[dam]], or [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]]. See also [[construction engineering]] and [[infrastructure]].
** Artificial landforms
*** {{annotated link|Artificial dwelling hill}}

*** {{annotated link|Artificial reef}}
** {{annotated link|Airport}} &amp;ndash; place where airplanes can take off and land, including one or more runways and one or more passenger terminals.
** {{annotated link|Aqueduct (watercourse)|Aqueduct}} &amp;ndash; artificial channel that is constructed to convey water from one location to another.
** {{annotated link|Breakwater (structure)|Breakwater}} &amp;ndash; construction designed to break the force of the sea to provide calm water for boats or ships, or to prevent erosion of a coastal feature.
** {{annotated link|Bridge}} &amp;ndash; structure built to span a valley, road, body of water, or other physical obstacle such as a canyon, for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle.
** {{annotated link|Building}} &amp;ndash; closed structure with walls and a roof.
** {{annotated link|Canal}} &amp;ndash; artificial waterway, often connecting one body of water with another.
** {{annotated link|Causeway}}
** {{annotated link|Dam}} &amp;ndash; structure placed across a flowing body of water to stop the flow, usually to use the water for irrigation or to generate electricity.
*** {{annotated link|Dike (construction)|Dike}} &amp;ndash; barrier of stone or earth used to hold back water and prevent flooding.
**** {{annotated link|Levee}} &amp;ndash; artificial slope or wall to regulate water levels, usually [[Soil|earthen]] and often [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the course of a [[river]] or the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Levees and Other Raised Ground | author=Henry Petroski | publisher=American Scientist | year=2006 | volume=94 | issue=1 | pages=7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** {{annotated link|Farm}} &amp;ndash; place where agricultural activities take place, especially the growing of crops or the raising of livestock.

== Persons influential in geography ==
{{Main|Geographer|List of geographers|List of Graeco-Roman geographers}}

A [[geographer]] is a [[scientist]] who studies [[Earth]]'s physical [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[human]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Geographers are historically known for making [[map]]s, the subdiscipline of geography known as [[cartography]]. They study the physical details of the environment and also its effect on human and [[wildlife]] [[ecology|ecologies]], [[weather]] and [[climate]] patterns, [[economics]], and [[culture]]. Geographers focus on the spatial relationships between these elements.

The '''Permanent European Conference for the Study of the Rural Landscape (PECSRL)''' is an international network of [[landscape]] researchers whose interest focus on the past, present and future of European landscapes, and serves as an international platform for new initiatives, meetings and publications about European rural landscapes. It meets every two years in a different European country for lectures, discussions, working groups and landscape excursions. It has several working groups that focus on actual problems in European landscape management and landscape research. The unifying concept of PECSRL is the past, present and future of European landscapes, relating to landscape research as well as landscape policy and landscape management.

==Objectives==
The objectives of PECSRL are:
* to facilitate personal contacts and information exchange between European landscape researchers;
* to improve interdisciplinary cooperation between landscape researchers from various scientific and human landscape disciplines;
* to improve cooperation between landscape researchers and landscape managers;
* to function as a platform for new initiatives in European landscape research and landscape management.

==History and scope==
The Permanent European Conference for the Study of the Rural Landscape is one of the most stable European networks of landscape researchers. It was established in 1957 at an inaugural conference held in Nancy, France. Initially, it consisted mainly of [[Historical geography|(historical)]] [[geography|geographers]], but during the last few decades its membership has diversified to include ecologists, social scientists, rural planners, landscape architects, historians, archaeologists, landscape managers, as well as other scholars and practitioners interested in European landscapes. Members undertake both fundamental and applied research on all aspects of the rural landscape or have a position in landscape management or heritage management. PECSRL covers Pan-Europe which means that it connects researchers from Northern, Eastern, Southern, Central and Western Europe. All together more than thirty European countries take part in PECSRL.

[[File:Permeable paver demonstration.jpg|thumb|300px|Permeable paving demonstration]]
[[File:Santarem carfree.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sett (paving)|Stone]] paving in [[Santarém, Portugal]]]]
'''Permeable paving''' is a method of paving vehicle and pedestrian pathways that allows for infiltration of fluids.  In pavement design the base is the top portion of the roadway that pedestrians or vehicles come into contact with.  The media used for the base of permeable paving may be porous, to allow for fluids to flow through it, or nonporous media that are spaced so that fluid may flow in between the gaps. In addition to reducing [[surface runoff]], permeable paving can trap suspended solids therefore filtering pollutants from stormwater.&lt;ref&gt;Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute, http://www.icpi.org/sustainable&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include roads, paths, and [[parking lot]]s that are subject to light vehicular traffic, such as [[cycle-path]]s, service or emergency access lanes, road and airport shoulders, and residential [[sidewalks]] and driveways.

Although some porous paving materials appear nearly indistinguishable from nonporous materials, their environmental effects are qualitatively different.  Whether it is [[pervious concrete]], porous [[asphalt]], [[Paving stone (flooring)|paving stones]] or concrete or plastic-based pavers, all these permeable paving systems allow [[stormwater]] to percolate and infiltrate the surface areas, bypassing the traditionally [[impervious surface|impervious]] materials to the soil below. The goal is to control stormwater at the source, reduce runoff and improve water quality by filtering pollutants in the substrata layers.

== Description and applications ==
Permeable solutions can be based on: porous asphalt and concrete surfaces, concrete pavers (permeable interlocking concrete paving systems – PICP), or polymer-based grass pavers, grids and geocells. Porous pavements and concrete pavers (actually the voids in-between them) enable stormwater to drain through a stone base layer for on-site infiltration and filtering. Polymer based grass grid or cellular paver systems provide load bearing reinforcement for unpaved surfaces of gravel or turf.

Grass pavers, plastic turf reinforcing grids (PTRG), and geocells ([[cellular confinement systems]]) are honeycombed 3D grid-cellular systems, made of thin-walled [[HDPE]] plastic or other polymer alloys. These provide grass reinforcement, ground stabilization and gravel retention. The 3D structure reinforces infill and transfers vertical loads from the surface, distributing them over a wider area. Selection of the type of cellular grid depends to an extent on the surface material, traffic and loads. The cellular grids are installed on a prepared base layer of open-graded stone (higher void spacing) or engineered stone (stronger). The surface layer may be compacted gravel or topsoil seeded with grass and fertilizer. In addition to load support, the cellular grid reduces compaction of the soil to maintain permeability, while the roots improve permeability due to their root channels.&lt;ref&gt;Stormwater Management, http://www.epa.gov/oaintrnt/stormwater/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In new suburban growth, porous pavements protect [[drainage basin|watersheds]] by delaying and filtering the surge flow. In existing built-up areas and towns, redevelopment and reconstruction are opportunities to implement stormwater water management practices. Permeable paving is an important component in [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|Low Impact Development]] (LID), a process for [[land development]] in the United States that attempts to minimize impacts on [[water quality]] and the similar concept of [[sustainable drainage system]]s (SuDS) in the United Kingdom.

The [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] capacity of the native soil is a key design consideration for determining the depth of base rock for stormwater storage or for whether an underdrain system is needed.

== Advantages ==

=== Managing runoff ===

Permeable paving surfaces have been demonstrated as effective in managing [[surface runoff|runoff]] from [[Impervious Surfaces|paved surfaces]].&lt;ref&gt;Brattebo, B. O., and D. B. Booth. 2003. [http://depts.washington.edu/cwws/Research/Reports/permeableparking.pdf "Long-Term Stormwater Quantity and Quality Performance of Permeable Pavement Systems."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327123757/http://depts.washington.edu/cwws/Research/Reports/permeableparking.pdf |date=2007-03-27 }} ''[[Water Research]].'' 37: 4369–4376. {{DOI|10.1016/S0043-1354(03)00410-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. [http://www.epa.gov/owow/NPS/pavements.pdf "Field Evaluation of Permeable Pavements for Stormwater Management, Olympia, Washington."] Fact Sheet. October 2000. Document No. EPA-841-B-00-005B.&lt;/ref&gt; Large volumes of [[urban runoff]] causes serious [[erosion]] and [[silt]]ation in [[surface water]] bodies. Permeable pavers provide a solid ground surface, strong enough to take heavy loads, like large vehicles, while at the same time they allow water to filter through the surface and reach the underlying soils, mimicking natural ground absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chesapeakeecologycenter.org/?page_id=78|title=Permeable Pavers|website=www.chesapeakeecologycenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can reduce downstream flooding and stream bank erosion, and maintain base flows in rivers to keep ecosystems self-sustaining. Permeable pavers also combat erosion that occurs when grass is dry or dead, by replacing grassed areas in suburban and residential environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.belgard.com/knowledge_center/planning_materials/permeable_pavers|title=Permeable Pavers|last=Belgard|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controlling pollutants ===
Permeable paving surfaces keep the [[water pollution|pollutants]] in place in the soil or other material underlying the roadway, and allow water seepage to [[groundwater recharge]] while preventing the stream erosion problems. They capture the [[heavy metals]] that fall on them, preventing them from washing downstream and accumulating inadvertently in the environment. In the void spaces, naturally occurring [[micro-organisms]] digest car oils, leaving little but [[carbon dioxide]] and water. Rainwater infiltration is usually less than that of an impervious pavement with a separate stormwater management facility somewhere downstream. {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}.in areas where infiltration is not possible due to unsuitable soil conditions permeable pavements are used in the attenuation mode where water is retained in the pavement and slowly released to surface water systems between storm events.

=== Trees ===
Permeable pavements may give urban trees the rooting space they need to grow to full size. A "structural-soil" pavement base combines structural [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] with soil; a porous surface admits vital air and water to the rooting zone. This integrates healthy ecology and thriving cities, with the living tree canopy above, the city's traffic on the ground, and living tree roots below. The benefits of permeables on urban tree growth have not been conclusively demonstrated and many researchers have observed tree growth is not increased if construction practices compact materials before permeable pavements are installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volder|first=A|author2=Watson, Viswanathan|title=Potential use of pervious concrete for maintaining existing mature trees during and after urban development|journal=Urban For.

== Disadvantages ==

=== Runoff Volumes ===
Permeable pavements are designed to replace Effective Impervious Areas (EIAs), not to manage stormwater from other impervious surfaces on site. Use of this technique must be part of an overall on site management system for stormwater, and is not a replacement for other techniques.

During large storm event, the water table below the porous pavement can rise to a higher level, preventing the precipitation from being absorbed into the ground. Some additional water is stored in the open graded / crushed drain rock base, and remains until the subgrade can absorb the water. For clay-based soils, or other low to 'non'-draining soils, it is important to increase the depth of the crushed drain rock base to allow additional capacity for the water as it waits to be infiltrated.

The best way to prevent this problem is to understand the soil infiltration rate, and design the pavement and base depths to meet the volume of water. Or, allow for adequate rain water run off at the pavement design stage.

=== Pollutant load ===
Runoff across some land uses may become contaminated, where pollutant concentrations exceed those typically found in stormwater. These "hot spots" include commercial [[Plant nursery|plant nurseries]], [[recycling]] facilities, [[Filling station|fueling stations]], industrial storage, [[marina]]s, some outdoor [[Loading dock|loading facilities]], public works yards, hazardous materials generators (if containers are exposed to rainfall), vehicle service and maintenance areas, and vehicle and equipment washing and steam cleaning facilities. Since porous pavement is an infiltration practice, it should not be applied at stormwater hot spots due to the potential for groundwater contamination. All contaminated runoff should be prevented from entering municipal storm drain systems by using [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs) for the specific industry or activity.&lt;ref&gt;Capital Regional District. Victoria, BC. [http://www.crd.bc.ca/watersheds/regulations.htm "Regulating Stormwater Discharges."] Accessed 2010-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weight and traffic volumes ===
Reference sources differ on whether low or medium traffic volumes and weights are appropriate for porous pavements. For example, around truck loading docks and areas of high commercial traffic, porous pavement is sometimes cited as being inappropriate. However, given the variability of products available, the growing number of existing installations in North America and targeted research by both manufacturers and user agencies, the range of accepted applications seems to be expanding. Some concrete paver companies have developed products specifically for industrial applications. Working examples exist at fire halls, busy retail complex parking lots, and on public and private roads, including intersections in parts of North America with quite severe winter conditions.

=== Siting ===
Permeable pavements may not be appropriate when land surrounding or draining into the pavement exceeds a 20 percent slope, where pavement is down slope from buildings or where foundations have piped drainage at their footers. The key is to ensure that drainage from other parts of a site is intercepted and dealt with separately rather than being directed onto permeable surfaces.

=== Climate ===
Cold climates may present special challenges. Road salt contains chlorides that could migrate through the porous pavement into groundwater. Snow plow blades could catch block edges and damage surfaces. Sand cannot be used for snow and ice control on porous surfaces because it will plug the pores and reduce permeability.  Although there are design modifications to reduce the risks, infiltrating runoff may freeze below the pavement, causing frost heave. Another issue is spalling damage. Spalling damage exclusively occurs on porous concrete pavement from salt application during the winter season. Thus porous paving is suggested for warmer climates. However, other materials have proven to be effective, even lowering winter maintenance costs by preserving salt in the pavement itself. This also reduces the amount of storm water runoff that is contaminated with salt chlorides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://stormwater.wef.org/2012/01/porous-pavement-performance-in-cold-climates/|title=Porous Pavement Performance in Cold Climates - The Stormwater Report|date=2012-01-05|work=The Stormwater Report|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porous pavement designed to reduce frost heave and spalling damage has been used successfully in Norway. Furthermore, experience suggests that preventative measures with rapid drainage below porous surfaces be taken in order to increase the rate of snow melt above ground.

=== Cost ===
Some estimates put the cost of permeable paving at two to three times that of conventional asphalt paving. Using permeable paving, however, can reduce the cost of providing larger or more stormwater BMPs on site, and these savings should be factored into any cost analysis. In addition, the off-site environmental impact costs of not reducing on-site stormwater volumes and pollution have historically been ignored or assigned to other groups (local government parks, public works and environmental restoration budgets, fisheries losses, etc.) The City of [[Olympia, Washington]] is studying the use of pervious concrete quite closely and finding that new stormwater regulations are making it a viable alternative to storm water.

=== Longevity and maintenance ===
Some permeable pavements require frequent maintenance because grit or gravel can block the open pores. This is commonly done by industrial vacuums that suck up all the sediment. If maintenance is not carried out on a regular basis, the porous pavements can begin to function more like impervious surfaces. With more advanced paving systems the levels of maintenance needed can be greatly decreased, [[#Bound recycled glass porous pavement|elastomerically bound glass pavements]] requires less maintenance than regular concrete paving as the glass bound pavement has 50% more void space.

Plastic grid systems, if selected and installed correctly, are becoming more and more popular with local government maintenance personnel owing to the reduction in maintenance efforts: reduced gravel migration and weed suppression in public park settings.

Some permeable paving products are prone to damage from misuse, such as drivers who tear up patches of plastic &amp; gravel grid systems by "joy riding" on remote parking lots at night. The damage is not difficult to repair but can look unsightly in the meantime. Grass pavers require supplemental watering in the first year to establish the vegetation, otherwise they may need to be re-seeded. Regional climate also means that most grass applications will go dormant during the dry season. While brown vegetation is only a matter of aesthetics, it can influence public support for this type of permeable paving.

Traditional permeable concrete paving bricks tend to lose their color in relatively short time which can be costly to replace or clean and is mainly due to the problem of [[efflorescence]].

=== Efflorescence ===
{{Main|Efflorescence}}
Efflorescence is a hardened [[crystalline]] deposit of [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], principally [[calcium carbonate]]s, which migrate from the center of concrete or masonry materials to the surface, where they form insoluble deposits that harden on the surface.  Efflorescence usually appears white, gray or black depending on the region.

Over time, efflorescence begins to degrade the overall appearance of masonry/concrete and may cause the surfaces to become slippery when exposed to moisture. If left unchecked, this efflorescence will harden whereby the calcium/lime deposits begin to affect the integrity of the cementitious surface by slowly eroding away the cement paste and aggregate.  In some cases it will also discolor stained or coated surfaces.

Efflorescence forms more quickly in areas that are exposed to excessive amounts of moisture, such as near pool decks, spas, and fountains or where irrigation runoff is present.  The affected regions become very slick when wet. This can be of serious concern especially as a public safety issue to individuals, principals and property owners by exposing them to possible injury and increased general liability claims.

Efflorescence remover chemicals can be used to remove calcium/lime build-up without damaging the integrity of the paving surface.

== Types of Permeable Pavement ==
Installation of porous pavements is no more difficult than that of dense pavements, but has different specifications and procedures which must be strictly adhered to. Nine different families of porous paving materials present distinctive advantages and disadvantages for specific applications. Here are examples:

=== Pervious concrete ===
{{main|Pervious concrete}}
Pervious concrete is widely available, can bear frequent traffic, and is universally accessible. Pervious concrete quality depends on the installer's knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="Pervious Concrete"&gt;EPA. ''National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices.'' 2009-09-10. [http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=137&amp;minmeasure=5 "Pervious Concrete Pavement."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622224413/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=137&amp;minmeasure=5 |date=2010-06-22 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plastic Grids ===
Plastic grids allow for a 100% porous system using structural grid systems for containing and stabilizing either gravel or turf. These grids come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on use; from pathways to commercial parking lots. These systems have been used readily in Europe for over a decade, but are gaining popularity in North America due to requirements by government for many projects to meet [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] environmental building standards. Plastic grid system are also  popular with homeowners due to their lower cost to install, ease of installation, and versatility. The ideal design for this type of grid system is a closed cell system, which prevents gravel/sand/turf from migrating laterally.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} It is also known as Grass pavers / Turf Pavers in India.&lt;ref name="Plastic Grids"&gt;[http://www.grasspavers.in "Grass Pavers"] / [http://www.turfpavers.in "Turf Pavers"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Porous asphalt ===
'''Porous asphalt''' is produced and placed using the same methods as conventional [[asphalt concrete]]; it differs in that fine (small) aggregates are omitted from the asphalt mixture. The remaining large, single-sized  aggregate particles leave open voids that give the material its porosity and permeability. To ensure pavement strength, fiber may be added to the mix or a polymer-modified asphalt binder may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hansen | first1 = Kent | title = IS-131: Porous Asphalt Pavements for Stormwater Management | publisher = National Asphalt Pavement Association | year = 2008 | location = Lanham, Maryland | pages = 16 | accessdate = 2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, porous asphalt pavements are designed with a subsurface reservoir that holds water that passes through the pavement, allowing it to evaporate and/or percolate slowly into the surround soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://porouspavement.net | title = Porous Asphalt | accessdate = 2013-01-15 | author = National Asphalt Pavement Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices.'' 2009-09-10. {{cite web|title=Porous Asphalt Pavement|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=135&amp;minmeasure=5|work=Porous Asphalt Pavement|publisher=EPA|accessdate=18 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927041118/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=135&amp;minmeasure=5|archivedate=27 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Open-graded friction courses'' (OGFC) are a porous asphalt surface course used on highways to improve driving safety by removing water from the surface. Unlike a full-depth porous asphalt pavement, OGFCs do not drain water to the base of a pavement. Instead, they allow water to infiltrate the top 3/4 to 1.5 inch of the pavement and then drain out to the side of the roadway. This can improve the friction characteristics of the road and reducing road spray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Caltrans | authorlink1 = California Department of Transportation | title = Open Graded Friction Course Usage Guide | date = 8 Feb 2006 | year = 2008 | location = Sacramento, California | url = http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/Translab/ofpm/pdf/FrictionCourseGuide.pdf | accessdate = 2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Single-sized aggregate ===
'''Single-sized aggregate''' without any binder, e.g. loose gravel, stone-chippings, is another alternative. Although it can only be safely used in walkways and very low-speed, low-traffic settings, e.g. car-parks and drives, its potential cumulative area is great.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Porous turf ===
[[Image:Rasenpflasterstein 1.jpg|thumb|Grass pavement]]
'''Porous turf''', if properly constructed, can be used for occasional parking like that at churches and stadia. Plastic turf reinforcing grids can be used to support the increased load.&lt;ref name="Bean 2004"&gt;Bean, Eban Z.; Hunt, William F.; Bidelspach, David A.; Smith, Jonathan T.

=== Permeable interlocking concrete pavements ===
{{Main|interlocking concrete pavers}}
'''Permeable interlocking concrete pavements''' are concrete units with open, permeable spaces between the units.&lt;ref name="Bean 2004" /&gt;{{rp|2}} They give an architectural appearance, and can bear both light and heavy traffic, particularly interlocking concrete pavers, excepting high-volume or high-speed roads.&lt;ref&gt;''National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices.'' 2009-09-10. {{cite web|title=Permeable Interlocking Concrete Pavement|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=136&amp;minmeasure=5|work=Permeable Interlocking Concrete Pavement|publisher=EPA|accessdate=18 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915061616/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=136&amp;minmeasure=5|archivedate=15 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some products are polymer-coated and have an entirely porous face.

=== Permeable clay brick pavements ===
'''Permeable clay brick pavements''' are fired clay brick units with open, permeable spaces between the units. Clay pavers provide a durable surface that allows stormwater runoff to permeate through the joints.

=== Resin bound paving ===
{{Main|Resin bound paving}}
'''Resin bound paving''' is a mixture of resin binder and aggregate.  Clear resin is used to fully coat each aggregate particle before laying.  Enough resin is used to allow each aggregate particle to adhere to one another and to the base yet leave voids for water to permeate through.  Resin bound paving provides a strong and durable surface that is suitable for pedestrian and vehicular traffic in applications such as pathways, driveways, car parks and access roads.

=== Bound recycled glass porous pavement ===
'''Elastomerically bound recycled glass porous pavement''' consisting of bonding processed post consumer glass with a mixture of resins, pigments, granite and binding agents. Approximately 75 percent of glass in the U.S. is disposed in landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Truth unclear on recycled glass in L.I. |first=Claude |last=Solnik |newspaper=Long Island Business News |publisher=Dolan Media |location=Ronkonkoma, NY |date=2009-11-03 |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/waste-management/materials-recovery-recycling/13411628-1.html |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310085925/http://www.allbusiness.com/waste-management/materials-recovery-recycling/13411628-1.html |archivedate=2011-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2009).

The '''philosophy of environment''' is a trend of [[Freethought|free thought]] located between [[philosophy]], [[epistemology]] and [[anthropology]]. It combines various schools of philosophy such as humanist ecology, philosophy of evolution and environmental [[humanism]]. It is also meant to be a cultural trend having an influence in society.

==Environment and evolution==

The philosophical current indicated under the name philosophy of evolution has been developed since the 1970s by Humanist Ecology (also called Environmental or Evolutive Humanism) and by the [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-darwinian]] school. Its purpose is the long-term evolution of the complex [[Organism|living being]] in its universal environment, analysed through its Human cultural expression.

This trend is unique to the quasi religious Evolutionist Humanism advocated by [[Julian Huxley]], notably during the founders congress of the IHEU ([[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]) in 1952.

Further than the basic [[Theory|scientific theory]] of evolution (notably neo-[[darwinian]], Evolutive Humanism, developed by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]),  looks at the necessity for Man of a permanent adaptation of both his organism and his thoughts to his universal [[natural environment|environment]]. And from there to the relativized relation to belief and to uncertainty, because human ideas evolve and are transformed, as are physical qualities, in a universal process of [[evolution]] and adaptive improvement in their environment. But this does not suppose [[determinism]], genetic or cultural, it refers to the evolutive interactivity and reactivity, partly random, of the living being with his surroundings. According to [[Marc Carl]], "Man must necessarily learn to manage the insufficient appearance and the uncertainty of information to fit and to develop in his relational interactions with his environment, as well as physically and culturally". In a universal environment still as much as 90% unknown, this evolutive cogitation therefore tries not to be locked in premature schemata and answers. It encourages humility in proposals and intuitive boldness in investigations.
A subjacent humanist thought encourages human beings to deliberately take his destiny in his hands, in careful correlation with his environment, knowing that human thought is one of the most impacting manifestations of the living being, as an agent of transformation of the environment, and consequently not only of the Earth's environment. In terms of philosophy of evolution, the organized collective thought of humanity, and in general his evolutive culture, appears as the key to development of our [[species]] in its universal environment, and the key to a possibly significant interactive modification, in the long term, of this environment. It is principally a prospective step.

This cultural trend seems to have emerged because the concept of progressive permanent adaptation, which is no longer appreciated only by its scientific aspects, also took a metaphysical dimension (in a sense of research of the essence of the human), which consequently encourages analysis of [[human evolution]], an agent which potentially modifies our environment, in philosophical terms. The possibilities and the risks of this evolution, [[Nondeterministic algorithm|non-deterministic]] because of its integration into a dynamic complex living system, gives the human existence and destiny a new sense. And to be involved in such a cogitation opens a philosophical way in which curious minds could not miss advancing sooner or later, a way which rests on a regenerated [[metaphysics]], encouraging us to take back in an evolutive way Aristoteles original concept of physis and its substance, and to search with modern conceptual tools the essence and the sense of our life.

==Humanist ecology (environmental humanism)==

Supported by the philosophy of evolution, this international emerging concept has expressed since the 1970s an evolutive humanism, extending the naturalist tradition of ancient Greek philosophers. Humanist ecology encourages us to better understand and situate the place and the destiny of humanity in its environment in permanent evolution. Human destiny is put in perspective in a universal context where many things remain to be learned.  Because it encourages every human in a responsibility in front of his conscience, humanist ecology  can be defined too as a will of ethical responsibility of civilized humanity, favouring its permanent improvement and its happiness, in useful interaction with its evolutive environment, in a beneficial way as much for a human being particularly as for mankind in general, and in common symbiosis with their local and global bioscape in evolution. That serves to optimize [[Society|human society]] in its own interactions and in its interactions with its bioscape, notably by preserving the planetary equilibrium of the Earth. This solidarity of all of mankind is necessary to preserve its environment and its best development in this environment inspired a particular political expression of humanist ecology, taken up notably by Statesmen such as [[Jacques Chirac]] (France) or Mohammed VI (Morocco) in the main meetings of the United Nations.

==Evolution and its relativisation==

Humanist ecology naturally favours the permanent adaptation and the best possible development of humanity, and of the human being, in an uncertain universal environment in permanent evolution, with a mind open enough to consider all the possibilities. In humanist ecological comprehension, it is vain to want to freeze an arbitrary cultural schemata and choose the apparent equilibrium and the supposed future of one moment of evolution. A permanent evolutive adaptation is necessary, as much biologically as mentally. That requires relativity and a caution in the analysis. According to this concept, for the [[Mind|human mind]], any representation belongs to the domain of belief, considering the uncertainty of the relation of man to the universe, and the natural imperfection of his senses to represent his environment and his interactions with this environment; the reality perceived by Man being only one representation of reality, particular in mankind. Humanist ecology admits this relativized relation with [[belief]] but refutes any final and locking form, knowing that no truth can be final for the human mind without upsetting its natural evolutive necessity. This [[School (discipline)|school of thought]] accepts belief in the present, for want of anything better, but dictates that you must take care to verify and update beliefs.

{{short description|Any system that uses satellite radio signals to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning}}

A '''satellite navigation''' or '''satnav''' system is a system that uses [[satellite]]s to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small [[electronics|electronic]] receivers to determine their location ([[longitude]], [[latitude]], and [[altitude]]/[[elevation]]) to high precision (within a few metres) using [[time signal]]s transmitted along a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] by [[radio]] from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated.

A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a '''global navigation satellite system''' ('''GNSS'''). {{As of|2018|10}}, the [[United States]]' [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and [[Russia]]'s [[GLONASS]] are fully operational GNSSs, with [[China]]'s [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System]] (BDS) and the [[European Union]]'s [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] scheduled to be fully operational by 2020.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/china-military-news/2010-05/20/content_4222569.htm |title=Beidou satellite navigation system to cover whole world in 2020 |publisher=Eng.chinamil.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-4366_en.htm |title=Galileo goes live! |publisher=europa.eu |date=2016-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], [[France]] and [[Japan]] are in the process of developing regional navigation and augmentation systems as well.

Global coverage for each system is generally achieved by a [[satellite constellation]] of 18–30 [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO) satellites spread between several [[orbital planes]]. The actual systems vary, but use [[orbital inclination]]s of &gt;50° and [[orbital period]]s of roughly twelve hours (at an altitude of about {{convert|20000|km|mi|disp=or}}).

==Classification==
Satellite navigation systems that provide enhanced accuracy and integrity monitoring usable for civil navigation are classified as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifatca.org/system/files/public_docs/gnss.pdf |publisher=IFATCA |title=A Beginner's Guide to GNSS in Europe |format=PDF |accessdate=20 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''GNSS-1'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} is the first generation system and is the combination of existing satellite navigation systems (GPS and GLONASS), with [[Satellite Based Augmentation System]]s (SBAS) or [[Ground Based Augmentation System]]s (GBAS). In the United States, the satellite based component is the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), in Europe it is the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS), and in Japan it is the [[Multi-Functional Transport Satellite|Multi-Functional Satellite Augmentation System]] (MSAS). Ground based augmentation is provided by systems like the [[Local Area Augmentation System]] (LAAS).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
* '''GNSS-2'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} is the second generation of systems that independently provides a full civilian satellite navigation system, exemplified by the European Galileo positioning system. These systems will provide the accuracy and integrity monitoring necessary for civil navigation; including aircraft. Initially, this system consisted of only Upper L-Band frequency sets (L1 for GPS, E1 for Galileo, G1 for GLONASS). In recent years, GNSS systems have begun activating Lower L-Band frequency sets (L2 and L5 for GPS, E5a and E5b for Galileo, G3 for GLONASS) for civilian use; they feature higher aggregate accuracy and less problems with signal reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php/Galileo_General_Introduction|title=Galileo General Introduction - Navipedia|website=gssc.esa.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php/GNSS_signal|title=GNSS signal - Navipedia|website=gssc.esa.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2018, a few consumer grade GNSS devices are being sold that leverage both, and are typically called "Dual band GNSS" or "Dual band GPS" devices.
* Core Satellite navigation systems, currently GPS (United States), GLONASS (Russian Federation), Galileo (European Union) and Compass (China).

== History and theory ==
[[File:Accuracy of Navigation Systems.svg|thumb]]
Ground based [[radio navigation]] has long been practiced.  The [[Decca Navigator System|DECCA]], [[LORAN]], [[Gee (navigation)|GEE]] and [[Omega Navigation System|Omega]] systems used terrestrial [[longwave]] radio [[transmitter]]s which broadcast a radio pulse from a known "master" location, followed by a pulse repeated from a number of "slave" stations.  The delay between the reception of the master signal and the slave signals allowed the receiver to deduce the distance to each of the slaves, providing a [[fix (position)|fix]].

The first satellite navigation system was [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]], a system deployed by the US military in the 1960s. Transit's operation was based on the [[Doppler effect]]: the satellites travelled on well-known paths and broadcast their signals on a well-known [[radio frequency]].  The received frequency will differ slightly from the broadcast frequency because of the movement of the satellite with respect to the receiver. By monitoring this frequency shift over a short time interval, the receiver can determine its location to one side or the other of the satellite, and several such measurements combined with a precise knowledge of the satellite's orbit can fix a particular position. Satellite orbital position errors are induced by variations in the gravity field and radar refraction, among others. These were resolved by a team led by Harold L Jury of Pan Am Aerospace Division in Florida from 1970-1973. Using real-time data assimilation and recursive estimation, the systematic and residual errors were narrowed down to a manageable level to permit accurate navigation. &lt;ref&gt;Jury, H, 1973, Application of the Kalman Filter to Real-time Navigation using Synchronous Satellites, Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium on Space Technology and Science, Tokyo, 945-952. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Part of an orbiting satellite's broadcast included its precise orbital data. In order to ensure accuracy, the [[US Naval Observatory|US Naval Observatory (USNO)]] continuously observed the precise orbits of these satellites. As a satellite's orbit deviated, the USNO would send the updated information to the satellite. Subsequent broadcasts from an updated satellite would contain its most recent [[ephemeris]].

Modern systems are more direct.  The satellite broadcasts a signal that contains orbital data (from which the position of the satellite can be calculated) and the precise time the signal was transmitted.  The orbital [[ephemeris]] is transmitted in a data message that is superimposed on a code that serves as a timing reference. The satellite uses an [[atomic clock]] to maintain synchronization of all the satellites in the constellation. The receiver compares the time of broadcast encoded in the transmission of three (at sea level) or four different satellites, thereby measuring the time-of-flight to each satellite. Several such measurements can be made at the same time to different satellites, allowing a continual fix to be generated in real time using an adapted version of [[trilateration]]: see [[GNSS positioning calculation]] for details.

Each distance measurement, regardless of the system being used, places the receiver on a spherical shell at the measured distance from the broadcaster. By taking several such measurements and then looking for a point where they meet, a fix is generated. However, in the case of fast-moving receivers, the position of the signal moves as signals are received from several satellites. In addition, the radio signals slow slightly as they pass through the ionosphere, and this slowing varies with the receiver's angle to the satellite, because that changes the distance through the ionosphere. The basic computation thus attempts to find the shortest directed line tangent to four oblate spherical shells centred on four satellites. Satellite navigation receivers reduce errors by using combinations of signals from multiple satellites and multiple correlators, and then using techniques such as [[Kalman filter]]ing to combine the noisy, partial, and constantly changing data into a single estimate for position, time, and velocity.

==Applications==
{{Main article|GNSS applications}}
{{further|Automotive navigation system}}
[[File:Satellite-navigation.jpg|thumb|Satellite navigation using a [[laptop]] and a [[GPS]] receiver]]
The original motivation for satellite navigation was for military applications. Satellite navigation allows precision in the delivery of weapons to targets, greatly increasing their lethality whilst reducing inadvertent casualties from mis-directed weapons. (See [[Guided bomb]]). Satellite navigation also allows forces to be directed and to locate themselves more easily, reducing the [[fog of war]].

The ability to supply satellite navigation signals is also the ability to deny their availability. The operator of a satellite navigation system potentially has the ability to degrade or eliminate satellite navigation services over any territory it desires.

{{Main article|Global Positioning System}}

The United States' Global Positioning System (GPS) consists of up to 32 [[medium Earth orbit]] satellites in six different [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]s, with the exact number of satellites varying as older satellites are retired and replaced. Operational since 1978 and globally available since 1994, GPS is the world's most utilized satellite navigation system.

===GLONASS===
{{Main article|GLONASS}}
The formerly [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], and now [[Russia]]n, '''''Glo'''bal'naya '''Na'''vigatsionnaya '''S'''putnikovaya '''S'''istema'', (GLObal NAvigation Satellite System or GLONASS), is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides a civilian radionavigation-satellite service and is also used by the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces. GLONASS has full global coverage with 24 satellites.

===Galileo===
{{Main article|Galileo (satellite navigation)}}
The [[European Union]] and [[European Space Agency]] agreed in March 2002 to introduce their own alternative to GPS, called the [[Galileo positioning system]]. Galileo became operational on 15 December 2016 (global Early Operational Capability (EOC)) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=europa.eu |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-4366_en.htm |title=Galileo goes live!|date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At an estimated cost of €3 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5286200.stm |title=Boost to Galileo sat-nav system |date=25 August 2006 |accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the system of 30 [[Medium Earth orbit|MEO]] satellites was originally scheduled to be operational in 2010.

==Augmentation==
[[GNSS augmentation]] is a method of improving a navigation system's attributes, such as accuracy, reliability, and availability, through the integration of external information into the calculation process, for example, the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]], the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]], the [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System]], [[Differential GPS]], [[GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation]] (GAGAN) and [[inertial navigation system]]s.

===DORIS===
{{Main article|DORIS (geodesy)}}
Doppler Orbitography and Radio-positioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) is a [[France|French]] precision navigation system. Unlike other GNSS systems, it is based on static emitting stations around the world, the receivers being on satellites, in order to precisely determine their orbital position. The system may be used also for mobile receivers on land with more limited usage and coverage. Used with traditional GNSS systems, it pushes the accuracy of positions to centimetric precision (and to millimetric precision for altimetric application and also allows monitoring very tiny seasonal changes of Earth rotation and deformations), in order to build a much more precise geodesic reference system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/doris.html |title=DORIS information page |publisher=Jason.oceanobs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low Earth orbit satellite phone networks==
The two current operational low Earth orbit [[satellite phone]] networks are able to track transceiver units with accuracy of a few kilometers using doppler shift calculations from the satellite. The coordinates are sent back to the transceiver unit where they can be read using [[AT command]]s or a [[graphical user interface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://common.globalstar.com/doc/common/en/products/gsp1700_usermanual.pdf |title=Globalstar GSP-1700 manual |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyhelp.net/acrobat/jan_05/Iridium%20SBD-FAQ%201-05.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109014357/http://www.skyhelp.net/acrobat/jan_05/Iridium%20SBD-FAQ%201-05.pdf |date=November 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be used by the gateway to enforce restrictions on geographically bound calling plans.

The survey townships are represented by the numbers (horizontal "town" and vertical "range" numbers), and the [[civil township]]s using the same boundaries are represented by the names.]]

'''Survey township''', sometimes called '''Congressional township''', as used by the [[United States]] [[Public Land Survey System]], refers to a square [[Conversion of units#Area|unit]] of land, that is nominally six (U.S. Survey) [[mile]]s (~9.7&amp;nbsp;km) on a side. Each 36-square-mile (~93&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) township is divided into 36 one-square-mile (~2.6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) [[Section (land)|sections]], that can be further subdivided for sale, and each section covers a nominal {{Convert|640|acre|km2}}. The townships are referenced by a numbering system that locates the township in relation to a [[principal meridian]] (north-south) and a [[Baseline (surveying)|base line]] (east-west). For example, Township 2 North, Range 4 East is the 4th township east of the principal meridian and the 2nd township north of the base line. Township (exterior) lines were originally surveyed and platted by the US [[General Land Office]] using contracted private survey crews. Later survey crews subdivided the townships into sections (interior) lines. Virtually all lands covered by this system were sold according to these boundaries. They are marked on the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] [[topographic map]]s.

== History ==
Prior to standardization, some of the [[Ohio Lands]] (the [[United States Military District]], the [[Firelands]] and the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]]) were surveyed into townships of {{Convert|5|mi|km}} on each side. These are often known as Congressional Townships.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Rectangular Survey System by C. Albert White, 1983, Pub: Washington, D.C. : U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management : For sale by Supt. of Docs., U.S. G.P.O.,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/more/cadastralsurvey/cadastral_history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113090104/http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/more/cadastralsurvey/cadastral_history.html |archivedate=2014-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections are divided into quarter-sections of {{Convert|160|acre|ha}} each and quarter-quarter sections of {{Convert|40|acre|ha}} each. In the [[Homestead Act]] of 1862, one quarter-section of land was the amount allocated to each settler. Stemming from this are the [[idiomatic expression]]s, "the lower 40", which is the 40 acres on a settler's land that is lowest in elevation, in the direction towards which water drains toward a stream, and the "[[back forty]]", the portion farthest from the settler's dwelling.

== Survey township vs. civil township ==
Survey townships are distinct from [[civil township]]s. A survey township is used to establish boundaries for land ownership. A civil township is a form of [[local government]]. In states with civil townships, the boundaries of survey townships are often coterminous with civil townships. County lines, especially in western States, usually follow township lines, leading to the large number of rectangular counties in the West, which are agglomerations of survey townships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geological Survey Circular|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfckAQAAIAAJ|year=1933|publisher=The Survey|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XfckAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 24]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In western Canada, the [[Dominion Land Survey]] adopted a similar format for survey townships, which do not form administrative units. These townships also have the area of 36 square miles (six miles by six miles).

A '''table''' or '''tableland''' is a [[butte]], flank of a mountain, or [[mountain]], that has a flat [[summit|top]].  

This landform has numerous names in addition to "table", including:
*[[Tuya]]
*[[Tepui]]
*[[Mesa]]
*[[Potrero (landform)|Potrero]]
*[[Butte]]
*[[Plateau]]
*[[Fluvial terrace|Terrace]]
*Table
**Table hill
**Table-topped hill
**Table mountain
**Tableland

==Description==
The term "flat" is relative when speaking of tables, and often the naming or identification of a table (or table hill or mountain) is based on the appearance of the terrain feature from a distance or from below it.  An example is [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde, Colorado]], where the "flat top" of the mountain is both rolling terrain and cut by numerous deep canyons and arroyos, but whose rims appear quite flat from almost all directions, terminating in cliffs.

'''UN/LOCODE''', the '''United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations''', is a [[geocode|geographic coding scheme]] developed and maintained by [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE). UN/LOCODE assigns codes to locations used in [[trade]] and [[transport]] with functions such as [[port|seaports]], [[rail terminal|rail]] and road terminals, [[airport]]s, Postal Exchange Office and [[border crossing point]]s. The first issue in 1981 contained codes for 8,000 locations. The version from 2011 contained codes for about 82,000 locations.&lt;ref name="Note 2011-1" /&gt;

==Structure==
UN/LOCODEs have five characters. The first two letters code a country by the table defined in [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]. The three remaining characters code a location within that country. Letters are preferred, but if necessary digits 2 through 9 may be used, excluding "0" and "1" to avoid confusion with the letters "O" and "I" respectively.

For each country there can be a maximum of 17,576 entries using only letters (26×26×26), or 39,304 entries using letters and digits (34×34×34).

For the US, the letter combinations have almost all been exhausted. So in 2006, the Secretariat added 646 entries with a digit as the last character.

==Loose consistency with existing IATA airport codes==
For airports, the three letters following the [[country code]] are not always identical to the [[IATA airport code]]. According to the Secretariat note for Issue 2006-2, there are 720 locations showing a different IATA code.&lt;ref name="Note 2006-2" /&gt;

==Official UN/LOCODE tables==
UN/LOCODEs are released as a table. An individual revision is officially referred to as an "issue". A discussion of the table's structure follows.

;Explanations:

* &lt;tt&gt;US NYC&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for New York City in the United States. Subdivision is the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] (see [[ISO 3166-2:US]]). Function: port, rail, road, airport, postal. IATA code is NYC. Coordinates: {{coord|40|42|N|074|00|W}}.
*&lt;tt&gt;DE BER&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for Berlin (city) in Germany. Subdivision is the [[German state]] of Berlin (see [[ISO 3166-2:DE]]). Function: port, rail, road, airport, postal. IATA code is BER. Coordinates: {{coord|52|31|N|013|23|E}}.
*&lt;tt&gt;DE TXL&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for [[Berlin-Tegel International Airport|Berlin-Tegel Airport]] in Germany. Function: airport. IATA code is TXL.
*&lt;tt&gt;FR PAR&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for Paris (city) in France. Subdivision is the [[French department]] of Paris (see [[ISO 3166-2:FR]]). Function: port, rail, road, postal.
*&lt;tt&gt;GB PAR&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for [[Par, Cornwall|Par]] in United Kingdom. Subdivision is the [[English county]] of [[Cornwall]] (see [[ISO 3166-2:GB]]). Function: port.
*&lt;tt&gt;SE GOT&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for [[Göteborg]] (Goteborg without diacritics) in Sweden. Subdivision is the [[Swedish county]] of [[Västra Götaland]] (see [[ISO 3166-2:SE]]). Function: port, airport, postal. The IATA code of XWL indicated in the table is that of a train station in the city centre of [[Göteborg]] (though not the Central Station), while the IATA code for the main airport ([[Göteborg Landvetter Airport]]) is actually GOT. It also has a separate reference entry showing an alternate spelling of ''Gothenburg''.

===Data fields===
The fields are listed in the official order.

====Ch (Changes)====
:A change from the previous issue is indicated by one of the following characters in the first column:&lt;ref name="Note 2006-2" /&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Marked for deletion in the next issue
: &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Change in location name (usually spelling)
: &lt;tt&gt;¦&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Other changes in the entry (not location)
: &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Entry added to the current issue
: &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Reference entry
: &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Retained for certain entries in the USA code list ("controlled duplications")

====Locode====
:The code is represented with a space between the alpha-2 codes of ISO 3166-1 country code and the 3-character element.

====Name====
:Names of locations should be shown using the 26 letters of the Roman alphabet with, where appropriate, diacritic signs as contained in ISO 10646-1/1993 or ISO 8859-1/1987.

====Name Without Diacritics====
:The name of the location, but non-practicable Diacritics may be ignored and should not be converted into additional characters(e.g., Göteborg may be read as Goteborg,  rather than Goeteborg, Gothenburg, Gotembourg, etc.).
:Can contain an apostrophe, e.g. [[L'viv]]

====SubDiv (Subdivision)====
:The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 1 to 3 character alphabetic and/or numeric code for the administrative division (state, province, department, etc.) of the country, as included in [[ISO 3166-2]]/1998. Only the latter part of the complete ISO 3166-2 code element (after the hyphen) is shown.

====Function====
:Each defined function gets a classifier; the most important are:
:* 1 = port (for any kind of waterborne transport)
:* 2 = rail terminal
:* 3 = road terminal
:* 4 = airport
:* 5 = postal exchange office
:* 6 = Inland Clearance Depot – ICD or "Dry Port", "Inland Clearance Terminal", etc.
:* 7 = fixed transport functions (e.g. oil platform)"; the classifier "7" is reserved for this function. Noting that the description "oil pipeline terminal" would be more relevant, and could be extended to cover also electric power lines and [[ropeway]] terminals.
:* B = Border crossing function
:* 0 = function not known, to be specified

====Status====
:Indicates the status of the entry by a 2-character code. The following codes are used at present:
:*AA: Approved by competent national government agency
:*AC: Approved by Customs Authority
:*AF: Approved by national facilitation body
:*AI: Code adopted by international organisation (IATA or ECLAC)
:*AM: Approved by the UN/LOCODE Maintenance Agency
:*AQ: Entry approved, functions not verified 
:*AS: Approved by national standardisation body
:*RL: Recognised location - Existence and representation of location name confirmed by check against nominated gazetteer or other reference work
:*RN: Request from credible national sources for locations in their own country
:*RQ: Request under consideration
:*UR: Entry included on user's request; not officially approved 
:*RR: Request rejected
:*QQ: Original entry not verified since date indicated
:*XX: Entry that will be removed from the next issue of UN/LOCODE

====Date====
:The date the location was added or updated: 0207 is July 2002, 9501 is January 1995, etc.
:Note that the edition published in 2008 uses the value 0701 for additions, while in other cases the exact month is used like 9710, 0212.

====IATA====
:For correlation purposes, the [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA code]] for the location is marked if different from the second part of the UN/LOCODE.

====Coordinates====
:Some entries have coordinates in the database. They are represented as: ddmmN dddmmW, ddmmS dddmmE, etc.

====Remarks====
:The remarks column can among other things contain a hint to what specifically was changed (See data field - "Change").

==Availability==
Availability
UN/LOCODE is available on the [http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/welcome.html UNECE website], where the latest release of UNLOCOD directories and background documents are listed. Complete UN/LOCODE code list may be downloaded in the format of.mdb (MS Access database), .txt (text file) and .csv (Comma-separated values). HTML pages are also displayed on the website by countries.

==Data Maintenance Requests==
UN/LOCODE Data Maintenance Request system is web-based (http://apps.unece.org/unlocode/), which enables registered users to submit online requests for new UN/LOCODE entry modifications.

The system provides online functions for 
:*Registration of users and password retrieval 
:*Submission of requests for new UN/LOCODE entries 
:*Submission of requests for modification changes in existing UN/LOCODE entries 
:*A guide to explain the use of the system

==Errors==
In 2006-07 &lt;tt&gt;IQ IRB&lt;/tt&gt; for [[Irbil]] was added while &lt;tt&gt;IQ ABL&lt;/tt&gt; [[Arbil]] with almost the same coordinates existed. In the 2007 edition &lt;tt&gt;IQ ABL&lt;/tt&gt; gets marked for deletion and &lt;tt&gt;IQ EBL&lt;/tt&gt; [[Erbil International Apt]] is added to the database, but with a different coordinates, reflecting the distance between airport and city. The error is to delete ABL and to insert IRB.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}}

Occasionally locations are listed twice; this is not necessarily an error. In issue 2006-1, &lt;tt&gt;ARSMC &lt;/tt&gt; [[San Miguel de Tucumán]] (functions 2,3) was added while &lt;tt&gt;ARTUC &lt;/tt&gt; Tucumán (function 1) already was in the list. The coordinates are with very little deviation the same. Also in 2006-1, &lt;tt&gt;ARSSJ &lt;/tt&gt; [[San Salvador de Jujuy]] was added (function 4) while &lt;tt&gt;ARJUJ &lt;/tt&gt; Jujuy (functions 1,2,3,5) already existed.

=== 2009-1 ===
The 2009-1 release added several entries for Ukraine where the longitude is off by a few orders of magnitude. Ranging from 23230E to 38829E, they are outside what would constitute an eastern [[longitude]]. [[Ivano Frankovsk]] and [[Chuguyev]] have two entries now, along with Nikolayev. For all three, the [[Romanization|romanized]] spelling varies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15906">'''UN M.49''' is a standard for area codes used by the [[United Nations]] for [[statistics|statistical]] purposes, developed and maintained by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]]. Each area code is a 3-digit number which can refer to a wide variety of geographical, political, or economic regions, like a [[continent]], a [[country]], or a specific group of [[Human development (economics)|developed or developing countries]].  Codes assigned in the system generally do not change when the country or area's name changes (unlike [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] or [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]]), but instead change when the territorial extent of the country or area changes significantly,{{sfn|United Nations|1996|p=2}} although there have been exceptions to this rule.{{efn|Through the second revision of M.49 in 1983, changes in territory did not necessarily result in changed codes.{{sfn|United Nations|1982|p=vi}} [[Pakistan]], for example, retains the code it was assigned in the original 1970 edition of M.49, even though [[Bangladesh]] did not separate from Pakistan until 1971 and did not officially receive a code until the first revision of M.49 was released in 1975.{{sfn|United Nations|1975|p=1}}}}

Some of these codes, those representing countries and territories, were first included as part of the [[ISO 3166-1]] standard in its second edition in 1981, but they have been released by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]] since 1970.{{sfnm|1a1=United Nations|1y=1970|2a1=Jensen|2a2=Parkin|2a3=MacLennan|2a4=Muir|2a5=Skeet|2y=1991}}

Another part of these numeric codes, those representing geographical (continental and sub-continental) supranational regions, was also included in the IANA registry for region subtags (first described in September 2006 in the now obsoleted RFC 4646, but confirmed in its successor RFC 5646, published in September 2009) for use within language tags, as specified in IETF's [[BCP 47]] (where the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are used as region subtags, instead of UN M.49 codes, for countries and territories).

== Private-use codes and reserved codes ==
Beside the codes standardized above, the numeric codes '''900''' to '''999''' are reserved for private-use in ISO 3166-1 (under agreement by the UNSD) and in the UN M.49 standard. They may be used for any other groupings or subdivision of countries, territories and regions.

Some of these private-use codes may be found in some UN statistics reports and databases, for their own specific purpose. They are not portable across databases from third parties (except through private agreement), and may be changed without notice.

Note that the code '''000''' is reserved and not used for defining any region. It is used in absence of data, or for data in which no region (not even the World as a whole) is applicable. For unknown or unencoded regions, private-use codes should preferably be used.

== Extensions to M.49 ==
Early editions of M.49 used one- or two-digit prefixes to designate economic regions rather than assigning 3-digit codes.  These two digit prefixes were designed to be used to easily aggregate data through the use of prefix matching, and regions could be specified collectively by using the '''000''' code as a base to which the prefix would be added.{{sfn|United Nations Statistical Office|1970|p=4}}  For example, by prefixing '''13''' to [[Algeria]]'s code, '''012''', to create the five-digit code '''13012''', Algeria could be identified as being in [[North Africa]] ('''13000'''), which is itself in [[Africa]] ('''10000''').

One-digit suffixes were also permitted, to specify statistics of subdivisions of countries.{{sfn|United Nations Statistical Office|1970|p=4}} For example, by suffixing '''5''' to the code for the [[United Kingdom]] to create the four-digit code '''8265''', [[Scotland]] could be represented as a subdivision of the United Kingdom.  Additional suffixes could be used to represent the other constituent units of the UK.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2938">USBL ('''ultra-short baseline''', also sometimes known as '''SSBL''' for super short base line) is a [[Underwater Acoustic Positioning System|method of underwater acoustic positioning]]. A complete USBL system consists of a [[transceiver]], which is mounted on a pole under a ship, and a [[Transponder|transponder or responder]] on the seafloor, on a [[towfish]], or on an [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]. A computer, or "topside unit", is used to calculate a position from the ranges and bearings measured by the transceiver.

An [[Acoustics|acoustic]] pulse is transmitted by the transceiver and detected by the subsea transponder, which replies with its own acoustic pulse. This return pulse is detected by the shipboard transceiver. The time from the transmission of the initial acoustic pulse until the reply is detected is measured by the USBL system and is converted into a range.

To calculate a subsea position, the USBL calculates both a range and an angle from the transceiver to the [[subsea]] beacon. Angles are measured by the transceiver, which contains an array of [[transducers]]. The transceiver head normally contains three or more transducers separated by a baseline of 10&amp;nbsp;cm or less. A method called “[[Phase difference|phase-differencing]]” within this [[Microphone array|transducer array]] is used to calculate the direction to the subsea transponder.

USBLs have also begun to find use in "inverted" (iUSBL) configurations, with the transceiver mounted on an [[autonomous underwater vehicle]], and the transponder on the target. In this case, the "topside" processing happens inside the vehicle to allow it to locate the transponder for applications such as [[automatic docking]] and [[Tracking system|target tracking]].
