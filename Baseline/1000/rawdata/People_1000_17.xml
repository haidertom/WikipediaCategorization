There are '''apocryphal biographies''' in the first edition (1885–1900) of the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (DNB), a major work on historical biography related to the [[United Kingdom]]. In other words, there is a biography that presents a life of a person asserted to have existed, but (in the light of later scholarship) the evidence for the person having lived has become regarded as tenuous or non-existent.

Examples are in [[:s:Category:Apocryphal biographies]], based on the updated ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (ODNB), where the corresponding article casts serious doubt on the DNB assertions.

==Kirkman Finlay==
'''Kirkman Finlay'''—supposed: (''c.'' 1802&amp;ndash;1828) was an alleged Scottish [[philhellene]].

The DNB has an article on this man,{{sfn|Goodwin|1889|p=32}} but more modern scholarship refutes its credibility. Monica Clough in the 21st century ODNB explains how the original source for the DNB probably confused fact with fiction and concludes by citing and quoting C. R. Fay (1951):
{{quote|
Perhaps, unless new evidence is found, more reliable than the obituary in the ''Gentleman's Magazine'' of April 1828 which called him into being,{{sfn|Gentlemen's Magazine staff|1828|p=372}} 'the second quite imaginary Kirkman Finlay of the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] "who was neither killed in Greece nor born anywhere"' can be safely buried.|Monica Clough&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clough|2004}} citing C. R. Fay, Huskisson and his age (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Robert Bruce (died 1094?) ==
Robert de Brus [Bruce] supposed nobleman, based on late medieval lists of those who fought at Hastings,{{sfn|Mackay|1886|p=114}} which are wholly unreliable.{{sfn|Cownie |2004}}

==Macduff 'thane' of Fife==
"A half or wholly mythical personage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB |wstitle=Macduff |first=Thomas Finlayson |last=Henderson |volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; If he is not a literary invention, then he represents a supporter of [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], descended from [[Dub, King of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Dauvit|last= Broun|title=Dubh  (d. 966)|id= 8166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five of the fourteen captives in this group repatriated to Saudi captivity on November 9, 2007 were among the eleven former Guantanamo captives to be listed on the 85 men on the [[Saudi list of most wanted suspected terrorists]], published on February 3, 2009.
One of the cohort, [[Said Ali al-Shihri]], became second in command of [[Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]].

According to [[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]], reporting for the ''BBC'', his team found that the cohort of Saudis repatriated in November 2007 problematic.&lt;ref name=Bbc2010-10-13/&gt;
He reported that many of these captives were not rehabilitated.
He reported that five of the fourteen men in batch 10 escaped to [[Yemen]], and joined jihadists there.
The version of the men's names were [[Mohammed al-Awfi]], [[Said al-Shihri]], [[Yussef al-Shihri]], [[Murtadha Ali Saeed Magram]] and [[Turki Meshawi Zayid al-Assiri]].
Said al-Shihri and Mohammed al-Awfi appeared in an alarming video in January 2009.  Said al-Shihri took a leadership role in [[Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula]].
Yussef al-Shihri was killed in a shoot-out with Saudi security officials.  He is alleged to have tried to cross the Saudi border dressed in a [[Burkha]], an all-encompassing female garment, armed with a suicide belt.
Taylor reports that Murtadha Ali Saeed Magram and Turki Meshawi Zayid al-Assiri remain at large.
The other nine men repatriated in batch 10 were:
[[Zaid Muhamamd Sa'id Al Husayn]],
[[Sultan Ahmed Dirdeer Musa Al Uwaydha]],

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Galahad]], Bors the Younger, and [[Percival]] achieve the Grail ([[Edward Burne-Jones]] C. 1895)]]

'''Bors''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔr|z}}; {{lang-fr|Bohort}}) is the name of two knights in the [[Arthurian legend]], one the father of the other. Bors the Elder is the King of Gaunnes or [[Gaul]] during the early period of [[King Arthur|King Arthur's]] reign, and is the brother of [[King Ban]] of Benoic. The two first appear in the 13th-century [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle. Bors the Younger later becomes one of the best [[Round Table|Knights of the Round Table]], and even achieves the [[Holy Grail]].

==King Bors the Elder==
As Ban's brother, King Bors is [[Lancelot|Lancelot's]] and [[Hector de Maris|Hector de Maris']] uncle. He marries [[Evaine]], the sister of Ban's wife [[Elaine (legend)|Elaine]], and has two sons, Bors the Younger and [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]. Ban and Bors become Arthur's early allies in his fight against eleven rebel kings in [[Great Britain|Britain]], including [[King Lot|Lot]], [[Urien]], and [[Caradoc]], and he vows to help them against their enemy [[Claudas]], who has been threatening their lands. Arthur is late on his promise, however, and Claudas succeeds in his invasion, resulting in both kings' deaths. Ban's son Lancelot is taken by the [[Lady of the Lake]], but Bors' children are raised in captivity by Claudas' retainers.

==Sir Bors the Younger==
Sir Bors the Younger is better known than King Bors throughout Arthurian studies. Sir Bors and Lionel live for several years at Claudas' court. But they eventually rebel against him and even slay his cruel son Dorin. Before Claudas can retaliate, the boys are rescued by a servant of the Lady of the Lake and are spirited off to be raised with their cousin Lancelot. All three grow to be excellent knights and go to [[Camelot]] to join King Arthur's retinue. Bors is recognizable by a distinctive scar on his forehead, and participates in most of the King's conflicts, including the eventual battle with Claudas that liberates his father's lands. Bors fathers Sir [[Elyan the White]] when the daughter of King Brandegoris tricks him into sleeping with her by way of a magic ring; he later introduces his son into the Round Table.

[[Image:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|right|Bors chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother Lionel]]

Bors is always portrayed as one of the Round Table's finest, but his real glory comes on the [[Grail Quest]], where he proves himself worthy enough to witness the Grail's mysteries alongside [[Galahad]] and [[Percival]]. Several episodes display his virtuous character; in one, a lady approaches Bors vowing to commit suicide unless he sleeps with her. He refuses to break his vow of [[celibacy]]; the lady and her maidens threaten to throw themselves off the castle battlements. As the ladies jump off, they reveal themselves to be demons set on deceiving him by playing to his sense of compassion. In another, Bors faces a dilemma where he must choose between rescuing his brother Lionel, being whipped with thorns by villains in one direction, and saving a young girl who has been abducted by a rogue knight in the other. Bors chooses to help the maiden, but prays for his brother's safety. Lionel escapes his tormentors and tries to murder Bors, and Bors does not defend himself, refusing to raise a weapon against his kinsman. Fellow Knight of the Round Table Sir [[Calogrenant]] and a religious hermit try to intervene, but Lionel slays them both when they get in the way. Before he can kill his brother, however, God strikes him down with an immobilizing column of fire. Bors, Galahad, and Percival go on to achieve the Holy Grail and accompany it to [[Sarras]], a mystical island in the [[Middle East]]. Both Galahad and Percival pass away while there; Bors is the only one to return.

In [[Thomas Malory|Thomas Malory's]] ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Sir Bors agrees to fight as Guinevere's champion when she is accused of poisoning a knight. Bors is reluctant, as her first choice, Lancelot, left Camelot because of Guinevere. He relents when Arthur sees Guinevere kneeling before him.  He is about to joust for her sake when Lancelot arrives to take his place.

Like the rest of his family, Bors joins Lancelot in exile after his affair with [[Guinevere]] is exposed, and helps rescue the Queen from her execution at the stake. Bors becomes one of Lancelot's most trusted advisors in the ensuing war between Lancelot and Arthur, and becomes ruler of Claudas' former lands. When Arthur and [[Gawain]] must return to Britain to fight the evil usurper [[Mordred]], Gawain sends a letter to Lancelot asking for aid. Lancelot's men arrive to put down the remainder of the rebellion led by Mordred's sons [[Sons of Mordred|Melehan and Melou]]; Lionel is killed by Melehan, and Bors avenges his death.

==Modern portrayals==
*In [[T.H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', Bors is described as a "misogynist" and an "almost-virgin", and generally something of a curmudgeon.
*In 1975's ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', Sir Bors (played by [[Terry Gilliam]]) is the first Knight of the Round Table to succumb to the [[Rabbit of Caerbannog|Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog]]. Arthur, dismissive of the Rabbit despite Tim the Enchanter's warnings, orders Bors to kill the Rabbit to demonstrate that it is of no threat. However, the Rabbit leaps through the air and onto Sir Bors, and he is quickly decapitated before he can attempt a single blow.
*In 2004's ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', British actor [[Ray Winstone]] plays a different Bors. He is one of the Sarmatian 'knights', and is brash, bold and violent in a departure from the saintly earlier figure. He is brother to [[Dagonet]]; has a native lover Vanora, and more than ten illegitimate children. [[Vanora]] is believed to be an early identity of Guenevere; the Vanora of the film is also some-time mistress to fellow Sarmatian knight Lancelot, who is strongly hinted to be the father of Bors' youngest child, and possibly others (for example Gilly, the eldest), as they have dark hair whereas neither of their parents do.
*In ''[[Adventures of Sir Galahad]]'', a Columbia serial from 1949, Sir Bors is played by [[Charles King (character actor)|Charles King]] as a comedy relief sidekick for Galahad.

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*Macbeth suffers from [[hubris]], leading to the murder of [[Duncan I of Scotland]]; he later becomes [[paranoia|paranoid]], leading him to order the deaths of [[Banquo]] and the family of [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]: ''[[Macbeth]]''
*[[Hamlet]] is indecisive and self-doubting, which thwarts him in avenging his father's murder.

On 18 March 2013, [[Pope Francis]] adopted in his [[papal coat of arms]] the [[coat of arms]] and the [[motto]] that he used since his [[episcopal consecration]] in 1991, differenced following his election as [[Supreme Pontiff]].&lt;ref name="OR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/elezione/stemma-papa-francesco_it.html | title=Lo Stemma di Papa Francesco | publisher=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] | date=March 18, 2013 | access-date=March 18, 2013 | language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges and field==
His [[coat of arms]] displays three [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] on a blue [[Field (heraldry)|field]]. In reference to Francis being a [[Jesuit]], the uppermost charge is the emblem of the [[Society of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; The emblem is composed of a  [[Sun (heraldry)|Sun radiant]], within which is the IHS [[christogram]] (a [[monogram]] of the [[Holy Name of Jesus]]) in red, with a red cross surmounting the H and three black nails below the H.&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; 

Below the Jesuit emblem is an eight-pointed star, the [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|star]] being  a long-standing symbol of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], and a [[spikenard]] representing [[Saint Joseph]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VIS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-miserando-atque-eligendo | title=Pope Francis : "Miserando atque eligendo"... | publisher=[[Vatican Information Service]] | date=March 18, 2013 | accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= NCR/&gt; In [[Hispanic]] iconographic tradition Saint Joseph is often depicted with a branch of spikenard in his hand.&lt;ref name="OR2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/elezione/stemma-papa-francesco_it.html | title=Lo Stemma di Papa Francesco | publisher=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] | date=March 18, 2013 | accessdate=4 December 2016 | language=Italian}} "La stella, secondo l’antica tradizione araldica, simboleggia la Vergine Maria, madre di Cristo e della Chiesa; mentre il fiore di nardo indica San Giuseppe, patrono della Chiesa universale. Nella tradizione iconografica ispanica, infatti, San Giuseppe è raffigurato con un ramo di nardo in mano."&lt;/ref&gt; 

These charges appeared on Bergoglio's previous coat of arms displayed when he was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Buenos Aires|Archbishop of Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref name= NCR&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope stresses simplicity, ecumenism in inaugural Mass plans |url= http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-stresses-simplicity-ecumenism-inaugural-mass-plans|newspaper= [[National Catholic Reporter]] |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as Pope the [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] of the star and the spikenard were elevated from ''Argent'' (silver) to ''Or'' (gold). The first version of the [[Coats of arms of the Holy See and Vatican City|papal coat of arms]] published by the Vatican showed a five-pointed star from Bergoglio's previous one, but this was later amended to eight points; the representation of the spikenard was also slightly altered so it would resemble leaves rather than what appears to look like grapes.

==Blazon==

The Vatican has not yet published the official [[blazon]] of the arms, but an approximation has been made by John Hamilton Gaylor, as follows:
:''Azure on a Sun in Splendour Or the IHS Christogram ensigned with a Cross paty fitchy piercing the H Gules all above three Nails fanwise points to centre Sable, and in dexter base a Mullet of eight points and in sinister base a Spikenard flower Or.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wedvick of Jarlsby - Religious/Francis, H.

Pope 3 |url=http://wedvickofjarlsby.org/webvick-gallery/displayimage.php?album=7&amp;pos=24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206134335/http://wedvickofjarlsby.org/webvick-gallery/displayimage.php?album=7&amp;pos=24 |archivedate=2013-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==External ornaments==
Traditionally, a [[Pope]]'s coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered [[Papal Tiara|papal tiara]] with lappets and the crossed keys of [[Saint Peter]] with a cord. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the Pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind in Heaven as on earth.&lt;ref&gt;({{bibleverse||Matt|16:19|63}})&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis' arms maintain the keys, but replaced the tiara (as did his predecessor) with a [[mitre|triband mitre]]. 

The [[Papal Tiara|tiara]] and keys remain the symbol of the [[papacy]] and appear on the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Holy See]] and (reversed) on the flag of [[Vatican City]].

===Mitre===
[[File:BANDERA GUARDIA VATICA PANCHO.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Banner of the Pontifical Swiss Guard]] with Pope Francis' coat of arms]]
As with his [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|predecessor's personal arms]], Francis replaced the traditional [[papal triregnum]] by adopting a [[tincture (heraldry)|silver]] [[mitre]] with three gold bands. These bands allude to the papal tiara's three [[crown (headgear)|crown]]s, which came to represent the three powers of Orders, Jurisdiction, and Magisterium, all joining at the centre depicting unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).

===Motto===
[[File:Coat of arms of Jorge Mario Bergoglio.svg|thumb|Coat of arms as Cardinal Bergoglio]]
Unusually, Francis also decided to retain his personal [[motto]]: ''Miserando atque eligendo''. It is taken from the 21st [[homily]] of [[Bede|Saint Bede]], which is on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and refers to the [[vocation]] of [[Saint Matthew]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; He writes:

:"Vidit ergo Iesus publicanum et quia '''miserando atque eligendo''' vidit, ait illi 'Sequere me'." (Om. 21; CCL 122, 149-151)
:"Jesus saw the tax collector and, because '''he saw him through the eyes of mercy and chose him''', he said to him: Follow me." (trans. ''[[Liturgy of the Hours]]'' 1975, p. 1418)

Bede is here discussing Matthew 9:9-13. The salient point is that Jesus chose Matthew as his disciple not in spite but because of his being a sinner. In the Douay Rheims translation: 
&lt;ol start=9&gt;&lt;li&gt; And when Jesus passed on from hence, he saw a man sitting in the custom house, named Matthew; and he saith to him: Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; But Jesus hearing it, said: They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I am not come to call the just, but sinners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

The statement from the Vatican announcing the Pope's coat of arms and motto explained that the phrase had a special meaning for Francis as he felt it recalled his own vocation, when at the age of 17, he went to [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] on St Matthew's day in 1953.&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt;

The [[blazon]] of the '''[[coat of arms]] of the [[Princess of Asturias]]''' is given by a Royal Decree 979 on 30 October 2015 which was an amendment of the Royal Decree 1511 dated [[Madrid]] 21 January 1977, which also created her guidon (military personal ensign) and her standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boletín Oficial del Estado|url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2015/10/31/pdfs/BOE-A-2015-11729.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official blazon==

The shield is divided into four quarters, blazoned as follows:

*1st, [[Gules]] a castle three-towered [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], masoned [[Sable]] ajoure, (door and windows) [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]], for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]];
*2nd, [[Argent]] a lion rampant Purpure crowned Or, armed Gules and crowned Or, for [[Kingdom of León|León]];
*3rd, Or four pallets Gules, for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]];
*4th, Gules a cross, saltire and orle of chains all linked Or, an emerald Proper, for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]];
*''Enté en point'', Argent a pomegranate Proper seeded Gules, supported, sculpted and leafed in two leaves [[Vert (heraldry)|Vert]], for [[Granada]];
*[[Inescutcheon]], Azure with three [[fleurs-de-lys]] Or, [[bordure]]d Gules, for [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]].

The whole is differenced by a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points Azure, the [[brisure|difference]] used by heirs apparent to the [[House of Habsburg|Spanish House of Habsburg]].

The shield is surmounted by a closed crown, which is a circle of gold, inset with precious stones of their colours, composed of eight rosettes of acanthus leaves, of which five are visible, interspersed by pearls in their colour, issuing from which are four pearl diadems, of which three are visible, which converge in a blue orb, with gold semi-meridian and equator, surmounted by a gold cross, the crown lined with red and surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]].

&lt;!--The following is unsourced:== Variants ==

Before 2001, the heir to the Spanish throne used this coat of arms unofficially, and still does in Aragon or Navarre, where a different version of the coat of arms, as Prince or Princess of Girona and Viana respectively, is displayed. It is likely that these arms will also be some day adopted officially.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera Sánchez, Alfonso (2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4585">'''Creirwy''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈkrəirʊɨ}}) is a figure in the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and the ''[[s:The Mabinogion/Taliesin|Hanes Taliesin]]'' (the story of [[Taliesin]]'s life), daughter of the enchantress [[Ceridwen]] and [[Tegid Foel]] ("Tacitus the Bald"). The [[Welsh Triads]] name her one of the three most beautiful maids of the Isle of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Triads of Britain|Triads of Britain]]&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Penllyn (cantref)|Penllyn]] in [[Powys]], Wales, Creirwy (also known as ''Llywy'') has a dark, hideous brother named [[Morfran]] and a foster brother, [[Gwion Bach]] (who would become the bard Taliesin). She does not appear in the stories about [[Afagddu]] and Taliesin.

==Interpretation as a goddess==
[[Celtic Revival|Celtic]] researcher [[Edward Davies (Celtic)|Edward Davies]] deemed Creirwy "the [[Proserpina|Proserpine]] of the [[Britons (historical)|British]] [[Druid]]s"—also [[Comparative mythology|comparing]] her mother Ceridwen to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] of Roman myth.&lt;ref name=virago&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mythologyritesof00davirich ''The Mythology and Rites of the British Druids''], [https://archive.org/stream/mythologyritesof00davirich#page/205/mode/1up/ page 205]&lt;/ref&gt; Mythographer [[Jacob Bryant]] theorized that Creirwy and Ceridwen were essentially "the same mystical personage."&lt;ref name=virago /&gt;

Her name possibly means "sacred symbol of the egg" (i.e., "[[mundane egg]]", "[[adder stone]]") from the Welsh elements ''creir'' "a token, jewel, sacred object, relic, talisman, treasure, richly decorated article, object of admiration or love, darling, safeguard, strength, hand-bell, church-bell"&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, August. [http://thedarkavalonbooks.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/creirwy-the-lake-monster-of-bala-lakellyn-tegid/ "Creirwy, the Lake Monster of Bala Lake/Llyn Tegid?"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719142009/http://thedarkavalonbooks.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/creirwy-the-lake-monster-of-bala-lakellyn-tegid/ |date=2012-07-19 }} ''Dark Avalon Books''. Retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''wy'' "egg".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ŵy|Wiktionary: "ŵy"]]&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Druids, the mundane egg allegedly symbolized chaos, the beginning of all things, and upon it oaths were administered.

==Saint Creirwy==
This was also the name of a 6th-century Breton saint from Wales, daughter of Saint [[Gwen Teirbron|Gwen the Triple-Breasted]] and sister of the great regional saint [[Winwaloe]]. According to [[hagiographies]] of Winwaloe, Saint Creirwy ({{lang-la|Creirvia}}; {{lang-br|'''Klervi'''}}) as a young girl had one or both eyes gouged out by a wild [[goose]], but Winwaloe retrieved the eyeball(s) from the gander's belly and returned it/them to his little sister's [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit(s)]], and Creirwy's eyesight was miraculously restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://louis.buchillot.perso.sfr.fr/page369.htm#fiche5 "Sainte Chreirbia" (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, she is allegedly a patron saint of the blind. The story is memorialized in a 16th-century statue in Keravézan, [[Saint-Frégant]]; known as ''la fontaine de Saint Guénolé'', it depicts Winwaloe (Guénolé) holding the goose and the eyeball, with little Creirwy at his feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saint-fregant.e-monsite.com/pages/patrimoine/fontaine-de-saint-guenole.html Fontaine de Saint-Guénolé (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:br:Restr:St Frégant 2.jpg|A photo of the statue of Winwaloe and Creirwy on Breton Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the legend is dismissed by [[Sabine Baring-Gould|Baring-Gould]] and Fisher, who say it originated with an expression that "Creirwe" used; supposedly she would often say she "owed her eye to Winwaloe", but in reference to a much more ordinary childhood event, in which her brother stepped in and protected her when a wild goose flew at Creirwy and almost pecked out her eye.&lt;ref&gt;Anna of the blog ''Early Western Saints''.

'''The East Side Kids''' were characters in a series of films released by [[Monogram Pictures]] from 1940 through 1945.  Many of them were originally part of [[Dead End Kids|The Dead End Kids]] and [[Little Tough Guys|The Little Tough Guys]], and several of them later became members of [[The Bowery Boys]].

==History==
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
When [[Samuel Goldwyn]] turned the play ''[[Dead End (play|Dead End]]'' into the [[Dead End (1937 film)|1937 film version]], he recruited the original tough-talking kids from the play ([[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Bobby Jordan]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Billy Halop]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]) to repeat their roles in the film. This led to the making of six other films starring [[The Dead End Kids]]. The most successful of these features were ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (1938) with [[James Cagney]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], and ''[[They Made Me a Criminal]]'' (1939), starring [[John Garfield]]. Universal offered a competing series, under the [[Little Tough Guys]] brand name, later combining the Little Tough Guys cast members with the Dead End Kids (minus Gorcey) as the Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys series.

==The East Side Kids==
In 1940 producer [[Sam Katzman]], noting the financial success of other tough-kid series,  made the film ''[[East Side Kids (film)|East Side Kids]]'' using two of the 'Little Tough Guys', Hally Chester and Harris Berger. He added former [[Our Gang]] player [[Donald Haines]], [[Frankie Burke]], radio actor Sam Edwards, and Eddie Brian to round out the new team. The film served as a kind of "pilot" for a possible series of films, which were eventually made possible by this film's success.

Katzman hired former Dead End Kid Bobby Jordan to play the lead in the first film in the series proper, ''[[Boys of the City]]'' and he was soon joined in the series by Leo Gorcey. Gorcey's brother David was also added, as well as (Ernie) [[Ernie Morrison|'Sunshine' Sammy Morrison]] as "Scruno," the only African-American in the group and a former child actor from the very first cast of the [[Our Gang]] comedy team.

In the first few films, [[Dave O'Brien (actor)|Dave O'Brien]] (familiar from low-budget westerns and serials, and as the accident-prone star of the [[Pete Smith Specialties|Pete Smith]] comedies) played Jordan's older brother ''Knuckles Dolan,'' who always seemed to be getting roped into chaperoning the kids from adventure to adventure. O'Brien appeared in different roles as well—continuity between films was often ignored. As with the Little Tough Guys, the membership of the team changed from film to film, until Huntz Hall joined in 1941, when the lineup was somewhat stabilized. In total, 20 actors were members of the team at one time or another.

[[File:Million Dollar Kid (1944) 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Bobby Stone]], [[Robert Greig]], [[Leo Gorcey]], and [[Huntz Hall]] in the film ''[[Million Dollar Kid]]'' (1944).]]
Always the outsider, Gabriel Dell drifted in and out of the series as a gang-member, a reporter, or a small-time hoodlum (as in ''Million Dollar Kid''). In ''Smart Alecks'' he's an ex-member who left the gang to pursue a life of crime. [[Stanley Clements]] also appeared in ''Smart Alecks'' as well as '''Neath Brooklyn Bridge'' and ''Ghosts on the Loose''. After Gorcey left the subsequent "Bowery Boys" series in 1956, Clements was chosen to replace him in the last seven films.

Monogram (which later became Allied Artists) was notorious for its "[[Poverty Row]]" productions, and the East Side films were no exception. With a minuscule budget of around $33,000 per feature and a tight shooting schedule of only 5–7 days, the series churned out three or four movies a year (an astonishing 21 films in less than six years). There was no time or money for subtlety, story development, or more than one or two takes per scene.

The stories always centered on the tough, pugnacious "Muggs McGinnis" (Gorcey) or the more innocent, clean-cut "Danny" (Bobby Jordan). Huntz Hall's "Glimpy" began as a minor character who grew in prominence as he was allowed to do more comedy bits over the course of the series. The loose format proved flexible enough to shift back and forth between urban drama (''That Gang of Mine''), murder mystery (''Boys of the City''), boxing melodrama (''Bowery Blitzkrieg''), and horror-comedy (''Spooks Run Wild''), with the kids confronting various stock villains: gangsters, smugglers, spies, and crooked gamblers, along the way. The East Side films were problem-teen melodramas until 1943, when director [[William Beaudine]] joined the series and emphasized the comedy content. He encouraged the actors to improvise freely, adding to the films' spontaneous charm.

The contemporaneous events of World War II affected the series as well as the cast.  In 1943 Béla Lugosi (who was in ''Spooks Run Wild'') returned as a Nazi saboteur in the incongruously-titled ''Ghosts on the Loose'' which also featured a young [[Ava Gardner]]; a German-Japanese spy ring was thwarted in the blatantly patriotic ''[[Let's Get Tough!]]'' from 1942 (with Gabriel Dell, of all people, as a Nazi spy). At the end of ''[[Kid Dynamite (film)|Kid Dynamite]]'' Muggs, Danny, and Glimpy enlist and show off their uniforms. In ''Follow The Leader'' (1944), Muggs and Glimpy appear in uniform as they are on leave from the Army. Offscreen, between 1942 and 1944, cast members [[Billy Benedict]], Morrison, Jordan, Dell, and David Gorcey left the series after being drafted. A few days after receiving ''his'' induction notice, Leo Gorcey suffered a near-fatal motorcycle accident and spent almost a year in recovery. His injuries led to a 4-F classification, rendering him unfit for military service.

During Bobby Jordan's absence, his role in the series was taken by former child actor David Durand. Durand had been the star of Columbia's series of "Glove Slingers" campus comedies, and lent the same earnest sincerity to his East Side Kids appearances. (Jordan returned in 1944, in uniform, for a guest appearance in ''Bowery Champs''.)

Starting with ''Clancy Street Boys'' in 1943, Bernard Gorcey (Leo's father) did various bit parts, playing different characters in a total of seven films. In ''Million Dollar Kid'' he and Leo exchanged banter borrowed from an Abbott and Costello routine. He later became a fixture with [[The Bowery Boys]].

Given the low budgets, simplistic stories, and crude, assembly-line production of the East Side Kids series, its enduring popularity relies on the cast's rambunctious energy, breezy banter (often ad-libbed and containing inside jokes), fast-paced action, and Leo Gorcey's trademark [[malapropism|malapropisms]] ("This calls for drastic measurements").

The East Side Kids series was supplanted by [[The Bowery Boys]] in 1946.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}
The '''Eight Great Eminent Officials''' ({{zh|c=八大元老|p=Bā dà yuánlǎo}}), abbreviated as the '''Eight Elders''' ({{zh|c=八老|p=Bā lǎo}}), were a group of elderly members of the [[Communist Party of China]] who held substantial power during the 1980s and 1990s. In the English-speaking world, these men are often called '''The Eight Immortals''' as an [[allusion]] to the Taoist deities commonly known as the [[Eight Immortals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=William A.|title=Politics in China: An Introduction|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-533530-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kk80evDTZIYC&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in "strongman politics" ==
The politburo system was created by the Bolsheviks in 1917, when [[Vladimir Lenin]] established it to command and control the [[October Revolution]]. It was later adopted by the Chinese communists.  In both the early Chinese and Russian politburos, "strongman politics" played a large role in internal decision-making. Politburos under both [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]] were later criticized for being dysfunctional and largely decorative, allowing the top leaders to dictate both party policy and the fate of the other leaders.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Under [[Deng Xiaoping]], important decisions were often made in Deng's home with a caucus of eight senior party cadres, called "Eight Elders". Deng ruled as paramount leader, although he never held the top title of the party or the state. However, Deng was able to remove three Party leaders with the aid of the Eight Elders. [[Hua Guofeng]] was gradually removed from Premier and Party Chairman between 1980 and 1981; [[Hu Yaobang]] was removed in 1987; and, [[Zhao Ziyang]] was removed in 1989.&lt;ref name=scmp20120420xiang&gt;Xiang, Lanxin (Apr 20, 2012). "Bo Xilai probe shows up China's outdated system of government". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descendants ==
Descendants of the Eight Elders who have benefited significantly from nepotism and cronyism constitute a group now known as "the [[Princelings]]" or the "Crown Prince Party". Its members, rising through party ranks, can easily overrule any opposition in their jurisdictions, even if they are assigned to a local administrative position. They are often seen to outrank other party officials and possess greater prestige due to their lineage.&lt;ref name=scmp20120420xiang/&gt; Bloomberg has reported on the extensive wealth accumulated by these descendants via their roles in various public and private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heirs of Mao’s Comrades Rise as New Capitalist Nobility|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-26/immortals-beget-china-capitalism-from-citic-to-godfather-of-golf.html|accessdate=December 28, 2012 | work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The council of '''Eight Men''' was an early representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous [[Twelve Men]] and was followed by the [[Nine Men]].

==Council==
In 1643 [[Abraham Pietersen Van Deusen]] who had served on the [[council of twelve men]] was appointed to a new council of eight men. The council contacted the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] and blamed governor [[Willem Kieft]] for the declining economic condition of the nascent colony, and the [[Kieft's War|war]] with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. They requested that a new [[Director-General of New Netherland]] be appointed and that the people themselves be given more influence in the new government. Director General Kieft was dismissed, and [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took his place and Stuyvesant remained in power until the colony was turned over to the British in 1664. Kieft returned to Holland, but the vessel, the [[Princess Amelia (1634 ship)|''Princess Amelia'']] was lost at sea and his body was never recovered. John Franklin Jameson (1859–1937) writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commonalty were called together; they were sore distressed. They chose eight, in the stead of the previous twelve, persons to aid in consulting for the best; but the occupation every one had to take care of his own, prevented anything beneficial being adopted at that time. nevertheless it was resolved that as many Englishmen as were to be got in the country should be enlisted, who were indeed now proposing to depart; the third part of these were to be paid by the commonalty; this promise was made by the commonalty but was not followed by the pay.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1643 a minor altercation with Indians evolved into a serious uprising followed by an ugly slaughter of Weckquaskeek Indians on Manhattan Island. Kieft feared a major Indian assault. Allerton was asked by Kieft to join a "group of 8 men" to help New Amsterdam. Because he was English and respected in New Haven, Kieft sent Allerton and another Englishman to New Haven in 1643 to ask for men and materials to help defend New Amsterdam. In addition, the "group of 8" was asked to propose measures to improve civility and law-and-order in New Amsterdam. New Haven refused to send men to support the Dutch but Kieft entered into an agreement with the Indians in 1645 that settled the dispute. Because of Kieft's dictatorial manner, several of the eight men petitioned the WIC directors to recall Kieft as Director-General. In time Kieft was replaced by Peter Stuyvesant, and the men initiating the recall petition were accused of insurrection and faced punishment. Allerton was the second signatory of the petition but was not the group's primary spokesman. In 1646, Allerton established a permanent residence in New Haven.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Five Tiger Generals''' is a popular appellation in Chinese culture for any five military generals serving under a ruler. This term is used in literature texts, plays and popular culture. In historical contexts, "Five Tiger Generals" usually refers to the five best military generals serving under the ruler. The term does not appear in Chinese historical records and is not used officially.

==In literature==
When applied to the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, the "Five Tiger Generals" refer to five generals from the state of [[Shu Han]]. In the historical text ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''Sanguozhi''), the biographies of [[Guan Yu]], [[Zhang Fei]], [[Zhao Yun]], [[Ma Chao]] and [[Huang Zhong]] are placed in the same volume. In the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''Sanguo Yanyi''), which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period, the [[Shu Han|Shu]] emperor [[Liu Bei]] actually bestowed the titles of "Five Tiger Generals" on these five generals.&lt;ref&gt;''Sanguo Yanyi'' ch. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The historicity of the Tiger Generals is unknown; those generals existed but it is uncertain whether they were granted the titles contemporarily or posthumously honoured as such.

In the classical novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', five of the 108 outlaws at [[Mount Liang|Liangshan Marsh]] – [[Guan Sheng]], [[Lin Chong]], [[Qin Ming]], [[Huyan Zhuo]] and [[Dong Ping]] – are named the "Five Tiger Generals" of the Liangshan cavalry.

In the historical novel ''[[Shuo Tang]]'', the rebellion force of [[Wagang Army]] has ''Five Tiger Generals'' including [[Qin Shubao]], [[Shan Xiongxin]], [[Cheng Yaojin]], [[Wang Bodang]] and [[Luo Cheng]].

The [[Qing dynasty]] writer Li Yutang named [[Di Qing]], Shi Yu, Zhang Zhong, Li Yi, and Liu Qing as the "Five Tiger Generals" in his works ''Romance of Di Qing'', ''The Five Tigers Conquer the West'', and ''The Five Tigers Pacify the South''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://open-lit.com/listbook.php?cid=2&amp;gbid=106&amp;start=0 Chapter Two of Wuhu Zhengxi]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Heroes of the Ming Dynasty'', a novel romanticising the events leading to the founding of the Ming dynasty, [[Xu Da]], [[Tang He]], [[Chang Yuchun]], [[Hu Dahai]], and [[Mu Ying]] are named the "Five Founding Tiger Generals of Ming".

==Cultural impact==
In present-day terminology, "Five Tiger Generals" can refer to any group of five that is particularly outstanding in a certain field.

Hsiao Shou-li, Chiang Wu-tung, Chiao Tsai-pao, Chen Chun-sheng, and Su Teng-wang are called "Five Tiger Generals" of [[Taiwanese opera]].

Taiwanese politicians Kuo Yu-hsin, Li Wan-chu, Kuo Kuo-chi, Li Yuan-chan, and [[Wu San-lien]] are called the "Five Tiger Generals" of the [[Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council]]. Together with female politician [[Hsu Shih-hsien]], the six of them are called "Five Tigers and the Phoenix".

In the 1980s and 1990s, the five hosts of the Taiwanese television channel [[Sanlih E-Television]], He Yih-hang, Peng Chia-chia, Yang Fan, Yu Tien and Li Teng-tsai are called "Five Tiger Generals".

In the 1980s, [[Hong Kong]] television actors [[Felix Wong]], [[Michael Miu]], [[Kent Tong]], [[Andy Lau]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] are called the "[[Five Tiger Generals (TVB)|Five Tiger Generals]] of [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]]". The five of them starred together in the 1991 film ''[[The Tigers (film)|The Tigers]]''.

In 2009, a Taiwanese musical band called [[Wu Hu Jiang (band)|Wu Hu Jiang]] was formed. The five members starred as the Five Tiger Generals of Shu in the television series ''[[K.O.3an Guo]]'', which spoofs ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' in a modern school setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16279">[[File:Royal Standard of the Netherlands.svg|thumb|260px|Royal Standard of the Netherlands.]]

The '''flags of the Dutch royal family''' are a set of flags used to identify a member of the royal family. The current system of flags for the Dutch monarch, princes, and princesses was introduced in 1908.

== Background ==
The current system of personal flags for the monarch and other members of the royal family was introduced in 1908. In 1907, minor modifications were introduced to the Dutch coat of arms; likewise, a new flag for the Dutch monarch was introduced the following year. These flags are designed by the High Council of Nobility (who are also responsible for heraldry of the royal family) and are granted by royal decree. Like their coats of arms, these flags are usually shared among siblings.

The flags follow a similar pattern and, although not [[banner of arms|banners of arms]], are heavily influenced by heraldry. Flags of those born into the royal family feature a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field, while the colours are reversed for those who marry into the family. Males have near-square flags while those of females are swallowtailed. Elements of an individual's family coat of arms are also incorporated into the flags.

== Use ==
The flags are used to mark the presence of an individual in certain buildings, when on vehicles (e.g. a car or ship), or in an army unit. The flag of the monarch is flown above [[Huis ten Bosch Palace]] in [[The Hague]] (the king's private residence) and above [[Noordeinde Palace]] in The Hague (the king's official residence) when the monarch is in the Netherlands, but not necessarily when he is actually resident. Besides these two residences, the royal standard is flown above other palaces, castles or estates where and when the King is actually staying.

The flags are never flown at half-mast; during a period of mourning, a black [[pennon]] is affixed to the flagpole flying the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal flags|url=https://www.royal-house.nl/topics/flags/personal-flags|website=www.royal-house.nl|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Royal standard ==
The '''royal flag''' ({{lang-nl|koninklijke vlag}}), or the '''royal standard''' of the [[Netherlands]], is the official flag of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarch]]. This flag is a non-personal distinctive flag and is not changed from reign to reign. The current flag, introduced in 1908, is a square [[orange (colour)|orange]] flag, divided in four quarters by a nassau-blue [[cross]]. These colours refer to the principality of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]] (in [[France]]) and the principality of [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] (in [[Germany]]) from which the present royal family originates. 

In the centre of the flag is the lesser [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|coat of arms of the Kingdom]] (which originates as a composite of features taken from the arms of the [[house of Nassau]] and the [[Dutch Republic Lion|arms of the Dutch republic]]) surmounted by a [[Crown (headgear)|royal crown]] and surrounded by the insignia of the Grand Cross of the [[Military William Order]]. Each quarter shows a bugle-horn which originates in arms of the principality of Orange.

Image:Arms of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.svg| [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Upon the accession of King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]] in 2013, the monarch's flag was slightly modified: Instead of a rosette, a bow is placed in the ribbon of the Military William Order. Furthermore, the tassels on the horns now both hang down. The adjustments were applied on 30 April 2013 immediately after Willem-Alexander taking office.

==Princes==
The flag of a Dutch prince is rectangular in shape and of proportions 5:6. Flags of princes born into the royal family consist of a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field. 

Instead of the hunting horn of Orange in the upper right and the lower left quarters found in the monarch's flag, these are replaced with figures obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the prince's parent who married into the royal family. 

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed within an orange circle which replaces the center of the cross.

==Princesses==
The flag of a Dutch princess is [[Swallowtail (flag)|swallowtail]]ed in shape and of proportions 5:6. Flags of princesses born into the royal family consist of a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field while the flags of princesses by marriage are reversed. 

Unlike the flags for princes, the right side of the flag is devoid of the hunting horn of Orange and personal figure. However, the left portion of a princesse's flag contains the usual hunting horn of Orange and personal figure (obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the princess's parent who married into the royal family) in the upper and lower left quarters of the flag respectively.

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed either within an orange circle which replaces the center of a blue cross, or at the centre of an orange cross.

==Consorts==
In general, the standard of a prince consort of the Netherlands is a rectangular flag with proportions 5:6 with the colours of the royal standard (i.e. the orange field and blue cross) reversed. The upper left and lower right quarters bear the lion from the Dutch coat of arms (holding arrows in one hand and brandishing a sword on the other) while the other two quarters have a personal figure taken from their personal coat of arms.

In general, the standard of a queen consort, or the wife of a prince of the Netherlands, is a flag in the form of a swallow tail. The two right quarters are empty, the upper left corner bears the orange horn taken from the arms of the Principality of Orange and the lower left quarter has a personal figure, taken from their personal coat of arms.

In both cases, the coat of arms of the kingdom is at the center of the cross.

'''''Gradshteyn and Ryzhik''''' ('''GR''') is the informal name of a comprehensive [[table of integrals]] originally compiled by the Russian mathematicians I. S. Gradshteyn and I. M. Ryzhik. Its full title today is '''''Table of Integrals, Series, and Products'''''.

Since its first publication in 1943, it was considerably expanded and it soon became a "classic" and highly regarded reference for mathematicians, scientists and engineers. After the deaths of the original authors, the work was maintained and further expanded by other editors.

At some stage a German and English dual-language translation became available, followed by Polish, English-only and Japanese versions. After several further editions, the Russian and German-English versions went out of print and have not been updated after [[the fall of the Iron Curtain]], but the English version is still being actively maintained and refined by new editors, and it has recently been retranslated back into Russian as well.

==Overview==
One of the valuable characteristics of ''Gradshteyn and Ryzhik'' compared to similar compilations is that most listed integrals are referenced. The literature list contains 92 main entries and 140 additional entries (in the eighth English edition). The integrals are classified by numbers, which haven't changed from the fourth Russian up to the seventh English edition (the numbering in older editions as well as in the eighth English edition is not fully compatible).
The book does not only contain the integrals, but also lists additional properties and related [[special function]]s.
It also includes tables for [[integral transform]]s.
Another advantage of ''Gradshteyn and Ryzhik'' compared to [[computer algebra system]]s is the fact that all special functions and constants used in the evaluation of the integrals are listed in a registry as well, thereby allowing reverse lookup of integrals based on special functions or constants.

On the downsides, ''Gradshteyn and Ryzhik'' has become known to contain a relatively high number of typographical errors even in newer editions, which has repeatedly led to the publication of extensive [[errata]] lists. Earlier English editions were also criticized for their poor translation of mathematical terms&lt;ref name="RMT_85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REV_153_5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REV_209_1"/&gt; and mediocre print quality.&lt;ref name="RMT_85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REV_153_5"/&gt;

In the foreword of the first edition by Ryzhik, the author thanked three mathematicians of the [[Moscow Mathematical Society]] for their suggestions and advice:

The third edition (1951) was worked on by Gradshteyn, who also introduced the chapter numbering system in [[decimal notation]].

In 1963, it was followed by the second edition, a reprint edition with a four-page inlet listing corrections compiled by [[Eldon Robert Hansen]].

Derived from the 1963 edition, but considerably expanded, the third German-English edition by {{lang|de|Ludwig Boll}}&lt;ref group="nb" name="Boll_Bio"&gt;Ludwig Boll (1906–? or 1951?–1987), {{GND|116236140|1068090308}}?&lt;/ref&gt; was finally published in 1981; it incorporated the material of the fifth Russian edition (1971) as well.

Pending this third German-English edition an English-only edition by Alan Jeffrey&lt;ref group="nb" name="Jeffrey_Bio"&gt;Alan Jeffrey (1929-07-16 to 2010-06-06), {{GND|113118120}}.

Lacking a clear designation by itself it was variously known as first, third&lt;!-- as it followed the 2nd German-English edition and because this edition number fits in nicely after the publication of the (actually so called) fifth English edition in 1994 --&gt; or fourth English edition, as it was based on the then-current fourth Russian edition. The formulas were photographically reproduced and the text translated. This still held true for the expanded fourth English edition in 1980, which added chapters 10 to 17.&lt;ref name="ZBL_521-193-1"/&gt;

Both of these editions saw multiple [[print run]]s each incorporating newly found corrections. Starting with the third printing&lt;!-- 1967 or 1969? --&gt;, updated table entries were marked by adding a small superscript number to the entry number indicating the corresponding print run ("3" etc.&lt;!-- print run "7" of 4th edition is documented for 1990 --&gt;), a convention carried over into later editions by continuing to increase the superscript number as kind of a [[revision number]] (no longer directly corresponding with actual print runs).

The fifth edition (1994), which contained close to 20&amp;thinsp;000 formulas,&lt;ref name="ZBL_918-65002"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="Formula_Entry"/&gt; was electronically reset&lt;ref name="REV_209_1"/&gt; in preparation for a CD-ROM issue of the fifth edition (1996) and in anticipation of further editions.

{{Islam}}
The [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]], specified ten of his [[Sahabah|companions]] who were promised paradise. Those companions named in this hadith are referred to as '''The Ten With Glad Tidings Of Paradise''' ({{lang-ar|العشرة المبشرون بالجنة}}; ''al-`Asharaa al-Mubasharûn bi-l-Janna'').

==The Hadith==

{{Quote|Narrated [[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]]:&lt;br&gt;that the Messenger of Allah said: "[[Abu Bakr]] is in Paradise, '[[Umar]] is in Paradise, '[[Uthman]] is in Paradise, '[[Ali]] is in Paradise, [[Talhah]] is in Paradise, [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam|Az-Zubair]] is in Paradise, '[[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]] is in Paradise, [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas|Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas]] is in Paradise, [[Sa'id ibn Zayd]] is in Paradise, and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu 'Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah]] is in Paradise."|Collected by [[Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi]]|''[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/urn/636260|title=Hadith - Chapters on Virtues - Jami` at-Tirmidhi - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|author=|date=|website=sunnah.com|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Muslim view==
[[Muslim]]s put different weight on this hadith, the majority of the [[Sunni]]s, viewing it as very favourable whilst the [[Shia|Shiites]] dismmissed it in its entirety.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
This hadith was narrated in three collections by Tirmidhi, Abu Dawood, and [[Ibn Majah]].

The Sunni collection of hadith, called the ''[[Kutub al-Sittah]]'' (six major hadith collections), includes: ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'', ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'', ''Sunan Abu Dawood'', ''[[Al-Sunan al-Sughra]]'', ''Jami` at-Tirmidhi'' and ''[[Sunan ibn Majah]]''. ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' and ''Sahih Muslim'' are considered the most reliable of these collections.&lt;ref&gt;Muqaddimah Ibn al-Salah, pg. 160 Dar al-Ma’aarif edition; al-Tirmithi, under #3748; al-Tirmithi, Volume 5, Page 605, Hadith 3748; Abu Daoud, #4649 and #4650&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunnis say that Muhammad's companions were sorted into twelve groups and of these the ten promised paradise were ranked first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caliphtv.com/files/khalid.bin.waleed/khalid/companions.html Twelve Ranks of the Companions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423065308/http://www.caliphtv.com/files/khalid.bin.waleed/khalid/companions.html |date=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Perseo in Villa San Marco Stabiae.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Perseus and the head of Medusa in a Roman fresco at [[Stabiae]]. Unlike medieval and modern heroes, classical heroes did great deeds out of esteem and fame rather than out of any concern for the good of people]]

A '''hero''' (masculine) or '''heroine''' (feminine) is a real person or a main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of [[ingenuity]], [[bravery]] or [[Physical strength|strength]]; the original hero type of classical epics did such things for the sake of glory and honor. On the other hand are [[Medieval]] and [[modern history|modern]] heroes, who perform great deeds for the common good instead of the classical goal of pride and fame.

The concept of the hero can be found in [[classical literature]]. It is the main or revered character in [[Epic poetry|heroic epic poetry]] celebrated through ancient legends of a people, often striving for military conquest and living by a continually flawed personal honor code.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia|url = http://academic.eb.com/EBchecked/topic/263398/hero|website = academic.eb.com|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of a hero has changed throughout time. [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam Webster]] dictionary defines a hero as "a person who is admired for great or brave acts or fine qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hero|title=Definition of HERO|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of heroes range from mythological figures, such as [[Gilgamesh]], [[Achilles]] and [[Iphigenia]], to historical figures, such as [[Joan of Arc]] or [[Sophie Scholl]], modern heroes like [[Alvin York]], [[Audie Murphy]] and [[Chuck Yeager]], and fictional [[superheroes]], including [[Superman]] and [[Batman]].

==Etymology==
The word ''hero'' comes from the Greek ἥρως (''hērōs''), "hero" (literally "protector" or "defender"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hero|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly one such as [[Heracles]] with divine ancestry or later given divine honors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dh%28%2Frws ἥρως]
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; Before the decipherment of [[Linear B]] the original form of the word was assumed to be *{{lang|grc|ἥρωϝ-}}, ''hērōw-'', but the Mycenaean compound ''ti-ri-se-ro-e'' demonstrates the absence of -w-.

According to the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root is ''*ser'' meaning "to protect". According to Eric Partridge in ''Origins,'' the Greek word  ''Hērōs'' "is akin to" the Latin ''seruāre,'' meaning ''to safeguard''. Partridge concludes, "The basic sense of both [[Hera]] and hero would therefore be 'protector'." [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejects an Indo-European derivation and asserts that the word has a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
{{see also|Greek hero cult}}
A classical hero is considered to be a "warrior who lives and dies in the pursuit of honor" and asserts their greatness by "the brilliancy and efficiency with which they kill".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each classical hero's life focuses on fighting, which occurs in war or during an epic quest. Classical heroes are commonly semi-divine and extraordinarily gifted, like [[Achilles]], evolving into heroic characters through their perilous circumstances.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; While these heroes are incredibly resourceful and skilled, they are often foolhardy, court disaster, risk their followers' lives for trivial matters, and behave arrogantly in a childlike manner.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; During classical times, people regarded heroes with the highest esteem and utmost importance, explaining their prominence within epic literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = Saul | year = 1984 | title = Love and the Hero of the Iliad | url = | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 43–50 | doi=10.2307/283510| jstor = 283510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of these mortal figures marks a revolution of audiences and writers turning away from [[Twelve Olympians|immortal gods]] to mortal mankind, whose heroic moments of glory survive in the memory of their descendants, extending their legacy.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

[[Hector]] was a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the [[Trojan War]], which is known primarily through [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Iliad]]''. Hector acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defense of Troy, "killing 31,000 Greek fighters," offers Hyginus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Hector was known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, Homer places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. However, his familial values conflict greatly with his heroic aspirations in ''The Iliad,'' as he cannot be both the protector of [[Troy]] and a father to his child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hector is ultimately betrayed by the gods when [[Athena]] appears disguised as his ally [[Deiphobus]] and convinces him to take on Achilles, leading to his death at the hands of a superior warrior.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad.'' Trans. Robert Fagles (1990). NY: Penguin Books. Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The_Rage_of_Achilles,_by_Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo_(1696-1770),_Italian_Rococo_painter.jpg|thumb|An 18th century depiction of ''The Rage of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]|302x302px]][[Achilles]] was a Greek Hero who was considered the most formidable military fighter in the entire Trojan War and the central character of ''The Iliad.'' He was the child of [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], making him a [[Demigod|demi-god]]. He wielded superhuman strength on the battlefield and was blessed with a close relationship to the [[Greek gods|Gods]]. Achilles famously refuses to fight after his dishonoring at the hands of Agamemnon, and only returns to the war due to unadulterated rage after Hector kills his close friend [[Patroclus]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Achilles was known for uncontrollable rage that defined many of his bloodthirsty actions, such as defiling Hector's corpse by dragging it around the city of Troy. Achilles plays a tragic role in ''The Iliad'' brought about by constant [https://books.google.com/books?id=5TFUv2VRKd8C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=achilles+dehumanization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5D2sb_hGx_&amp;sig=iJrfJQdt0VhRVG2iJoRf-Nc6oqA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje8uWTosvJAhWGyT4KHZE7BUoQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=achilles%20dehumanization&amp;f=false de-humanization] throughout the epic, having his ''menis'' (wrath) overpower his ''philos'' (love).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Mortal Hero: An Introduction to Homer's Iliad|last = Schein|first = Seth|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heroes in myth often had close but conflicted relationships with the gods. Thus Heracles's name means "the glory of [[Hera]]", even though he was tormented all his life by Hera, the Queen of the Gods. Perhaps the most striking example is the Athenian king [[Erechtheus]], whom [[Poseidon]] killed for choosing [[Athena]] over him as the city's patron god. When the Athenians worshiped Erechtheus on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], they invoked him as ''Poseidon  Erechtheus''.

[[Destiny|Fate]], or destiny, plays a massive role in the stories of classical heroes. The classical hero's heroic significance stems from battlefield conquests, an inherently dangerous action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The gods in [[Greek mythology|Greek Mythology]], when interacting with the heroes, often foreshadow the hero's eventual death on the battlefield. Countless heroes and gods go to great lengths to alter their  pre-destined fate, but with no success, as no immortal can change their prescribed outcomes by the [[Fates|three Fates]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.auburn.wednet.edu/cms/lib03/WA01001938/Centricity/Domain/2205/Fate%20reading.pdf|title = Articles and musing on the concept of Fate for the ancient Greeks|date = |accessdate = |website = Auburn University|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent example of this is found in ''[[Oedipus Rex]].'' After learning that his son, [[Oedipus]], will end up killing him, the King of Thebes, [[Laius]], takes huge steps to assure his son's death by removing him from the kingdom. But, Oedipus slays his father without an afterthought when he unknowingly encounters him in a dispute on the road many years later. The lack of recognition enabled Oedipus to slay his father, ironically further binding his father to his fate.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Stories of heroism may serve as [[moral example]]s. However, classical heroes often didn't embody the Christian notion of an upstanding, perfectly moral hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Four Conceptions of the Heroic|url = http://www.fellowshipofreason.com/archives/4heroes.htm|website = www.fellowshipofreason.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Achilles's character-issues of hateful rage lead to merciless slaughter and his overwhelming pride lead to him only joining the Trojan War because he didn't want his soldiers to win all of the glory. Classical heroes, regardless of their morality, were placed in religion. In [[classical antiquity]], cults that venerated deified heroes such as [[Heracles]], [[Perseus]], and [[Achilles]] played an important role in Ancient Greek religion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Graf, Fritz. (2006) "Hero Cult." ''Brills New Pauly.'' Retrieved from http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/hero-cult-e511460?s.num=1&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.brill-s-new-pauly&amp;s.q=hero.&lt;/ref&gt; These ancient [[Greek hero cult]]s worshipped heroes from oral [[Epic Cycle|epic tradition]], with these heroes often bestowing blessings, especially healing ones, on individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Myth and monomyth==
[[File:JourneytotheWest.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The four heroes from the 16th-century Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'']]
The concept of the "Mythic Hero Archetype" was first developed by [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]] in his 1936 book, ''The Hero, A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama''. It is a set of 22 common traits that he said were shared by many heroes in various cultures, myths and religions throughout history and around the world.  Raglan argued that the higher the score, the more likely the figure is mythical.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Raglan. ''The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama by Lord Raglan'', Dover Publications, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a story archetype of the standard [[monomyth]]ical "hero's [[quest]]" that was reputed to be pervasive across all cultures is somewhat controversial. Expounded mainly by [[Joseph Campbell]] in his 1949 work ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', it illustrates several uniting themes of hero stories that hold similar ideas of what a hero represents, despite vastly different cultures and beliefs. The monomyth or Hero's Journey  consists of three separate stages including the Departure, Initiation, and Return. Within these stages there are several archetypes that the hero or heroine may follow including the call to adventure (which they may initially refuse), supernatural aid, proceeding down a road of trials, achieving a realization about themselves (or an apotheosis), and attaining the freedom to live through their quest or journey. Campbell offered examples of stories with similar themes  such as [[Krishna]], [[Buddha]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Joseph Campbell in ''The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' Princeton University Press, 2004 [1949], 140, {{ISBN|0-691-11924-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the themes he explores is the androgynous hero, who combines male and female traits, like Bodhisattva: "The first wonder to be noted here is the androgynous character of the Bodhisattva: masculine Avalokiteshvara, feminine Kwan Yin."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his 1968 book, ''The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology'', Campbell writes "It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adonis]], and [[Osiris]] cycles."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Campbell]]. The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology'' Penguin, reprinted, {{ISBN|0-14-004306-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavic fairy tales==
[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan Tsarevich]], a hero of [[Slavic mythology|Russian folklore]]]]
[[Vladimir Propp]], in his analysis of the Russian [[fairy tale]], concluded that a fairy tale had only eight ''[[dramatis personæ]]'', of which one was the hero,&lt;ref name="Propp"&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p. 80}} and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian folklore. The actions that fall into such a hero's sphere include:
# Departure on a quest
# Reacting to the test of a [[Donor (fairy tale)|donor]]
# Marrying a princess (or similar figure)
Propp distinguished between ''seekers'' and ''victim-heroes''. A [[villain]] could initiate the issue by kidnapping the hero or driving him out; these were victim-heroes. On the other hand, an antagonist could rob the hero, or kidnap someone close to him, or, without the villain's intervention, the hero could realize that he lacked something and set out to find it; these heroes are seekers. Victims may appear in tales with seeker heroes, but the tale does not follow them both.&lt;ref name="Propp" /&gt;{{Rp|36}}

==Historical studies==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Philosophy of history]] --&gt;
{{Further information|Philosophy of history|Great man theory}}
No history can be written without consideration of the lengthy list of [[List of medals for bravery|recipients of national medals for bravery]], populated by firefighters, policemen and policewomen, ambulance medics and ordinary have-a-go heroes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/12/25/1040511087609.html smh.com.au: "Everyday heroes"], 26 Dec 2002&lt;/ref&gt; These persons risked their lives to try to save or protect the lives of others: for example, the Canadian [[Cross of Valour (Canada)|Cross of Valour (C.V.)]] "recognizes acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=13503 gg.ca: "Decorations for Bravery Ceremony"], 2 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt; examples of recipients are [[Mary Dohey]] and [[David Gordon Cheverie]].

The philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] gave a central role to the "hero", personalized by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], as the incarnation of a particular culture's ''[[Volksgeist]]'', and thus of the general ''[[Zeitgeist]]''. [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s 1841 ''On Heroes, Hero Worship and the Heroic in History'' also accorded a key function to heroes and great men in history. Carlyle centered history on the [[biography]] of a few central individuals such as [[Oliver Cromwell]] or [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]. His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men included geniuses good and, perhaps for the first time in historical study, evil.

Explicit defenses of Carlyle's position were rare in the second part of the 20th century. Most in the [[philosophy of history]] school contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one that Carlyle used for his portraits. For example, [[Karl Marx]] argued that history was determined by the massive social forces at play in "[[class struggle]]s", not by the individuals by whom these forces are played out. After Marx, [[Herbert Spencer]] wrote at the end of the 19th century: "You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him."&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;Spencer, Herbert. ''[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=96277756  The Study of Sociology]'', Appleton, 1896, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]] argued in [[Philosophy of history#Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse|his analysis of societal communication and debate]] that history was mainly the "science of the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]]", until its inversion by the "historical and political popular discourse".

[[File:Mandela Bust at Southbank.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of Nelson Mandela erected on London's [[South Bank]] by the [[Greater London Council]] administration of [[Ken Livingstone]] in 1985]]
[[File:Raoul Wallenberg.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Swedish Diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] saved the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest during World War II.&lt;ref name="thomas.loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Library of Congress: Bill Summary &amp; Status 112th Congress (2011–2012) H.R. 3001|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3001:}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/wallenberg/tributes/philately/3368.htm | title = Holocaust Hero Honored on Postage Stamp | accessdate = | year = 1996 | publisher = [[United States Postal Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Modern examples of the typical hero are  [[Minnie Vautrin]], [[Norman Bethune]],  [[Alan Turing]], [[Raoul Wallenberg]], [[Chiune Sugihara]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Mother Teresa]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Oswaldo Paya]], [[Oscar Biscet]], and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].

The [[Annales School]], led by [[Lucien Febvre]], [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Fernand Braudel]], would contest the exaggeration of the role of [[subject (philosophy)|individual subjects]] in history. Indeed, Braudel distinguished various time scales, one accorded to the life of an individual, another accorded to the life of a few human generations, and the last one to [[civilization]]s, in which [[geography]], [[economics]] and [[demography]] play a role considerably more decisive than that of individual subjects.

Among noticeable events in the studies of the role of the hero and [[Great men theory|Great man]] in history one should mention [[Sydney Hook]]'s book (1943) ''[[Sidney Hook#The Hero in History|The Hero in History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, S. 1955 [1943]. The Hero in History. A Study in Limitation and Possibility. Boston, MA: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the twentieth century such male-focused theory has been contested, among others by feminists writers such as [[Judith Fetterley]] in ''The Resisting Reader'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Resisting Reader|last = Fetterley|first = Judith|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 1977|isbn = |location = Bloomington, IN|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and literary theorist [[Nancy K. Miller]], ''The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722–1782''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722–1782|last = Miller|first = Nancy K.|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the epoch of [[globalization]] an individual can still change the development of the country and of the whole world so this gives reasons to some scholars to suggest returning to the problem of the role of the hero in history from the viewpoint of modern historical knowledge and using up-to-date methods of historical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, Leonid]]  2010. The Role of an Individual in History: A Reconsideration. Social Evolution &amp; History, Vol. 9 No. 2 (pp. 95–136) [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129622/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the frameworks of developing [[counterfactual history]], attempts are made to examine some hypothetical scenarios of historical development. The hero attracts much attention because most of those scenarios are based on the suppositions: what would have happened if this or that historical individual had or had not been alive.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson. W. The Lead Economy Sequence in World Politics (From Sung China to the United States): Selected Counterfactuals. Journal of Globalization Studies. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2010. pp. 6–28 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/126971/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender differences ==
If the term "heroine" exists,{{clarify|reason=|date=September 2018}} "hero" is often the predominantly used term even though its neutrality can be put into question. The definitions of the heroine often refer back to the one of the hero, but sometimes insinuate that their deeds are of less value, or were obtained only thanks to their love of God or a country or of a man. Therefore, implying that an external explanation for the extraordinary nature of her deeds is needed to justify them. The warrior women is considered unholy, unnatural. These figures tend to be erased because they don't fit in the feminine values they are supposed to represent.
Acts of heroism coming from women are acceptable, during specific time, like when men are at war, during times of crisis, but they are otherwise often seen as suspicious. Moreover, women are often not individualized, but praised as a group for heroic deeds. [[Women in the military]] were often subordinated to tasks less likely to be praised than armed combat, and are rather praised for their courage as a general force, nurses during wartime are a good example of this phenomenon.
If their story gets told, they are made to fit in the acceptable script. Their story is told in a way as to match the expectations of [[femininity]] ex: maternal love, compassion, fidelity, resistance, defense. Etc. So the set of strengths in which a heroine could historically express her value are overall not the same and perceived as less valuable than their [[masculine]] counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;

If they get mentioned in history, the way their story is told also differs from their male counterpart, they are generally portrayed as young and beautiful, their actions are limited to a short time
lapse in opposition to the possibility of a long heroic career for male heroes, underlying feelings that led to their heroic acts are underlined, overall less details about their life are kept and
emphasis is put over their tragic death. Not to forget that heroes and heroines are part of a social construct, their history is told and changes throughout history to serve different purposes of memory, propaganda according to diverse social, political or religious evolutions.&lt;ref&gt;

==Modern fiction==
{{Further information|Vanity Fair (novel)|Superhero}}

[[File:Batman_and_Robin_1966.JPG|thumb|225x225px|[[Batman]] ([[Adam West]]) and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (Burt Ward) in the 1966–1968 TV Series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''.]]
	 
The word "hero" or "heroine", in modern times, is sometimes used to describe the [[protagonist]] or the [[Romantic interest (theatre)|love interest]] of a story, a usage which can conflict with the superhuman expectations of heroism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A classic example is [[Anna Karenina]], the lead character in the novel of the same title by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In modern literature the hero is more and more a problematic concept. In 1848, for example, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] gave ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' the subtitle ''A Novel without a Hero'', and imagined a world in which no sympathetic character was to be found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p. 34, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vanity Fair'' is a satirical representation of the absence of truly moral heroes in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Shmoop Editorial Team. (2008, November 11). ''Vanity Fair Theme of Morality and Ethics''. Retrieved December 6, 2015, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.shmoop.com/vanity-fair-thackeray/morality-ethics-theme.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The story focuses on the characters Emmy Sedley and Becky Sharpe (the latter as the clearly defined anti-hero), with the plot focused on the eventual marriage of these two characters to rich men, revealing character flaws as the story progresses. Even the most sympathetic characters, like Captain Dobbin, are susceptible to weakness, as he is often narcissistic and melancholy.

The larger-than-life hero is a more common feature of [[fantasy]] (particularly in [[Comic book|comic-books]] and [[High fantasy|epic fantasy]]) than more realist works.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]:  The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 5 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these larger-than life figures remain prevalent in society. The [[superhero]] genre is a multibillion-dollar industry that includes comic books, movies, toys and video games. Superheroes usually possess extraordinary talents and powers that no living human could ever emulate. The superhero stories often pit a [[Supervillain|super villain]] against the hero, with the hero fighting the crime caused by the super villain. Examples of long-running superheroes include [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wonder Woman]].

==Psychology==
[[Social psychology]] has begun paying attention to heroes and heroism. Zeno Franco and [[Philip Zimbardo]] point out differences between heroism and altruism, and they offer evidence that observers' perceptions of unjustified risk plays a role above and beyond risk type in determining the ascription of heroic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Franco | first1 = Z. | last2 = Blau | first2 = K. | last3 = Zimbardo | first3 = P. | year = 2011 | title = Heroism: A conceptual analysis and differentiation between heroic action and altruism | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-07260-001/ | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 99–113 | doi=10.1037/a0022672| citeseerx = 10.1.1.366.8315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for heroic risk-taking is that it is a [[costly signal]] demonstrating the ability of the hero. It can be seen as one form of [[altruism]] for which there are also several other evolutionary explanations.&lt;ref name=AEP1&gt;Pat Barcaly. The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation. In {{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S.

Roma Chatterji has suggested that the hero or more generally protagonist is first and foremost a symbolic representation of the person who is experiencing the story while reading, listening or watching;&lt;ref name=Chatterji&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatterji|first=Roma|date=January 1986|title=The Voyage of the Hero: The Self and the Other in One Narrative Tradition of Purulia|journal=Contributions to Indian Sociology|issue=19|pages=95–114|doi=10.1177/006996685019001007|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the relevance of the hero to the individual relies a great deal on how much similarity there is between the two. One reason for the hero-as-self interpretation of stories and myths is the human inability to view the world from any perspective but a personal one.

In the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[The Denial of Death]]'', [[Ernest Becker]] argues that human civilization is ultimately an elaborate, symbolic defense mechanism against the knowledge of our mortality, which in turn acts as the emotional and intellectual response to our basic [[survival mechanism]]. Becker explains that a basic duality in human life exists between the physical world of objects and a symbolic world of human meaning. Thus, since humanity has a dualistic nature consisting of a physical self and a symbolic self, we are able to transcend the [[dilemma]] of mortality through [[heroism]], by focusing our attention mainly on our symbolic selves. This symbolic self-focus takes the form of an individual's "[[immortality]] project" (or "''[[causa sui]]'' project"), which is essentially a symbolic belief-system that ensures oneself is believed superior to physical reality.  By successfully living under the terms of the immortality project, people feel they can become heroic and, henceforth, part of something eternal; something that will never die as compared to their physical body. This, in turn, gives people the feeling that their lives have meaning, a purpose, and are significant in the grand scheme of things. Another theme running throughout the book is that humanity's traditional "hero-systems", such as [[religion]], are no longer convincing in the [[Age of Enlightenment|age of reason]]. Science attempts to serve as an immortality project, something that Becker believes it can never do, because it is unable to provide agreeable, absolute meanings to human life. The book states that we need new convincing "illusions" that enable us to feel heroic in ways that are agreeable. Becker, however, does not provide any definitive answer, mainly because he believes that there is no perfect solution. Instead, he hopes that gradual realization of humanity's innate motivations, namely death, can help to bring about a better world. [[Terror Management Theory]] has generated evidence supporting this perspective.

The '''Imperial Standards of Iran''' were the personal official flags of the [[Shāhanshāh]], [[Shahbānū]], and Crown Prince of Iran, adopted at the beginning of 1971.

The official flag of Shāhanshāh consisted of a pale-blue field with the [[flag of Iran]] in the upper left corner and the Pahlavi coat of arms in the centre. At the top of the coat of arms was the Pahlavi crown, created for the Coronation of [[Rezā Shāh of Iran|Rezā Shāh]] in 1926. The Imperial motto of Pahlavi is "''Mara dad farmud va Khod Davar Ast''" ("Justice He bids me do, as He will judge me" or, alternatively, "He gave me power to command, and He is the judge").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ir_imp-i.html|title=Iranian Empire (Pahlavi dynasty): Imperial standards|accessdate=2007-05-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412122220/http://fotw.net/flags/ir_imp-i.html|archivedate=2007-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pale blue]] was the colour of the Imperial Family. The uniforms of the Imperial Guard included this colour to show their allegiance.

'''Jeanne Louise Calment''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒan lwiz kalmɑ̃|lang}}; 21 February 1875 – 4 August 1997) was a French [[supercentenarian]] who has the [[Oldest people|longest confirmed human lifespan]] of 122 years, 164 days.

She lived in [[Arles]] all her life, outliving both her daughter and grandson. She became the oldest living person on 11 January 1988 at 112, one hundred years after encountering [[Vincent van Gogh]], who visited her father's shop. She was declared the oldest person ever on 17 October 1995 at 120.

Although Calment came from a long-living family, there is no particular explanation for her remarkable longevity. She had lived a comfortable and stress-free life, with a healthy appetite and a daily exercise routine, enabling her to walk without a stick until 114.

==Early life==
[[File:Acte de naissance de Jeanne Calment.png|thumb|rt|upright=1.14|[[Birth certificate]] of Jeanne Louise Calment]]

Calment was born in Arles, [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], Southern France on 21 February 1875.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath&gt;{{cite news | first=Craig R.| last=Whitney| title=Jeanne Calment, World's Elder, Dies at 122| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7D7113DF936A3575BC0A961958260| work=New York Times| date=5 August 1997| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Nicolas Calment (8 November 1837– 28 January 1931)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09a.htm|title=Validation of Exceptional Longevity - Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life|last=Wilhelm|first=Peter|website=www.demogr.mpg.de|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was a [[shipbuilding|shipbuilder]], and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was from a family of [[miller]]s. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan, although none lived anywhere near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to 93, and her mother to 86.

==Personal life==
From the age of seven until her [[first communion|first holy communion]], Jeanne Calment attended Madame Benet's church primary school in Arles, and then attended the local college, finishing at the age of 16 with the diploma ''brevet Classique'', after which she continued to live with her parents, awaiting marriage, painting, and improving her piano skills.&lt;ref name = YouTube1994&gt;{{YouTube|cB_yIlnaryg|Interview with Jeanne Calment, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Allard1998Englishchapter2&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=27–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 April 1896, at the age of 21, she married her [[Double cousin|double second cousin]], Fernand Nicolas Calment (1868–1942). Their paternal grandfathers were brothers, hence the same surname and their paternal grandmothers were also sisters.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck&gt;{{cite web | title=Validation of Exceptional Longevity – Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life| url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09.htm| publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]]| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernand was a wealthy shop owner and she moved into the apartments above his shop ''Grands Magasins de Nouveautés'', where she lived until the age of 110.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; His wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work; instead they led a leisured lifestyle within the upper society of Arles, pursuing hobbies such as fencing, cycling (at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]), tennis,  swimming, rollerskating at [[Alyscamps]], and playing the piano and making music with friends.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt;

In the summer, the couple would stay at [[Uriage]] for mountaineering all the way up to the glacier. She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the [[Provence]] to shoot rabbits and [[wild boar]]s, but disliked killing birds.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1&gt;{{Cite book | last=Garoyan| first=Georges| year=1990| title=Cent-quatorze ans de vie ou la longue histoire de Jeanne Calment, doyenné d'âge de France [One Hundred and Fourteen Years of Life or the Long History of Jeanne Calment, the Eldest of France]| location=Marseille| publisher= Université d'Aix-Marseille II| pages=4–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considered the most important historical event in her lifetime to have been the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the [[Execution of the Romanov family|execution of the Russian imperial family]], a view shared by many fellow centenarians.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter12&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=113–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second World War had little effect on her life in the south of France. German soldiers slept in her rooms but she bore no grudge against them because "they did not take anything away". In 1942, Fernand ate cherries treated with [[Copper(II) sulfate#As a fungicide and herbicide|copper sulfate]] the day before, developed [[jaundice]], and died of the poisoning in the course of one and a half months on 2 October 1942 at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; Jeanne had eaten fewer of the cherries and survived.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter6/&gt;

Their only child, a daughter named Yvonne Marie Nicolle Calment (19 January 1898 – 19 January 1934), produced a grandson, Frédéric Billiot, on 23 December 1926.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; Yvonne died from [[pneumonia]], after which Calment raised Frédéric herself.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news | title = World's oldest person dies at 122| url = http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/04/obit.oldest/| publisher=CNN| date=4 August 1997| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frédéric became a doctor, and lived with her until his death in an automobile accident in 1963.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;

[[File:JeanneCalmentaged20.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Calment at age 20 in 1895]]
In 1965, at age 90 and with no heirs, Calment signed a contract to sell her apartment to lawyer André-François Raffray, retaining a [[life estate]].&lt;ref name=LifeLease&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/29/world/a-120-year-lease-on-life-outlasts-apartment-heir.html |title=A 120-Year Lease on Life Outlasts Apartment Heir |author=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=28 December 1995 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raffray, then aged 47 years, agreed to pay her a monthly sum of 2,500 [[French franc|francs]] (€381.12) until she died. Raffray ended up paying Calment the equivalent of more than €140,000, more than double the apartment's value. After Raffray's death from cancer at the age of 77, in 1995, his family continued the payments until Calment's death.&lt;ref name=LifeLease/&gt; Calment's comment on this situation was reported to be, "In life, one sometimes makes bad deals."&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;  During all these years, Calment used to say to them that she "competed with [[Methuselah]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boutique.ina.fr/video/CAB89003100/jeanne-calment-114-and-a-rencontre-van-gogh.fr.html |title=From an interview made in 1989 |publisher=Boutique.ina.fr |date=21 January 1989 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, she moved into a nursing home, having lived on her own until age 110.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;

==Recognition and registration as record-breaker==
[[File:JeanneCalmentaged22.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Calment at age 22 in 1897]]
On 20 June 1986 Jeanne Calment became the oldest living person in France at the age of 111 when Eugenie Roux died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Go, granny, go |url= |newspaper=The Anniston Star|location=Anniston, Alabama |date=July 2, 1986|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her international fame escalated in 1988, when the centenary of [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s visit to Arles provided an occasion to meet reporters. She said at the time that she had met Van Gogh 100 years before, in 1888, as a thirteen-year-old girl in her uncle's shop,&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref name=mccook&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VqEgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7GgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6026%2C3313956| title=World's oldest person dead| date=4 August 1997| work=McCook Daily Gazette| page=1| accessdate=5 May 2011| location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he bought some canvas, later describing him as "ugly" (''laid''), "blighted by [[Alcoholism#Signs and symptoms|alcohol]]" (''brûlé par l'alcool''), and visiting [[Prostitution in France|brothels]] (''il fréquentait des maisons de tolérance'').&lt;ref name=YouTube1994/&gt;

After her 1988 interview, at age 112, Calment was given the [[Guinness World Records]] title for the world's ‘Oldest person (living)’ upon the death of [[Florence Knapp (supercentenarian)|Florence Knapp]] on 11 January 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/60at60/2015/8/1988-oldest-living-human-being-of-all-time-392901 '''1988: Oldest Living Human Being of All Time'']; Guinness World Records&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, however, the title was withdrawn and given to [[Carrie C. White]] of Florida, who claimed to have been born in 1874, although this was discounted by subsequent census research.&lt;ref name=SunJournal&gt;{{cite news | first = Ronda| last = Addy| title = Life Expectancy| url = http://www.sunjournal.com/index.php?t=8&amp;storyid=267178&amp;subpub=118| archive-url = https://archive.is/20090201092634/http://www.sunjournal.com/index.php?t=8&amp;storyid=267178&amp;subpub=118| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 1 February 2009| work = [[Sun Journal (Lewiston)| Sun Journal]]| date = 25 May 2008| accessdate = 6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon White's death on 14 February 1991, Calment, then a week shy of 116, became recognized as the oldest living person, though there are unverified claims that older people were alive at the time (see [[Longevity claims]] and [[Longevity myths]]).

At the age of 114, she appeared briefly in the 1990 film ''[[Vincent and Me]]'' as herself, becoming the oldest person ever to appear in a motion picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Oldest Person| url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-5000/oldest-person/| work=[[Guinness World Records]]| accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film about her life, entitled ''Beyond 120 Years with Jeanne Calment'', was released in 1995.&lt;ref name=LastingTribute&gt;{{cite web | title=Tribute to Jeanne Calment, memorial – Lasting tribute| url=http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/calment/2603938| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106034901/http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/calment/2603938 |archivedate=6 November 2009 |publisher=Lasting Tribute| accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, ''Time's Mistress'', a four-track CD of Calment speaking over a background of [[Rapping|rap]], was released.&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle&gt;{{cite news | title=Believed to be world's oldest, woman in France dies at 122 |url=http://supercentenarian.com/oldest/jeanne-calment.html |date=4 August 1997 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |accessdate=5 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 1995, Calment reached 120 years and 238 days to become the "oldest person ever" according to Guinness, surpassing [[Shigechiyo Izumi]] of Japan, whose claim (120 years 237 days old at the time of his death on 21 February 1986, which was Calment's 111th birthday) was discounted in February 2011, more than thirteen years after Calment's death.&lt;ref name=LastingTribute /&gt;

[[File:JeanneCalmentaged40.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|Calment at age 40 in 1915]]
Exceeding any other longevity case reported, Calment establishes the record as the most verifiable supercentenarian ever recorded. For example, beginning with the 1876 census (Calment is listed as a one-year-old), she was indexed in fourteen census documents until 1975.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;

After her death, 116-year-old [[Marie-Louise Meilleur]] became the oldest recognized living person. Both before and after Calment's death, there have been several claims to have surpassed her age (see [[Unverified longevity claims]]), but none of these have been proven and Calment therefore continues to hold the record for the oldest verified person ever.

== Health and lifestyle ==
Calment's remarkable health presaged her later record. On television she stated ''J'ai jamais été malade, jamais, jamais'' (I have never been ill, never ever).&lt;ref name="Mise au Point"&gt;{{cite news |date = 15 June 2014 |accessdate = 2 December 2016 |title = Comme si c’était hier: Jeanne Calment |url = http://www.rts.ch/video/emissions/mise-au-point/5931633-comme-si-c-etait-hier-jeanne-calment.html |work = Mise au Point |publisher = Radio Télévision Suisse Un }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about her daily routine while at [[primary school]], she replied that "when you are young you get up at eight o'clock".{{efn|The [[Time in France#History|French time zone]] has varied historically. In Calment's youth each French town had its own solar time. In 1891 the introduction of railways motivated a unified French time zone in line with Greenwich Time in Britain. In 1940 the invading Germans changed the French time by one hour to German time, to which France still adheres as of 2016.}} In lieu of a solid breakfast she would have either white coffee or hot chocolate, and at noon her father would pick her up from school to have lunch at home before she returned to school for the afternoon.&lt;ref name="Allard1998Englishchapter2" /&gt; 

At age 15 her cousin and eventual husband started courting her, but she was too young to be interested in boys and preferred [[confectionery|sweets]]. At age 20, incipient [[cataract]]s were discovered when she suffered a major episode of [[conjunctivitis]].&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; After marriage at 21, her husband's wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work. They led an active life including [[fencing]], cycling (at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]), tennis,  swimming, rollerskating at [[Alyscamps]] ("I fell flat on my face"), and playing the piano and making music with friends.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; In the summer, the couple would stay at [[Uriage]] for mountaineering up to the glacier ("Even at 16 I had good legs").

She and her husband sometimes travelled to nearby Marseilles where, at the ''Phocéen'' restaurant, they treated themselves to seafood, a glass of white wine, and bread and butter. Unlike her husband she did not enjoy pastries, but she did like creams (''crèmes''), cakes and in particular ''quatre-quarts'' ([[pound cake]]), and vanilla ice cream.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt; At "retirement age" she broke her ankle and apart from that had never been ill.&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishWitticisms/&gt; She continued cycling until her hundredth birthday.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; Around her hundredth year she fractured her leg but recovered quickly and was able to walk again.&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; 

After the death of her grandson in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a [[nursing home]].&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; According to one of her doctors, she had formerly been healthy but began showing signs of [[senescence]] (or [[Ageing|aging]]) at this point.&lt;ref name=France2DrLevraud&gt;{{cite news | first=| last=| title=France 2 Interview with Dr Catherine Levraud, Medical Doctor Treating Jeanne Calment| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE| work=France 2 television| date=4 August 1997| accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daily routine at ages 111–114===
After her admission to the care home ''Maison du Lac'' [House on the Lake] in January 1985 at the age of 109, she initially had a highly ritualized daily routine whereby, uniquely among the care home residents, she requested to be woken at 6:45 am and started the day with a long prayer at her window thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting, sometimes loudly asking the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one alive in her family. Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands ("a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands"), then the legs, and her carers noted that she moved faster than the other residents, who were 30 years younger, despite her blindness. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk, and [[rusks]]. 

Her morning ablutions included washing herself unassisted with a flannel rather than taking a shower ("an odd invention"), and applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed ''daube'' ([[braising|braised beef]]) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she smoked a [[Dunhill (cigarette)|Dunhill cigarette]] (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank a small amount of [[Port wine]]. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter – this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a fruit salad based on banana slices and squeezed orange. 

In the afternoon she would take a nap for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her eyesight now being too poor for her favorite pastime of crosswords), smoke a last cigarette and go to bed at 10pm.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years|location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=85–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical examination at ages 111–116===
Medical student Georges Garoyan published a thesis on Calment when she was 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for [[heart failure]] and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with arthropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150&amp;nbsp;cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed the presence of the [[HLA-DR1|DR1 allele]], common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2&gt;{{Cite book | last=Garoyan| first=Georges| year=1990| title=Cent-quatorze ans de vie ou la longue histoire de Jeanne Calment, doyenné d'âge de France [One Hundred and Fourteen Years of Life or the Long History of Jeanne Calment, the Eldest of France]| location=Marseille| publisher=Université d'Aix-Marseille II| pages=22–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage Calment was still in good shape, and continued to walk without a cane&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; until she fractured her [[femur]] during a fall at age 114 (January 1990), which required surgery.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;&lt;ref name=SunJournal/&gt; After her operation, Calment required a wheelchair&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt; and abandoned her daily routine.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt;

At the age of 115 she attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with Calment's attending doctor, Dr. Victor Lèbre to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. They analysed her for over a year and reported that Jeanne Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to have a routine operation to restore her vision; she had a moderately weak heart and a chronic cough ("caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco") and bouts of [[rheumatism]]. On the other hand, she always had good digestion, slept well and had no problems with incontinence. During the last years her height was 4&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in [137&amp;nbsp;cm] and her weight was 88 pounds [40&amp;nbsp;kg]; she confirmed that she had always been small, but she had lost weight in recent years. In terms of pigmentation, her eyes were [[eye color|light gray]] and her [[Human hair color#Gray and white|white hair]] had once been [[chestnut brown]].&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt;

===Diet at 116===
With regards to her diet, the three researchers' interviews revealed that in the care home she said she always had a dessert with every meal. She complained about the blandness of the food in the care home and, given a choice, would wish to order fried and spicy foods.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt; She occasionally ("more than once") feasted on [[chocolate]] in her old age: sometimes over a kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;lb) of chocolate per week.&lt;ref&gt;"More than once, she surprised her entourage by her digestive abilities; she said herself 'I have the stomach of an ostrich!' which did not prevent her from appreciating good things. She showed herself more than once capable of absorbing considerable quantities of chocolate: more than a kilo per week." in Michel Allard, Victor Lèbre, Jean-Marie Robine ''Les 120 ans de Jeanne Calment. Doyenne de l'Humanité'', Le cherche midi éditeur, Paris, 1994, p92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurological examination at 118===
At the age of 118, over a period of six months, she was submitted to neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency was comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and there was no evidence of progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ritchie |first1=K| title=Mental status examination of an exceptional case of longevity J.

===Popular media reports===
Apocryphal media articles reported varying details. One report claimed that Calment recalled selling "coloured pencils" to Van Gogh, and seeing the [[Eiffel Tower]] being built.&lt;ref name="Deseret19950221"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CL4RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1584,3192209| title=World's oldest person marks 120 beautiful, happy years |publisher=News.google.com| date=21 February 1995| accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another wrote that she did not start fencing until age 85 (1960).&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; Calment reportedly ascribed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance for her age to a diet rich in [[olive oil]].&lt;ref name=mccook /&gt; She is also said to have credited her calmness, saying, "That's why they call me Calment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1008681/Alcohol-cigarettes-chocolates-sweets--The-secrets-long-life.html| title=Alcohol, Cigarettes, Chocolates and Sweets – The Secrets of a Long Life?| work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercentenarian clinical study===
Bertrand Jeune, Jean-Marie Robine and colleagues compared Jeanne Calment with a list of nearly 20 people worldwide who had securely been verified to have attained at least 115 years of age. The researchers concluded that the lives of these people differed widely, and that there were but few common characteristics: the overwhelming majority were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. They all seem to have had strong characters, but certainly not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical functions declined markedly, especially after their 105th birthdays. In their final years they required wheelchairs, and were nearly blind and deaf. "But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Jeanne Calment and her successors.

==Death ==
On her 122nd birthday on 21 February 1997, it was announced that she would make no more public appearances, as her health had seriously deteriorated. Demographer [[Jean-Marie Robine]], a co-author of a book about Jeanne Calment, reportedly said that this "allowed her to die, as the attention had kept her alive",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deller |first=Deborah |url=http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5849062 |title=Jeanne Calment : Obituary |publisher=ThisIsAnnouncements |accessdate=16 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729221706/http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5849062 |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported Robine to have stated that she had been in good health, though almost [[Visual impairment|blind]] and [[deaf]], as recently as a month before her death.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt; Jeanne Calment died on 4 August 1997 around 10 am [[Central European Time]]&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE ''France 2'']; August 4 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book of Records]]'', 1999 edition, p. 102, {{ISBN|0-85112-070-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of unspecified causes.&lt;ref name=mccook /&gt; According to the researchers, the care home committed her body quickly and in a strictly private ceremony to a coffin, which was then solemnly driven by limousine through Arles, stopping at her house in the ''rue Gambetta'', and finally to the cemetery, where her doctor placed on her coffin the photographs of her daughter and grandson, in accordance with her wishes.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter14&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H.

'''Kupanta-Kurunta''' was the first recorded [[king]] of [[Arzawa]], in the late 15th century BC. He was defeated by [[Tudhaliya I]] and [[Arnuwanda I]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Routledge Handbook of The People and Places of Ancient Western Asia'' by Trevor Bryce&lt;/ref&gt; He then attacked Arnuwanda's restive vassal [[Madduwatta]] at [[Zippasla]]. He had a daughter, who married Madduwatta.

Another '''Kupanta-Kurunta''' was born in the 1330s or 1320s BC at [[Mira (Anatolia)|Mira]] in western [[Anatolia]], in one of the princely families. His father joined a coup against king [[Mašḫuiluwa]]. The [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Suppiluliuma I]] married Mašḫuiluwa to his daughter Muwatti and reinstalled him. Kupanta-Kurunta's father apparently died or was exiled soon after. Mašḫuiluwa then asked Suppiluliuma's successor [[Mursili II]] if he could adopt Kupanta-Kurunta as a son.

Mira remained a Hittite ally against [[Uhha-Ziti]] of Arzawa; but two years after [[Mursili's eclipse]] (which would mean 1310 BC) Mira rebelled under influence from "Great-House-Father" (probably an adventurer from Masa). Mursili quashed this rebellion, transferred Mašḫuiluwa to a priesthood in [[Hittites|Hittite]] territory, and installed Kupanta-Kurunta as king.

In the early 13th century BC, [[Muwatalli II]] signed a treaty with Alaksandu of [[Wilusa]]. In it, he informed Alaksandu that he viewed Kupanta-Kurunta as the son of Muwatti and so a member of the Hittite royal family.

Kupanta-Kurunta is possibly the recipient of the [[Milawata letter]].

Kupanta-Kurunta apparently supported [[Hattusili III]] over Hattusili's nephew Urhi-Tessup, "[[Mursili III]]". After Hattusili attained the kingdom, Kupanta-Kurunta received a letter from Pharaoh [[Rameses II]] which was copied to Hattusili. In it, the Pharaoh reassured Kupanta-Kurunta that [[Egypt]] remained a full ally of [[Hittite Empire|Hatti]] and entertained no plans to aid Urhi-Tessup in any further adventures.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of the Great Kings of the Ancient Near East'' by [[Trevor Bryce]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6089">'''LOVEINT''' is the practice of [[intelligence service]] employees making use of their extensive monitoring capabilities to spy on their [[love interest]] or [[spouse]]. The term was coined in resemblance to intelligence terminology such as [[Signals Intelligence|SIGINT]], [[COMINT]] or [[HUMINT]].

== National Security Agency ==
The term LOVEINT originated at the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], where approximately one such incident has been reported per year. In 2013, eight had been reported in the past decade, and they are the lion's share of unauthorized accesses reported by the NSA.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57605051-38/nsa-offers-details-on-loveint-thats-spying-on-lovers-exes/ |title=NSA offers details on 'LOVEINT' (that's spying on lovers, exes) |author=Edward Moyer |work=CNET |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHk7ld6C?url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57605051-38/nsa-offers-details-on-loveint-thats-spying-on-lovers-exes/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most incidents are self-reported, for example during a [[polygraph]] test.

In legal terms, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII of England]] had only three wives, because three of his putative marriages were annulled. Unlike a divorce, where a married couple chooses to end their union, [[annulment|annulments]] essentially declare that a true marriage never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11358279/Henry-VIII-didnt-really-have-six-wives-why-everything-you-know-about-the-Tudors-is-wrong.html|title=Did Henry VIII really have six wives?

==Overview==
The six women who were married to Henry VIII were, in chronological order:

{| class="wikitable" 
|- 
! No. !! Name !! Married from - through !! Fate of marriage !! Fate of wife and issue 
|- 
| 1 || [[Catherine of Aragon]] || 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 || Annulled || Died 7 January 1536 while detained in [[Kimbolton Castle]].&lt;br&gt;Mother of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Carolly |title=Great Harry: A Biography of Henry the VII |date=2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-16858-6 |page=48 |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Henry's first marriage lasted nearly 24 years; the five that followed less than 10 years combined.

A common [[mnemonic device]] to remember the fates of Henry's consorts is "Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived". There are also two rhymes:{{cn|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}}

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;King Henry VIII,
To six wives he was wedded.
One died, one survived,
Two divorced, two beheaded.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

and

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Boleyn and Howard lost their heads,
Anne of Cleves he would not bed,
Jane Seymour gave him a son – but died before the week was done,
Aragon he did divorce,
Which just left Catherine Parr, of course!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

It is often noted that [[Catherine Parr]] "survived him." In fact, [[Anne of Cleves]] also survived the king, and was the last of his queens to die. Of the six queens, [[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]], [[Anne Boleyn]], and [[Jane Seymour]] each gave Henry one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children would eventually ascend to the throne: [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].

Catherine Howard and Anne Boleyn, the two of Henry's queens who were beheaded, were first cousins. Several of Henry's wives worked in at least one of his other wives' service, typically as [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]]: Anne Boleyn worked in Catherine of Aragon's service, Jane Seymour worked in Catherine of Aragon's and Anne Boleyn's, and Catherine Howard worked in Anne of Cleves's.

Henry and at least four of his wives (Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, and Catherine Parr) were portrayed in [[List of historical opera characters|opera]].

==Katherine of Aragon==
{{Main article|Katherine of Aragon}}
[[File:Catherine aragon.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Katherine of Aragon]]
[[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]] (16 December 1485{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1536; {{lang-es|link=no|Catalina de Aragón}}) was Henry's first wife.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Although her name is sometimes spelled ''Catherine'', Katherine of Aragon spelled and signed her name with a "K," which was the accepted spelling in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon#Spelling_of_her_name|title=Catherine of Aragon|last=Wikipedia|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}{{circular inline|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Davies|first=C.S.L.|last2=Edwards|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=England|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|doi-access=Free|chapter=Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], her first husband and Henry's brother, a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until after he came to the throne in 1509. Prospects were looking good when Katherine became pregnant in 1510, just 4 months after their marriage, but the girl was stillborn. Katherine became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to a boy, [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. In 1513, Katherine gave birth to a stillborn boy, and gave birth to a boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally, Katherine bore him a healthy daughter in 1516, [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. It took her two years to conceive again. This pregnancy ended in a short-lived girl. It is said that Henry truly loved Katherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times in declarations, etc.

Henry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that his marriage was invalid because Katherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21) to justify his stance: "If a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.” 
Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who is said{{by whom|date=July 2016}} to have refused to become his mistress (Henry had already consummated an affair then dismissed Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], and most historians believe that Anne wanted to avoid the same treatment){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Despite the pope's refusal, Henry separated from Katherine in 1531. In the face of the Pope's continuing refusal to annul his marriage to Katherine, Henry ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court to rule on the status of his marriage to Katherine. On 23 May 1533,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer ruled the marriage to Katherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows, probably in late January 1533). This led to the break from the Roman Catholic Church and the later establishment of the [[Church of England]].
 
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] called Katherine "The Queen of Earthly Queens."

Marriage to Henry VIII: 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 (23 years, 11 months, 19 days); marriage annulled.

==Anne Boleyn==
{{Main article|Anne Boleyn}}
[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]
[[Anne Boleyn]] (c.1501/1507{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne, and her subsequent execution, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the [[English Reformation]]. The daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and his wife, [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Lady Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), Anne was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired, with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]].

Anne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her in 1526 and she refused to become his mistress, as her sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], so he could marry Anne. Evidence of intimacy between the King and Anne is found in a love letter written by the King, in which he expressed admiration for her "pretty duckies" (breasts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, the breaking of the power of the Roman Catholic Church in England began.

Henry had [[Thomas Wolsey]] dismissed from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain, [[Thomas Cranmer]], appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn"&gt;"Anne Boleyn 1507–1536." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of [[excommunication]] against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the [[Church of England]] was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn" /&gt;
Anne was crowned [[List of English consorts|Queen Consort of England]] on 1 June 1533. Later that year, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Henry's second daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. When Anne failed to quickly produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, the King grew tired of her, annulled their marriage, and a plot was hatched by [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] to execute her.

Although the evidence against her was unconvincing, Anne was beheaded on charges of [[adultery]], [[incest]], and [[high treason]] on 19 May 1536. Following her daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s coronation as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].

Marriage to Henry VIII: 28 May 1533{{spaced ndash}}17 May 1536 (2 years, 11 months, 19 days); annulled, then beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tudorhistory.org/boleyn/|title=Anne Boleyn|website=tudorhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jane Seymour==
{{Main article|Jane Seymour}}
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]
[[Jane Seymour]] (c.roughly 1508{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served [[Catherine of Aragon]] and was one of [[Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn's]] ladies-in-waiting.&lt;ref&gt;Jokinen, Anniina. "[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sixwives.htm The Six Wives of King Henry VII]" 2007. Web. 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongly believed{{who|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 10–11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Finally, a year later, Jane gave birth to a healthy, legitimate male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later, presumably because of post-natal complications. This apparently caused her husband genuine grief, as she was the only queen to receive a proper Queen's burial; when the King died in 1547, he was buried next to her.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 30 May 1536{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537 (1 year, 4 months, 24 days); death from complications of childbirth.

==Anne of Cleves==
{{Main article|Anne of Cleves}}
[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]
[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was Henry's fourth wife, for only six months in 1540, from 6 January to 9 July. Anne of Cleves was a German princess.&lt;ref&gt;"Anne of Cleves." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that Henry referred to her as "''A Flanders Mare''", which may or may not be true; nevertheless, the label has stuck with Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett "History of the Reformation of England" Print&lt;/ref&gt; Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for an annulment. Anne agreed to this, claiming that the marriage had not been consummated, and because she hadn't resisted the annulment, was given a generous settlement, including [[Hever Castle]], former home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns. She was given the name "The King's Sister", and became a friend to him and his children until his death. She outlived both the King and his last two wives, making her the last of the six wives to die.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 6 January 1540{{spaced ndash}}9 July 1540 (6 months, 3 days); annulled.

==Catherine Howard==
{{Main article|Catherine Howard}}
[[File:HowardCatherine02.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Howard]]
[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540–1542, sometimes known as "the rose without a
thorn". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine Howard." World Book Encyclopaedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage to Henry VIII: 28 July 1540{{spaced ndash}}23 November 1541 (1 year, 3 months, 26 days); beheaded.

==Catherine Parr==
{{Main article|Catherine Parr}}
[[File:Catherine Parr from NPG.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Parr]]
[[Catherine Parr]] (1512{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543–1547. She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542–46|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.

Catherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 12 July 1543{{spaced ndash}}28 January 1547 (3 years, 6 months, 16 days); his death at the age of 55.

==Ancestry==
Henry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I of England]],&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry VIII'', genealogical tables&lt;/ref&gt; through more than one ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tudorqueen6.com/2012/09/22/english-ancestry-of-the-six-wives-descent-from-edward-i/|title=English Ancestry of The Six Wives: Descent from Edward I|date=22 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinister supporter came from the [[Coat of arms of the King of Spain|coat of arms of her father]], [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], who displayed his shield on the breast of a single-headed Apostolic eagle displayed. Catherine's badges were a commemoration of the [[Granada War|conquest of Granada]] from the [[Emirate of Granada|Moors]], where a victory was gained by the superiority of the Spanish archers. Both badges were combined with the [[Tudor rose]] (Henry's dynastic symbol).&lt;ref name="Pinces 142"&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The noted antiquarian and heraldist [[Charles Boutell]] commented that the: "Arms of Queen Anne Boleyn are the first which exemplify the usage, introduced by Henry VIII, of granting to his Consorts "Augmentations" to their paternal arms. It is a striking illustration of the degenerate condition of [[Heraldry]] under the second [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor Sovereign]]."&lt;ref name="Boutell 242"/&gt; The dexter supporter was intended to represent the leopard of [[Guyenne]] (Aquitaine). The sinister supporter was a [[Charge_(heraldry)#Animals|heraldic creature]] from the badge of the Boleyn, as descended from Earls of Ormond (Butler).&lt;ref name="Willment 69"&gt;Willement p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The falcon badge was granted to Anne as Countess of Pembroke, this badge was also used by her daughter Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].

An alternative set of supporters for Queen Jane was reportedly: "Dexter a unicorn argent, crowned and unguled or, collared with a double wreath of white daisies and red roses; Sinister, a panther incensed, striped with various colours, gorged with a coronet of crosses patée and fleurs de lys alternately and chained or."&lt;ref name="Pinces 146"/&gt; The badge of the phoenix rising from the flames was granted posthumously by her son King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] to his maternal relations (who became the Dukes of Somerset), who continues to use it as a crest in their coat of arms to this day.&lt;ref name="Willment 71"&gt;Willement p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox Davies 597"&gt;Fox Davies p. 597&lt;/ref&gt;

-----
The sinister supporter was inherited from her maternal grandfather William FitzHugh, 4th Baron FitzHugh. Her badge was granted by the King, it combined the Tudor rose badge of Henry with a previous one used by the Queen's family. The House of Parr has assumed as a badge "a maiden's head, couped below the breasts, vested in ermine and gold, her hair of the last, and her temples encircled with red and white roses." This they inherited from the badge of Ross, of Kendal.&lt;ref name="Willment 75"&gt;Willement p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1226">The '''Masters of Dirc van Delf''' were a group of [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript painters]] active in the [[Netherlands]] between 1400 and around 1410. The name has been appended to several unknown artists who together make up an important [[studio]] of illuminators, one of the first important ones known from fifteenth-century Holland. Their name is derived from the lavish work they did to illustrate devotional texts by [[Dirc van Delf]], court chaplain to [[Albert I, Duke of Bavaria|Albrecht of Bavaria]] from 1389 until 1404 in [[The Hague]]. The studio's artists combined with Dirc to play an important role in the new cultural life of the royal court in the Netherlands.

Paintings by the Masters may be found in the collections of the [[Getty Center|J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

The '''Muan''', '''Moan''' or '''Mohan''' (moo-ahn), sometimes also known as '''Poira''' is a name applied to several mythological or otherwise supernatural creatures in [[South America|South]] and [[Latin American folklore|Central American folklore]]. The most common and widespread use of the term is to refer to the souls of the dead and the indigenous ancestors of old. The word is also used for [[shaman]]s or [[witch doctor]]s in some [[Colombia]]n indigenous cultures (such as the [[:es:Panche|Panche]]s).
[[File:Mohan pijao.JPG|thumb|right|Un muñeco de Mohán.]]
==History==
Various different legends exist about the Mohan, with many of them emerging from Colombia. In Colombia, Mohan can also mean a forest or barren land kind of supernatural being associated with natural forces such as the great rivers and the mysteries lying within the forests, beyond human reach and comprehension. In some legends, it is a [[satyr]]-like being who steals and rapes young women and lives in a cave-like grotto in the bottom of the great jungle rivers where he keeps his female captives. In others, it is depicted as the spirit of an old Indian, brawny and stout, with a terrifying grin and stare, with larger than human stature and proportions, who steals fishermen's bait, catch or nets, and has the power to change shape into a cat-like beast. Other legends describe the Mohan as a "big-headed Indian, with short legs and fish fins on his back, and very brown."&lt;ref name="Botero 1999 286"&gt;{{cite book|last=Botero|first=Alvaro|title=La fábula y el desastre: estudios críticos sobre la novela colombiana, 1650-1931|year=1999|publisher=Fondo Editorial Universidad EAFIT|location=Medellín|isbn=958-9041-27-2|page=286|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/La_f%C3%A1bula_y_el_desastre.html?id=yqXq2rVoA0kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed as an extremely hairy being with a very treacherous personality who dwells in the backwaters and is feared by many people.

{{New Netherland}}

The council of '''Nine Men''' was a citizens board and a form of representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous councils, the [[Twelve Men]] and the [[Eight Men]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs  |first=Jaap  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Netherland: A Dutch Colony In Seventeenth-Century America |year=2005  |publisher= |quote=Both in the way it was set up and in the extent of its rights, the council of Twelve Men, as did the two later advisory bodies ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uex2budtSOUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA136&amp;dq |isbn=90-04-12906-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the council were elected in 1647, 1649, 1650 and 1652. On July 26, 1649, eleven current and former members of the board signed the ''Petition of the Commonality of New Netherland'', which requested that the States General take action to encourage [[economic freedom]] and force local government like that in the Netherlands, removing the colony from the control of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. It became the basis for the municipal government when the city of [[New Amsterdam]] received its charter in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = About the City Council   | publisher = New York City Council   | date =    | url = http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | accessdate = 2013-01-01   | deadurl = yes   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120620053608/http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | archivedate = 2012-06-20   | df =    }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Poitiers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Battle of Poitiers]] 1356. The oriflamme can be seen on the top left.]]

The '''Oriflamme''' (from Latin ''aurea flamma'', "golden flame") was the [[battle standard]] of the [[King of France]] in the Middle Ages. It was originally the sacred banner of the [[Abbey of St. Denis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenophongroup.com/montjoie/orifl-fa.htm Oriflamme Society]&lt;/ref&gt; a monastery near Paris. When the oriflamme was raised in battle by the French royalty during the Middle Ages, most notably during the [[Hundred Years War]], no prisoners were to be taken until it was lowered. Through this tactic they hoped to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, especially the nobles, who could usually expect to be taken alive for ransom during such military encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Southey (1841) '' Joan of Arc: a poem'', Longman et autres. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TPRAhDvWDrwC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=oriflamme+no+quarter+given&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k7Nfv2vzz-&amp;sig=v2VEcfsGqIA6hlWsT62p_Jgrodg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAmoVChMIo6Du2dmMxwIVBL1yCh38WwSD#v=onepage&amp;q=oriflamme%20no%20quarter%20given&amp;f=false p. 280]&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, the term "''oriflamme''" has come to mean any banner with pointed ends; by association with the form of the original.

==Legendary origin==

 }}
The  Oriflamme was mentioned in the eleventh-century ballad the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' (vv. 3093-5) as a royal banner, first called ''Romaine'' and then ''Montjoie''.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt; According to legend, [[Charlemagne]] carried it to the Holy Land in response to a prophecy regarding a knight possessing a golden lance, from which flames would burn and drive out the [[Saracens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Distant Mirror |last=Tuchman |first=Barbara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1978|publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0140054073 |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the ''lance'' was originally the important object, with the banner simply a decoration, but this changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/oriflamm.htm Heraldica.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Oriflamme was first used by [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] in 1124 and was last flown in battle at Agincourt in 1415,&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Barber (1984) ''The Penguin guide to medieval Europe'', Penguin Books. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A9MYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;dq=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;pgis=1 p. 224]&lt;/ref&gt; though a version of it remained in the Abbey of St. Denis until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Book of Heraldry|last=Slater |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Hermes House |location= |isbn=1846819601 |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis VI replaced the earlier banner of Saint Martin with the oriflamme of the Abbey of St. Denis, which floated about the tomb of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the abbey by king Dagobert.
Until the 12th century the standard-bearer was the [[Comte de Vexin]], who, as vowed to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the abbey. Louis VI, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as war began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the tomb of the saint to carry it to the combat.

It is recorded as having been carried at the following battles/campaigns:{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
*[[Battle of Bouvines|Bouvines 1214]]
*[[Seventh Crusade|Seventh Crusade 1248]]
*[[Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle|Mons-en-Pévèle 1304]]

*[[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers 1356]]
*[[Battle of Roosebeke|Roosebeke 1382]]
*[[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt 1415]]

The Oriflamme was lost at least five times during its medieval history; Mons-en-Pévèle,&lt;ref&gt;DeVries, Kelly (2006) : ''Infantry Warfare in the Early Fourteenth Century''. Woodbridge, UK: Boydell Press, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; Crécy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Trial by Battle |last=Sumption |first= Jonathon|year=1990|publisher= Faber &amp; Faber|location=London |isbn=0-571-20095-8 |page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poitiers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Green | title=The Battle of Poitiers 1356 | publisher= | location= | year=2004 | isbn=0-7524-2557-9|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Agincourt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Agincourt|last=Barker |first=Juliet |authorlink=Juliet Barker |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Little, Brown |location=London |isbn=0316726486 |page=288 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also during the campaigns of the [[Seventh Crusade]] under [[King Louis IX]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5ry8BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT47&amp;lpg=PT47&amp;dq=oriflamme+lost+at+crecy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pI5Vxrq898&amp;sig=c1k1MERjD9ECAMD1WfoIvaA_Rb4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBWoVChMI493i9t6MxwIVAuFyCh1J-gGR#v=onepage&amp;q=oriflamme%20lost%20at%20crecy&amp;f=false Edward Cowan (2012) '' The Wallace Book'', Birlinn]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.baronage.co.uk/bphtm-02/moa-15a.html|title= The Oriflamme|date=2000|publisher=The Baronage Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
The banner was red or orange-red silk and flown from a gilded lance.&lt;ref&gt;Slater (2002), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, its colour stems from it being dipped in the blood of the recently beheaded [[Denis|St. Denis]].

The surviving descriptions of the Oriflamme are in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the "Chronicle of Flanders" (fourteenth century), in the "Registra Delphinalia" (1456) and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536). They show that the primitive Oriflamme was succeeded in the course of the centuries by newer Oriflammes which bore little resemblance to one another except for their colour.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Oriflamme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance on the battlefield ==
When the Oriflamme was displayed on the battlefield it indicated that [[no quarter]]
was to be given, its red colour being symbolic of cruelty and ferocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The laws of War in the late Middle Ages |last=Keen |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Keen |coauthors= |year=1965 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |location= London|isbn= |page= |pages= 105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the azure ground (from the blue cope of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]]) strewn with gold [[fleur-de-lis]] remained the symbol of royalty until the 15th century, the Oriflamme became the royal battle standard of the King of France, and it was carried at the head of the king's forces when they met another army in battle. In the fifteenth century, the fleur-de-lis on the white flag of [[Joan of Arc]] became the new royal standard replacing both the symbol of royalty and the Oriflamme on the battle field.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;&lt;!--cited for last sentence--&gt;

==Porte oriflamme==
The bearer of the standard, the ''porte-oriflamme'', became an [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|office]] (like that of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] or [[Constable of France|Constable]]) and a great honour, as it was an important and very dangerous job to take charge of such a visible symbol in battle.  If things went badly, the bearer was expected to die rather than relinquish his charge.

Froissart vividly describes ''porte-oriflamme'' Geoffroi de Charny's fall at the side of his king at the Battle of Poitiers in this passage:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“There Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him because he was carrying the king’s sovereign banner [the Oriflamme]. He also had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open the king’s battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jean Froissart; trans Geoffrey Brereton, ''Chronicles'' ( Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, 1978), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:Sends me a messenger of mercy forth,

:Only to those an enemy, whose lust
:Of sway makes them the enemies of man."

"'''PayPal Mafia'''" is a group of former [[PayPal]] employees and founders who have since founded and developed additional technology companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://projects.wsj.com/soty/mentor/david-sacks/david-sacks-drills-into-light-points-technology | title=David Sacks: Biography | publisher=Wall Street Journal online | accessdate=August 30, 2013 | author=Staff Writer}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Tesla Motors]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Palantir Technologies]], [[SpaceX]], [[YouTube]], [[Yelp]], and [[Yammer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=San Jose Mercury News|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business-headlines/ci_13617121|title=PayPal finally poised to enter Web 2.0|author=Duke Harris|date=October 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the members attended [[Stanford University]] or [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] at some point in their studies. Six members, [[Peter Thiel]], [[Elon Musk]], [[Reid Hoffman]], [[Luke Nosek]], [[Ken Howery]], and [[Keith Rabois]], have become billionaires.

==History==
Originally, PayPal was a money-transfer service offered by a company called [[Confinity]] which was acquired by [[X.com]] in 1999. Later X.com was renamed PayPal and purchased by [[eBay]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt;&lt;ref name=fortune&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/11/13/magazines/fortune/paypal_mafia.fortune/index.htm | title=Meet the PayPal mafia | date=November 26, 2007 | last=O'Brien | first=Jeffrey M. | accessdate=December 4, 2009 | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | publisher=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original PayPal employees had difficulty adjusting to eBay's more traditional corporate culture and within four years all but 12 of the first 50 employees had left.&lt;ref name=exodus/&gt;  They remained connected as social and business acquaintances,&lt;ref name=exodus/&gt; and a number of them worked together to form new companies in subsequent years.  This group of PayPal alumni became so prolific that the term PayPal Mafia was coined.&lt;ref name=pays&gt;{{Cite news|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/technology/17paypal.html?ei=5088&amp;en=943bf3f552d09fb2&amp;ex=1318737600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|title=It Pays to Have Pals in Silicon Valley |author=Miguel Helft|date=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term&lt;ref name=fortune/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Fortune|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/index.cfm?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=71077|title=Thiel, Levchin and the PayPal Mafia|date=November 15, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; gained even wider exposure when a 2007 article in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine used the phrase in its headline and featured a photo of former PayPal employees in gangster attire.&lt;ref name=fortune/&gt;&lt;ref name=vw1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vw2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Valleywag|url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/315670/the-paypal-mafia-personified|title=The Paypal Mafia Personified|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705143412/http://valleywag.gawker.com/315670/the-paypal-mafia-personified|archivedate=July 5, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The PayPal Mafia is sometimes credited with inspiring the re-emergence of consumer-focused Internet companies after the [[dot-com bust]] of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/15/DDOH107DLG.DTL|date=May 16, 2008|title=Nonfiction review: 'Once You're Lucky'|author=Marcus Banks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PayPal Mafia phenomenon has been compared to the founding of [[Intel]] in the late 1960s by engineers who had earlier founded [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] after leaving [[Shockley Semiconductor]].&lt;ref name=pays/&gt; They are discussed in journalist [[Sarah Lacy]]'s book ''Once You're Lucky, Twice You're Good.''  According to Lacy,  the selection process and technical learning at PayPal played a role, but the main factor behind their future success was the confidence they gained there. Their success has been attributed to their youth; the physical, cultural, and economic infrastructure of [[Silicon Valley]]; and the diversity of their skill-sets.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt; PayPal's founders encouraged tight social bonds among its employees, and many of them continued to trust and support one another after leaving PayPal.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt; An intensely competitive environment and a shared struggle to keep the company solvent despite many setbacks also contributed to a strong and lasting camaraderie amongst former employees.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Wired|title=How PayPal Gave Rise to a Silicon Valley ‘Mafia’|author=Dylan Tweney|date=November 15, 2007|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2007/11/how-paypal-gave/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3722">'''Philip Bellino''' and '''Edward Gertson''' (both died May 9, 1947) were the last persons [[capital punishment|executed]] by [[Massachusetts]].

==The murder==

Bellino and Gertson were two gangsters convicted of [[murder]]ing nineteen-year-old Robert "Tex" Williams, a former [[U.S. Marine]]. On August 3, 1945, Williams led Bellino, Gertson and Charles Mantia to a [[New Hampshire]] [[summer camp]]. He had learned there would be an illegal dice game taking place in the camp. The four men would rob the players at gunpoint. Williams had lured his accomplices with a promise of easily stealing up to $10,000. Instead they escaped with "a few hundred dollars".&lt;ref name = rogers&gt;Alan Rogers, [http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/lawreviews/meta-elements/journals/bctwj/22_2/02_TXT.htm "Success—At Long Last: The Abolition of the Death Penalty in Massachusetts, 1928–1984"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trio was enraged at Williams. They also feared the younger man could squeal on them to the police. On August 7, 1945, the four of them shared a taxi ride in the vicinity of [[Boston]]. The taxi stopped at an isolated location, not far from the shore. Williams, Bellino and Gertson stepped out for a walk. Mantia waited in the taxi with the cab driver. Bellino and Gertson returned without Williams, claiming the young man would spend his night with a girlfriend.&lt;ref name = rogers/&gt;

Williams' corpse was soon after discovered. He had been shot in the back of the head. Mantia was the one to lead the police to Bellino and Gertson. James Salah, the cab driver, also became a witness for the prosecution. On June 18, 1946, the duo were found guilty of first-degree murder in a trial by jury. There were originally 14 jurors. Two of them had been dismissed prior to the final verdict. A legal argument that this violated the rights of the defendants was eventually rejected by the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]]. A "mercy bill" discussed at the time in the [[Massachusetts General Court]] could have proven beneficial to the duo, but was vetoed by [[Robert F. Bradford]], [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|Governor of Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name = rogers/&gt;

==Execution and abolition of death penalty in Massachusetts==
Both Bellino and Gertson were executed in the [[electric chair]] at the [[Massachusetts State Prison at Charlestown]] shortly after midnight on the night of May 8–9, 1947.

On April 3, 1951, Massachusetts enacted a "mercy bill" which removed the mandatory death sentence for murder in all cases except for murder committed in the course of rape or attempted rape. No further executions were carried out and in 1984 the [[Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts]] ruled that capital punishment violated the [[constitution of Massachusetts|state constitution]].

A '''Polybiography''' is the use of [[Email archiving|archived internet email services]] such as ListServs and WWWeb to publish historical information by those involved in the history. The historical web site and ListServ provide for formal historical articles, images, photographs, commentary, and discussion of those items in a process called a "polybiography"... the history by many of the many events.  The site is designed to be a [[Digital library#Searching|searchable repository]] of "raw material" for those with an interest in the history of [[Diagnostic Medical Sonography]] ([[ultrasonography]]).

This Internet based [[archive|historical archive]] has been referred to as a "polybiography" because it is both [[biographical]] and [[autobiographical]]; the many individuals involved write the history of the many events discussed. The resulting [[archive]] is expected to be similar to an [[oral history]] where an editor records and transcribes the various stories into a cohesive narrative. However, the oral history will have a slant due to the selection of participants and how they are edited. The polybiography will avoid a bias or slant from an editor because the participants are [[self-selected]]. The stories will be in the unedited words of the individuals who made the history. The primary problem anticipated will be the differences in individuals' writing styles, and a possibly confused organization.

The polybiography is uniquely adapted to the Internet and would be virtually impossible without the Internet. Without the global connections it would be difficult to locate all the individuals who contributed to the development of historical events. By the use of the Internet anyone who has a story to tell about the developments will be able to add to the history. This will allow those who were assistants to contribute, as well as the luminaries; where as with the traditional oral history, the editor might not locate some relatively minor, relocated participants.

The concept of the "polybiography" was first presented at the Annual Conference 2000 of the American Association of History &amp; Computing in [[Waco, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATION, COMMUNITY, AND VALUES, http://bcis.pacificu.edu/journal/2002/04/dubose.php, accessed November 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DuBose TJ; "A Poly-Autobiography of Sonography"; Proceedings [[American Association of History &amp; Computing]], Waco, Texas April 13–15, 2000. http://www.theaahc.org/, last access: February 21, 2001 http://www.theaahc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The original article was titled "Poly-autobiography of [[Diagnostic Medical Sonography]]",&lt;ref&gt;SDMS &amp; OBGYN.net; Ultrasound-History Forum &amp; Archives: http://forums.obgyn.net/ultrasound-history/; last access: February 21, 2001
&lt;/ref&gt; but during the discussion following the presentation it was suggested that, while the concept was thought to be a unique use of the Internet and WWWeb, the term "polybiography" would be more appropriate, more descriptive, and simpler.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4170">The '''presidential standard''' or '''presidential flag''' is the flag that is used in many countries as a symbol of the head of state or [[president]]. It is for exclusive use of the president and is only raised where the head of state is located. When the country is a monarchy, similar flags may be referred to as royal or imperial standards.

{{Islamic prophets|Prophets in the Quran}}
{{Islam|beliefs}}

'''Prophets in Islam''' ({{lang-ar|الأنبياء في الإسلام}}) include "messengers" (''rasul'', pl. ''rusul''), bringers of a [[Revelation|divine revelation]] via an angel (Arabic: {{lang|ar|ملائكة}}, [[Islamic view of angels|malāʾikah]]);&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaatri, A. I. 2007"&gt;Shaatri, A. I. (2007). Nayl al Rajaa' bisharh' Safinat an'najaa'. Dar Al Minhaj.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Prophet#Islam|prophet]]s" (''nabī'', pl. ''anbiyāʼ''), lawbringers that [[Muslim]]s believe were sent by [[God in Islam|God]] to every person, bringing God's message in a language they can understand.&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campo|first1=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816054541|pages=559–560|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA559&amp;dq=prophethood+in+islam+encyclopedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pTKIVduAEobuoAS0-Yi4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=prophethood%20in%20islam%20encyclopedia&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|30|47|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the Islamic prophets is one of the [[Iman (concept)#The_Six_Articles_of_Faith|six articles of the Islamic faith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/beliefs.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Basic articles of faith|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813005904/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/beliefs.shtml|archive-date=13 August 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically mentioned in the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|2|285|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that the first prophet was also the first human being, [[Adam]] ([[Adam in Islam|ادم]]), created by Allah (الله). Many of the revelations delivered by the 48 [[prophets in Judaism]] and many [[prophets of Christianity]] are mentioned as such in the Quran but usually in slightly different forms. For example, the Jewish [[Elisha]] is called [[Elisha#In Islam|Eliyas]], [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] is [[Job in Islam|Ayyub]], [[Jesus]] is [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]], etc. The [[Torah]] given to [[Moses]] ([[Moses in Islam|Musa]]) is called ''[[Torah in Islam|Tawrat]]'', the [[Psalms]] given to [[David]] ([[David in Islam|Dawud]]) is the ''[[Zabur]]'', the [[The gospel|Gospel]] given to Jesus is ''[[Gospel in Islam|Injil]]''.&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559/&gt;

Unique to Islam is [[Muhammad]] ([[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad ibn ʿAbdullāh]]), who Muslims believe is the "Seal of the Prophets" (''[[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]]'', i.e. the last prophet); and the [[Quran]], revealed to Muhammad but not written down by him,&lt;ref name=denffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Denffer|first=Ahmad von|title=Ulum al-Qur'an : an introduction to the sciences of the Qur an|year=1985|publisher=Islamic Foundation|isbn=0860371328|pages=37|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Muslims believe is unique among divine revelations as the only correct one protected by [[God in Islam|God]] from distortion or corruption,&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding the Qurán'' - Page xii, Ahmad Hussein Sakr - 2000&lt;/ref&gt; destined to remain in its true form until the [[End time|Last Day]].&lt;ref name="The Qur'an Surah 15:9"&gt;{{Cite quran|15|9|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe Muhammad to be the last prophet, although after the prophets there are still [[Wali|saints]]&lt;ref&gt;Neal Robinson ''Christ in Islam and Christianity'' SUNY Press 1990 {{ISBN|978-0-791-40558-1}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt; (though some modern schools, such as [[Salafism]] and [[Wahhabism]], reject the theory of sainthood&lt;ref&gt;Radtke, B., Lory, P., Zarcone, Th., DeWeese, D., Gaborieau, M., F. M. Denny, Françoise Aubin, J. O. Hunwick and N. Mchugh, "Walī", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W. P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In Muslim belief, every prophet in Islam preached the same main Islamic beliefs, the [[Tawhid|Oneness of God]], worshipping of that one God, avoidance of [[Shirk (Islam)|idolatry]] and [[Islamic views on sin|sin]], and the belief in the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]] or the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgement]] and life after death. Each came to preach Islam at different times in history and some told of the coming of the final ''Islamic prophet and messenger'' of [[God in Islam|God]], who would be named "[[Ahmad|Ahmed]] and Muhammad". 

This narrative is found in "Chapter of the Ranks", Qur'an, 61:6 as Allah asked Jesus to remind the Children of Israel but they accused him of the prophecy:

&lt;big&gt;وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ يَـٰبَنِى إِسْرَٰعِيلَ إِنِّى رَسُولُ ٱللهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَىَّ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرىٰةِ وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِى مِن بَعْدِى ٱسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبينٌ&lt;/big&gt;  

''wa-idh qāla ‘Īsā ’b·nu Maryama: "yā Banī Israā‘īla innī Rasūlu ’llāhi ilay-kum muṣaddiqal li-mā bayna yadayya mina ’t-Tawraāti wa-mubash·shiram bi-Rasūlin ya’tī mim ba‘dī ’s·mu-huū Aḥmadu, fa-lammā jaā’a-hum bi’l-bayyināti, qālū "hādhā siḥrum mubīn!"''

{{quote|&lt;nowiki&gt;And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you, confirming the Law [=Torah] (which came) before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad." But when he came to them with Clear Signs, they said, "this is evident sorcery!"&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Quran, sura 61 (As-Saf), ''[[ayah]]'' 6|source=}}

== Etymology ==
In Arabic and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]],&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew root [[Nun (letter)|nun]]-[[Bet (letter)|vet]]-[[Aleph|alef]] ("navi") is based on the two-letter root nun-vet which denotes hollowness or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself "open". Cf. [[Rashbam]]'s comment to {{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:7|105}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''nabī'' (Arabic plural form: &lt;big&gt;أَنْبِيَاء&lt;/big&gt; ''anbiyāʼ'') means "prophet". Forms of this noun occur 75 times in the Quran. The term ''[[nubuwwah]]'' ([[Arabic]]: &lt;big&gt;نُبُوَّة&lt;/big&gt; meaning "prophethood") occurs five times in the Quran. The terms ''rasūl'' ([[Arabic]] plural: &lt;big&gt;رُسُل&lt;/big&gt; ''rusul'') and  ''mursal'' ([[Arabic|ِArabic]] singular: &lt;big&gt;مُرْسَل&lt;/big&gt; ''mursal''; plural: &lt;big&gt;مُرْسَلُون&lt;/big&gt; ''mursalūn'') denote "messenger with law given/ received by GOD" and occur more than 300 times. The term for a prophetic "message" ([[Arabic|ِArabic]] singular: &lt;big&gt;رِسَالَة&lt;/big&gt; ''risālah''; plural: &lt;big&gt;رِسَالَات&lt;/big&gt; ''risālāt''), appears in the [[Quran]] in ten instances.&lt;ref name="EoQP"&gt;Uri Rubin, "Prophets and Prophethood", ''[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Syriac language|Syriac form]] of ''rasūl Allāh'' (literally: "messenger of God"), ''s̲h̲eliḥeh d-allāhā'', occurs frequently in the [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] ''[[Acts of Thomas|Acts of St. Thomas]]''. The corresponding verb for ''s̲h̲eliḥeh''—''s̲h̲alaḥ'', occurs in connection with the prophets in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:13-14|1000}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|4:13|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:8|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|1:7|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;A. J. Wensinck, "Rasul", ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "prophet" (Arabic: {{lang|ar|نبي}} {{transl|ar|''nabī''}}) and "messenger" (Arabic: {{lang|ar|رسول}} {{transl|ar|''rasūl''}}) appear several times in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]].

The following table shows these words in different languages:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Strong's Concordance]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Hebrew Bible, the word ''[[Nevi'im|nabi]]'' ("spokesperson, prophet") occurs more commonly, and the Hebrew word ''mal'akh'' ("messenger") refers to [[Angels in Judaism]]. According to Judaism, [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zaqariah]], and [[Malachi]] were the last prophets, all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year [[Babylonian exile]]. With them, the authentic period of ''[[Prophecy#Judaism|Nevuah]]'' ("prophecy") died,&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[Vilna Gaon]], based on the opinion that [[Nechemyah]] died in Babylon before 9th Tevet 3448 (313 BCE). Nechemya was governor of [[Yehud Medinata|Persian Judea]] under [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]] in the 5th century BCE. The [[Book of Nehemiah]] describes his work in rebuilding Jerusalem during the [[Second Temple period]]. {{Cite journal | title = Babylonian Talmud | first = Vilna |last=Gaon |authorlink=Vilna Gaon| volume = San.11a, Yom.9a/Yuch.1.14/Kuz.3.39,65,67/Yuch.1/Mag.Av.O.C.580.6 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nowadays only the "[[Bath Kol]]" (בת קול, lit. ''daughter of a voice'', "voice of God") exists ([[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 11a).

In the New Testament, however, the word "messenger" becomes more frequent, sometimes in association with the concept of a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|3:1|1000}}; [[Gospel of John|John]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|17:3|1000}}; [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|11:10|1000}}; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:2|1000}}; [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|3:5|1000}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|4:11|1000}}; [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb||1Corinthians|28:12|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Messenger" may refer to Jesus, to his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] and to John the Baptist. But the last book of the Old Testament, the [[Book of Malachi]], speaks of a messenger that Christian commentators interpret as a reference to the future prophet [[John the Baptist]] (Yahya).&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] under {{bibleverse||Malachi|2:7|1000}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Malachi|3:1|1000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=June 2018}}
In Muslim belief, every Islamic prophet preached Islam. The beliefs of [[Charity (practice)|charity]], prayer, pilgrimage, worship of God and fasting are believed to have been taught by every prophet who has ever lived.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Quran itself calls Islam the "religion of [[Abraham]]" ([[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|67|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to [[Jacob]] ([[Jacob in Islam|Yaqub]]) and the [[Israelites|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] as being Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|123|e=133|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran says
{{quote|The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah—the which We have sent by inspiration to thee—and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein:...|Quran, sura 42 ([[Ash-Shura]]), ayah 13&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|13|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Status ===
Islam teaches that prophets were "protected from sin" by God, so unlike lesser human beings they cannot commit a sin.&lt;ref name="Auda-2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Auda |first1=Jasser |title=Were Prophets and Companions Infallible? |url=http://aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-about-islam/prophets-companions-infallible/ |website=About Islam |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=Nov 17, 2016 |quote=Regarding the issue of the prophets being sinless or infallible, there is an agreement among scholars that prophets are protected from sins. The protection of all prophets from sins is an Islamic belief, which is a precondition to trusting the prophets’ message and following their example.
However, there is a debate among scholars on whether prophets (peace be upon them all) are subject to error in judgments in “human” matters. The word `issmah (literally: protection) is mentioned in the Quran in the context of the Prophet being protected from people’s whims and Satan’s delusions while he conveys the message of God.
However, the Quran did correct Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) on a few occasions in matters of human judgment (Quran 8:67; 9:43; and 80:1-3).
Nevertheless, some scholars rejected the possibility of erring in any prophetic decision whatsoever (for example, Al-Amedi, Al-Ihkaam fi Usul Al-Ahkam, vol.4, p. 99, Dar Al-Kitab Al-Arabi, Beirut, AH 1404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IQA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saalih al-Munajjid |first1=Muhammad |title=248875: Infallibility of the Prophets |url=https://islamqa.info/en/248875 |website=Islam Question and Answer |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=4 January 2017 |quote=The Prophets were infallible in conveying the message from Allah, may He be exalted, so their words could not be but true and they did not make any mistake, whether deliberate or otherwise, in conveying the message.  They were also infallible and protected from committing major sins such as zina (adultery) and theft.  They were also infallible and protected from committing minor sins that are indicative of baseness, such as stealing a morsel of food or giving short measure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran speaks of the ''Islamic prophets'' as being the greatest human beings of all time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wheeler, ''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', "Prophets"&lt;/ref&gt; A prophet, in the Muslim sense of the term, is a person whom God specially chose to teach the faith of Islam.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some were called to prophesy late in life, in Muhammad's case at the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, ''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', "Noah"&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as John the Baptist, were called to prophesy while still at a young age and Jesus prophesied while still in his cradle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|30|e=33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Quran verse 4:69 lists various virtuous groups of human beings, among whom prophets (including messengers) occupy the highest rank. Verse 4:69 reads:&lt;ref name="EoQP"/&gt;

{{quote|All who obey [[Allah]] and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of Allah—of the prophets (who teach), the sincere (lovers of Truth), the witnesses (who testify), and the Righteous (who do good): Ah! what a beautiful fellowship!|Quran, sura 4 (An-Nisa), ''[[ayah]]'' 69&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|69|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Biblical stories retold in the Quran in the Arabic language (e.g., Job, Moses, [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] ([[Joseph in Islam|Yusuf]]) etc.) certainly differ from the Jewish [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Greek Old Testament]] and the Greek [[New Testament]], in that the Quran always demonstrates that it is "God's practice" (''[[sunnat Allah]]'') to make faith triumph finally over the forces of evil and adversity. "We have made the [[Shaitan|evil ones]] friends to those without faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|27|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Assuredly God will defend those who believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|22|49|e=133|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eoi-84&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosskeen Gibb,|first1=Hamilton Alexander|last2=Pellat|first2=Charles|last3=Schacht|first3=Joseph|last4=Lewis,|first4=Bernard|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|date=1973|publisher=Brill|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the [[Islamic view of Jesus' death|Islamic Isa]] did not die on the cross like the Christian thought about Jesus, but deceived his enemies and ascended to heaven.

The prophets and messengers "share no divine attributes", and possess "no knowledge or power" other than that granted to them by God.&lt;ref name=EHHoF&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Amriki|first1=Yusuf Talal Ali|last2=Ullah|first2=Qazi Thanaa|title=Essential Hanafi Handbook of Fiqh|date=1985|publisher=Kazi Publications|location=Lahore, Pakistan|pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Numbers ===
Muslims believe that many prophets existed, including many not mentioned in the Quran.

But Abu’l-Faraj ibn al-Jazwi disagreed with him and included this hadeeth in his book ''al-Mawdoo‘aat'' (the fabricated hadeeths) and accused Ibraaheem ibn Hishaam of fabricating the hadeeth. There is no doubt that more than one of the imams of ''al-jarh wa’t-ta‘deel'' (evaluation of hadeeth narrators) criticised him because of this hadeeth. "&lt;/ref&gt; and Shu'ayb al-Arna'oot&lt;ref&gt;''Tahqeeq Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan'', 2/79, "Shu‘ayb al-Arna’oot said: Its ''isnaad'' is ''da‘eef jiddan'' (very weak) – and he quoted the comments of the scholars about Ibraaheem ibn Hishaam."&lt;/ref&gt; the narration is weak, if not fabricated.

=== Female prophets ===
Most mainstream [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] scholars agree that prophets were males only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = There were no female prophets - Islam web - English|url = http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=31788|website = www.islamweb.net|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}} Still, some like [[Ibn Hazm]], [[Al-Qurtubi|Qartubi]], [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajir]], and [[Ash'ari|al Ash‘ari]] thought that the verses that mention angels speaking to Mary are proofs of her prophethood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Surat 'Ali `Imran [3:42] - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم|url = http://legacy.quran.com/3/42|website = legacy.quran.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://islamqa.info/en/158044&lt;nowiki/&gt;With regard to Prophethood, some of the scholars – such as Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari, al-Qurtubi and Ibn Hazm – were of the view that there were some female Prophets! including Maryam bint ‘Imraan. Their evidence is the verses in which it says that Allah, may He be exalted, sent revelation to the mother of Moosa, for example, and what it says about the angels speaking to Maryam (peace be upon her), and also what it says about Allah, may He be exalted, having chosen her above the women of the world.
&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}}  Also, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajir]] interprets the Hadith "Many among men attained perfection but among women none attained the perfection except Mary, the daughter of `Imran; and Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh." He said perfection is prophethood, hence his claim that Mary and [[Asiya]] were prophets.&lt;ref&gt;http://islamqa.info/en/7181&lt;nowiki/&gt;The scholars differed as to the meaning of the perfection of women. Some said, it refers to Prophethood.

Ibn Hajar said in "''al-Fath''":

"… it is as if he said: No women attained Prophethood except for So and so and So and so." (''al-Fath'', 6/447).
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scriptures and other gifts ==

=== Holy books ===
{{See also|Islamic holy books}}
The revealed books are the records which Muslims believe were dictated by God to various Islamic prophets throughout the history of mankind, all these books promulgated the code and laws of Islam. The belief in all the revealed books is an [[Creed#Islamic creed|article of faith]] in Islam and Muslims must believe in all the scriptures to be a Muslim. Muslims believe the Quran, the final holy scripture, was sent because all the previous holy books had been either [[Tahrif|corrupted]] or lost.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse, "Holy Books"&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Islam speaks of respecting all the previous scriptures, even in their current forms.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran mentions some Islamic scriptures by name, which came before the Quran:
* ''[[Torah in Islam|Tawrat]]'' ([[Torah]]): According to the Quran, the Tawrat (Torah) was revealed to Moses,&lt;ref name="Q5336"&gt;{{Cite quran|53|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Muslims believe that the current Pentateuch, although it retains the main message,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|87|18|e=19|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suffered corruption over the years. Moses and his brother Haroon ([[Aaron]]) used the Torah to preach the message to the Children of Israel. The Quran implies that the Torah is the longest-used scripture, with the [[Jews|Jewish]] people still using the Torah today, and that all the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] prophets would warn the people of any corruptions that were in the scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|44|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus, in Muslim belief, was the last prophet to be taught the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]] in its true form.
* ''[[Zabur]]'' ([[Psalms]]): The Quran mentions the Psalms as being the holy scripture revealed to David. Scholars have often understood the Psalms to have been holy songs of praise.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', "Psalms"&lt;/ref&gt; The current Psalms are still praised by many Muslim scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Martin Lings, ''Mecca''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Abdul Malik, ''In Thy Seed''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Muslims generally assume that some of the current Psalms were written later and are not divinely revealed.
* Book of Enlightenment ([[Arabic]]: &lt;big&gt;كِتَابُ ٱلْمُنِير&lt;/big&gt; ''Kitābu ’l-Munīr''): The Quran mentions a ''Book of Enlightenment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|184|s=ns}} and {{Cite quran|35|25|s=ns|b=n}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has alternatively been translated as ''Scripture of Enlightenment'' or the ''Illuminating Book''. It mentions that some prophets, in the past, came with clear signs from God as well as this particular scripture.
* Books of Divine Wisdom ([[Arabic]]: possibly identified as &lt;big&gt;الْزُبُر&lt;/big&gt; ''az-Zubur''): The Quran mentions certain ''Books of Divine Wisdom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|184|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated by some scholars as ''Books of Dark Prophecies'', which are a reference to particular books vouchsafed to some prophets, wherein there was wisdom for man. Some scholars have suggested that these may be one and the same as the Psalms as their root Arabic word, ''Zubur'' (Quran 35:25) - the plural for the word "Scriptures", comes from the same source as the Arabic ''Zabur'' for the Psalms.
* ''[[Gospel in Islam|İnjil]]'' ([[Gospel]]): The İnjil (Gospel) was the holy book revealed to Jesus, according to the Quran. Although many lay Muslims believe the ''Injil'' refers to the entire New Testament, scholars have clearly pointed out that it refers not to the New Testament but to an original Gospel, which was sent by God, and was given to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary'', Appendix: "On the Injil"&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, according to Muslim belief, the Gospel was the message that Jesus, being divinely inspired, preached to the Children of Israel. The current [[Development of the New Testament canon|canonical Gospels]], in the belief of Muslim scholars, are not divinely revealed but rather are documents of the life of Jesus, as written by various contemporaries, disciples and companions. These Gospels contain portions of Jesus's teachings but do not represent the original Gospel, which was a single book written not by a human but was sent by God.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', "Injil"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scrolls of Abraham]]: ([[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ ٱلْأُولَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Ūlā'' - "Books of the Earliest Revelation" and/or [[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ إِبْرَهِيم ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’Ibrahīm'') The Scrolls of Abraham are believed to have been one of the earliest bodies of scripture, which were vouchsafed to Abraham,&lt;ref name="quran8719"&gt;{{Cite quran|87|19|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later used by Ishmael and Isaac. Although usually referred to as 'scrolls/ manuscript', many translators have translated the Arabic ''Suhuf'' as 'the Scriptures'.&lt;ref&gt;Marmaduke Pickthall, ''The Meaning of the Glorious Quran''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''The Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scrolls of Abraham are now considered lost rather than corrupted, although some scholars{{who ?|date=May 2018}} have identified them with the [[Testament of Abraham]], an [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic piece of literature]] available in Arabic at the time of Muhammad{{source needed|date=May 2018}}. The verse mentioning the "Scriptures" is in Quran 87:18-19 where they are referred to "Books of the Earliest Revelation".
* [[Scrolls of Moses]]: ([[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ ٱلْأُولَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Ūlā'' - "Books of the Earliest Revelation" and/or [[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ مُوسَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Mūsā'') These scrolls, containing the revelations of Moses, which were perhaps written down later by Moses, Aaron and [[Joshua]], are understood by Muslims to refer not to the Torah but to revelations aside from the Torah. Some scholars have stated that they could possibly refer to the [[Book of the Wars of the Lord]],&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''The Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lost text spoken of in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 21:14&lt;/ref&gt; The verse mentioning the "Scriptures" is in Quran 87:18-19 where they are referred to "Books of the Earliest Revelation".

=== Holy gifts ===
{{Religious text primary|section|date=June 2011}}
The Quran mentions various divinely-bestowed gifts given to various prophets. These may be interpreted as books or forms of celestial knowledge. Although all prophets are believed by Muslims to have been immensely gifted, special mention of "wisdom" or "knowledge" for a particular prophet is understood to mean that some secret knowledge was revealed to him. The Quran mentions that Abraham prayed for wisdom and later received it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|26|83|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also mentions that Joseph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|10|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|28|14|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; both attained wisdom when they reached full age; David received wisdom with kingship, after slaying [[Goliath]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|251|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] ([[Lot in Islam|Lut]] received wisdom whilst prophesying in [[Sodom and Gomorrah]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|21|74|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; John the Baptist received wisdom while still a mere youth;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|14|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jesus received wisdom and was vouchsafed the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|48|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prophethood in Ahmadiyya ===
{{main article|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}
The [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Community]] does not believe that messengers and prophets are different individuals. They interpret the Quranic words ''warner'' (''[[nadhir]]''), ''prophet'', and ''messenger'' as referring to different roles that the same divinely appointed individuals perform. Ahmadiyya distinguish only between law-bearing prophets and non-law-bearing ones. They believe that although law-bearing prophethood ended with Muhammad, non-law-bearing prophethood subordinate to Muhammad continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Alexa|date=2016|title=Placing the Marginalized Ahmadiyya in Context with the Traditional Sunni Majority|url=https://journals.gmu.edu/jmgr/article/download/1330/1142|dead-url=no|journal=3|publisher=Journal of Mason Graduate Research|volume=3|pages=122-123|issn=2327-0764|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181006041014/https://journals.gmu.edu/jmgr/article/download/1330/1142|archive-date=2018-10-06|via=Mason Publishing Journals (at [[George Mason University]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e85|title=Ahmadis - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahmadiyya Community recognizes [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] also known as Mirza Qadiani (1835–1908) as such a “prophet” of gods and the promised [[Messiah]] and [[Imam]] [[Mahdi]] of the latter days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mirza-Ghulam-Ahmad|title=Mirza Ghulam Ahmad {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam|Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement]] rejects his status as a prophet, instead considering him to be a renewer of the faith.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, all other Muslims and their scholars argue and firmly establish that the Ahmadiyya community are not even Muslim due to the fact their beliefs violate the Muslim belief in Muhammad as the "Seal of the Prophets" (Khatam an-Nabiyyin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Other persons ==
The Quran mentions 25 prophets by name but also tells that God (Allah) sent many other prophets and messengers, to all the different nations that have existed on Earth. Many verses in the Qur'an discuss this:
* "We did aforetime send messengers before thee: of them there are some whose story We have related to thee, and some whose story We have not related to thee...."&lt;ref name="quran4078"&gt;{{cite quran|40|78|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For We assuredly sent amongst every People a messenger, ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|16|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other special persons in the Qur'an ===
* [[Caleb#Quranic account|Caleb (Kaleb)]]: In the Quran, Caleb is mentioned in the 5th [[surah]] of the Quran (5:20-26).
* [[Dhul-Qarnayn]]: Dhul-Qarnayn.  
* [[Joachim#In Islam|Joachim (Imran)]]: The [[Al Imran|Family of Imran]] ([[Arabic]]: '''آل عمران''') is the 3rd chapter of the Quran. ''Imran'' is [[Arabic]] for the biblical figure [[Amram]], the father of Moses and Aaron, who is regarded by Muslims as being the ancestor of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] ([[Mary in Islam|Maryām]]) and Jesus through his son Aaron. In Muslim belief, however, the [[Christian]] Joachim has been attributed the name Imran as well.
* [[Khidr]]: The Quran also mentions the mysterious Khidr (but does not name him), identified at times with [[Melchizedek]], who is the figure that Moses accompanies on one journey. Although most Muslims regard him as an enigmatic saint or an angel,&lt;ref&gt;Jill Caskey, Adam S. Cohen, Linda Safran ''Confronting the Borders of Medieval Art'' BRILL 2011 {{ISBN|978-9-004-20749-3}} page 124&lt;/ref&gt; some see him as a prophet as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/863824465|title=The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism|last=Noegel|first=Scott B.|last2=Wheeler|first2=Brannon M.|date=2010-04-01|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9781461718956|location=Lanham|pages=196-197|oclc=863824465}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Luqman]]: The Quran mentions the [[Wise old man|sage]] Luqman in [[Luqman (sura)|the chapter]] named after him, but does not clearly identify him as a prophet. The most widespread Islamic belief&lt;ref&gt;''A-Z of Prophets in Islam'', B. M. Wheeler, "Luqman"&lt;/ref&gt; views Luqman as a [[saint]], but not as a prophet. The Arabic term ''[[wali]]'' (Arabic ولي, plural Awliyā' أولياء) is commonly translated into English as "Saint". However, the wali should not be confused with the Christian tradition of sainthood. A key difference is that the wali continues what a prophet taught without any change. However, other Muslims regard Luqman as a prophet as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse, "Prophets in Islam"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mary in Islam|Mary (Maryam)]]: A few scholars (such as [[Ibn Hazm]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/islam/gender/women_prophethood.html|title=Imam Ibn Hazm: On Prophethood of Women|last=Farooq|first=Mohammad Omar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312084433/http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/islam/gender/women_prophethood.html|archive-date=2005-03-12|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=Mohammed Zayki|date=2015|title=Ibn Ḥazm’s theory of prophecy of women: Literalism, logic, and perfection|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.831.1259&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|dead-url=no|journal=Intellectual Discourse|publisher=IIUM Press|volume=23|issue=1|pages=76-77|issn=0128-4878|eissn=2289-5639|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181006035648/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.831.1259&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|archive-date=2018-10-05|via=[[CiteSeerX]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; see Maryam (Mary) as a ''nabi'' and a prophetess, since God sent her a message via an angel. The Quran, however, does not explicitly identify her as a prophet. Islamic belief regards her as one of the holiest of women, but not as a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond The Exotic: Women's Histories In Islamic Societies'', p. 402. Ed. Amira El-Azhary Sonbol. [[Syracuse University Press]], 2005. {{ISBN|9780815630555}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[People of Ya-Sin|Three persons of the town]]: These three unnamed person, who were sent to the same town, are referenced in [[Ya Sin|chapter 36]] of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|36|13|e=21|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=October 2018}}
* [[Saul#In Islam|Saul]] ([[Talut]]): Saul is not considered a prophet, but a divinely appointed king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2115|title=Saul - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jacob#Children of Jacob|Sons of Jacob]]: These men are sometimes not considered to be prophets, although most exegesis scholars consider them to be prophets, citing the hadith of Muhammad and their status as prophets in Judaism. The reason that some do not consider them as prophets is because of their behaviour with Yusuf (Joseph) and that they lied to their father.

=== Other people mentioned in Islamic literature ===
Numerous other people have been mentioned by scholars in the Hadith, [[exegesis]], [[Tafsir|commentary]]. These people include:
* [[Cain and Abel in Islam|Habil]] ([[Abel]])&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
* [[Daniel in Islam|Danyal]] ([[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism|first= B.

}}
According to the post-1900 publications of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the writings of [[C. W. Leadbeater]], [[Annie Besant]], etc., as well as those authors influenced by the theosophical teachings such as [[Alice A. Bailey]], and [[Benjamin Creme]], and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] of [[Guy Ballard]], [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]],  [[Geraldine Innocente]], [[Joshua David Stone]], and other Ascended Master Teachings / teachers,&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lord Sunat Kumara'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ascension-research.org/sanat.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; is an "Advanced Being" at the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ninth level of initiation]] who is regarded as the 'Lord' or 'Regent' of [[Earth]] and of the [[Human race|humanity]], and is thought to be the head of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth who dwells in [[Shamballah]] (also known as 'The City of Enoch').

Shamballah is said by the adherents to the Ascended Master Teachings, to be a floating city manifested on the [[etheric plane]] somewhere above the [[Gobi Desert]] in the borderlands of [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;(See: '[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]' By [[Yogananda Paramahansa]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A Tibetan Journey]] By Alexandra David-Neale. 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great White Brotherhood]] is a spiritual 'fraternity' of Ascended Beings, including Lord Sunat Kumara, long since dedicated to the eventual Salvation of Mankind and the establishment of Divine Law again in this Three-dimensional reality.

According to Elizabeth Van Buren, the Brotherhood once maintained (earthly) headquarters hidden in a remote valley near a sacred lake in old Tibet, until relatively recently, when, possibly due to the surmised threat of Communist China, they withdrew, allegedly through subterranean tunnels to an alternative earthly location in [[Peru]], where they are still reported as having an earth base (circa 1985).&lt;ref&gt;[[Authors Notes: 'The Refuge of the Apocalypse.]] By Elizabeth Van Buren. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors believe that Lord Sunat Kumara is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, composed of [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] (called in the Ascended Master Teachings [[Ascended Master]]s) and volunteers from other worlds who have joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004. Describes the founding of Shamballah by Sunat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in Hinduism==
Sanat Kumara appears as a [[rishi]] in the [[Hindu]] [[religious text]] the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]. A shrine to Sanat Kumara which attracts and unites people of all religions and faiths is situated in the town of [[Kataragama]], [[Sri Lanka]]. In Sanskrit, "Sanat Kumara" is "Eternal Youth" (from [[Sant (religion)|Sanat]] "eternal", Ku "with difficulty" and Mara "mortal"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danijel.org/index.php?id=clanak&amp;articleID=161&amp;pageID=22 O znalcima vraga] — Danijel Turina&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Kumar resides in the most sublime center of our planet, [[Shamballa]], the [[sahasrara]] of the world.  The Kumara has several names, relating to the sahasrara centers of different Systemic Existences: At the Supra-Cosmic plane, he is called ''Sanatana''; at the Cosmic plane, it is ''Subrahmanya''; at the Solar plane, the Kumara is ''Sanaka''; at the Planetary plane, it is ''Sanandana''; and on this planet, it is ''Sanath'' Kumara. So Sanath Kumara is an aspect of Kumara that resides in Shamballa.

Scriptures, especially the [[Mahabharata]], say that it is Sanath Kumara who comes down to help the Divine Plan of Creation, when [[Lord Krishna]] came to be. He was born to Lord Krishna as his son, and he was named [[Pradyumna]]. Sanath Kumara incarnates himself through the Divine Mother [[Rukmini]] as Pradyumna. On completion of his work, He again gets back to his original position and takes to the seat in Shambala as Sanath Kumara. These details are given in the last chapters of [[Mahabharata]].

==Shamballa in Buddhism – home of the King of the World==

''Shambhala'' ([[Wylie transliteration|Tib]]. ''bde 'byung'') in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] (the religion of [[Tibet]]) is a [[Sanskrit]] term meaning "place of peace/tranquility/happiness". [[Gautama Buddha]] is said by Vajrayana Buddhists to have taught the [[Kalachakra]] [[tantra]] on request of King [[Suchandra]] of Shambhala; the teachings are also said to be preserved in Shamballa.  The [[Stanzas of Dzyan]] from which [[Madame Blavatsky]] claimed to have gotten the information in [[The Secret Doctrine]] are believed by some scholars to have been a mistranslation of words ''Kalachakra tantra'' (''rGyud-sde'' in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reigle, David and Nancy ''Blavatsky's Secret Books'' San Diego 1999. {{ISBN|0-913510-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shambhala is ruled over by a line of [[Kings of Shambhala]] known as [[Kulika]] or [[Kalki]] Kings (Tib. ''Rigden''), a monarch who upholds the integrity of the ''Kalachakra tantra''. In the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism, the King of Shamballa is often metaphorically referred to as ''The King of the World''.  Shamballa was thought by the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s to be somewhere north of [[Lake Manasarovar]] and its adjacent [[Mount Kailash|Mount Kailasa]], a [[sacred mountain]] in Tibet where it is thought that all the [[Ley line|dragon current]]s intersect.

==The Defender Lord at Kurama Temple==
The ancient Buddhist temple, [[Kurama-dera]] in [[Japan]], is host to a unique bodhisattva, the "Defender Lord", who is said to come from the planet Venus 6.5 million years ago. He is described as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Sanat Kumara in Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
Sanat Kumara  was mentioned briefly  by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Sanat Kumara – Volume I: 89, 457–458; Volume II: pages 106, 140, 319, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the "Lords of the Flame", whom Christian tradition has presented as [[Lucifer]] and the fallen angels.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Volume II pp 243 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara gained greater prominence when Blavatsky's close-friend and colleague  [[Charles W. Leadbeater]] wrote that Sanat Kumara was the "King" or ''Lord of the World'', and the head of the [[Great White Brotherhood]] of [[Mahatma]]s who had revealed the principles of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Pages 296–299&lt;/ref&gt;

Later authors who draw from Theosophical teachings such as [[Alice Bailey]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] have added to the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy, said to be the incarnation of the Will of the Logos, and purportedly possesses an unaging body not born of mortal woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q6xVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=sanat+kumara+theosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ts3XnQyt-F&amp;sig=IEXRZ-Z1gLLBh6-bQnczyiul1BM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP-I-i6bvKAhXGlh4KHbeKBhk4FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sanat%20kumara%20theosophy&amp;f=false First Principles of Theosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Descent of Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Living Flame from Venus==
C.W. Leadbeater and later adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] such as Alice A. Bailey believe that Sanat Kumara descended from the [[etheric plane]] of the planet [[Venus]] to [[Earth]] 18,500,000 years ago (A.E. Powell gives a figure of 16,500,000 years ago; [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] of [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] does not give a specific date but says it was a minimum of 2,500,000 years ago). In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the beings that helped Sanat Kumara organize the expedition from [[Venus]] are called the "Lords of the Flame".  C.W. Leadbeater and [[Annie Besant]] said that Sanat Kumara brought 30 "Lords of the Flame" with him from Venus to help him set up his colony.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 299&lt;/ref&gt; In the later version of the story promulgated by [[Guy Ballard]], notable "Lords of the Flame" include [[Gautama Buddha]], and the [[World Teacher]] (the being referred to alternately as [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] or [[Christ]] by [[Benjamin Creme]]). [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]'s [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] teaches that Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Flame also brought [[144,000]] souls with them from Venus. Alice Bailey, on the other hand, gives the number 105 only. The prior incarnation and only incarnation of Maitreya, the Lord of Consciousness, according to some interpretations (not C.W. Leadbeater's), is Gauthama Siddartha Sakyamuni / Lord Buddha; according to these interpretations, he essentially 'overshadowed' the body of Gautama Siddhartha Buddha with Siddhartha's permission.

Sanat Kumara is regarded as the great guru, saviour of Earth. Believers in him see him in all the major religions, as [[Murugan|Skanda]]/[[Kartikkeya]] in [[Hinduism]], [[Brahma]]-'''Sanam Kumar''' in [[Buddhism]], the [[Ancient of Days]] in [[Judeo-Christian]] traditions, and identify him as [[Ahura Mazda]] in [[Zoroastrianism]] (although the last of these claims is contested from a lack of information on the subject). It is also considered that Sanat Kumara is [[Al Khdir]] (green man) known to [[Sufi]] Muslims (according to [[Dakshinamurti]]).

It is maintained in most of these versions of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that [[Venus]], the 'Planet of Love', is the most spiritually advanced [[planet]] of our [[solar system]]. The beings living on the [[etheric plane]] of [[Venus]] are said to be hundreds of millions of years ahead of us in their spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London: 1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution) See chart on Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritofra.com/EC_etheric_planes.htm Planetary Schemes of Our Solar System According to Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the governing council of [[Venus]] – the ''Seven Holy Kumars'' – sent one of themselves, Sanat Kumara, here to guide us.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana: 2003 Summit University Press, pages 339–341&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theosophy, once Sanat Kumara arrived here, he directed the construction of the city of Shamballa on the [[etheric plane]] above the [[Gobi Desert]] to serve as his headquarters. Elizabeth Clare Prophet teaches that Shamballa was built physically on the White Island in the Gobi Sea (now the Gobi Desert), and was only later withdrawn from the physical to the etheric plane.

==City plan of Shamballa==
The main temple of Shamballa is topped with a [[Gold (color)|golden]] dome and is surrounded by seven smaller temples—one for each of the seven rays.  These temples are located on a number of wide [[boulevard]]s resembling the [[Champs-Elysees]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet, (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 465–470 Shamballa&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, [[George Washington]] was divinely inspired by the Ascended Masters to choose [[city planner]] [[Pierre L'Enfant]] to create the [[city plan]] of [[Washington DC]] which, it is claimed, he unconsciously modeled on the plan of the city of Shamballa.

==Appellations (titles) of Sanat Kumara==
The most common title attributed to Lord Sanat Kumara in the Theosophical religious tradition is "Lord of the World". [[C.W. Leadbeater]] also states that an important duty of Sanat Kumara is to participate in an elaborate ritual every [[Wesak]] (the Full Moon of May) led by [[Gautama Buddha]], and also participated in by the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] (the being Theosophists identify as [[Christ]]), in which [[Spiritual energy|cosmic energy]] is focused from the "Solar Logos" to Earth in order to keep our planet's cosmic energy in balance.  The ritual is said to take place in a ravine in southern [[Tibet]] (the Frontispiece of Leadbeater's book ''The Masters and the Path'' has a picture of the ritual taking place) and, it is stated by Leadbeater, can be viewed by in the [[etheric body]] or in the [[physical body]] by those who have [[third eye|etheric sight]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1929 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997) – Fold-out picture facing the title page of the book shows a picture of Lord Sananda Buddha performing the Wesak ritual&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, two other common appellations of Sanat Kumara are two opposite titles: "The Ancient of Days" (because he has been on [[Earth]] millions of years) and "The Youth of Sixteen Summers" (because even though he is millions of years old, he still looks like he is 16 years old).  Another of his titles is "The One Initiator" because it is said by C. W. Leadbeater in the ''Masters and the Path'' that he personally performs the initiation ceremony for anyone who has reached the third level of spiritual [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]].  [[Alice A. Bailey]] indicates the same in her writings.

In the all organizations subscribing to the "''Ascended Master Teachings''", Sanat Kumara is presented  as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]]. He is also currently, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, known as the "Regent Lord of the World" in deference to [[Gautama Buddha]] having taken the office of "Lord of the World". (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989. Describes Sanat Kumara and his role in founding the Brotherhood on Earth and passing the office of "Lord of the World" to Lord Sananda.&lt;/ref&gt; With Sananda Buddha taking on more of the day-to-day administrative tasks of governing the planet, this arrangement allows Sanat Kumara more time for the long-range [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] planning and interstellar diplomacy that is necessary for him to prepare Earth for its eventual admission to what [[Joshua David Stone]] calls the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Galactic Confederation of Planets|Galactic Confederation of Planets]].

Sanat Kumara's symbol of the authority of his office as ''Lord of the World'' is a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} [[magic wand]] called the ''Rod of Power'' made of the metal [[orichalcum]], with cone-shaped [[diamond]]s on each end.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Pages 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Venus==
[[The Bridge to Freedom]], [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] and all other "[[Ascended Master Teachings]]" organizations believe that Sanat Kumara has a ''Divine Complement'' (''Twin Flame'') (i.e., a ''celestial wife'') – '''Lady Master Venus'''[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg Image of Lady Master Venus shown above is originally from the Church Universal and Triumphant):]&lt;/ref&gt; – the New Age "[[goddess|Goddess of Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Summarizes the beliefs about Sanat Kumara by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt; The Ascended ''Lady Master Venus'' is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.  Sanat Kumara is believed to have [[Marriage|married]] Lady Master Venus millions of years ago on Venus before he came to Earth.

==Lady Master Meta==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus have a daughter named the '''Lady Master Meta''' [http://www.ethericretreats.com/images/meta.jpg] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethericretreats.com/meta.htm Source of (not very clear) Image of the Lady Master Meta—Etheric Retreats website:]&lt;/ref&gt; who they brought with them from Venus.  She is said to have incarnated as an [[Avatar]] in Atlantis (where she served as the [[high priestess]] at the ''Temple of Healing'') and in [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian Persia]], where she married a [[wikt:mortality|mortal]] and had three children.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, she is revered as the ''Goddess of Healing'' and is the patron deity of [[physician|doctor]]s and [[nurse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt; Since she is [[Immortality|immortal]], possessing a celestial body like Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus, she, like the Lady Master Venus, also has the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.

==Master Cha Ara==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the '''Master Cha Ara''' [http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/BofLight/CHA-ARA.JPG ] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/brotherhoodoflight.htm Source of Image of Master Cha Ara – World Global Express Brotherhood of Light:]&lt;/ref&gt;
was originally one of the three children of Lady Master Meta when she incarnated as an Avatar in [[Sassanian empire|Sassanian Persia]].  He became a master [[alchemy|alchemist]] who formulated an [[elixir of immortality]] made from [[Rose|rose petals]], tea leaves from mcleod ganj and other ingredients.  This enabled him to quickly achieve ascended masterhood.  He uses small amounts of the elixir to heal people.  He is the protector of all [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]].  He works with [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]] to bring about the New Age in the West [[Americas]].  Lady Master Meta’s husband and her other two children from her descent as an Avatar to Sassanian Persia have also become ascended masters but their names have not yet been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 52 Master Cha Ara; pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Nada==

In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of religions based on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], '''Lady Master Nada'''&lt;ref&gt;Artist concept:[http://www.summitlh.com/minneapolis/chohans/chohans_files/_notes/nada-lrg-n.jpg] - source of image Summit Lighthouse Teaching Center (Minneapolis-St. Paul, USA)&lt;/ref&gt; is the "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" (see [[Seven Rays]]), and is the [[Ascended master|Ascended Lady Master]] governing humanity's development of the Divine Qualities of Ministration, Service, and Peace. The colors of her [[Seven Rays|Ray]] are [[purple]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]], and also [[Ruby (color)|ruby]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II"&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and [[The Bridge to Freedom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also considered a Member of the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]]; she handles the appeals of those on the [[Seven Rays|third ray]].  She is believed by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to have succeeded the previous Chohan, the '''Master Jesus / Sananda Buddha''', on January 1, 1956, when she is said to have fully taken on the Office of Chohan of the Sixth Ray.,&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and [[The Summit Lighthouse]] Pages 144 and 240&lt;/ref&gt; thus advancing from the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|fifth to the sixth level of initiation]].  She primarily serves at ''Arabian  Retreat'' in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], northeast of the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Nada serves there with the Brothers and Sisters of the [[Indigo]] Cape, as well as with [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], his [[Mother Mary]] and El Samyam, the  Chief of the Arabian Council.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The Magic Presence''. The Compt de Saint-Germain Press 1935. Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; She also serves at ''The [[Rose (color)|Rose]] Temple'', located on the [[etheric plane]] above [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. Designed after the pattern of a [[rose]], with each "petal" being a room, this Retreat is the etheric counterpart of the "Temple of Love" on [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] where Nada once served as a High Priestess.  In another human incarnate life in Atlantis, she was a [[lawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The [[I AM Activity]] and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; She was described as having raised her body and [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ascended]] approximately 2,776 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The I AM Discourses''. Saint Germain Press 1935. page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Lady Master Nada's home residence (called in the Ascended Master Teachings her "retreat") is underground on the etheric plane on the Arabian peninsula, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, she teleports to Shamballa every workday to her day job on the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]], hearing the cases of those souls who are on the third ray.

==Masters of the Ancient Wisdom==

According to  the [["I AM" Activity]], the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998. Refers also to the other six Kumars that assist Sanat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt; and others, the [[Ascended Master]]s (The great beings the original Theosophists called the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]"), such as the [[Master Jesus]], [[Count of St Germain|Saint Germain]], '''Megha Alcorn''' aka '''Megan Sebastian''' on [[Earth]],   [[Kuthumi]], '''Hatton''', [[Gopal Das]] and others are working for the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of our planet, under the leadership of Lord Sanat Kumara, [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]].  Many theosophists believe the "Masters" utilize the cosmic power of the [[Seven Rays]] to advance the ''Plan of the Masters'' to encourage the continual advance of [[civilization]] on [[Earth]] toward higher [[Initiation (Theosophy)|levels of consciousness]]. One of the beliefs of adherents of these belief systems is that the Masters of Wisdom have united together in an organization called the ''[[Great White Brotherhood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America''. Summit University Press 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara is also often referred to as the manifestation of the 'Solar Logos'==

The Theosophist '''A.E. Powell''' stated that Sanat Kumara (whom he refers to as the ''Lord of the World'') is in continuous telepathic rapport with '''ANNA''' / [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the ''Spirit of the Earth'' (i.e., the ''Planetary Logos'' – equivalent to the goddess known in some religions as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] or as Prithivi in Hinduism).&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution)&lt;/ref&gt;[[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]] stated that Sanat Kumara is in continuous [[Telepathy|telepathic]] rapport with the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]] (the Being considered by Theosophists as the consciousness of the [[Sun]]). It is believed in Theosophy that Sanat Kumara captures the mystical power of the [[Seven Rays]] from the Solar Logos and distributes it to his assistants who guide the spiritual evolution of humanity, the ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'' (the Ascended Masters), who then focus the power to us.  An intermediate trinity of [[Pratyeka]]-Buddhas assists Lord Buddha in stepping down this power from Sanat Kumara to Earth's [[Spiritual Hierarchy]], and these Buddhas are also said to be Kumars originally from Venus.

==The council chamber of the Lord of the World==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Lord Sanat Kumara conducts business in an enormous room in his palace called ''The Council Chamber of the Lord of the World''.  It is here that he regularly meets with [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the '''Maha Chohan''', [[Djwal Khul]], [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]], the [[Master Jesus]] and the other [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], of which it is said there are 24 principal council members, to assess the progress being made in implementing ''The Plan of the Masters'' to bring the [[human race]] to [[Level of consciousness|higher levels of consciousness]].  According to C.W. Leadbeater, it is also here that he periodically personally receives ambassadors from [[Planetary system|other solar systems]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Sanat Kumara has many assistants who help him in his arduous task of spiritually governing Earth as its presiding Regent. 
These include '''The Watcher''' (also called the ''Silent Watcher'' or the ''Great Silent Watcher''), whose function it is to continually watch the [[Akashic records]] and download daily all the [[information]] on them relevant to the life waves of Earth and forward it to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 300&lt;/ref&gt; (the Watcher is part of a special race of beings who fulfill this function that are posted on planets throughout the [[Cosmos]] &lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press (Note: the idea that Watcher was part of race of beings posted throughout the Cosmos to fulfill this functions was first promulgated by C.W. Leadbeater and continued by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet) The Great Silent Watchers Page 122&lt;/ref&gt; ); the '''Lords of Karma''' – Alice A. Bailey mentioned three ''Lords of Karma'' but did not name them; they are called in the Ascended Master Teachings the '''Karmic Board''' and they are stated to number seven and each of them is identified by name: '''The Great Divine Director''' (1st ray), '''The Goddess of Liberty''' (2nd ray), '''[[Lady Master Nada]]''' (3rd ray), '''Cyclopea''' (4th ray), '''[[Athena|Pallas Athena]]''' (5th ray), '''Lady Master Portia''' (6th ray), and '''[[Kwan Yin]]''' (7th ray).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm Identity of the seven members of the Karmic Board according to the Ascended Master Teachings—The Goddess of Liberty, Kwan Yin, Pallas Athena, The Great Divine Director, Cyclopea, Nada, and Portia:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118080316/http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm |date=18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 153–155 The Karmic Board&lt;/ref&gt;  The Karmic Board decides when [[soul]]s that are between lives are to reincarnate again (if a disembodied soul desires to reincarnate somewhere or somewhen else than where they have been assigned, they must file an appeal with the Karmic Board—each person has to file an appeal to the member of the board that handles the appeals for their ''soul ray''); and the one Alice A. Bailey calls the '''Custodian of the Hall of Records''' (called the '''Keeper of the Scrolls''' in the Ascended Master Teachings), the being who is in charge of the ''Hall of Records'', an enormous administrative complex near Sanat Kumara’s palace in the etheric city of Shamballa—this is where the ''Recording Angels'' and those souls who are between incarnations who volunteer to give up their time in [[The Summerland#Summerland in Theosophy|Summerland]] and help perform this work make visual records (utilizing the most advanced [[supercomputers]] on the etheric plane of Earth) of everything that happens in everyone’s lives on Earth.  The raw [[data]] is first downloaded daily by ''The Watcher'' from the [[Akashic records]] and fed by him to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records'' and thence forwarded to the ''recording angels'' and their volunteer helpers.  These [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] records are sorted daily first into one of seven general files by the ''soul ray'' (see [[seven rays]]) of the soul that is reincarnating, and then downloaded from that general file into a special individual file for each soul that can be consulted by the ''Karmic Board'' if that soul makes an appeal before it.

==Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet==

'''Omri-Tas''', the ''Ruler of the Violet Planet'', is a [[Milky Way Galaxy|Galactic]] level Ascended Master ('''[[Spiritual Hierarchy]], Cosmic Beings''') who with his celestial mate, Irmo-Sat, [http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/elohim_of_aquariuslrg_.jpg],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/cosmicos_setimo.htm Source of Image of Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet and his Twin Flame – "Sintonia / Saint Germain". Portuguese language Ascended Master Teachings website:]&lt;/ref&gt; is Sanat Kumara's [[Ascended Master Teachings#Violet Flame|violet flame]] supplier.  The violet flame is composed of a special type of [[Occult Chemistry (book)|etheric matter particles]], which may plausibly be called ''violetrons'',  that are capable of cleansing bad [[karma]].   ''Omri-Tas'' rules a planet on the [[etheric plane]] called the Violet Planet, which is apparently several dozen to several hundred [[light year]]s from Earth.  The Violet Planet is one of many throughout the Cosmos that serve as reservoirs for the violet flame.  Omri-Tas is the ruler of the Violet Planet that is closest to Earth and which is responsible for transmitting the violet flame from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy|'''Great Central Sun''']] of the Cosmos via the '''Galactic Logos''' to planets in [[Spiritual Hierarchy|Ursa Major (Our sector is reputedly 'Sector Nine' of the 48 Sectors in this spiral Galaxy)]].  Omri-Tas or one of his representatives periodically teleports from the Violet Planet to Shamballa with canisters of violet flame to replenish the violet flame in the large circular pool in the ''Temple of the Violet Flame'' in Shamballa (In return for the violet flame. Lord Sanat Kumara assigns to his care and tutelage worthy initiated Adepts/Chelas for etheric transport to their next assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 249–253 Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benjamin Creme's views==
[[Benjamin Creme]] subscribes to the modern esoteric view that [[Nordic aliens]] (like those mentioned by [[George Adamski]] – Creme accepts Adamski's sightings as valid.) pilot [[flying saucer]]s from the Way-Station on Venus that is thought to exist on the [[etheric plane]] (Esotericists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the ''etheric plane'', the planet's [[heat]] doesn't affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the [[physical plane]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 205&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Creme's followers assume that Sanat Kumara and the 'Lords of the Flame' [See Elizabeth Van Buren's Book of the same name.](Nordic aliens themselves) visit from Venus in a flying saucer. How, they ask, did Sanat Kumara get to Earth from Venus if it wasn't on a flying saucer?  Creme's disciples believe that there is regular flying saucer traffic between Venus and Shamballa as well as other locations on Earth, especially areas where [[crop circles]] appear.  Creme's acolytes believe that Shamballa is equipped with an [[Spaceport|astrodrome]] as well as with numerous flying saucer landing pads attached to the tops or the sides of the buildings to accommodate the heavy flying saucer traffic from Venus.  Since Shamballa is envisioned as a [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] about five miles above the surface of the earth on the etheric plane, there are also numerous entrances in the basements of the buildings, where flying saucers can enter from the bottom of the city and park in spacious flying saucer parking garages provided in the basement levels of the buildings. In addition, says Creme, the Venusians have cigar-shaped [[mother ship]]s up to four miles long to accommodate the transport of multiple individual flying saucers to and from Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 133&lt;/ref&gt; According to Creme, sometimes flying saucers from places more distant than Venus, such as from [[Mars]], the [[Moons of Jupiter]], [[Uranus]], [[Sirius]], the [[Pleiades]], and beyond, fly in to pay a visit at Shamballa.  Since, according to Creme, the Venusians flying saucer designers outsource the actual construction of their flying saucers to the [[Martians]] (who are said to dwell on the etheric plane of Mars),&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 337&lt;/ref&gt; whom he describes as the "master engineers of the [[solar system]]",&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 194&lt;/ref&gt; Shamballa provides a convenient neutral ground where the Venusians and the Martians can meet to evaluate new flying saucer designs and negotiate flying saucer construction contracts between themselves.

==Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet==
The Master [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] was first incorporated into the Ascended Master Teachings by [[Joshua David Stone]] in the early 1990s, based on his incorporation of the early 1980s revelations of the medium [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)#Tuella|Tuella]] into his own teachings. Stone had already begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that the [[Master Jesus]], under his [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] name '''Sananda''' (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with '''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Commander Ashtar]]''', flying with '''[[Pallas Athena]]''' in their own flying saucer within the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet]] as its ''Commander-in-Chief''.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Joshua David ''Cosmic Ascension: Your Cosmic Map Home'' (March 1998) (Book 6 of the multi-volume series, The Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path) {{ISBN|0-929385-99-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stone, another name used by ''Commander Ashtar'' to denote his flying saucer fleet is ''The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood''. Although the Ashtar Command is ultimately under the titular authority of Sanat Kumara, the Master Jesus in consultation with Pallas Athena and Ashtar, make all the day to day command decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html The Ashtar Command by Joshua David Stone:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227160744/http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.

According to some, The Ashtar Command is simply a modern concept of the Sumerian/Babylonian goddess and deity [[Astarte]]/[[Ishtar]]/[[Isis]] and her entourage whose assigned function is to protect an evolving mankind from the [[Satan|Satanic forces]], then extant, on this planet, that sought to usurp the Earthly Regency of the local Ascended Masters in their role of protecting and engendering Divine Law upon the Earth until the arrival, at 'The Meridian of Time' of 'The [[Son of God]]'... Jesus/Sananda and his incarnation of 'The Christ Being'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Al Daoud.'' [By 'The Pen'. 1930].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lourene Altiery, also known as ''Karita'' to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from [[Joliet, Illinois]] who now resides in [[Sun Lakes, Arizona]] – she set up her website in 2001.  According to Altiery, there are four Masters originally from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near [[Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet]] who are now permanently stationed on Shamballa.  These are the Masters '''Ballerian''', who is the proprietor of a flying saucer repair facility in Shamballa called ''God's Garage''; '''Kumad''', an expert [[linguist]] who helps the Keeper of the Scrolls decipher and interpret ancient manuscripts; '''Ashlem''',  a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] Master who resides at the Hall of Records and helps people decipher their past lives by assisting them in accessing the [[Akashic records]]; and '''Sutko''', the "space detective", who helps the Master K-17 solve unusually difficult cases.  Elements of the ''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'' sometimes dock at Shamballa so the flying saucer crews can go on '[[shore leave]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Altiery, Lourene (Karita) ''The World's Greatest Teachings by Christ the Master and Other Avatars, Telepathically Communicated to Karita 2002'' {{ISBN|0-9718008-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serversofall.com/ Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery)—Images of the cosmic beings described above in the mid-level command hierarchy of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet are depicted on this web page:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hatonn and the Photon Belt==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], who began teaching in 1990, '''Hatonn''', an [[android (robot)|android]] [[Pleiadean]] Master who flies aboard the flying saucer ''Phoenix'' (one of the flying saucers of the ''Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'', piloted by Hatonn’s partner the Master '''Soltec'''), monitors events on Earth for the ''Galactic Hall of Records'' at the [[galactic Center|galactic core]].

He feeds information about events on Earth via [[Subspace radio|subspace relay]] to the [[supercomputer]]s at the "Galactic Hall of Records".  However, Bellringer says that this activity is secondary to Hatonn's primary task, which is functioning as the [[liaison officer]] between Sanat Kumara and the [[Pleiadeans]] in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate in [[2012 phenomenon|2012]] through the approaching so-called "[[photon belt]]", said to emanate from the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hatonnspeaksthetruth.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/hatonn-introduction-to-the-photon-belt/ Hatonn and the Photon Belt:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwinds10.com/siterun_static/general/about_fourwinds.php Four Winds10.com—website of Anne Bellringer:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian criticism==

According to many Christians, notably the anti-[[New Age]] author [[Constance Cumbey]], New Age Leaders, including Masters of the [[Illuminati]], are actually worshipping the Lord of this World, whose name is Sanat Kumara (Alice Bailey, ''Externalisation of the Hierarchy'', p.&amp;nbsp;676, 709, 725; and Elizabeth Van Buren, ''The Secret of the Illuminati'', p.&amp;nbsp;1). Bailey goes on to explain that Sanat Kumara is the "life and the forming intelligence", presiding over the Council of Shamballa [the Heaven of Earth according to New Age doctrine]. (''The New Age Dictionary'', p.&amp;nbsp;172) Further, Sanat Kumara is "the eternal youth from the Planet [[Venus]]". The name Lucifer is one of the ancient Greek names for Venus. Therefore, according to Cumbey, Sanat Kumara is merely another name for [[Satan]] or [[Lucifer]]. (Cumbey, ''Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow'') [7].

==Theosophical reply to Christian criticism==
Other [[New Age]] leaders have tried to separate themselves from the Illuminati movement, and view that burdening the two groups as entirely coexistent is inaccurate and ineffectual. New Age theosophy also counters these critics, teaching the fact that the being known as Sanat Kumara would rather see spiritual harmony and peace, a fact which many Illuminati members ignore and abuse.

In the glossary of in the back of the book ''Alchemy'', which [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] claims was dictated to her by [[Kuthumi]], Satan and Sanat Kumara are clearly distinguished as two different and opposed beings—Satan working for evil and Sanat Kumara for good.&lt;ref&gt;"Kuthumi" (dictated to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]) ''Alchemy'' 1982 Summit Lighthouse See glossary at end of book&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Sanat Kumara'', although mentioned in passing by Madame Blavatsky, was never mentioned by her as an important "Master" that Blavatsky claimed to have met.  He was first presented, under the name ''Lord of the World'', as the head of the "Masters" by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] in his 1925 book ''The Masters and the Path''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in popular culture==

'''[[Panelology]]'''
*Sanat Kumara’s helper ''The Watcher'' was apparently made into a [[Marvel Comics]] character called [[Uatu]] by [[Stan Lee]] in 1963. The [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher comic books]] have tales about a special race of beings talented at [[information processing]] called ''The Watchers'' spread throughout the [[Cosmos]], and it is believed in Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings that The Watcher belongs to.{{citationeeded|date=January 2016}}
'''Video games'''
*Sanat Kumara is the name of Helena Blavatsky's Noble Phantasm in ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]''. It takes the form of a flying saucer.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Scaea''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Σκαιήν means "left, on the left hand"), was one of the [[Daughters of Danaus|Danaids]].

==Family==
Scaea was the daughter of [[Danaus]], king of [[Libya]] and of [[Europa (Greek myth)|Europe]], a queen. She was the full sister of other Danaids namely Automate, [[Amymone]] and [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]]. ''Bibliotheca, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.1.5&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 Book 2.1.5]''&lt;/ref&gt; Scaea was married to [[Daiphron]], son of [[Aegyptus]] and later to [[Archander]] of whom she had begotten a son, [[Metanastes]].

==Mythology==
Scaea like her other sisters, except [[Hypermnestra]], killed their husbands on their wedding night at the behest of their father Danaus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the murder, later on, Scaea and her sisters were punished in afterlife, being forced to carry a jug to fill a bathtub (pithos) without a bottom (or with a leak) to wash their sins off. The water was always leaking that they would forever try to fill the tub.

In some accounts, Scaea remarried Archander while her sister Automate took as husband his brother [[Architeles]]. These two were sons of [[Achaeus (son of Xuthus)|Achaeus]], coming from [[Phthiotis]] to settle in [[Argos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].

A '''slave name''' is the [[personal name]] given by others to an [[slavery|enslaved]] person, or a name inherited from enslaved ancestors. The modern use of the term applies mostly to [[African Americans]] and [[Afro-Caribbean|West Indians]] who are descended from enslaved Africans who retain their name given to their ancestors by the enslavers.

Changing from a slave name to a name embodying an [[Africanization|African identity]] became common after [[emancipation]] in the 1960s by those in the [[African diaspora in the Americas]] seeking a reconnection to their African cultural roots.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Ancient Rome==
{{Slavery}}
In Rome slaves were given a single name by their owner. A slave who was [[manumission|freed]] might keep his or her slave name and adopt the former owner's name as a [[praenomen]] and [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]. As an example, one historian says that "a man named Publius Larcius freed a male slave named Nicia, who was then called Publius Larcius Nicia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/roman_names.html Roman Nomenclature at vroma.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Harold Whetstone Johnston]] writes of instances in which a slave's former owner chose to ignore custom and simply chose a name for the [[freedman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumromanum.org/life/johnston_2.html#60 Johnson, Harold Whetstone; Johnston, Mary; Names of Freedmen; 1903, 1932; forumromanum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==African Americans==

A number of African-Americans and [[Afro-Caribbeans]] have changed their names out of the belief that the names they were given at birth were slave names. An individual's name change often coincides with a religious conversion ([[Muhammad Ali]] changed his name from Cassius Clay, [[Malcolm X]] from Malcolm Little, and [[Louis Farrakhan]] changed his from Louis Eugene Walcott, for example)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Farrakhan Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/louis-farrakhan-9291850|work=Database|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muhammad Ali Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/muhammad-ali-9181165|work=Database|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or involvement with the [[black nationalist]] movement (e.g., [[Amiri Baraka]] and [[Assata Shakur]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Van Deburg|Deburg, William L. Van]], "Modern Black Nationalism: From Marcus Garvey to Louis Farrakhan",  NYU Press (1997), p 269, {{ISBN|0-8147-8789-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations encourage African-Americans to abandon their slave names. The [[Nation of Islam]] is perhaps the best-known of them. In his book, ''[[Message to the Blackman in America]]'', Nation of Islam leader [[Elijah Muhammad]] writes often of slave names. Some of his comments include:

* "''You must remember that slave-names will keep you a slave in the eyes of the civilized world today. You have seen, and recently, that Africa and Asia will not honor you or give you any respect as long as you are called by the white man's name.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seventhfam.com/temple/books/black_man/blk24.htm [[Muhammad, Elijah]]; ''Message to the Blackman''; Chapter 24; seventhfam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "''You are still called by your slave-masters' names. By rights, by international rights, you belong to the white man of America. He knows that. You have never gotten out of the shackles of slavery. You are still in them.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seventhfam.com/temple/books/black_man/blk34.htm Muhammad, Elijah; ''Message to the Blackman''; Chapter 34; seventhfam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] [[US Organization]] also advocates for African-Americans to change their slave names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us-organization.org/nguzosaba/NguzoSaba.html "NGUZO SABA (The Seven Principles)" From : US Organization website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10905">[[File:Holy Matrimony.JPG|thumb|A religious [[marriage]].]]

A '''spouse''' is a [[life partner]] in a [[marriage]], [[civil union]], or [[common-law marriage]]. The term is [[gender neutral]], whereas a male spouse is a [[husband]] and a female spouse is a [[wife]]. Although a spouse is a form of [[significant other]], the latter term also includes non-marital partners who play a social role similar to that of a spouse, but do not have rights and duties reserved by law to a spouse.

==Legal status==
{{Further information|Coverture|Marital power}}
The legal status of a spouse, and the specific rights and obligations associated with that status, vary significantly among the jurisdictions of the world. These regulations are usually described in [[family law]] statutes. However, in many parts of the world, where [[civil marriage]] is not that prevalent, there is instead customary marriage, which is usually regulated informally by the community. In many parts of the world, spousal rights and obligations are related to the payment of [[bride price]], [[dowry]] or [[dower]]. Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to male marital partners that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to female marital partners. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender.  Among the last European countries to establish full [[gender equality]] in marriage were Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;In 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450][http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html] The new reforms came into force in January 1988.''Women's movements of the world: an international directory and reference guide, edited by Sally Shreir'', p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;In 1983, legislation was passed guaranteeing equality between spouses, abolishing [[dowry]], and ending legal discrimination against illegitimate children [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#]''Demos, Vasilikie. (2007) “The Intersection of Gender, Class and Nationality and the Agency of Kytherian Greek Women.” Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association. August 11''.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;In 1981, Spain abolished the requirement that married women must have their husbands’ permission to initiate judicial proceedings {{cite web |url=http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824032832/http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and France &lt;ref&gt;Although married women in France obtained the right to work without their husbands' permission in 1965,[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf] and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children), it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children's property. [https://terapiadeparejaweb.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s. In various [[marriage laws]] around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority; for instance the Civil Code of [[Iran]] states at Article 1105: ''"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311161504/http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on jurisdiction, the refusal or inability of a spouse to perform the marital obligations may constitute a [[ground for divorce]], [[legal separation]] or [[annulment]]. The latter two options are more prevalent in countries where the dominant religion is [[Roman Catholicism]], some of which introduced divorce only recently (i.e. [[Italy]] in 1970, [[Portugal]] in 1975, [[Brazil]] in 1977,  [[Spain]] in 1981, [[Argentina]] in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-12/news/mn-3473_1_divorce-law|title=Divorce Is Now Legal in Argentina but, So Far, Few Couples Have Taken the Break|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paraguay]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin. American Dictatorships and Democracies'', by Mala Htun, pp 102&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colombia]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''note''': divorce between 1976-1991 was allowed for non-Catholics&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ireland]] in 1996, [[Chile]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Chile introduces right to divorce | date = November 18, 2004 | publisher = [[BBC]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4021427.stm | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malta]] in 2011). In recent years, many Western countries have adopted [[no fault divorce]]. In some parts of the world, the formal dissolution of a marriage is complicated by the payments and goods which have been exchanged between families (this is common where [[arranged marriage|marriages are arranged]]). This often makes it difficult to leave a marriage, especially for the woman: in some parts of Africa, once the bride price has been paid, the wife is seen as belonging to the husband and his family; and if she wants to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the girl's family. The girl's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf |title=Protecting the Girl Child: Using the Law to End Child, Early and Forced Marriage and Related Human Rights Violations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-05-29 |website=equalitynow.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}

Regardless of legislation, personal relations between spouses may also be influenced by local [[culture]] and [[religion]], which may promote male authority over the wife: for instance the word [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (ba`al), Hebrew for ''husband'', used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with ''owner'' and ''master''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/90607132/religion-and-sexism-images-of-woman-in-the-jewish|title=Religion and Sexism: Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimum age==
There is often a minimum legal [[marriageable age]]. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] stated the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/MarryingTooYoung.pdf |title=Marrying Too Young - End Child Marriage |author=United Nations Population Fund UNFPA |date=2012 |website=www.unfpa.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In 2010, 158 countries reported that 18 years was the minimum legal age for marriage for women without parental consent or approval by a pertinent authority. However, in 146 countries, state or customary law allows girls younger than 18 to marry with the consent of parents or other authorities; in 52 countries, girls under age 15 can marry with parental consent. In contrast, 18 is the legal age for marriage without consent among males in 180 countries. Additionally, in 105 countries, boys can marry with the consent of a parent or a pertinent authority, and in 23 countries, boys under age 15 can marry with parental consent."

Although in Western countries spouses sometimes [[Childfree|choose not to have children]], such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world.  In some cultures and religions, the quality of a spouse imposes an obligation to have children. In [[northern Ghana]], for example, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control are at risks of threats and coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women’s fears and men’s anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choosing a spouse==
There are many ways in which a spouse is chosen, which vary across the world, and include [[love marriage]], [[arranged marriage]], and [[forced marriage]]. The latter is in some jurisdictions a [[void marriage]] or a [[voidable marriage]]. Forcing someone to marry is also a criminal offense in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/part/10/enacted|title=Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Theosophy}}

'''St. Germain''' (also sometimes referred to as '''Master Rakoczi''' or '''Master R''') is a legendary spiritual master of the ancient wisdom in various [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] and post-Theosophical teachings, responsible for the [[New Age]] culture of the [[Age of Aquarius]] and identified with the '''[[Count of St. Germain]]''' (''[[floruit|fl.]]'' 1710–1784), who has been variously described as a [[courtier]], [[adventurer]], [[charlatan]], inventor, [[Alchemy|alchemist]], pianist, violinist and amateur composer.

==Legend==
Some write that his name St. Germain was invented by him as a French version of the Latin ''[[Sanctus Germanus]]'', meaning "Holy Brother".&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, pages 250 – 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, pages 254 – 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, pages 312 – 322&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ascended Master Teachings (but not in traditional Theosophy), the ''Master R'', or the ''Master Rakóczi'', is a separate and distinct being from St. Germain.

==Literature about St. Germain==

===Biographies===
There are several "authoritative" biographers who usually do not agree with one another. Probably the two best-known biographies are [[Isabel Cooper-Oakley]]'s ''The Count of St. Germain'' (1912) and [[Jean Overton-Fuller]]'s ''The Comte de Saint-Germain: Last Scion of the House of Rakoczy'' (1988). The former is a compilation of letters, diaries and private records written about the Count by members of the French aristocracy who knew him in the 18th century. Dr. Raymond Bernard's book ''The Great Secret – St. Germain'' is biographical and covers many aspects of the Count's life including his conflation with Sir [[Francis Bacon]] and the author of the [[Shakespeare]]an opus. [[Manly Palmer Hall]] in his ''[[Manly Palmer Hall#Works|The Secret Teachings of All Ages]]'', describes some of the same attributes as Dr. Bernard, including the attribution of the writings of Shakespeare to a great adept like Francis Bacon, who could be amalgamated with the Count of St. Germain.

There have also been numerous French and German biographies, among them ''Der Wiedergänger: Das zeitlose Leben des Grafen von Saint-Germain'' by [[Peter Krassa]], ''Le Comte de Saint-Germain'' by [[Marie-Raymonde Delorme]] and ''L'énigmatique Comte De Saint-Germain'' by [[Pierre Ceria]] and [[François Ethuin]].

===Occult biography===
A book titled ''The Great Secret, Count St. Germain'', by Dr. Raymond Bernard purports that St. Germain was actually [[Francis Bacon]] by birth, and later [[Baconian theory|authored the complete Plays attributed to Shakespeare]]. He also contends, as does the [[Saint Germain Foundation]] in Schaumburg, Illinois, that [[Francis Bacon]] was the child of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Lord Dudley]] but that it was kept quiet. According to the theory, Francis was raised by the Bacon family. Yet, throughout the [[Shakespeare]]an canon, there are numerous hints that the author knows of his true birth, as revealed in the explicit clues in the text of the plays themselves, in pictures, as well as the [[Bacon's cipher|cipher code that he employed]].

===Books claimed by Guy Ballard to have been dictated to him by Saint Germain===
Saint Germain is the central figure in the Saint Germain Series of Books published by the Saint Germain Press (the publishing arm of the Saint Germain Foundation). The first two volumes, ''Unveiled Mysteries'' and ''The Magic Presence'', written by [[Guy Ballard]] as "Godfré Ray King" describe Saint Germain as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]], like [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], who is assisting humanity. In these first two books, he discusses his personal experiences with Saint Germain and reveals many teachings that are in harmony with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and some other works referenced above. The third volume, ''The 'I AM' Discourses'', contains material that is foundational to the [[sacred scripture]]s of the "I AM" Religious Activity, founded in 1930, the first of the Ascended Master Teachings religions.

There are 20 Volumes in the Saint Germain Series of Books, which are also referred to as the "Green Books." Another work of great importance, the ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'', is said to be from the hand of Sir Francis Bacon before he Ascended and returned as Sanctus Germanus or Saint Germain. First printed in 1670, the book includes a picture of the Polish Rider, [[Rembrandt]]'s famous painting at the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City, which is said to be of Sir Francis Bacon, ''a.k.a.'' the [[Comte de Gabalis]], or the Count of the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]]. Lotus Ray King (Edna Ballard's pen name), wife of [[Guy Ballard]], talked about this book having been authored by the Ascended Master Saint Germain in the Round Table Talks of the "I AM" Religious Activity.

===Claimed encounters with Saint Germain===
Several [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and practitioners of alternate esoteric traditions have claimed to have met Saint Germain in the late 19th or early 20th centuries: 
* [[Annie Besant]] said that she met the Count in 1896.
* [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]] claimed to have met him in Rome in 1926 and gave a physical description of him as having [[brown eyes]], [[Olive skin|olive colored skin]], and a pointed beard; according to Leadbeater, "the splendour of his Presence impels men to make obeisance".&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 32&lt;/ref&gt; Leadbeater said that Saint Germain showed him a robe that had been previously owned by a [[Roman Emperor]] and that Saint Germain told him that one of his residences was a [[castle]] in [[Transylvania]]. According to Leadbeater, when performing [[Incantations|magical rituals]] in his castle in Transylvania, Saint Germain wears "a suit of golden chain-mail which once belonged to a [[Roman Emperor]]; over it is thrown a magnificent cloak of [[Tyrian purple]], with on its clasp a [[heptagram|seven-pointed star]] in diamond and [[amethyst]], and sometimes he wears a glorious robe of violet."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 240&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Guy Ballard]], founder of the [["I AM" Activity]], claimed that he met Saint Germain on [[Mount Shasta]] in California in August 1930, and that this initiated his "training" and experiences with other [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] in various parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Edgar Cayce]], the "Sleeping Prophet", was asked while in trance if Saint Germain was present. Cayce's reply was: "When needed." (From reading # 254–83 on 2/14/1935.)
* [[Dorothy Leon]], living author, has claimed to have had several encounters with Saint Germain and is an avowed disciple of his.
* [[Miroslav Zimmer]], living poet, claim to have met St Germain in the Mala Fatry mountains in 2011 in the company of a Sam Bennett.
* [[David Narozny]], living Czech music composer, claims to have met St Germain in Pruhonice 23.5.2014.
*[[Peter Mt. Shasta]], living spiritual teacher, claims that in 1973 St. Germain materialized before him in Muir Woods, Marin County, California, USA. He describes this meeting in ''Apprentice to the Masters: Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book II''. He also claims to have had many other physical as well as etheric meeting with him as well as other Masters.
*[[David Christopher Lewis]], living spiritual teacher, claims that Saint Germain first came to him in person on June 10, 2004 in his home in Paradise Valley, Montana and continued to come many times thereafter, dictating what is now in the book: Saint Germain on Advanced Alchemy: HeartStreaming in the Aquarian Age .&lt;ref&gt;"SAINT GERMAIN ON ADVANCED ALCHEMY" (Meru Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esoteric activities===
Many groups honor Saint Germain as a [[supernatural being]] called a Master of the Ancient Wisdom or an [[Ascended master]]. In the Ascended Master Teachings he is referred to simply as Saint Germain, or as the Ascended Master Saint Germain. As an Ascended Master, Saint Germain is believed to have many [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers such as the ability to teleport, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]], walk through walls, and to inspire people by [[telepathy]], among others.

The Theosophical Society after Blavatsky's death considered him to be a [[Mahatma]], Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or Adept. [[Helena Blavatsky]] said that he was one of her Masters of Wisdom and hinted that he had given her secret documents. Some [[esotericism|esoteric]] groups credit him with inspiring the [[Founding Fathers]] to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], as well as providing the design of the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. (See [[Hall, Manly P.|Manly Palmer Hall]]'s ''Secret Teachings of All Ages.'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Hall, Manly P.]] ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' "An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings Concealed within the Rituals, Allegories and Mysteries of all Ages" H.S. Crocker Company, Inc. 1928 See chapter on "St. Germain"&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Age]] beliefs, Saint Germain is always associated with the color violet, the jewel [[amethyst]], and the ''[[Maltese cross]]'' rendered in violet (usually the ''iron cross style cross patee'' version). He is also regarded as the "Chohan of the Seventh Ray"&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Germain" (claimed to have been dictated by St. Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse. See occult biographical (actually [[Hagiography|hagiographical]]) sketch of Saint Germain, pages 80–90 (The original edition of this book is printed in violet type on cream colored paper.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Theosophical Society]], the [[Seven Rays]] are seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls and the unfolding of each 2,158-year-long [[Astrological Age]]. Since according to Theosophy the next [[Astrological Age]], the [[Age of Aquarius]], will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called "The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius".  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is "The God of Freedom for [[Solar system|this system of worlds]]."  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the preliminary lead-up to the beginning of the Age of Aquarius began on 1 July 1956, when Ascended Master Saint Germain became the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, replacing the former [[Astrological age|Astrological Age]] Hierarch, the Ascended Master Jesus, who had been for almost 2,000 years the "Hierarch of the [[Age of Pisces]]".

In the works authored by Alice A. Bailey, Saint Germain is called ''Master Rakóczi'' or the ''Master R.''&lt;ref name=fire1237&gt;Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three – Division A – Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237&lt;/ref&gt;  (In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Rakoczi [ otherwise known as the Great Divine Director ] is regarded as Saint Germain's teacher in the Great White Brotherhood of Ascended Masters.) Alice A. Bailey's book ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' (a compilation of earlier revelations published posthumously in 1957) gives the most information about his reputed role as a Spiritual Master. Saint Germain's spiritual title is said to be ''Lord of Civilization,'' and his task is the establishment of the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) Page 667&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to telepathically influence people who are seen by him as being instrumental in bringing about the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius. Alice A. Bailey stated that "sometime after AD 2025," the Jesus, the Master Rakóczi (Saint Germain), Kuthumi, and others in the Spiritual Hierarchy would "externalise"&lt;!--British spelling of externalize--&gt;, i.e., descend from the spiritual worlds, and interact in visible tangible bodies on the Earth in [[ashram]]s, surrounded by their disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 530&lt;/ref&gt; Alice A. Bailey said that St. Germain is the "manager of the executive council of the Christ"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 508&lt;/ref&gt;(Theosophists regard "the Master Jesus" and "Christ" as two separate and distinct beings.  They believe in the [[Gnostic]] [[Christology]] espoused by [[Cerinthus]] (''fl.'' c. 100 AD), according to which "Christ" is a being who was incarnated in Jesus only during the three years of the [[ministry of Jesus]]). According to certain Theosophists, "Christ" is identified as being a highly developed spiritual entity whose actual name is Maitreya. This Maitreya is the same being known in Buddhism as the Bodhisattva Maitreya, who is in training to become the next Buddha on Earth. According to Alice A. Bailey, the "executive council of the Christ" is a specific subgroup of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, charged with preparing the way for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ and the consequent inauguration of the Age of Aquarius.

===Previous incarnations===
According to [[The Theosophical Society]] (not to be confused with the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]]) and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], Saint Germain was incarnated as: (see notes 1, 2, and 3 for sources): (Note: Not all Theosophical and Ascended Master Teaching groups accept all of these incarnations as valid. St. Germain's incarnations as St. Alban, Proclus, Roger Bacon and Sir Francis Bacon are universally accepted.)

* Ruler of a [[Root race#Early beginnings of the Aryan root race|Golden Age civilization centered in a city called "The City of the Sun"]] 70,000 years ago located in the then lush and verdant area that is now the [[Sahara Desert]], originally a colony sent out from [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]].
* High priest in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|the civilization of Atlantis]] 13,000 years ago, serving in the ''Order of Lord Zadkiel'' in the ''Temple of Purification'', located in an Atlantean colony that had been sent out from the main island of [[Atlantis]] that had been established on the island now called [[Cuba]].
* [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], 11th-century BC religious leader in Israel who served as prophet, priest, and last of the Hebrew judges.
* [[Hesiod]], Greek poet whose writings serve as a major source of insight into Greek mythology and cosmology (c. 700 BC).
* [[Plato]], Philosopher who studied with students of Pythagoras and scholars in Egypt. He established his own school of philosophy at the Academy in Athens. (427–347 BC).
* [[St. Joseph|Saint Joseph]], 1st century AD, Nazareth. Husband of Mary and guardian of Jesus.
* [[Saint Alban]], late 3rd or early 4th century, town of Verulamium, renamed St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England. First British martyr – he had sheltered a fugitive priest, became a devout convert, and was put to death for disguising himself as the priest so that he could die in his place.
* [[Proclus]], c. 410 – 485 AD. Athens. The last major Greek Neoplatonic philosopher. He headed the Platonic Academy and wrote extensively on philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and grammar.
* [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]], c. 5th or 6th century, Britain. Magician and counselor at King Arthur's Camelot who inspired the establishment of the Order of the Knights of the Round Table.
* [[Roger Bacon]], c. 1220–1292 AD, England. Philosopher, educational reformer, and experimental scientist. Forerunner of modern science renowned for his exhaustive investigations into alchemy, optics, mathematics, and languages.&lt;ref&gt;Although [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claims that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of Saint Germain and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] (the main Ascended Master Teachings religion) also accepts this, some sources and some Ascended Master Activities believe that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of the Ascended Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|El Morya]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organizer behind the scenes for the Secret Societies in Germany in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The creation of a possibly fictional character named "[[Christian Rosenkreuz]]" was inspired by his efforts.
* [[Christopher Columbus]], 1451–1506 AD. Believed to have been born in Genoa, Italy and settled in Portugal. Landed in America in 1492 during the first of four voyages to the New World sponsored by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of Spain
* [[Francis Bacon]], 1561–1626, England. Philosopher, statesman, essayist and literary master, [[Baconian theory|author of the Shakespearean plays]] (according to the [[Ascended Master Teachings]]), father of inductive science, and herald of the [[scientific revolution]].

===Ascension into masterhood===
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Francis Bacon made it appear that he died on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1626, and he even attended his own "funeral" in disguise.  It is believed by the adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that he then traveled secretly to [[Transylvania]] (then part of [[Hungary]], now part of [[Romania]]) to the Rakoczy Mansion of the [[Rakóczi|royal family of Hungary]]. Finally on 1 May 1684 he is believed to have attained (by his knowledge of [[alchemy]]) his physical Ascension (attaining [[immortality]] and eternal youth [ the sixth level of Initiation]) at which time Francis Bacon adopted the name "Saint Germain."&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Germain" (claimed by the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] to have been [[Channeling (mediumistic)|dictated]] by Saint Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse. See occult biologographical sketch of history of Saint Germain, pages 80–90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also see the article "Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements" by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' 5 October 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.

'''Stefano Colonna''' was the name of several members of the Italian family of [[Colonna family|Colonna]]. The most important include:

*'''Stefano Colonna the Elder''' (1265 &amp;ndash; c. 1348) was son of [[Giovanni Colonna (died 1293)|Giovanni Colonna]] and one of the most important political figures in Rome in the first half of the 14th century. He was heir of the [[Papal States|Papal]] fief of [[Palestrina]]. In 1290 he was named count of [[Romagna]], and he was several times Senator of [[History of Rome#Medieval Rome|Rome]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] vicar in [[Italy]]. A staunch [[Ghibelline]], he struggled for large part of his life against the Guelph [[Orsini]] family. He was a protector of [[Petrarch]], who dedicated two sonnets and other works to him. He was also a fierce opponent of [[Cola di Rienzo]], leader of the popular rebellion of Rome in 1347. He was brother to [[Sciarra Colonna]].
*'''Stefano Colonna the Younger''' (died 1347), son of the former, was Senator of Rome in 1306 and 1330. He was killed (together with his sons Giovanni and Camillo) at the [[battle of Porta San Lorenzo]] (1347) against the troops of Cola di Rienzo.
*'''Stefanello''' (died c. 1368), son of the former, was the first of the Palestrina branch of the family.
*'''Stefano Colonna di [[Palestrina]]''' (16th century). Commander of the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] militia during the siege of Florence.&lt;ref name=af&gt;{{cite web|title=L'assedio di Firenze:cronologia|url=http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/aa1528a.htm|website=cronologia.leonardo.it|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Five''', also known as the '''Mighty Handful''' and the '''New Russian School''', were five prominent 19th-century Russian [[composers]] who worked together to create distinct [[Russian classical music]]. [[Mily Balakirev]] (the leader), [[César Cui]], [[Modest Mussorgsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Borodin]] all lived in [[Saint Petersburg]], and collaborated from 1856 to 1870.

[[Image:Vladimir Stasov.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Stasov]] &lt;br&gt; (1824&amp;ndash;1906)]]
In May 1867 the critic [[Vladimir Stasov]] wrote an article, titled ''Mr. Balakirev's Slavic Concert'', covering a concert that had been performed for visiting Slav delegations at the "All-Russian Ethnographical Exhibition" in Moscow. The four Russian composers whose works were played at the concert were [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], [[Mily Balakirev]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Gerald, ''Essays on Russian and East European Music: Vladimir Stasov, Man and Critic'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985, pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The article ended with the following statement:

{{quote|God grant that our Slav guests may never forget today's concert; God grant that they may forever preserve the memory of how much poetry, feeling, talent, and intelligence are possessed by the small but already mighty handful of Russian musicians.&lt;ref name="Calvocoressi, M.D. 1946, pg. 178"&gt;Calvocoressi, M.D., Abraham, G., ''Master Musicians Series: Mussorgsky'', London: J.M.Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1946, pg. 178&lt;/ref&gt;|Vladimir Stasov|''[[Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti]], 1867''}}

The expression "mighty handful" ({{lang-ru|Могучая кучка}}, ''Moguchaya kuchka'', "Mighty Bunch") was mocked by enemies of Balakirev and Stasov: [[Alexander Serov|Aleksandr Serov]], academic circles of the conservatory, the Russian Musical Society, and their press supporters. The group ignored critics and continued operating under the moniker.&lt;ref name="Calvocoressi, M.D. 1946, pg. 178"/&gt; This loose collection of composers gathered around Balakirev now included Cui, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Borodin &amp;mdash; the five who have come to be associated with the name "Mighty Handful", or sometimes "The Five". [[Gerald Abraham]] stated flatly in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' that "they never called themselves, nor were they ever called in Russia, 'The Five'"&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Gerald, ''The New Grove: Russian Masters 1: Balakirev'', New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1986, pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt; (although today the Russian equivalent "Пятёрка" ("Pyatyorka") is occasionally used to refer to this group).&lt;ref&gt;''Krugosvet'', "[http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/muzyka/BALAKIREV_MILI_ALEKSEEVICH.html Balakirev Mily Alekseevich]".&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Rimsky-Korsakov routinely refers to the group as "Balakirev's circle", and occasionally uses "The Mighty Handful", usually with an ironic tone. He also makes the following reference to "The Five":

{{quote|If we leave out of account [[Nikolai Lodyzhensky|Lodyzhensky]], who accomplished nothing, and [[Anatoly Lyadov|Lyadov]], who appeared later, Balakirev's circle consisted of Balakirev, Cui, Mussorgsky, Borodin, and me (the French have retained the denomination of "''Les Cinq''" for us to this day).&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, N., ''Chronicle of My Musical Life'', New York: Knopf, 1923, pg. 286&lt;/ref&gt;|Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov|''Chronicle of My Musical Life'', 1909}}

The Russian word ''kuchka'' also spawned the terms "kuchkism" and "kuchkist", which may be applied to artistic aims or works in tune with the sensibilities of the Mighty Handful.

The name of [[Les Six]], an even looser collection of French-speaking composers, emulates that of "The Five".

===Formation===
The formation of the group began in 1856, with the first meeting of Balakirev and [[César Cui]]. [[Modest Mussorgsky]] joined them in 1857, [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] in 1861, and [[Alexander Borodin]] in 1862. All the composers in The Five were young men in 1862. Balakirev was 25, Cui 27, Mussorgsky 23, Borodin the eldest at 28, and Rimsky-Korsakov just 18. They were all self-trained amateurs. Borodin combined composing with a career in [[chemistry]]. Rimsky-Korsakov was a [[Imperial Russian Navy|naval officer]] (he wrote his First Symphony on a three-year naval voyage circumnavigating the globe). Mussorgsky had been in the prestigious [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]] of the Imperial Guard, and then in the civil service before taking up music; even at the height of his career in the 1870s he was forced by the expense of his drinking habit to hold down a full-time job in the State Forestry Department.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, Orlando, ''Natasha's Dance: A Cultural History of Russia'' (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2002), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the élite status and court connections of Conservatory composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], The Five were mainly from the minor gentry of the provinces. To some degree their ''[[esprit de corps]]'' depended on the myth, which they themselves created, of a movement that was more "authentically Russian," in the sense that it was closer to the native soil, than the classic academy.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 179. Also see R. Tarushkin, ''Defining Russia Musically'', xiii ff, per Figes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before them, [[Mikhail Glinka]] and [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]] had gone some way towards producing a distinctly Russian kind of music, writing operas on Russian subjects, but the Mighty Handful represented the first concentrated attempt to develop such a music, with Stasov as their artistic adviser and Dargomyzhsky as an elder statesman to the group, so to speak. The circle began to fall apart during the 1870s, no doubt partially due to the fact that Balakirev withdrew from musical life early in the decade for a period of time. All of "The Five" are buried in [[Tikhvin Cemetery]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

==Musical language==

===Stylization===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
The musical language The Five developed set them far apart from the Conservatoire. This self-conscious Russian styling was based on two elements:

*They tried to incorporate in their music what they heard in village songs, in [[Cossack]] and [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] dances, in church chants and the tolling of church bells (to the point where the bell tolling became a cliché). The Five's music became filled with imitative sounds of Russian life. They also tried to reproduce the long-drawn, lyrical and [[melisma]]tic peasant song, what Glinka had once called "the soul of Russian music."  Balakirev made this possible by his study of songs from the Volga in the 1860s. More than any previous anthology, his transcriptions artfully preserved the distinctive aspects of Russian folk music:
**Tonal mutability
*:A tune seems to shift naturally from one [[tonal center]] to another, often ending up in a different key than the one in which the song began. This can produce a feeling of elusiveness, a lack of definition or of logical progression in the harmony. Even when stylized by The Five, this quality can make Russian music sound very different from the tonal structures of the West.
**[[Heterophony]]
*:A melody is simultaneously rendered by two or more performers in different variations. This is improvised by the singers until the end, when the song reverts to a single melodic line.
**[[consecutive fifth|Parallel fifth]]s, fourths and thirds
*:The effect lends Russian music a raw sonority missing entirely from the comparatively polished harmonies of Western music.
*The Five also adopted a series of harmonic devices to create a distinct "Russian" style and color different from Western music. This "exotic" styling of "Russia" was not just self-conscious but entirely invented. None of these devices was actually used in Russian folk or church music:
**[[Whole tone scale]]
*:Although Glinka did not invent this scale, his application of it in the opera ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' (1842) &amp;mdash; most recognizable at the end of the festive overture &amp;mdash; provided a characteristic harmonic and melodic device. This scale in "Russian" works often suggests evil or ominous personages or situations. It was used by all the major composers from Tchaikovsky (the appearance of the Countess's ghost in ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'') to Rimsky-Korsakov (in all his magic-story operas—''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'', ''[[Kashchey the Deathless]]'' and ''[[The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya|The Invisible City of Kitezh]]''). [[Claude Debussy]] also uses this scale in his music, taking this, among many things, from the Russians. Later it became a standard device in horror-movie scores.
**The [[Russian submediant]]&lt;ref&gt;DeVoto, Mark. "The Russian Submediant in the Nineteenth Century," Current Musicology, no. 59 (October 1995), pp. 48&amp;ndash;76.&lt;/ref&gt;
*:Also linked to Glinka's  ''Ruslan'', this is a harmonic pattern (in  major mode) in which one upper part proceeds from the dominant pitch chromatically to the submediant while the other harmony parts remain constant. The most basic form of this pattern can be shown as follows (beginning with typical tonic):  root-position tonic triad → root-position augmented tonic triad → 1st inversion submediant minor triad. A famous example of the Russian submediant occurs in the very opening bars of the third movement of Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherezade]]''.
**[[Octatonic scale|Diminished or octatonic scale]]
*:Rimsky-Korsakov first used this in his symphonic poem ''Sadko'' in 1867. This scale became a sort of Russian calling-card &amp;mdash; a ''[[leitmotif]]'' of magic and menace used not just by Rimsky-Korsakov but all of his followers, above all [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] (mode 2).
**Modular rotation in sequences of thirds
*:The Five made this device of [[Franz Liszt]] their own to base a loose [[symphonic poem|symphonic-poem]] type of structure. This way, they could avoid the rigid Western laws of modulation in [[sonata form]], allowing the form of a musical composition to be shaped entirely by the "content" of the music (its programmatic statements and visual descriptions) rather than by formal laws of symmetry. This loose structure became especially important for Mussorgsky's ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', a work that may have done more than any other to define the Russian style.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 180&amp;ndash;181.&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Pentatonic scale]]
*:This stylistic aspect became used by every Russian nationalist composer.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Its distinctive feature is to have only five notes in the octave, rather than the seven of the [[heptatonic scale]]s (e.g., [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]]). The pentatonic scale is one of the ways of suggesting a "primitive" folk-melodic style as well as the "Eastern" element (Middle East, Asia). A melodic example of the "major-mode" pentatonic scale (C-D-E-G-A) can be heard at the entrance of the chorus at the beginning of Borodin's ''[[Prince Igor]]''.

===Orientalism===
One hallmark of "The Five" was its reliance on [[orientalism]].&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Many quintessentially "Russian" works were composed in orientalist style, such as Balakirev's ''[[Islamey]]'', Borodin's ''[[Prince Igor]]'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]''.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Orientalism, in fact, became widely considered in the West both one of the best-known aspects of Russian music and a trait of Russian national character.&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; As leader of "The Five," Balakirev encouraged the use of eastern themes and harmonies to set their "Russian" music apart from the German symphonism of [[Anton Rubinstein]] and other Western-oriented composers.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Rimsky-Korsakov used Russian folk and oriental melodies in his [[Symphony No. 1 (Rimsky-Korsakov)|First Symphony]], Stasov and the other nationalists dubbed it the "First Russian Symphony," even though Rubinstein had written his ''Ocean'' Symphony a dozen years before it.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; These were themes Balakirev had transcribed in the Caucasus.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; "The symphony is good," Cui wrote to Rimsky-Korsakov in 1863, while the latter was out on naval deployment. "We played it a few days ago at Balakirev's—to the great pleasure of Stassov. It is really Russian. Only a Russian could have composed it, because it lacks the slightest trace of any stagnant Germanness."&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, A.N., ''N.A. Rimskii-Korsakov: zhizn' i tvorchestvo'', vyp. 2 (Moscow, 1935), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orientalism was not confined to using authentic Eastern melodies.&lt;ref name="maes82"&gt;Maes, Francis, tr. Pomerans, Arnold J. and Erica Pomerans, ''A History of Russian Music: From ''Kamarinskaya ''to'' Babi Yar (Berkeley, Los Angeles and London: University of California Press, 2002), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; What became more important than the melodies themselves were the musical conventions added to them.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; These conventions allowed orientalism to become an avenue for writing music on subjects considered unmentionable otherwise, such as political themes and erotic fantasies.&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; It also became a means of expressing Russian supremacy as the empire expanded under [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; This was often reinforced through [[Misogyny|misogynist]] symbolism—the rational, active and moral Western man versus the irrational, passive and immoral Eastern woman.&lt;ref name="maes80"/&gt;

Two major works entirely dominated by orientalism are Rimsky-Korsakov's symphonic suite ''[[Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Antar]]'' and Balakirev's symphonic poem ''Tamara''.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; ''Antar'', set in Arabia, uses two different styles of music, Western (Russian) and Eastern (Arabian).&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The first theme, Antar's, is masculine and Russian in character.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The second theme, feminine and oriental in melodic contour, belongs to the queen, Gul Nazar.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; Rimsky-Korsakov was able to soften the implicit misogyny to some extent.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; However, female sensuality does exert a paralyzing, ultimately destructive influence.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; With Gul Nazar extinguishing Antar's life in a final embrace, the woman overcomes the man.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt;

Balakirev gives a more overtly misogynistic view of oriental women in ''Tamara''.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; He had originally planned to write a Caucasan dance called a ''lezginka'', modeled on Glinka, for this work.&lt;ref name="maes83"/&gt; However, he discovered a poem by [[Mikhail Lermontov]] about the beautiful Tamara, who lived in a tower alongside the gorge of Daryal.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; She lured travelers and allowed them to enjoy a night of sensual delights, only to kill them and throw their bodies into the River Terek.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Balakirev uses two specific codes endemic to orientalism in writing ''Tamara''. The first code, based on obsessive rhythms, note repetitions, climactic effects and accelerated tempi, represents Dionysian intoxication.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The second code, consisting of unpredictable rhythms, irregular phrasing and based on long passages with many repeat notes, augmented and diminished [[interval (music)|intervals]] and extended [[melisma]]s, depict sensual longing.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; Not only did Balakirev use these codes extensively, but he also attempted to supercharge them further when he revised the orchestration of ''Tamara'' in 1898.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct result of such orientalism was the big influence that this circle left on the formation of classical traditions in other nations of the east and south of Russia. For instance, one of Rimsky-Korsakov's famous students, [[Alexander Spendiaryan]] went on to become the founder of Armenian classical music, carrying on the traditions and aesthetics of the Mighty Handful to the Caucasus.

==Quotations==
[[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] provides the following picture of "The Mighty Handful" in his memoirs, ''Chronicle of My Musical Life'' (translated by J. A. Joffe):

===Tastes===
{{quote|"The tastes of the circle leaned towards Glinka, Schumann, and Beethoven's last quartets ... they had little respect for Mendelssohn ... Mozart and Haydn were considered out of date and naive ... J. S. Bach was held to be petrified ... Chopin was likened by Balakirev to a nervous society lady ... Berlioz was highly esteemed ...Liszt was comparatively unknown ... Little was said of Wagner ... They respected Dargomyzhsky for the recitative portions of ''Rusalka'' ... [but] he was not credited with any considerable talent and was treated with a shade of derision. ...Rubinstein had a reputation as a pianist, but was thought to have neither talent nor taste as a composer."}}

===Balakirev===
{{quote|"Balakirev, who had never had any systematic course in harmony and counterpoint and had not even superficially applied himself to them, evidently thought such studies quite unnecessary ... An excellent pianist, a superior sight reader of music, a splendid improviser, endowed by nature with the sense of correct harmony and part-writing, he possessed a technique partly native and partly acquired through a vast musical erudition, with the help of an extraordinary memory, keen and retentive, which means so much in steering a critical course in musical literature ... He instantly felt every technical imperfection or error, he grasped a defect in form at once. Whenever I or other young men, later on, played him our essays at composition, he instantly caught all the defects of form, modulation, and so on, and forthwith seating himself at the piano, he would improvise and show how the composition in question should be changed exactly as he indicated, and frequently entire passages in other people's compositions became his and not their putative authors' at all. He was obeyed absolutely, for the spell of his personality was tremendous. ... His influence over those around him was boundless, and resembled some magnetic or mesmeric force. ... he despotically demanded that the tastes of his pupils should exactly coincide with his own. The slightest deviation from his taste was severely censured by him. By means of raillery, a parody or caricature played by him, whatever did not suit him at the moment was belittled — and the pupil blushed with shame for his expressed opinion and recanted...."}}

===Abilities===
{{quote|"Balakirev considered me a symphony specialist ... in the sixties, Balakirev and Cui, though very intimate with Mussorgsky and sincerely fond of him, treated him like a lesser light, and of little promise at that, in spite of his undoubted talent. It seemed to them that there was something missing in him and, in their eyes, he was in need of advice and criticism. Balakirev often said that Mussorgsky had 'no head' or that his 'brains were weak.' ... Balakirev thought that Cui understood little in symphony and musical forms and nothing in orchestration, but was a past master in vocal and operatic music; Cui, in turn, thought Balakirev a master in symphony, form, and orchestration, but with little liking for operatic composition and vocal music in general. Thus they complemented each other, but each, in his own way, felt mature and grown up. Borodin, Mussorgsky, and I, however &amp;mdash; we were immature and juvenile. Obviously, towards Balakirev and Cui we were in somewhat subordinate relations; their opinions were listened to unconditionally...."}}

==Influence==
Except perhaps for Cui, the members of this group influenced or taught many of the great Russian composers who were to follow, including [[Alexander Glazunov]], [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. They also influenced the two French symbolist composers [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Claude Debussy]] through their radical tonal language.

==The Cavite Conspiracy==
Shortly before the [[Katipunan]] was uncovered, [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] was planning to attack the Spanish arsenal at [[Fort San Felipe (Cavite)|Fort San Felipe]] and he enlisted other Katipuneros to recruit enough men so they could overrun the Spanish garrison. Their meetings were held at the house of Cabuco.

Aguinaldo and the other Katipuneros agreed that they would arm the inmates of the provincial jail who were made to work at the garrison. The task of recruiting the inmates was given to Lapidario, who was also the warden of the provincial jail. Aguado was to supply Lapidario with money to buy arms.

According to their plan, the uprising would be signalled by fireworks from the warehouse of Inocencio. Other leaders of the uprising were Luciano, Conchu, Pérez, Pablo José, Marcos José, and Juan Castañeda.  The revolt was to start on September 1.

On August 26, Aguinaldo received a letter from [[Andrés Bonifacio]] who reported that a Katipunan assembly in Balintawak on August 24 decided to start the revolution on August 30, to be signalled by a blackout at the Luneta, then known as Bagumbayan. On the appointed day, Bonifacio and his men attacked the Spanish powder magazine in San Juan. Later that same day, the Spanish authorities declared martial law in [[Manila]] and the provinces of [[Cavite]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Batangas]], [[Bulacan]], [[Pampanga]], [[Tarlac]] and [[Nueva Ecija]].

Aguinaldo learned of the declaration of martial law in a meeting with Spanish Governor Fernando Pargas on the morning of August 31, 1896. He then went to Cabezas' haberdashery and ask him to inform to Lapidario that they had alternative but to rise in arms. Cabezas was the one who enlisted Lapidario for the planned uprising.

But Cabezas was not in favor of starting the revolt on August 31, 1896 so they discussed the uprising further. They decided to postpone the attack to September 3. However, the Spanish learned of the plan from a dressmaker named Victoriana Sayat and they immediately arrested Lapidario, de Ocampo and Aguado. The three were held incommunicado in the boat ''Ulloa'' and interrogated. They are presumed to have been tortured.

[[File:Trece Martires Monument.jpg|thumb|280px|The Thirteen Martyrs Monument in San Roque]]
De Ocampo revealed the names of his companions and the thirteen suspects were rounded up on September 3 along with dozens of other Cavite leaders, including the musician [[Julián Felipe]], who would compose the Philippine national anthem the following year. Felipe was incarcerated for nine months at Fort San Felipe. Also subsequently released were Pablo and Marcos José, and Juan Castañeda of Imus, who are also believed to have been involved in the uprising.

While awaiting trial, guilt-stricken de Ocampo tried to commit suicide by slashing his stomach with a piece of broken glass. However, he was included in the indictment for treason before a military court which found them guilty on September 11 after a four-hour trial.

At 12:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. the following day, the thirteen patriots were brought out of their cells and taken to the Plaza de Armas, outside Fort San Felipe, and executed by musketry. Their bodies were later buried in a common grave at the Catholic cemetery at the village of Caridad.

Later, the bodies of seven of the martyrs—Máximo Inocencio, Victorino Luciano, Francisco Osorio, Luis Aguado, Hugo Pérez, José Lallana, and Antonio San Agustín—were exhumed and reburied elsewhere. But the rest—Agapito Conchu, Máximo Gregorio, Alfonso de Ocampo, Eugenio Cabezas, Feliciano Cabuco, and Severino Lapidario remained unclaimed in their common grave.

In 1906, a monument to the Thirteen Martyrs was erected at the San Roque district of Cavite City, at the head of then San Roque causeway. Their families reinterred the remains of their loved ones at the foot of the monument.  The monument is located at the intersection of M. Valentin St., Lopez Jaena Rd, Zulueta Rd and the P. Burgos Ave.

== Legacy ==
In 1954, the capital of Cavite was transferred to a newly created city situated near the center of the province, and it was named ''[[Trece Mártires]]'' in their honor. Each of its 13 [[barangay]]s were named for each of the martyrs. On May 24, 2004, a new monument of the thirteen patriots were inaugurated in Trece Martires near the City Hall.

The '''Council of Twelve Men''' was a group of 12 men, chosen on 29 August 1641 by the residents of [[New Netherland]] to advise the [[Director-General of New Netherland|Director of New Netherland]], [[Willem Kieft]], on relations with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] due to the murder of Claes Swits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs  |first=Jaap  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Netherland: A Dutch Colony In Seventeenth-Century America |year=2005  |publisher= |quote=Both in the way it was set up and in the extent of its rights, the council of Twelve Men, as did the two later advisory bodies ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uex2budtSOUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA136&amp;dq |isbn=90-04-12906-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the council was not permanent, it was the first representational form of democracy in the Dutch colony.

==Three Questions==
#Whatever it is not just to punish the barbarous murder of Claes Swits committed by an Indian and, in case the Indians refuse to surrender the murderer at our request, whether it is not justifiable to ruin the entire village to which he belongs?
#In what manner the same ought be put into effect and at what time?
#By whom it may be undertaken?

==War==
They did not counsel war, as desired by [[Willem Kieft]]. They proposed a friendly request to be sent to the Indians to surrender the murderer. Displeased  with the reply of the council of twelve, he disassembled the council on February 8, 1643.Kieft then ordered the [[Dutch West India Company]] soldiers to attack nearby Indian encampments at [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]] and [[Cherry Street (Manhattan)|Corlears Hook]]. Escalating attacks and retaliations by the Indians and the Dutch West India Company soldiers during the next two years became known as [[Kieft's War]] and led to a near devastation of the [[New Netherland]] settlements on [[Staten Island]], [[Long Island]], and at [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]]. [[Rensselaerswyck]], a [[patroonship]], outside the territory of the [[Lenape]] was unscathed, and profited from the conflict.

The '''widowhood effect''' is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time  after their long-time [[spouse]] has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called "dying of a [[broken heart]]". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas &amp; Kuttichira, 2013).

Psychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement.  The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing.  Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically.  During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising.  Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide.  Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, P. J., Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011). Does Widowhood Increase Mortality Risk? Epidemiology, 22(1), 1-5. doi:10.1097/ede.0b013e3181fdcc0b&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}}It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-widowhood-effect-idUSBRE9AD0VU20131114|title='Widowhood effect' strongest during first three months|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jegtvig, 2013).

Although there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=J.

==Gender differences==

Both men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women.  Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136854 Widowhood and Depression: Explaining Long-Term Gender Differences in Vulnerability.] ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior.'' (1992). Retrieved on 2016-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 [[National Survey of Families and Households]]. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies]]— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 18, 2016 |title=Is Broken Heart Syndrome Difficult? |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Is-Broken-Heart-Syndrome-Difficult_UCM_448547_Article.jsp |location=Dallas |publisher=American Heart Association |access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lee|DeMaris|Bavin|Sullivan|2001}}

Experimenters involved in the study regarding: ''The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes'', took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).

In a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).

Nicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.

&lt;ref&gt;In conclusion to this, other research that has been conducted has gathered similar statistics regarding widowhood effect between genders. A comparable study taken place in the U.S found that “The death of a husband is associated with a greater rate in all-cause mortality for women, and the death of a wife is associated with a lesser rate in all-cause mortality for men, after adjusting for covariates (Elwert, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects of widowhood==
The death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, &amp; Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, &amp; Sullivan, 2001).

==Takotsubo and the widowhood effect==

Recently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the [[broken heart syndrome]] (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016.)

==Effects of widowhood on social life==

Elderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}} It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.

==Urban, rural and race variations==

A study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.

In a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2008).

The widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).

==Possible causes==

It was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased [[mortality rate]] of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.{{sfn|Boyle|Feng|Raab|2011}}

In April 2016, the [[American Heart Association]] published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as "broken heart syndrome". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"/&gt;


== Widowhood Effect Solution == 
	Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. 


== Coping Mechanisms ==
There is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13788">The '''Witches of Warboys''' were Alice Samuel and her family, who were accused of, and executed for [[witchcraft]] between 1589 and 1593 in the village of [[Warboys]], in the [[fens]] of England.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..."&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Strange and Admirable Discouerie of the Three Witches of Warboys Arraigned, Conuicted, and Executed at the Last Assises at Huntington, for the Bewitching of the Fiue Daughters of Robert Throckmorton Esquire, and Other Persons (1593), Reprint|year=2010|publisher=BiblioBazaar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of many [[witch trials in the early modern period]], but scholar Barbara Rosen claims it "attracted probably more notice than any other in the sixteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen |first=Barbara |title=Witchcraft in England 1558–1618 |location=Amherst |publisher=University  of Massachusetts |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The trials of the witches occurred during the sixteenth century at [[Warboys]] in Huntingdonshire. The first allegations were made in November 1589 by Jane Throckmorton, the 10-year-old daughter of Robert Throckmorton the [[Squire]] of Warboys when she started suffering from fits (see Initial Allegations below). She accused the 76-year-old Alice Samuel of being the cause; this was echoed by Jane’s four sisters and some household servants who began exhibiting similar symptoms. When Alice Samuel was brought forward to the children, they became more ill and had the urge to scratch her.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

Robert Throckmorton was a close friend of [[Henry Williams (alias Cromwell)|Sir Henry Cromwell]], one of the wealthiest commoners in England and the grandfather of [[Oliver Cromwell]].  In March 1590, Lady Cromwell came to Warboys to visit. At the Throckmorton house, she interviewed Alice Samuel and what came after the interview served to confirm the suspicions the Throckmortons had. Lady Cromwell was tormented by Alice Samuel in her dreams, and after some time she became ill and died (buried 1592). This was enough proof to put Alice Samuel through a trial that would find her and the rest of her family guilty.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

==Initial allegations==

===Throckmorton family===
The first allegations declaring Alice as a practitioner of witchcraft were made in November 1589.  Following this, there were a total of twelve maid-servants of the Throckmorton household (in addition to the five daughters) who experienced fits and the torment of Alice Samuell’s witchcraft. Jane’s fits were described as such: "Sometimes she would neese [sneeze] very loud and thick for the space of half an hour together; and evidently as one in a great trance and sound lay quietly as long, soon after would begin to swell and heave up her belly so as none was able to bend her or keep her down, sometime thee would shake one leg and no other part of her, as if the palsie had been in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of her arms and then the other, and soon after her head, as if she had been infected with the running palsie".&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discouerie of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane's mother and grandmother were by the child’s side while other neighbors came to see her. When Alice Samuel came in, the child proclaimed: "Grandmother look where the old witch sitteth (pointing to Samuell) did you ever see one more like a witch than she is: Take off her black thrumbed [shaggy or fringed] cap, for I cannot abide to look on her". Jane's mother  thought nothing of this at first, thinking her child was sleep deprived and sick.  However, because Jane continued to get worse, her parents sent her urine to Doctor Barrow of Cambridge, who sent medicine to Jane three separate times thinking it would heal her.  It did not.  After the third time, the Doctor inquired whether there were any signs of sorcery or witchcraft involved that the parents could see. Jane’s urine was then sent to a family acquaintance, Master Butler, for examination and he sent back the same remedies that Doctor Barrow had sent. Exactly a month later, on the same day almost to the hour, two more of Master Throckmorton’s daughters fell sick to the same illness  that was afflicting Jane.&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"/&gt;

These daughters, two to three years older than Jane, cried out: "Take her away, look where she standeth here before us in a black thrumbed cap it is she that hath bewitched us and she will kill us if you do not take her away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discovery of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents were then worried, but could not understand why any such harm would come to them, for they had only moved into the town the "Michaelmas before" (September 29, 1588).{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}} Their youngest daughter, nine years old, fell sick less than a month later. Soon after this, the oldest daughter, fifteen years old, fell sick. She was sickest out of the five. Both cried out against Alice Samuell. Their eldest sister, having been the strongest, strived with the spirit, and was grievously tortured not being able to overcome it. This caused her to "(neefe), screech and groan very fearfully, sometimes it would heave up her belly and bounce up her body with such violence that she was not kept upon her bed".{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}}   When sitting in a chair, her fits often caused her to break that chair.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The daughters could not see, hear or feel while in these fits. They accused Mother Samuell, asking for her to be taken away. These fits would sometimes last for half a day and happened up to six or seven times a day.  They believed that God freed them of this [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and afterwards, the sisters remembered nothing of what they had been saying.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

===Lady Cromwell===
In March 1590, Lady Cromwell and Alice had a discussion regarding the accusations made against Alice.  During this conversation, Lady Cromwell reportedly grabbed a pair of [[scissors]] and cut a lock of hair off Alice, and gave it to Mrs. Throckmorton to burn (a [[folk tradition|folk]] remedy believed to weaken a witch's power). That night, Lady Cromwell had nightmares, became ill and later died in 1592.&lt;ref name="Luke Matin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matin |first1=Luke |title=The Witch Trials – Witches of Warboys Witch Trials |url=http://www.witchcraftandwitches.com/trials_warboys.html|publisher=Luke Matin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Following the death of Lady Cromwell, a local parson convinced Alice to admit to witchcraft, which she retracted the very next day.  However, she confessed again when she was brought before the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], and taken to [[Huntingdon]] where she was imprisoned with her daughter and husband.  The family was tried in April 1593 for the murder by witchcraft of Lady Cromwell. Alice’s words to Lady Cromwell ("Madam, why do you use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet") were used against her at the trial, and all three were found guilty and eventually hanged.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luke Matin" /&gt;

==Posthumous proof==
The jailer and his wife examined the corpses.
{{quote|[H]e found upon the body of the old woman Alice Samuel a little lump of flesh, in manner sticking out as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an inch; which both he and his wife perceiving, at the first sight thereof meant not to disclose because it was adjoining so secret a place which was not decent to be seen. Yet in the end, not willing to conceal so strange a matter, and decently covering that privy place a little above which it grew, they made open show thereof unto diverse that stood by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations |first=Diane |last=Purkiss |publisher=Routledge |year=2013|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Jim Kermode argues that the discovery of a [[witches' mark]] (also known as a "devil's mark") was important legal proof at this period in England. "[I]t gradually became accepted that the mark, with women, most commonly took the form of a teat-like growth in the pudenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kermode |first=J.I. |last2=Walker |first2=Garthine |title=Women, crime and the courts in early modern England |date=1994 |publisher=UCL Press |location=London |isbn=1857281403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tale of the jailer's postmortem examination has been widely quoted in modern scholarship, for example with reference to the animal/human divide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Creager |editor-first=Angela N.H. |last=Jordan|first=William Chester |title=The animal-human boundary: historical perspectives |date=2002 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location=Rochester, N.Y |isbn=9781580461207 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "sado-erotic fascination of the witches' teat",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Words like daggers: violent female speech in early modern England |date=2015 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=[S.l.] |isbn=978-0-8032-5488-6 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly in [[feminist interpretations of the Early Modern witch trials]]. It is also cited by writers such as [[Lynn Picknett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Picknett |first1=Lynn |title=The secret history of Lucifer: the ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci code |date=2005 |publisher=Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1845292638 |edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The scholar [[George Lyman Kittredge|George Kittredge]] (1860–1941) called the Warboys trial "the most momentous witch-trial that had ever occurred in England", partially because it had "demonstrably produced a deep and lasting impression on the class that made laws". He makes a case that the Warboys trial influenced the passage of the [[Witchcraft Acts#Witchcraft Act 1604|Witchcraft Act of 1604]].

Following the hangings, Robert Throckmorton left Warboys hastily, his wife allegedly dying shortly before his departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeWindt |first=Anne |title=Witchcraft and Conflicting Visions of the Ideal Village Community |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=34 |year=1995 |pages=427–463}} JSTOR.
