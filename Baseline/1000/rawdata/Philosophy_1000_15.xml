'''''{{lang|la|Ad nauseam}}''''' is a [[Latin]] term for argument or other discussion that has continued 'to [the point of] nausea'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Amo, Amas, Amat and More| first=Eugene| last=Ehrlich| year=1985| page=25| publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ad%20nauseam "ad nauseam" definitions from Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sentence "This topic has been discussed ''{{lang|la|ad nauseam}}''" signifies that the topic in question has been discussed extensively, and that those involved in the discussion have grown tired of it.  The fallacy is also called '''''{{lang|la|argumentum [[ad infinitum]]}}''''' ('to infinity'), and '''argument from repetition'''.&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ad nauseam|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=ad%20nauseam|publisher=[[American Heritage Dictionary]]|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==

The term (in all three variants) is defined by the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' as "an argument made repeatedly (possibly by different people) until nobody cares to discuss it any more. This may sometimes, but not always, be a form of [[proof by assertion]]."&lt;ref name="AHD" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2018}} 

In other words, it refers not to something initially or topically unpleasant; rather, it is something discussed to the point of being so.

'''Associationism''' is the idea that mental processes operate by the [[Association (psychology)|association]] of one mental state with its successor states.

==History==

The idea is first recorded in [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], especially with regard to the succession of memories. Members of the principally British "''Associationist School''", including [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[James Mill]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Alexander Bain]], and [[Ivan Pavlov]], asserted that the principle applied to all or most mental processes.&lt;ref name="Boring"&gt;Boring, E. G. (1950) "A History of Experimental Psychology" New York, Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; Later members of the school developed very specific principles elaborating how associations worked and even a physiological mechanism bearing no resemblance to modern [[neurophysiology]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlov, I.P. (1927, 1960) "Conditioned Reflexes" New York, Oxford (1927) Dover (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;  For a fuller explanation of the intellectual history of associationism and the "Associationist School", see ''[[Association of Ideas]]''.

Some of the ideas of the Associationist School anticipated the principles of [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] and its use in [[behaviourism|behavioral psychology]].&lt;ref name="Boring"/&gt;

In philosophy, the '''Cartesian Other''', part of a thought experiment, is any other than the mind of the individual thinking about the experiment. The Other includes the individual's own body. According to the philosopher [[Descartes]], there is a divide intrinsic to consciousness, such that you cannot ever bridge the space between your own consciousness and that of another.

This "other" is in essence theoretical, since one cannot ever be [[empirical]]ly shown such an "other."

Put differently, Descartes concluded ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'', "I think, therefore I am," that is, that the presence of a self of which to speak (an "I") proves its existence to oneself; however, according to his [[Descartes#Philosophical work|Wax Argument]], one could never similarly demonstrate the existence of the "other."

'''Cartesian anxiety''' refers to the notion that, since [[René Descartes]] posited his influential form of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|body-mind dualism]], Western [[civilization]] has suffered from a longing for [[ontology|ontological]] certainty, or feeling that [[scientific method]]s, and especially the study of the world as a thing separate from ourselves, should be able to lead us to a firm and unchanging [[knowledge]] of ourselves and the world around us. The term is named after Descartes because of his well-known emphasis on "mind" as different from "body", "[[self]]" as different from "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]". 

[[Richard J. Bernstein]] coined the term in his 1983 book ''Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">'''Chemism''' refers to forces of attraction or adhesion between entities.  It has uses in chemistry and philosophy.

==Chemistry==
In the past, chemism referred to intramolecular forces between atoms, or more generally, any forces acting on atoms and molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''The principles of theoretical chemistry, with special reference to the constitution of chemical compounds'' (1887).  Remsen, Ira,, Philadelphia, Lea Brothers &amp; Co. pg, 83 (archived version [https://archive.org/details/cu31924002984676 here])&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now typically superseded by more precise terms such as [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen interaction]].

==Philosophy==
The concept of chemism has been referred to in many of the various disciplines that constitute philosophical practice. Some of the include:

*The use of the term in philosophy references the activities of chemism in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Clark.  ''Hegel's logic: between dialectic and history'', Northwestern University Press, Chicago. 1996. (p. 260)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chemism is a term in [[Hegelianism|Hegelian philosophy]] that stands for the ''"mutual attraction, interpenetration, and neutralisation of independent individuals which unite to form a whole."'' Hegel posits that the concept of "Objectivity" contains the "three forms of Mechanism, Chemism , and Teleology":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The object of mechanical type is the immediate and undifferentiated object. No doubt it contains difference, but the different pieces stand, as it were, without affinity to each other, and their connection is only extraneous. In chemism, on the contrary, the object exhibits an essential tendency to differentiation, in such a way that the objects are what they are only by their relation to each other: this tendency to difference constitutes their quality. The third type of objectivity, the teleological relation, is the unity of mechanism and chemism. Design, like the mechanical object, is a self-contained totality, enriched however by the principle of differentiation which came to the fore in chemism, and thus referring itself to the object that stands over against it. Finally, it is the realisation of design which forms the transition to the Idea."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kern-ep.de/Internet/Hegels_Logik/object.htm|title=Hegel, The Notion, Part B. The Object|first=|last=Hegel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In his ''Science of Logic'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]  develops a succession of different forms of mechanism, which end up engendering a process called "chemism". Chemism is obviously a term that lends itself to chemical relationships in physical reality. Hegel, however, is using the term "chemism" logically, and therefore it can be applied to things that you do not study in chemistry class but you might study in German literature, reading Goethe's ''Elective Affinities,'' or in psychological studies dealing with a chemistry between individuals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Chemism constitutes in objectivity as a whole, the moment of judgment, of the difference that has become objective, and of the process. Since it already begins with determinateness and positedness and the chemical object is at the same time an objective totality, its immediate course is simple and is completely determined by its presupposition."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">'''Cratylism''' as a [[philosophical theory]] reflects the teachings of the Athenian [[Cratylus]] ({{lang-grc|Κρατύλος}}, also transliterated as Kratylos), fl. mid to late 5th century BCE. Cratylus is more popularly known as [[Socrates]]' antagonist in [[Plato]]'s dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scissors of Meter: Grammetrics and Reading|last=Wesling|first=Donald|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1999|isbn=0472107151|location=Ann Arbor|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaguely [[exegesis|exegetical]], Cratylism holds that the fluid nature of [[idea]]s, [[word]]s, and [[communication]]s leaves them fundamentally baseless, and possibly unable to support [[logic]] and [[reason]]. It is distinguished from linguisticity by the problematic status of style - that in a natural [[language]], where a perfect connection is found between word and things, variations of style are no longer conceivable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language and the Renewal of Society in Walt Whitman, Laura (Riding) Jackson, and Charles Olson: The American Cratylus|last=Billitteri|first=Carla|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=9781349375240|location=New York|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gérard Genette|Gerard Genette]] divided the theory into primary and secondary Cratylism. The former is said to involve a general attempt to establish a motivated link between the signifier and the signified by inventing emotional values for certain sounds while the latter admits that language has fallen and that the signifier enjoys an arbitrary relation to the signified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Assimilation/generation/resurrection: Contrapuntal Readings in the Poetry of José Lezama Lima|last=Heller|first=Ben|publisher=Bucknell University Press|year=1997|isbn=0838753477|location=Lewisburg|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cratylism reaches similar conclusions about the nature of reality and communication that [[Taoism]] and [[Zen Buddhism]] also confronted: how can a mind in flux, in a flowing world, hold on to any solid "truth" and convey it to another mind?

A fellow-Greek sophist, [[Gorgias]], expressed an equally ironic ''cul de sac'' conclusion about the nature of human [[epistemology|epistemological]] understanding: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Nothing exists. Even if something did exist, nothing can be known about it; and even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it cannot be communicated to others. And, finally, even if it can be communicated, it cannot be understood."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]], ''Greek Philosophy'' (1914), §96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1476">{{Immanuel Kant}}

Attributed to [[Immanuel Kant]], the '''critical philosophy''' ({{lang-de|kritische Philosophie}}) movement sees the primary task of [[philosophy]] as [[criticism]] rather than justification of knowledge; criticism, for Kant, meant judging as to the possibilities of knowledge before advancing to knowledge itself (from the Greek ''kritike (techne)'', or "art of judgment"). The basic task of philosophers, according to this view, is not to establish and demonstrate theories about reality, but rather to subject all theories—including those about philosophy itself—to critical review, and measure their validity by how well they withstand criticism.

"Critical philosophy" is also used as another name for Kant's philosophy itself. Kant said that philosophy's proper enquiry is not about what is out there in reality, but rather about the character and foundations of experience itself. We must first judge how human reason works, and within what limits, so that we can afterwards correctly apply it to [[empirical evidence|sense experience]] and determine whether it can be applied at all to metaphysical objects.

'''Cultural schema theory''' holds that human beings employ classification to understand members of other cultures, and add new data to previously available categories.&lt;ref&gt;Shahghasemi, E. 2017. Cultural Schema Theory. The International Encyclopedia of Intercultural Communication. 1–9.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118783665.ieicc0019/full&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural schemas for [[social interaction]] are [[cognitive]] structures that contain knowledge for face-to-face interactions in a person's cultural environment. Schemas are generalized collections of knowledge of past experiences that are organized into related knowledge groups; they guide our behaviours in familiar situations. Cultural schemas do not differ from other schemas, except that they are shared by certain cultural groups rather than individuals (Garro, 2000). Schemas unique to individuals are created from personal experiences, whereas those shared by individuals are created from various types of common experiences (Garro, 2000). Cultural schema theory proposes that when we interact with members of the same [[culture]] in certain situations many times, or talk about certain information with them many times, cultural schemas are created and stored in our brain (Nishida, 1999).

== History ==
Cultural schema theory may be a relatively new theory, but neither schema nor cultural schema are new concepts.

The idea of schemas existing as ideal types in the mind dates back all the way back to [[Plato]] (see also [[Schema (disambiguation)|Schema]] and [[Schema (psychology)]]) . In the 19th century German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] developed the idea that every person's experiences are gathered in memory, forming higher order concepts. In the 1920s [[Jean Piaget]]'s work investigated schemas in infants. In the 1930s [[Frederic Bartlett]] tested memory for schemas. From the 1970s to the 1990s, many researchers obtained loads of evidence showing that people's [[behaviors]] are deeply embedded to what they store in their brains. Through these studies researchers learned that [[human behavior]] relies heavily on past experiences and the [[knowledge]] stored in one's brain.

Research also revealed that schemas operate at many different levels. The experiences which are unique to individuals allow them to acquire personal schemas.  Societal schemas may emerge from a group's collective [[knowledge]] and are represented across the minds in a [[society]], enabling people to think as if they are one mind (Malcolm &amp; Sharifian, 2002). However, when one's cultural environment provides experiences to which every member of that culture is exposed, their experiences allow every member to acquire cultural schemas (Nishida, 1999). Cultural schemas are [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]] structures which enable individuals to store perceptual and conceptual information about their [[culture]] and interpret cultural experiences and expressions. If people are not equipped with the appropriate cultural schema, they may not be able to make sense of culturally unfamiliar situations (Malcolm &amp; Sharifian, 2002).

== How cultural schemas develop ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

When one interacts with members of the same [[culture]] over and over again, or talks about certain information with them many times, cultural schemas are created and stored in one's brain. Subsequent similar instances cause the cultural schema to become more organized, abstract, and compact. As this occurs, communication becomes much easier. Nishida (1999) simply explains that experience is the force which creates cultural schemas. As people have more experiences their developing cultural schemas become more tightly organized. The information not only becomes more complex, but more useful among members of a culture, alike or different. Beyond the [[cognitive]] activity of cultural schemas is the complex pattern which occurs in the [[brain]].

When humans acquire and retain information from their surrounding environments, [[neural]] circuits are generated. Consequently, information processing experience is stored in the [[long-term memory]]. Memory representation or [[neural]] circuits created in the brain as a result of information processing are assumed to be schemas {{dubious|date=July 2013}}. Thus, schemas provide a foundation in the brain which helps to predict what is to be expected and looked for in certain situations.

Not all schemas are uniformly important. High-level schemas are internalized and emotionally salient; likewise, when a schema is only weakly related to a person's self it becomes emotionally empty and irrelevant (Lipset, 1993).

== Types of cultural schemas for social interactions ==

Cultural schemas for social interactions are cognitive structures that contain knowledge for face-to-face interactions in one's cultural environment. Nishida (1999) points out the eight primary types for generating human behavior for social interactions. These eight schemas are also referred to as Primary Social Interaction (PSI) schemas.

# ''Fact-and-concept schemas:'' These are pieces of general information about facts, such as Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United States, and concepts, such as bicycles are vehicles that have two wheels, a seat, and pedals.
# ''Person schemas:'' These are knowledge about different types of people, specifically [[personality traits]]; for example, Barb is shy or Dave is outgoing. Since people have some representation or idea of what being shy or outgoing is, they tend to classify others, such as Barb and Dave, into their dominant personality traits.
# ''Self schemas:'' These contain people's knowledge of how they see themselves and knowledge of how others see them.
# ''Role schemas:'' These are knowledge about social roles that denote expected sets of behaviors of people in particular social positions.
# ''Context schemas:'' These contain information about the situations and appropriate settings of behavioral parameters. Information in context schemas includes predictions about appropriate actions to take in order to achieve goals in the respective context. Information also includes suggestions for reasonable problem-solving strategies. It is important to note that context schemas are triggered before other schemas {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.
# ''Procedure schemas:'' These are knowledge about the appropriate sequence of events in common situations. This includes the specific steps to take and the appropriate behavioral rules for the events. The use of procedure schemas causes people to take certain actions some way.
# ''Strategy schemas:'' These are knowledge about problem-solving strategies.
# ''Emotion schemas:'' These contain information about affect and evaluation stored in long-term [[memory]]. This is accessed when other schemas are activated. [[Emotion]] schemas develop through social interactions throughout a person's life. This schema is relatively new {{clarify|date=July 2013}}. Researchers believed it was an important additive because emotions play important roles in human social interactions.

== Application to cross-cultural adaptation ==
The term cross-cultural adaptation refers to the complex process through which an individual acquires an increasing level of the communication skills of the host culture and of relational development with host nationals. Simply put, cross-cultural adaptation is the transformation of a person's own PSI schemas into those of the host culture and acquisition of new PSI schemas in the host culture s/he is residing in. A number of different people may b e subject to cross-cultural adaptation, including [[immigrants]], [[refugees]], [[business people]], [[diplomats]], [[foreign workers]], and [[students]]. However, this entry specifically applies cultural schema theory to [[:wikt:sojourner|sojourner]]s' cross cultural adaptation. Sojourners generally spend a few years in another culture while intending to return to their home country. Business people, diplomats, students, and foreign workers can all be classified as sojourners. In order to better explain sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation, [[axioms]] are used to express causal, correlational, or [[teleological]] relationships. [[Axioms]] also help to explain the basic assumptions of the Cultural Schema Theory (Nishida, 1999).

=== Sojourners' axioms ===
Nishida (1999) describes the following nine axioms:

'''Axiom 1:''' The more often a person repeats a schema-based [[behavior]] in his or her culture, the more likely the cultural schema will be stored in the person's memory.

'''Axiom 2:''' Sojourners' failure to recognize the actions and behaviors that are relevant to meaningful interactions in the host culture are mainly due to their lack of the PSI schemas of the culture.

'''Axiom 3:''' The acquisition of the PSI schemas of the host culture is a necessary condition for sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation to the culture.

'''Axiom 4:''' The PSI schemas of a person's own culture are interrelated with each other, forming a network of cultural schemas to generate behaviors that are appropriate in the culture. Experience in the host culture causes a change in one's cultural schema. This causes further changes in all other cultural schemas and results in a total change in behavior.

'''Axiom 5:''' The acquisition of information about interrelationships among the PSI schemas of the host culture is a necessary condition for sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation.

'''Axiom 6:''' People use both schema-driven and data-driven processing to perceive new information, depending on the situation and their motivations.

'''Axiom 7:''' If one has well-organized cultural schemas, schematically salient information is more likely to be processed through the schemas, whereas ambiguous information will either direct a search for the relevant data to complete the stimulus more fully, or it will be filled in with default options of the schemas.

'''Axiom 8:''' Sojourners who lack the PSI schemas of the host culture are more likely to employ data-driven processing, which requires effort and attention.

'''Axiom 9:''' In the host culture, sojourners encounter truly novel situations where they experience [[cognitive]] [[uncertainty]] and [[anxiety]] because of the lack of the PSI schemas in the situations.

'''Axiom 10:''' In the host culture, sojourners experience the stages of self-regulation and self-direction. In the stage of self-regulation, they try to resolve ambiguities and to establish integration of information using their native-culture schemas by gradually modifying them. In the stage of self-direction, on the other hand, they actively try to reorganize their native [[culture]] schemas or to generate host culture schemas in order to adapt to the host-culture environment.

=== Real-world example – a sojourner's experience ===
As discussed above, [[:wikt:sojourner|sojourner]]s are people who live in a culture other than their own with the intent of one day returning home. For sojourner Gillian Gibbons' situation, the cultural schema theory is highly applicable. Ms. Gibbons, a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[school teacher]], left [[Liverpool, England]] in August 2007 to teach a group of six- and seven-year-olds at Unity School in [[Khartoum, Sudan]]. Shortly after her arrival, Ms. Gibbons class was due to study the habitat and behavior of bears. Upon her request, a student brought in a [[teddy bear]] to serve as a case study. Students were invited to vote on a name for the bear. After considering the names [[Abdullah (name)|Abdullah]] and [[Hassan (name)|Hassan]], 20 of the 23 children voted in favor of the name [[Muhammad]]. What seemed like a harmless children's learning tool took a turn for the worse on November 25, 2007, when Ms. Gibbons was arrested at her home inside the school premises; Sudanese police claimed a number of parents complained to Sudan's [[Ministry of Education (Sudan)|Ministry of Education]] about the bear. Charges against Ms. Gibbons were prepared under article 125 of Sudanese [[criminal law]] which covers insults against faith and religions.  Ms Gibbons' particular crime: insulting Islam's [[Prophet Muhammad]]. In [[Islam]], insulting the [[Prophet Muhammad]] is considered a grave offense.  Ms. Gibbons' was held in a [[Khartoum]] jail facing a maximum penalty of 40 lashes and 6 months in jail. Ms. Gibbons was found guilty of insulting Islam and sentenced to 15 days in jail and deportation from Sudan after her release. Sudanese President [[Omar al-Bashir]] granted her a pardon after she served nine days in jail due to pressure from the British government. She immediately returned to [[England]] upon her release. While colleagues, friends, and family regarded the whole situation as a misunderstanding, many local Sudanese disagreed. Hundreds of protestors gathered outside of the presidential palace to denounce Ms. Gibbons. Some protestors waved ceremonial swords, some voiced anger at the Sudanese government for not treating her more severely, some distributed leaflets which condemned her as an infidel and accused her of polluting children's mentality by her actions. At the edge of extreme were those who called for her execution (BBC News, 2007; CNN, 2007; New York Times, 2007; TIME, 2007; Times Online, 2007). This highly publicized incident can be explained quite well by the cultural schema theory, particularly by discussing Ms. Gibbons' status as a sojourner in an unfamiliar culture. Axiom number three and axiom number nine apply quite well to Ms. Gibbons. As a sojourner, the acquisition of host [[culture]] PSI schemas would be necessary in order for the sojourner's cross-cultural adaptation to occur. Ms. Gibbons may have lived in Sudan, but she lived inside the walls of Unity School. According to [[BBC News]] (2007), once inside the walls of Unity School one would think s/he was at standing on the grounds of an Oxbridge University. This private school with children of well-to-do parents is much different than the rest of Sudan. Ms. Gibbons did not need to acquire the PSI schemas of the host culture because her native PSI schemas worked equally well inside the walls of Unity School. Had Ms. Gibbons been constantly made aware of the local PSI schemas (naming an animal after the [[Prophet Muhammad]] is unacceptable) she may have adapted and not allowed the children to name the teddy bear Muhammad. Naming a teddy bear was not a novel situation to her as a children's school teacher, but she was not in England. After the bear's naming she certainly encountered a novel situation where she experienced cognitive uncertainty and anxiety because of her lack of the PSI schemas in the situation. Hence the difficulties of cross-cultural adaptation for sojourners like Ms. Gibbons. They do not intend to stay and thus will not adapt/experience the stages of axioms which will best prepare them to appropriately fit in.

== Contrasting theory ==
Cultural Schema Theory is often compared and contrasted with the [[Cultural consensus theory|Cultural Consensus Theory]]. Both theories present distinct perspectives about the nature of individual and cultural knowledge. However, unlike the Cultural Schema Theory, the Cultural Consensus Theory helps to describe and mathematically measure the extent to which cultural beliefs are shared. The central idea is the use of the pattern of agreement or consensus among members of the same culture.  Essentially, the more knowledge people have, the more consensus is observed among them. Unfortunately, the Cultural Consensus Theory does not help others to better understand [[intracultural]] variability or how cultural knowledge is interrelated at a cognitive level. Cultural Consensus Theory anticipates intracultural variation but views variation as analogous to performance on a cultural test, with certain individuals functioning as better guides than others to the cultural information pool (Garro, 2000).

== Further use and development of the theory ==
Simply put, cultural schema theory can be described as cultural-specific world knowledge (Razi, 2002). As mentioned above, the concept of Cultural Schemas is not new, but the theory is.  Future studies must generate theorems and further tests must be conducted in order to better formulate theory itself and the axioms it proposes. Once this is complete the theory can be used in cross-cultural training purposes in order to facilitate individuals' adaptation to their respective host-culture environments (Nishida, 1999). There has been efforts to make this task done. For example, Ehsan Shahghasemi and [[D. Ray Heisey]] (2009) introduce the notion of "cross cultual schemata" as "abstract mental structures that one makes according to his/her past experiences or shared knowledge about the members of other cultures and thus makes them more understandable."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2009v18n1/10%20Ehsan%20Shaghasemi%20&amp;%20D.%20Ray%20Heisey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3474">'''Equality of autonomy''' is a [[political philosophy]] concept of [[Amartya Sen]] that argues "that the ability and means to choose our life course should be spread as equally as possible across society"—i.e., an equal chance at [[autonomy]] or [[empowerment]].&lt;ref name=twsO23&gt;{{cite news |author= Sunder Katwala |title= It's equality of life chances, not literal equality, that the left espouses |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= 21 October 2010 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/21/equality-life-chances-not-literal-left |accessdate= 2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equality of autonomy strives to spread empowerment widely so that "given their circumstances", people have more "choice and control".&lt;ref name=twsO24&gt;{{cite news|title=Equality Impact Assessments |publisher=''Hull Teaching Primary Care'' |date=2011-07-15 |url=http://www.hullpct.nhs.uk/impact_assessments/ |accessdate=2011-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307214013/http://www.hullpct.nhs.uk/impact_assessments/ |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has a slightly different emphasis from related notions, such as the value of [[Inequality in the workplace|equality in the workplace]] ("[[equal opportunity]]") or equal material wealth ("[[equality of outcome]]").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1576">The '''Eretrian school of philosophy''' was originally the '''School of [[Elis]]''' where it had been founded by [[Phaedo of Elis]]; it was later transferred to [[Eretria]] by his pupil [[Menedemus]]. It can be referred to as the '''Elian–Eretrian School''', on the assumption that the views of the two schools were similar. It died out after the time of Menedemus (3rd century BC), and, consequently, very little is known about its tenets. Phaedo had been a pupil of [[Socrates]], and [[Plato]] named a dialogue, ''[[Phaedo]]'', in his honor, but it is not possible to infer his doctrines from the dialogue. Menedemus was a pupil of [[Stilpo]] at [[Megara]] before becoming a pupil of Phaedo; in later times, the views of his school were often linked with those of the [[Megarian school]]. Menedemus' friend and colleague in the Eretrian school was [[Asclepiades of Phlius]].

Like the Megarians they seem to have believed in the individuality of "the Good," the denial of the plurality of [[virtue]], and of any real difference existing between the Good and the True. [[Cicero]] tells us that they placed all good in the [[mind]], and in that acuteness of mind by which the [[truth]] is discerned.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They denied that truth could be inferred by negative categorical [[proposition]]s, and would only allow positive ones, and of these only simple ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ii, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19136">'''Exclusivism''' is the practice of being [[:wikt:exclusive|exclusive]]; [[mentality]] characterized by the disregard for opinions and ideas other than one's own, or the practice of organizing entities into groups by excluding those entities which possess certain traits. (for an opposite example, see [[essentialism]]).

==Religious exclusivism==
{{Main|Chosen people|One true faith}}
Religious exclusivism, one of the three classic typologies created by [[Alan Race]] in order to describe religions relative to one another, states that one religion, to the exclusion of all others, has the correct understanding of God, truth and salvation. [[Diana L. Eck|Diana Eck]] states, ‘Exclusivism is more than simply a conviction about the transformative power of the particular vision one has; it is a conviction about its finality and its absolute priority over competing views’.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Douglas. "Exclusivism and Exclusivity: A Contemporary Theological Challenge." ''Pacifica'' 20.3 (2007): 296.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was originally used to define Christianity, exclusivism can apply to any religious belief system, as can Race’s other two categories [[inclusivism]] and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]]. In his 1982 ''[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Christians-Religious-Pluralism-Christian-Religions/dp/0334019389/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521581557&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=alan+Race+religious+pluralism Christians and Religious Pluralism],'' Race defined pluralism as all religions being equally beneficial, with no single religion dominating. Inclusivism attempts to straddle the poles of pluralism and exclusivism by agreeing with the latter that one religion (Christianity) has the most value, and agreeing with the former by stating that other religions still have significant value.&lt;ref&gt;Tuggy, Dale. "Religious Diversity, Theories Of." ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; While Race’s three categories have been criticized, amended and refuted, most religious studies and interfaith scholars and students find the typologies useful as a starting point for conversations about the diversity of religions.&lt;ref&gt;D'Costa, Gavin. "The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions." ''Religious Studies'' 32.2 (1996): 223-24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic Three-point typology ==

=== Pluralism ===
Pluralism was borne out of a criticism of exclusivism, saying that no single tradition has a monopoly on revelation or salvation, and that we have no way to judge between the salvific claims by adherents of any faith tradition.  [https://www.rsis.edu.sg/profile/paul-hedges/#.WrF9WMPFLDc Paul Hedges] suggests that each religion knows ‘transcendent reality (“God”) yet in partial perspective,’ much like the oft-quoted parable of the seven blind men and the elephant.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Paul. “A Reflection on Typologies: Negotiating a Fast-Moving Discussion.” ''Christian Approaches to Other Faiths''. Paul Hedges and Alan Race, eds. (London: SCM, 2008): 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gavin D'Costa|Gavin D’costa]]  says pluralists have two main critiques of exclusivists: people of other religions are god and loving and that they do not know their own Scriptures well enough.&lt;ref&gt;D'Costa, Gavin. "The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions." ''Religious Studies'' 32.2 (1996): 227.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]] says that pluralist’s problem with exclusivism stems from its immorality and arrogance. He quotes William Cantwell Smith: ‘Except at the cost of insensitivity or delinquency, it is morally not possible actually to go out into the world and say to devout, intelligent, fellow human beings: “…we believe that we know God and we are right; you believe that you know God, and you are totally wrong.”’&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, Alan. “Pluralism: A Defense of Religious Exclusivism.” ''The Rationality of Belief and the Plurality of Faith'', Thomas D. Senor (ed). (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1995): 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Smith, the leading proponent of pluralism is John Hick, who writes:

[Exclusivism], with its baleful historical influence, in validating centuries of anti-semitism, the colonial exploitation by Christian Europe of what today we call the third world, and the subordination of women within a strongly patriarchal religious system, not only causes misgivings among many Christians but also alarms many of our non-Christian neighbors, creating invisible but powerful barriers within the human community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pluralism and Particularity in Religious Belief|last=Stetson|first=Brad|publisher=Praeger|year=1994|isbn=|location=Westport CT and London|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth noting that D’costa argued persuasively that logically, pluralism can no longer be considered a category; when it makes a declarative truth claim, it becomes another form of exclusivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Costa|first=Gavin|date=1996|title=The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions 32.2 (1996): 223-32|url=|journal=Religious Studies|volume=32:2|pages=225|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclusivism ===
Inclusivists state that while one religion or revelation is true (Christianity), other truths can be found in fragments within other religions.&lt;ref&gt;D'Costa, Gavin. "The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions." ''Religious Studies'' 32.2 (1996): 225.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Rahner]] states it succinctly: ‘Insofar as they in good conscience practice what is good in their religion, people in other religions receive God’s grace and are “anonymous Christians,” people who are being saved through Christ, though they do not realize it.’ &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuggy|first=Dale|date=2015|title=Religious Diversity, Theories Of|url=|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusivists point to the biblical parable of the sheep and the goats in which the saved sheep show surprise at being rewarded for their service to [[Jesus]] (Matthew 25: 31-40)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Paul|date=2010|title=Religious Exclusivism|url=|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity|volume=|pages=86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exclusivism in Christianity and other religions ===
According to Race, the history of the Abrahamic faiths’ exclusivism – as well as inclusivism – goes back to the words of the Bible and the Qur’an.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Race, Alan. “Theologies of Religions in Change: Factors in the Shape of a Debate.” ''Christian Approaches to Other Faiths''. Paul Hedges and Alan Race, eds. (London: SCM, 2008): 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian exclusivists point to John’s gospel (14: 6), which quotes Jesus as saying, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’ After Jesus’ death, his disciple Peter said publicly, ‘Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved’ (Acts 4:12). Likewise, the Qur’an (3:85) states, ‘If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good).’ While Judaism does not stress salvation, the First Commandment (Exodus 20:3) is ‘You shall have no other gods before me.’ Race says, ‘The tension between Christian experience and the recognition of potential authentic practice outside of the Christian revelation, in fact has always existed in Christian history from the beginning, from the words of Jesus himself in the gospel of Luke: in 9:50 he says, “He who is ''not against'' us is for us”’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Daniel Strange points out what Race neglects to mention: that in the same gospel (11:23), Jesus says, ‘He who is ''not with me'' is against me.’&lt;ref&gt;Strange, Daniel. “Exclusivisms: ‘Indeed Their Rock is Not like Our Rock.’ ''Christian Approaches to Other Faiths''. Paul Hedges and Alan Race, eds. (London: SCM, 2008) 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== No salvation outside the Church ==
The exclusivist idea of ‘no salvation outside of the Christian church’ (''[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|Extra ecclesiam nulla salus]]'') has roots as early as [[Origen]] in the third century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; And while the Bible speaks about many topics of inclusion, diversity and tolerance in both the Old and New Testament – attitudes toward the alien and stranger; the hope of Christians being drawn from all nations and languages; God’s universal care and sustaining of creation; the universal scope of the gospel and the universal mandate to take the gospel to the nations&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; – the overwhelming feeling in the Church throughout most of its history mimics that of the [[Council of Florence]] in 1422: ‘The Council firmly believes, professes and proclaims that those not living within the Catholic Church, not only pagans, but Jews, heretics and schismatics, cannot participate in eternal life, but will depart into everlasting fire which has been prepared for the devil and his [sic] angels.’&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] continued the exclusivist theological bent: ‘For where Christ is not preached, there is no Holy Spirit to create, call and gather the Christian Church, and outside it no one can come to the Lord Christ’.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 41&lt;/ref&gt; The door in the exclusivist castle opened a crack during the 20th century missionary movement, when Dutch missiologist [[Hendrik Kraemer]] wrote that Jesus is the one who has the complete authority to judge other religions’ efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Highlighting a unique contemporary take on the salvation problem, Strange introduces [[George Lindbeck]]’s contention that those who do not know the Bible cannot be condemned for their lack of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New wave of exclusivism ==
Mara Brecht states that the problem with classic exclusivism is that it deals mainly with Christianity and salvation (or ‘top down’). She highlights the work of the ‘New Wave of exclusivism,’ led by Griffiths, D’costa and Netland, who employ a ‘bottom up’ approach to religious diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, Mara. "What's the use of Exclusivism?" ''Theological Studies'' 73.1 (2012): 34.&lt;/ref&gt; New Wave Exclusivists focus more on the religious believers’ ‘ways of knowing and understanding of religious beliefs as expressive truth,’ resulting in a broader possibility for interfaith engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Netland sets aside comparing religions’ salvation when he says dialogue should focus on the most important question all religions deal with – the question of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht reaches the conclusion that exclusivism is tenable for Christians – and by extension other religious believers – if believers come into contact with believers of other religions who can possibly ‘defeat’ their own, so they can have something to base their truth claims on. Brecht says, ‘Practically, this means that, for example, reflective Christians will consider their beliefs to be as ''probable'' as alternatives from within their own tradition, ''somewhat more probable than'' the relevant alternatives from within Judaism and ''considerably more probable than'' Buddhist alternatives. In other words, believers will weigh their beliefs against other beliefs.’&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions of exclusivism ==
Douglas Pratt further defines exclusivism, dividing it into three subdivisions – open, closed and extreme. Citing t’Hooft and Kraemer, Pratt says open exclusivism, while never ceding the superior position, ‘may at least be amenably disposed toward the other,’ if only in order to know Them well enough for possible conversion. The relationship is not entered into on equal ground, therefore, nor with the openness to a significant reciprocal change of self-identity. If dialogue is entered into, it is only for mutual edification and an increase in good will.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Douglas. "Exclusivism and Exclusivity: A Contemporary Theological Challenge." ''Pacifica'' 20.3 (2007): 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Closed exclusivism offers no chance for a relationship, other than acknowledging the other’s right to exist.  An extreme, hard-line exclusivism often leads to a fundamentalist perspective. Pratt writes, ‘Fundamentalism, as a mindset, is a mentality that expresses the modern quest for universality and coherence writ large: only one truth; one authority; one authentic narrative that accounts for all; one right way to be.’&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The logical conclusion for this fundamentalist mindset is taking steps to eliminate the other, as one would a business competitor. Pratt writes, ‘The negation of otherness is perhaps critical, for it involves a devaluing and dismissal of the "other," whether in terms of rival community or competing alterities, ideological or otherwise. In the process of negating the other, the self is asserted as inherently superior. My God is greater than your god.’&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 298-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Moser]] posits two forms of exclusivism: logical religious exclusivism, which asserts that since the contradictory, foundational truth claims for each religion excludes some or many of them from being true;&lt;ref&gt;Moser, Paul K. "Religious Exclusivism." ''The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity'' (2010): 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and the doxastic redemptive exclusivism based on the Athanasian Creed, which states if a person does not believe the Christian concept of the Trinity, that person is condemned. Moser further believes that a God who would exclude people from salvation for neither hearing nor understanding the concept of the Trinity does not have a moral character, and is therefore undeserving of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exclusivism in other religions ==
While most attention of exclusivism points toward Christianity, each religion has a branch that falls into the exclusivist category. D’costa&lt;ref&gt;D'cost, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; points out whether one considers oneself Buddhist or Hindu or Muslim – or indeed a pluralist – each version states that ‘only one single revelation or one single religion is true and all other “revelations” or religions are false.’ While acknowledging that historically, Christianity showed the most extreme forms of exclusivism, Pratt contends that many fundamentalist religions compete for that title, with Islam leading other worthy contenders&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; in ways that are not always obvious. With the purging of the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] in [[Myanmar]], the Buddhist Rakhine have joined the ranks of fundamentalists willing to resort to killing to achieve dominance over competing religions.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Morgan. “Love Thy Neighbor: South Asia Christians Advocate for Rohingya Muslims.” ''Christianity Today'', Oct. 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Ancient Greece==
The Decree of Diopithes (430 BCE) forbade the worship of and belief in gods other than those of the Olympian pantheon recognised by the Athenian polis. The introduction of other gods was treated as ''asebeia'', or [[impiety]], and was punishable by death. The philosophers [[Anaxagoras]], [[Protagoras]], [[Socrates]], [[Stilpo]], [[Theodorus the Atheist|Theodorus of Cyrene]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Theophrastus]] were accused of impiety under this decree. Socrates was found guilty of the charge of introducing new gods and condemned to death by drinking [[conium|hemlock]].

[[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], [[Selucid]] ruler of Israel, decided to Hellenize the Jews by ordering the worship of Zeus; when they refused, Antiochus sent an army to enforce his decree.

According to [[Herodotus]] the Caunians, a Greek people who claimed to have originated in Crete and settled in Asia Minor, worshiped the Olympian Gods exclusively. "They determined that they would no longer make use of the foreign temples which had been established among them, but would worship their own old ancestral Gods alone. Then their whole youth took arms, and striking the air with their spears, marched to the Calyndic frontier, declaring that they were driving out the foreign Gods."

[[Plato]], in his Laws, advocates that the state should punish those who deny the existence of the Olympian Gods or believe that the gods exist but think they are indifferent to mankind or can be easily bought by bribes.

''[[Interpretatio graeca]]'', the common tendency of ancient Greek writers to identify foreign divinities with members of their own pantheon, can be seen as a kind of exclusivism. The [[syncretism]] of the [[Hellenistic]] period whereby aspects of the cults of foreign Gods such as iconography and epithets, can also be seen as a kind of exclusivism.

=== Exclusivism and religious diversity in America ===
In a sociological survey of Americans and their relationship with religions other than Christianity, nearly 90 percent of respondents either strongly or somewhat agreed that “religious diversity has been good for America,” which reinforces the idea that Americans value diversity and religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Merino, Stephen. "Religious Diversity in a "Christian Nation": The Effects of Theological Exclusivity and Interreligious Contact on the Acceptance of Religious Diversity." ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 49.2 (2010): 237.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, respondents who identified in the exclusivist category or believed that the United States was a Christian nation displayed much more negative views and a decreased willingness to include other religious people in the lives of their community.&lt;ref&gt;Merino, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Merino concludes, ‘It may be that when many Americans think of “religious diversity,” they have only Christian diversity in mind.’ &lt;ref&gt;Merino, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, they also provided research to back up their statement, ''‘''Prior contact with non-Christians will be associated with more positive views of religious diversity and increased willingness to include non-Christians into social life.’ &lt;ref&gt;Merino, 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exclusivism and truth ===
In answering the pluralist charge, and hearkening back to Netland, Brad Stetson baldly states, ‘It is possible exclusivism is true.’ &lt;ref&gt;Stetson, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this statement, he says, that upsets pluralists who charge exclusivists with arrogance and bad form. ‘It is simply not true, as pluralists imply, that disagreeing with someone […] about religious truth is tantamount to treating them badly.[…] [a]n exclusivist claim about religious truth is not defeated strictly because such claims are believed to militate against human harmony and peace.' &lt;ref&gt;Stetson, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Hick, Smith and other pluralists balk at the idea that an all-loving God would condemn some people to hell,&lt;ref&gt;Stetson, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; nor that anyone actually deserves to be damned;&lt;ref name="Stetson, 123"&gt;Stetson, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; he then quotes CS Lewis: ‘The doors of hell are locked on the ''inside.’'' &lt;ref name="Stetson, 123"/&gt;

They are traditionally accounted a kind of sainthood and their [[spirit tablets]] are prominently placed in [[Confucian temple]]s, two upon the east and two upon the west side of the Hall of the Great Completion (''Dacheng Dian'').

The Four Sages are:
* [[Yan Hui]], Confucius's favourite [[disciples of Confucius|disciple]]

The former deals with the rights of the individual; the latter covers the expressed permission (or lack thereof) for more than one individual to engage in an activity.&lt;!--*"I define license as interfering with another's freedom." ---AS Neill.--&gt;

As a result, freedoms usually include rights which are usually recognized (often, not always, in an unconditional manner) by the government (and access to which is theoretically enforced against any and all interferences). Licenses, on the other hand, are distributed to individuals who make use of a specific item, expressing the permission to use the item or service under specified, conditional terms and boundaries of usage.

A term coined by [[Karl Popper]] in his work ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' to denote what he regarded as the main problem of [[methodology]] and the [[philosophy of science]], i.e. to explain and promote the further growth of scientific knowledge. To this purpose, Popper advocated his theory of [[falsifiability]], [[testability]] and testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prb.org 3 Population Bulletin Vol. 61, No. 2 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''heuristic argument''' is an [[argument]] that reasons from the value of a method or principle that has been shown by experimental (especially [[trial-and-error]]) investigation to be a useful aid in learning, discovery and [[problem-solving]]. A widely used and important example of a [[heuristic]] argument is [[Occam's Razor]].

It is a speculative, non-rigorous argument, that relies on an analogy or on intuition, that allows one to achieve a result or approximation to be checked later with more rigor; otherwise the results are of doubt. It is used as a hypothesis or conjecture in an investigation. It can also be used as a mnemonic.&lt;ref name="BrodskyEllis1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodsky|first1=Stanley J.|last2=Ellis|first2=John|last3=Karliner|first3=Marek|title=Chiral symmetry and the spin of the proton|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=206|issue=2|year=1988|pages=309–315|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(88)91511-0|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-4519.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hierarchy of the sciences''' is a theory formulated by [[Auguste Comte]] in the 19th century. This theory states that science develops over time beginning with the simplest and most general scientific discipline, [[astronomy]], which is the first to reach the "positive stage" (one of three in Comte's [[law of three stages]]). As one moves down the "hierarchy", this theory further states that sciences become more complex and less general, and that they will reach the positive stage later. Disciplines further down the hierarchy are said to depend more on the developments of their predecessors; the highest discipline on the hierarchy is the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.pfeiffer.edu/lridener/DSS/Comte/COMTEW4.HTML |title=Comte - The Work - Hierarchy of the Sciences |website=media.pfeiffer.edu |access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, there are higher levels of consensus and faster rates of advancement in [[physics]] and other [[natural sciences]] than there are in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cole |first=Stephen |date=July 1983 |title=The Hierarchy of the Sciences? |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/227835 |journal=American Journal of Sociology |language=en |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=111–139 |doi=10.1086/227835 |issn=0002-9602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Research has shown that, after controlling for the number of hypotheses being tested, positive results are 2.3 times more likely in the social sciences than in the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fanelli |first=Daniele |date=2010-04-07 |title="Positive" Results Increase Down the Hierarchy of the Sciences |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e10068 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 |pmc=2850928 |pmid=20383332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that the degree of [[scientific consensus]] is highest in the physical sciences, lowest in the social sciences, and intermediate in the [[biological sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fanelli |first=Daniele |last2=Glänzel |first2=Wolfgang |date=2013-06-26 |title=Bibliometric Evidence for a Hierarchy of the Sciences |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=e66938 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 |pmc=3694152 |pmid=23840557}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Simonton]] argues that a composite measure of the scientific status of disciplines ranks [[psychology]] much closer to biology than to sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Simonton |first=Dean Keith |date=2004 |title=Psychology's Status as a Scientific Discipline: Its Empirical Placement Within an Implicit Hierarchy of the Sciences. |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-11097-002 |journal=Review of General Psychology |language=en |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=59–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche's critique of the '''historical subject''' is based in the rejection of an existing substance in favor of forces and wills combining to form combinations, sometimes in the form of a [[consciousness]]. [[Heidegger]] later traced the [[concept]] of subject to the metaphysical concept of ''[[ousia]]'' to demonstrate the impossibility of eliminating the subject by simply historicizing it. The modern definition of subjectivity, according to Heidegger, recovered [[Immanuel Kant]]'s definition of the substance in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and [[Aristotle]]'s definition of ''ousia'' in ''[[Metaphysics]]''.

The term "historical subject" is also used by [[Michel Foucault]], as a concept opposed to the eternal and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] subject of the juridical and philosophical [[discourse]], yet still identified as an object. Foucault proposes a [[Philosophy of history#Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse|"historical and political discourse"]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2470">'''I'm entitled to my opinion''' or '''I have a right to my opinion''' is a [[Formal fallacy|logical fallacy]] in which a person discredits any opposition by claiming that they are entitled to their opinion. The statement exemplifies a [[red herring]] or [[Cliché#Thought-terminating cliché|thought-terminating cliché]]. The logical fallacy is often presented as '''Let's agree to disagree'''. Whether one has a particular entitlement or right is irrelevant to whether one's assertion is true or false. To assert the existence of the right is a failure to assert any [[justification (epistemology)|justification]] for the opinion.

'''Incarnational humanism''' is a brand of [[humanism]] which affirms the value and essential goodness of human reason and [[human culture|culture]]. Developed in a [[Christian]] framework, incarnational humanism asserts a unification of the [[secular]] and the [[sacred]] with the goal of a common humanity. This unification is fully realized in the participatory nature of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[sacrament]]s, particularly the [[Eucharist]]. The recognition of this goal requires a necessary difference between the [[church (Christian)|church]] and the world, where both "spheres are unified in their service of humanity."

In [[philosophy of science]], '''intertheoretic reduction''' occurs when a reducing theory makes predictions that perfectly or almost perfectly match the predictions of a reduced theory, while the reducing theory explains or predicts a wider range of phenomena under more general conditions. [[general relativity|Special relativity]],  for example, can be reduced to  [[Newtonian mechanics]] for velocities far less than ''[[Speed of light|c]]''.

According to [[Alexander Rosenberg]] philosophers mostly these days believe that reduction between sciences is possible ''in principle'' but concepts we currently have do not allow reductions even in many cases in which [[natural science]]s are involved, for instance from [[biology]] to [[chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Rosenberg - Philosophy of Social Science, second edition, page 140, published in 1995 by Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the extent to which one theory can be said to be reduced to another theory is complicated by the existence of [[Emergence|emergent]] phenomena. Furthermore, there is the issue of by what criteria one judges one theory as more fundamental than another. Often, this notion is ambiguous. For instance, a quintessential example of intertheoretic reduction is often considered to be the reduction of [[phenomenological thermodynamics]] to [[statistical mechanics]]. However, it has been argued that there are some phenomena (e.g. phase transitions and critical phenomena) that cannot be reductively explicated in terms of the "more fundamental" theory of statistical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Batterman, Robert (2009) Emergence, Singularities, and Symmetry Breaking.&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially [[psychology]] is seen often as a "scientific dead-end" due to its intentional concepts (though psychology does not necessarily have to use intentional concepts). Logical analysis has suggested that intentional concepts are not reducible to non-intentional concepts used by [[neurophysiology]] in which is the discipline "underlying" the psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg's book, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'', Rorty argues that [[Proust]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Heidegger]], [[Derrida]], and [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov|Nabokov]], among others, all exemplify Ironism to different extents.

'''Johan Rudolph Thorbecke''' (14 January 1798 – 4 June 1872) was a Dutch statesman of [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|a liberal]] bent, one of the most important Dutch politicians of the [[19th century]]. In 1848, he virtually single-handedly drafted the revision of the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]], giving less power to the king and more to the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], and guaranteeing more religious, personal and political freedom to the people.

==Early life and education==

Thorbecke was born in [[Zwolle]]. His father Frederik Willem was a Lutheran tobacco manufacturer of German descent, while his mother Christine Regina was born in the Lower Saxon [[Osnabrück]]. Frederik Willem's business suffered badly from the [[Continental System| anti-British policies]] of the French occupiers, and his tobacco factory went bankrupt in 1803, after which he was unable to find another source of employment and would spend most of his time on the education of Johan Rudolph and his younger brother.&lt;ref name=HN&gt;{{Cite web |last=Blessing |first=Maurice |url=http://www.historischnieuwsblad.nl/nl/artikel/26817/thorbecke-romantisch-liberaal.html |title=Thorbecke: Romantisch liberaal |website=Historisch Nieuwsblad |language=Dutch |date=July 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johan Rudolph proved to be diligent and exemplary at a young age, showing intelligence and curiosity. Because of the sacrifices of his parents, who continued to struggle with financial problems, he was able to enjoy decent education.&lt;ref name=Elsevier&gt;{{Cite web|last=Van der List |first=Gerry |url=http://www.elsevier.nl/Dossiers/achtergrond/2008/9/Thorbecke-de-belangrijkste-van-allemaal-ELSEVIER202081W/ |title=Thorbecke, de belangrijkste van allemaal |website=[[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]] |language=Dutch |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192720/http://www.elsevier.nl/Dossiers/achtergrond/2008/9/Thorbecke-de-belangrijkste-van-allemaal-ELSEVIER202081W/ |archivedate= 4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed primary education in his birthplace and in [[Amsterdam]], where he lived until 1806, and attended a [[Latin school]] back in Zwolle until 1814.&lt;ref name=Parlement&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parlement.com/id/vg09llalluyf/j_r_thorbecke |title=Dr.Mr. J.R.

Shortly after taking his doctorate, Thorbecke was granted a state scholarship for a journey through Germany. At [[University of Giessen|Giessen]] he lectured as an extraordinary professor, and at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], in 1824, published his treatise, ''Ueber das Wesen der Geschichte''.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Thorbecke, Jan Rudolf|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would spend four years travelling, during which he was introduced to [[historism]] and [[Romanticism]], and developed emotionally and spiritually.&lt;ref name=HN/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{Cite web |last=Stevens |first=Harm |url=http://retro.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Profiel/Grondwet/thorbecke.html |title=Een stijf Hollands heertje |website=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |language=Dutch |date=13 March 1998 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to the Netherlands in 1824, he settled in [[Amsterdam]], where he wrote his first political work of significance, ''Bedenkingen aangaande het Regt en Den Staat'' ("Objections concerning the Law and the State"). The work managed to catch attention, and Thorbecke became professor of Political Science at [[Ghent University]] the following year,&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; a position he was forced to resign from due to the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830. The following year, Thorbecke became professor of Diplomacy and Modern History at the [[Leiden University]],&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; where his students would describe him as a distant, analytical mind, living a secluded life in his study.&lt;ref name=Elsevier/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;

Originally a loyal supporter of the conservative government of [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]], Thorbecke developed a more critical view of the government and indeed the autocratic system of government throughout the 1830s. His increasingly strong support for constitutional reform is shown in a series of essays he published from 1839 onward, starting with ''Aanteekening op de grondwet'', literally "Annotation on the constitution". The climax of this series was ''Over het hedendaags burgerschap'', literally "On contemporary citizenship", published in 1844, in which he argued that universal suffrage would eventually be unavoidable.&lt;ref name=Elsevier/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;

==Political career==
{{see| Constitutional Reform of 1848}}
[[Image:TK statenpassage Thorbecke.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Thorbecke in The Hague]]
On 21 May 1844, Thorbecke was elected into the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] for [[South Holland]].&lt;ref name=Parlement/&gt; In the House, he developed into the leader of the liberal opposition and, later that year, joined forces with eight like-minded members in a vain attempt to amend the constitution in the so-called ''Voorstel der Negenmannen'' ("Proposition of the Nine Men"). Four years later, with much of Europe convulsed by the [[Revolutions of 1848]], [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] agreed upon the formation of a committee for revision of the constitution. Thorbecke was appointed as head of this committee on 17 March. The changes were virtually all created by Thorbecke, as the other members of the committee did little but approve of his proposals. The drafted constitution was somewhat reluctantly approved by the States General, and was proclaimed on 3 November 1848.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; The new constitution established civil rights and parliamentary competences, and introduced direct election of members of House of Representatives and [[ministerial responsibility]], thus limiting the power of the King and turning the country into a complete constitutional monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Turpijn |first=Jouke |url=http://www.historischnieuwsblad.nl/nl/artikel/24975/de-tweede-kamer-en-de-grondwet-van-1848.html |title=De Tweede Kamer en de grondwet van 1848 |website=Historisch Nieuwsblad |language=Dutch |date=January 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite initial reluctance, William II appointed Thorbecke as [[formateur]] in late October 1849, and his first cabinet took office on 13 November. In this cabinet, Thorbecke served as minister of the Interior and chaired the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]], thus becoming ''de facto'' [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]. Thorbecke's first cabinet passed several acts of particular importance, including the Electoral Act and the Province Act in 1850, and the Municipality Act in the following year.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=dbnl&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Molhuysen |first1=P.C. |last2=Blok |first2=P.J. |date=1918 |title=Nieuw Nederlandsch biografisch woordenboek. Deel 4 |trans-title=New Dutch biographic dictionary. Part 4 |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu04_01/molh003nieu04_01_1918.php |language=Dutch |location=Leiden |publisher=A.W. Sijthoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these successes, Thorbecke's reforms were increasingly subjected to resistance, and he was criticised for his haughtiness and his strained relationship with the King. In 1853, the [[Catholic Church]] sought to restore the episcopal hierarchy in the Netherlands. Common people, pastors and conservative notables showed resistance to this in an anti-papal movement known as the ''Aprilbeweging''. Thorbecke, who remained passive in the issue in defence of the [[separation of church and state]], was accused of catholic sympathies, and he was forced to resign.&lt;ref name=Elsevier/&gt;

Thorbecke spent nine years as leader of the opposition in the House of Representatives. He pleaded for neutrality in the [[Crimean War]] 1854, and opposed the religious nature of the Primary Education Act in 1857.&lt;ref name=dbnl/&gt;

The collapse of the conservative cabinet in 1862 brought Thorbecke back in power. On 31 January 1862, he started his second term as minister of the Interior and chairman of the Council of Minister.&lt;ref name=Parlement/&gt; Thorbecke's relationship with the King had improved because the focus of his reforms had shifted from politics to economics, and despite the increased disunity among the liberals, his cabinet lasted for four years because of the support of the Catholics. One of Thorbecke's first acts in his second term was the abolition of the governmental departments for religious services. Other notable achievements include the construction of several canals, the Secondary Education Act in May 1863, several acts on healthcare, and the municipal tax reform in 1865. The cabinet collapsed on 10 February 1866 and Thorbecke resigned after a conflict regarding criminal law in the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref name=Elsevier/&gt;&lt;ref name=dbnl/&gt;

Thorbecke returned to being leader of the opposition in the House of Representatives. In 1868, he formed the Van Bosse-Fock cabinet, but did not take part in the cabinet himself. Three years later, after this cabinet had collapsed over foreign policy, the 73-year old Thorbecke did not hesitate to start his third term.&lt;ref name=dbnl/&gt; In December 1871 fell ill, and never fully recovered. Thorbecke died at his home in [[The Hague]] on 4 June 1872, at the age of 74.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;

Hated by some (he was not a man of concessions), he is nowadays considered a towering figure in Dutch parliamentary history.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} There are three statues of Thorbecke (one in Amsterdam, one in The Hague and one in Zwolle) and a room in the Dutch parliament building is named after him.

Thorbecke wrote many articles on history and several newspaper articles (especially in the ''Journal de La Haye'') on topics of the day. He published a study on the [[philosophy of history]] (in German). All of his speeches in parliament have been published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7029">'''Krausism''' is a [[doctrine]] named after the German philosopher [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]] (1781–1832) that advocates doctrinal [[toleration|tolerance]] and [[academic freedom]] from [[dogma]].  

This philosophy was widespread in [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration Spain]], where it reached its maximum practical development thanks to the work of his promotor, [[Julián Sanz del Rio]], and the [[Institución Libre de Enseñanza|Free Institution of Education]] led by [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], and the contribution of a great jurist [[Federico Castro]]. 

One of the [[philosophers of identity]], Krause endeavoured to reconcile the ideas of a [[monotheistic]] singular [[God]] understood by [[faith]] with a [[pantheistic]] or [[empirical]] understanding of the world.

[[Divinity]], which is [[Intuition (Mind)|intuitively]] known by [[conscience]] is not a personality (which implies limitations), but an all-inclusive essence (''Wesen''), which contains the [[universe]] within itself. 

This system he called [[panentheism]], a combination of [[monotheism]] and [[pantheism]]. His theory of the world and of humanity is universal and idealistic.

==Spanish Krausism==
Spanish Krausism was a cultural movement that was rooted in the publication in the 19th century of Krause's personal version the dominant idealism, which was largely overshadowed in his native [[Germany]] by the prestige of its leading figures: [[Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and especially [[Hegel]]. 

Around 1840, a group of Spanish [[jurist]]s, notably Julián Sanz del Río were seeking a political doctrine within the [[liberalism|liberal]] tradition to initiate a regenerative process that they felt was necessary to modify and extend the philosophical concepts then in vogue. 

Coincidentally, [[Ruperto Navarro Zamorano]], a member of the Friends of Sanz del Rio, had in 1841 translated the '' Course Natural Law, or Philosophy of Law '', by [[Heinrich Ahrens]], which had previously been published in Paris in 1837.

Ahrens affirmed that the foundation of law is the "compliance": the set of external conditions upon which the fate of the rational [[Homo sapiens| man]] and [[human nature|humanity]] could be developed systematically as a universal order of piety, [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]] and [[altruism]]. 

Ahrens philosophy was developed and summarized by Kraus in the formula of "harmonious rationalism" or "[[panentheism]]" published in 1811 as  ''The Ideal of Humanity and Universal Federation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ideal of Humanity and Universal Federation
|author=Karl Christian Friedrich Krause|publisher=Bibliolife LLC/Forgotten Books (USA)|date=2012-08-01|ASIN= B008TCCEKU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ideal of Humanity and Universal Federation |url=https://www.archive.org/stream/idealhumanityan01kraugoog/idealhumanityan01kraugoog_djvu.txt|author=Karl Christian Friedrich Krause |publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark (Edinburgh)|date=1900|editor=W. Hastie D.D.|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin American Krausism==
The common language made some Latin Americans who visited or were exiled to Spain come into contact with Krause's doctrines. The most outstanding case was that of a Puerto Rican [[Eugenio María de Hostos]], who studied philosophy with Sanz del Rio. 

De Hostos' novel ''The Inner Pilgrimage of Eugenio Mara de Hostos as Seen Through Bayón''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Inner Pilgrimage of Eugenio Mara de Hostos as Seen Through Bayón|author=Eugenio Maria de Hostas|publisher=Centro Pro Hostos de Nueva York|date=2006-11-01|editor=de Hildreth N Waltzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a romantic novel in the form of a diary outlining his dream of a unified social philosophy. Hostos supports the liberation of women not as a human right, rather as a practical mechanism for greater good for the community and for the social organization. 

The Cuban writer and national hero [[José Martí]],  suffered a brutal political imprisonment with forced labor, but, despite his youth, he escaped prison for exile in Spain.  There he write letters against transatlantic military brutality of the colonial regime. He also studied law and thus encountered the philosophy and doctrines of Krause.

These two proponents,  Martí and de Hostos, although with a very different personal discourses, greatly influenced the evolution of Krausism in which the individual takes personal responsibility to act for the betterment of society. These discourses led to the so-called "Anti-Imperialist-Nationalism". This t term was first developed by Dr. [[Rafael Cuevas]], and referred to the analysis of the rebellion of Augusto C. Sandino, then fighting against the [[United States occupation of Nicaragua]]. 

Hostos and Martí became heroes and allies in their anti-colonial struggle for independence for both [[Spanish–American War|Cuba]] and [[Spanish–American War|Puerto Rico]] from Spain. Both men were initiated into [[Freemasonry]], thus confirming the influence of Freemasonry in the promotion of Krausism and vice versa. These links promoted a kind of social network to support the migration of Krausists liberal educators who reached out to Latin Americas'  liberal leaders who were seeking autonomy from colonial Spain.

Later Krausism figures included [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]], [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]], [[Alfonso Reyes]], [[Jose Enrique Rodo]], [[Alejandro Deustua]], [[Arturo Umberto Illia]] and [[Alejandro Korn]]. Reyes, for example, gave lectures at the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] in Madrid, whilst Rodo promoted esthetic concern through Krausism in his extensive correspondence with [[Leopoldo Alas]].

In [[political philosophy]], the '''landscapes of power''' are the features of the built environment that perform political functions — including establishing the hegemony of a governing entity or an ideological creed in a particular territory and cultivating a sense of pride in place in residents of a territory.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Martin, Rhys Jones, and Michael Woods. ''An Introduction to Political Geography: Space, Place and Politics''. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[Sharon Zukin]] originated the term in her book ''Landscapes of Power: From Detroit to Disney World.''&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Martin, Rhys Jones, and Michael Woods. ''An Introduction to Political Geography: Space, Place and Politics''. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004.  119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[Panopticon]] is a prime example of how the organization of physical space performs some of the functions listed above — in this case, establishing the authority over a particular area. The Panopticon is a type of prison built with a circle of cells arranged around a guard tower. The occupants of these cells are visible to the guard, but the prisoners cannot see into the tower. They must consequently behave, as they would be under surveillance, or risk the possible consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah, Matthew G. "Space and the Structuring of Disciplinary Power: An Interpretive Review." ''Geografiska Annaler'', 79, no. 3 (1997): 171-180. JSTOR, (Nov. 6, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] discussed the Panopticon in his book ''[[Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison]]''

There are 4 functions of landscape of power
1. to show who owns what
2. for nation building
3. to create identity and
4. to show who is in power.
More commonplace landscapes of power might include monuments, memorials and, as Zukin argues, even cities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Martin, Rhys Jones, and Michael Woods. ''An Introduction to Political Geography: Space, Place and Politics''. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14794">A person's '''life stance''', or '''lifestance''', is their relation with what they accept as being of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|ultimate importance]]. It involves the presuppositions and theories upon which such a stance could be made, a [[belief system]], and a commitment to potentially working it out in one's [[personal life|life]].&lt;ref&gt;
For example, as treated in ''[[The Intentional Stance]]'' by [[Daniel Dennett]] {{ISBN|0-262-54053-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It connotes an integrated perspective on reality as a whole and how to assign valuations, thus being a concept similar or equivalent to that of a [[worldview]]; with the latter word (derived from the German "Weltanschauung") being generally a more common and comprehensive term. Like the term "worldview", the term "life stance" is intended{{by whom|date=November 2015}} to be a ''shared'' label encompassing both [[religion|religious]] perspectives (for instance: "a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] life stance"  or "a&amp;nbsp;[[Christian]] life&amp;nbsp;stance" or "a [[Neopaganism|Pagan]] life stance"), as well as non-religious spiritual or philosophical alternatives (for instance: "a&amp;nbsp;[[Humanism|humanist]] life&amp;nbsp;stance" or "a [[personism|personist]] life stance" or "a [[Deep Ecology]] life stance"), without discrimination in favour of any.&lt;ref name = "Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"/&gt;

== Origins of the phrase ==
[[humanism|Humanists]] interested in educational matters apparently coined the [[neologism]] ''life stance'' in the mid-1970s; [[Harry Stopes-Roe]] of the [[Rationalist Association|Rationalist Press Association]] and [[British Humanist Association]] developed the concept originally in that context.&lt;ref&gt;
On "life stance education" see Stopes-Roe (1976), and Stopes-Roe (1983). Compare with the advocacy of "Education in Life Stances" in Cox (1975), on which also see Greer (1985, pp.  16–17)). The British Humanist Association pamphlet, ''Objective, Fair and Balanced'' (1975), includes the text of a letter by Stopes-Roe, printed in the ''Times Educational Supplement'' of 12 July 1974, which refers to "stances for living". It also cites the City of Birmingham's ''Agreed Syllabus of Religious Education'', dated 7 May 1974: "it introduces the new term "stance for living". (British Humanist Association, 1975, p. 15). For the related "life stance education" offered to non-religious pupils in Finland, see Slotte (2008).
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term originally arose in the context of debates over the controversial&lt;ref&gt;
Barnes (2008, p. 75), notes that the controversy reached Parliament.  Hull (1984, p. 111) notes that "an attempt was made in the spring of 1976 to introduce a Private Members Bill into the House of Commons which would have replaced religious education by 'Education in Stances for Living'". The Bill was published in "Objective, Fair and Balanced – a new law for religion in education", written by Harry Stopes-Roe and David Pollock for the British Humanist Association (1975)
&lt;/ref&gt; content of the City of [[Birmingham| Birmingham's]] ''Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education'', 1975.  That document referred to "non-religious stances for living". According to Barnes:

{{quote|It was the first syllabus to abandon the aim of Christian nurture and to embrace a multi-faith, phenomenological model of religious education; and it was also the first syllabus to require a ''systematic'' study of non-religious 'stances for living', such as Humanism, and for such study to begin in the primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes (2008, p. 75)
&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In the late 1980s Harry Stopes-Roe initiated a successful campaign for the adoption of the term by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and by other organisations (see also his comments quoted below on its provenance).&lt;ref&gt;
Stopes-Roe's advocacy of the term outside the literature of religious education was first published as Stopes-Roe (1987), but the article was in circulation at a Board meeting of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] in October 1987 (See Walter 1988a, p. 4). The article was reprinted in ''New Humanist'' (Stopes Roe 1988a) and Kurtz (1989). Stopes-Roe revisited the subject in Stopes-Roe (1996), and wrote the article on "Life stance" for the ''New Encyclopedia of Unbelief'' (Stopes-Roe 2007). See also the statement "[http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more Humanism is eight letters, no more]", signed by [[H.J. Blackham|Harold Blackham]], [[Levi Fragell]], [[Corliss Lamont]], [[Harry Stopes-Roe]], and [[Rob Tielman]].
&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was not an uncontroversial proposal among humanists.&lt;ref name = "needforlifestance"&gt;Stopes-Roe (1988a, p. 21) commented that "I have found the degree of opposition to the term "life stance" among Humanists more surprising than the religionist's objection." See also the overview of the debate between Walter (1988a and 1988b) and Stopes-Roe (1988a and 1988b) in Fowler (1999 [https://books.google.com/books?id=z5k5A0_nFogC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22life%20stance%22&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22life%20stance%22&amp;f=false pp. 3–4]).
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced as part of an attempt to establish a clear identity for Humanism, in order to gain recognition and respect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more See "Humanism is eight letters, no more"]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stopes-Roe:

{{quote|"Life stance" is an expression that has been current in Britain for more than ten years and is now gaining acceptance worldwide, to describe what is good in both Humanism and religion – without being encumbered by what is bad in religion.&lt;ref&gt;Stopes-Roe (1988a, p.19)
&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Definition==

Harry Stopes-Roe, who fought for the term's acceptance by the [[Humanism|Humanist]] movement, defined "life stance" as follows:

{{quote|"Life stance" - The style and content of an individual's or a community's relationship with that which is of ultimate importance; the presuppositions and commitments of this, and the consequences for living which flow from it. (Each individual or community hopes that it has come to a good and well-founded relationship, but the word is usually used without implying that this really is so).|[[Harry Stopes-Roe]]&lt;ref name="Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"&gt;Stopes-Roe (1988a, p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The British Humanist Association, drawing in part on jurisprudence related to the term "religion or belief" in the European Convention on Human Rights, has put forward a more analytical definition:

{{quote|A collective belief that attains a sufficient level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance and that relates the nature of life and the world to morality, values and/or the way its believers should live.|[[British Humanist Association]]&lt;ref&gt;
Memorandum from the BHA to the Charity Commission on Religion and Non-Religious Beliefs in Charity Law, August 2007: see http://www.humanism.org.uk/documents/3917&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Orthography==
A life stance may be distinguished from general support of a cause by [[capitalization]] of the first letter. For instance, the life stance of Humanism is distinguished from [[humanism]] generally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/DoerrND02.htm Humanism Unmodified] By Edd Doerr. Published in the ''Humanist'' (November/December 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Many life stances may contain humanism to a greater or lesser extent as [[instrumental value]] in order to fulfill their own chosen [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value(s)]]. However, Humanism regards it as having intrinsic value.

Not all life stances use this orthography.

==Spectrum==
The term was intended to be a ''shared'' label encompassing both [[religion]]s and alternatives to religion, without discrimination in favour of either.&lt;ref name="Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"/&gt;

A life stance differs from a [[World view|worldview]] or a belief system in that the term ''life stance'' emphasizes a focus on what is of ultimate importance. Life stance differs from [[eupraxsophy]] in that the latter typically implies a strictly non-theistic outlook, whereas a life stance can be theistic or non-theistic, supernaturalistic or naturalistic.

===Religious life stances===
{{Main|Religion}}
A ''religion'' is a set of beliefs and practices, often centered upon specific supernatural and/or moral claims about [[reality]], the [[cosmos]], and [[human nature]], and often codified as [[prayer]], [[ritual]], and [[law]].  Religion also encompasses ancestral or cultural [[tradition]]s, writings, history, and [[mythology]], as well as personal [[faith]] and [[mysticism|mystic experience]]. The term "religion" refers to both the personal practices related to communal faith and to group rituals and communication stemming from shared conviction.

In the frame of [[European religious thought]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] as cited in {{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11183/Sacred-Profane-Durkheim-s-Critics.html |title=Sacred and Profane - Durkheim's Critics |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; religions present a common quality, the "hallmark of patriarchal religious thought": the division of the world in two comprehensive domains, [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|one sacred, the other profane]].&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim 1976, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is often described as a communal system for the coherence of belief focusing on a system of thought, unseen being, person, or object, that is considered to be [[supernatural]], sacred, [[Divinity|divine]], or of the highest [[truth]].  
[[Moral code]]s, practices, values, institutions, tradition, [[philosophy]], rituals, and [[scripture]]s are often traditionally associated with the core belief. Religion is also often described as a "[[way of life]]".

===Non-religious life stances===
{{Further|Irreligion|Secular religion}}
Alternatives to religion include life stances based on [[atheism]], [[agnosticism]], [[deism]], [[Religious skepticism|skepticism]], [[freethought]], [[pantheism]], [[secular humanism]], [[spiritual but not religious]] (SBNR), [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], [[existentialism]], modern incarnations of [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]], or general [[secularism]].

====Humanism====

[[Humanism]] is an example of life stance which may be considered to be religious (usually in a non-theistic, ethical sense) or non-religious or anti-religious. One of Stopes-Roe's reasons for advocating the adoption of "life stance" as a label for the Humanist movement, was his hope that it would end the arguments between the different sides as to how best to characterise their position (note that Stopes-Roe uses the term "god-religious" to distinguish theists from non-theists in what follows):

{{quote|Humanists are divided into two camps... according to how they respond to the word "religion". Do they... respond negatively or positively? The ferocity of the antipathy on the one hand, and the power of the concern on the other, that is generated by this word quite obliterates reasoned discussion of many substantial and important questions on how we should develop Humanism. Likewise, our discussions with the god-religious are confused and frustrated. We need a new term for the idea and ideal of religion, opened out so that it is not discriminatory. Let this be "life stance". Could we, perhaps, bury the hatchet of "religion" and work together?&lt;ref name="Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"/&gt;}}

Bill Cooke comments:
{{quote|Harry Stopes-Roe's contribution is significant because it makes clear humanism's value as a legitimate system of belief, without it being a pseudo-religion.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke 2003 (p. 223)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Values and purposes==

Different life stances differ in what they hold as [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]s and [[purposes in life]].

{{Philosophy sidebar}}

This is a list of some of the major '''[[List of unsolved problems|unsolved problems]] in [[philosophy]]'''. Clearly, unsolved philosophical problems exist in the lay sense (e.g. "[[Meaning of life|What is the meaning of life?]]", "[[Origin of life|Where did we come from?]]", "[[Reality|What is reality?]]", etc.). However, professional philosophers generally accord serious philosophical problems specific names or questions, which indicate a particular method of attack or line of reasoning. As a result, broad and untenable topics become manageable. It would therefore be beyond the scope of this article to categorize "life" (and similar vague categories) as an unsolved philosophical problem.

==Aesthetics==

===Essentialism===
{{Main|Essentialism}}{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
In art, essentialism is the idea that each [[List of artistic mediums|medium]] has its own particular strengths and weaknesses, contingent on its mode of communication. A [[chase scene]], for example, may be appropriate for [[film|motion pictures]], but poorly realized in [[poetry]], because the essential components of the poetic medium are ill suited to convey the information of a chase scene. This idea may be further refined, and it may be said that the [[haiku]] is a poor vehicle for describing a lover's affection, as opposed to the [[sonnet]]. Essentialism is attractive to artists, because it not only delineates the role of art and media, but also prescribes a method for evaluating art (quality correlates to the degree of [[organic form]]). However, considerable criticism has been leveled at essentialism, which has been unable to formally define organic form or for that matter, medium. What, after all, is the medium of poetry? If it is language, how is this distinct from the medium of prose fiction? Is the distinction really a distinction in medium or [[genre]]? Questions about organic form, its definition, and its role in art remain controversial. Generally, working artists accept some form of the concept of organic form, whereas philosophers have tended to regard it as vague and irrelevant.

===Art objects===
 {{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
This problem originally arose from the practice rather than theory of art. [[Marcel Duchamp]], in the 20th century, challenged conventional notions of what "art" is, placing ordinary objects in galleries to prove that the context rather than content of an art piece determines what art is. In music, [[John Cage]] followed up on Duchamp's ideas, asserting that the term "music" applied simply to the sounds heard within a fixed interval of time.

While it is easy to dismiss these assertions, further investigation {{who|date=March 2011}} shows that Duchamp and Cage are not so easily disproved. For example, if a pianist plays a [[Chopin]] [[etude]], but his finger slips missing one note, is it still the Chopin etude or a new piece of music entirely? Most people would agree that it is still a Chopin etude (albeit with a missing note), which brings into play the [[Sorites paradox]], mentioned below. If one accepts that this is not a fundamentally changed work of music, however, is one implicitly agreeing with Cage that it is merely the duration and context of musical performance, rather than the precise content, which determines what music is? Hence, the question is what the criteria for art objects are and whether these criteria are entirely context-dependent.

==Philosophy of language==

===Counterfactuals===
{{Main|Counterfactual conditional}}
A counterfactual statement is a conditional statement with a false antecedent. For example, the statement "If [[Joseph Swan]] had not invented the modern [[incandescent light bulb]], then someone else would have invented it anyway" is a counterfactual, because in fact, Joseph Swan invented the modern incandescent light bulb. The most immediate task concerning counterfactuals is that of explaining their truth-conditions. As a start, one might assert that background information is assumed when stating and interpreting counterfactual conditionals and that this background information is just every true statement about the world as it is (pre-counterfactual). In the case of the Swan statement, we have certain trends in the history of technology, the utility of artificial light, the discovery of electricity, and so on. We quickly encounter an error with this initial account: among the true statements will be "Joseph Swan did invent the modern incandescent light bulb." From the conjunction of this statement (call it "S") and the antecedent of the counterfactual ("¬S"), we can derive any conclusion, and we have the unwelcome result that any statement follows from any counterfactual (see the [[principle of explosion]]). [[Nelson Goodman]] takes up this and related issues in his seminal [[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]; and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s influential articulation of [[possible world]] theory is popularly applied in efforts to solve it.

==Epistemology==
Epistemological problems are concerned with the nature, scope and limitations of knowledge.
[[Epistemology]] may also be described as the study of knowledge.

===Gettier problem===
{{Main|Gettier problem}}
[[Plato]] suggests, in his ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (210a) and ''[[Meno]]'' (97a–98b), that "knowledge" may be defined as justified true belief. For over two millennia, this definition of knowledge has been reinforced and accepted by subsequent philosophers. An item of information's justifiability, truth, and belief  have been seen as the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge..

In 1963, [[Edmund Gettier]] published an article in the journal "[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]]", a peer reviewed academic journal of philosophy, entitled "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?" which offered instances of justified true belief that do not conform to the generally understood meaning of "knowledge." Gettier's examples hinged on instances of [[Epistemology|epistemic]] luck: cases where a person appears to have sound evidence for a proposition, and that proposition is in fact true, but the apparent evidence is not causally related to the proposition's truth.

In response to Gettier's article, numerous philosophers{{who|date=July 2015}} have offered modified criteria for "knowledge." There is no general consensus to adopt any of the modified definitions yet proposed. Finally, if [[infallibilism]] is true, that would seem to definitively solve the Gettier problem for good--the idea is that knowledge requires certainty, such that, certainty is what serves to bridge the gap so that we arrive at knowledge, which means we would have an adequate definition of knowledge. However, infallibilism is rejected by the overwhelming majority of philosophers/epistemologists, even though it would solve the Gettier problem (if true).

===Problem of the criterion===
{{Main|Problem of the criterion}}

Overlooking for a moment the complications posed by Gettier problems, philosophy has essentially continued to operate on the principle that knowledge is justified true belief. The obvious question that this definition entails is how one can know whether one's justification is sound. One must therefore provide a justification for the justification. That justification itself requires justification, and the questioning continues interminably.

The conclusion is that no one can truly have knowledge of anything, since it is, due to this infinite regression, impossible to satisfy the justification element. In practice, this has caused little concern to philosophers, since the demarcation between a reasonably exhaustive investigation and superfluous investigation is usually clear.

Others argue for forms of [[coherentist]] systems, e.g. [[Foundherentism|Susan Haack]]. Recent work by [[Peter D. Klein]]&lt;ref&gt;Klein, P. D., “Human Knowledge and the Infinite Progress of Reasoning,” Philosophical Studies, 134. 1, 2007, 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; views knowledge as essentially defeasible. Therefore, an [[infinite regress]] is unproblematic, since any known fact may be overthrown on sufficiently in-depth investigation.

===Molyneux problem===
{{Main|Molyneux's problem}}

The Molyneux problem dates back to the following question posed by [[William Molyneux]] to [[John Locke]] in the 17th century: if a man born blind, and able to distinguish by touch between a [[cube]] and a [[globe]], were made to see, could he now tell by sight which was the cube and which the globe, before he touched them? The problem raises fundamental issues in [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of mind]], and was widely discussed after Locke included it in the second edition of his ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke|Locke, John]]. ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', Book 2, Chapter 9.
{{quote|"I shall here insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious promoter of real knowledge, the learned and worthy Mr. Molyneux, which he was pleased to send me in a letter some months since; and it is this:—"Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which the sphere. Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man be made to see: quaere, whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube?" To which the acute and judicious proposer answers, "Not. For, though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, how a cube affects his touch, yet he has not yet obtained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so; or that a protuberant angle in the cube, that pressed his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube."—I agree with this thinking gentleman, whom I am proud to call my friend, in his answer to this problem; and am of opinion that the blind man, at first sight, would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe, which the cube, whilst he only saw them; though he could unerringly name them by his touch, and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt. This I have set down, and leave with my reader, as an occasion for him to consider how much he may be beholden to experience, improvement, and acquired notions, where he thinks he had not the least use of, or help from them. And the rather, because this observing gentleman further adds, that "having, upon the occasion of my book, proposed this to divers very ingenious men, he hardly ever met with one that at first gave the answer to it which he thinks true, till by hearing his reasons they were convinced."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar problem was also addressed earlier in the 12th century by [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer), in his [[philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''Philosophus Autodidactus''). His version of the problem, however, dealt mainly with colors rather than shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik [[Ibn Tufayl]] and Léon Gauthier (1981), ''Risalat Hayy ibn Yaqzan'', p. 5, Editions de la Méditerranée.
{{quote|"If you want a comparison that will make you clearly grasp the difference between the [[perception]], such as it is understood by that sect [the Sufis] and the perception as others understand it, imagine a person born [[Blindness|blind]], endowed however with a happy natural [[temperament]], with a lively and firm [[intelligence]], a sure [[memory]], a straight sprite, who grew up from the time he was an infant in a city where he never stopped learning, by means of the [[sense]]s he did dispose of, to know the inhabitants individually, the numerous species of beings, living as well as non-living, there, the streets and sidestreets, the houses, the steps, in such a manner as to be able to cross the city without a guide, and to recognize immediately those he met; the [[color]]s alone would not be known to him except by the names they bore, and by certain definitions that designated them. Suppose that he had arrived at this point and suddenly, his eyes were opened, he recovered his view, and he crosses the entire city, making a tour of it. He would find no object different from the idea he had made of it; he would encounter nothing he didn’t recognize, he would find the colors conformable to the descriptions of them that had been given to him; and in this there would only be two new important things for him, one the consequence of the other: a clarity, a greater [[brightness]], and a great voluptuousness."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lobel, Diana. ''A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Baḥya Ibn Paqūda's Duties of the Heart'', [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], 2006, p.24. {{ISBN|0-8122-3953-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern science may now have the tools necessary to test this problem in controlled environments. The resolution of this problem is in some sense provided by the study of human subjects who gain vision after extended congenital blindness. In one such study, subjects were unable to immediately link objects known by touch to their visual appearance, and only gradually developed the ability to do so over a period of days or months. &lt;ref name=Held2011&gt;

===Münchhausen trilemma===
The [[Münchhausen trilemma]], also called [[Agrippa the Skeptic|Agrippa]]'s trilemma, purports that it is impossible to prove any certain [[truth]] even in fields such as logic and mathematics. According to this argument, the proof of any theory rests either on [[circular reasoning]], infinite regress, or unproven [[axiom]]s.

===Qualia===
{{See also|Distinguishing blue from green in language}}{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
The question hinges on whether [[color]] is a product of the mind or an inherent property of objects. While most philosophers will agree that color assignment corresponds to spectra of light [[frequencies]], it is not at all clear whether the particular psychological phenomena of color are imposed on these visual signals by the mind, or whether such [[qualia]] are somehow naturally associated with their [[noumenon|noumena]]. Another way to look at this question is to assume two people ("Fred" and "George" for the sake of convenience) see colors differently. That is, when Fred sees the sky, his mind interprets this light signal as blue. He calls the sky "blue." However, when George sees the sky, his mind assigns green to that light frequency. If Fred were able to step into George's mind, he would be amazed that George saw green skies. However, George has learned to associate the word "blue" with what his mind sees as green, and so he calls the sky "blue", because for him the color green has the name "blue." The question is whether blue must be blue for all people, or whether the [[perception]] of that particular color is assigned by the mind.

This extends to all areas of the physical reality, where the outside world we perceive is merely a representation of what is impressed upon the senses. The objects we see are in truth wave-emitting (or reflecting) objects which the brain shows to the conscious self in various forms and colors. Whether the colors and forms experienced perfectly match between person to person, may never be known. That people can communicate accurately shows that the order and proportionality in which experience is interpreted is generally reliable. Thus one's reality is, at least, compatible to another person's in terms of structure and ratio.

==Ethics==

===Moral luck===
{{Main|Moral luck}}
The problem of moral luck is that some people are born into, live within, and experience circumstances that seem to change their moral culpability when all other factors remain the same.

For instance, a case of ''circumstantial moral luck:'' a poor person is born into a poor family, and has no other way to feed himself so he steals his food. Another person, born into a very wealthy family, does very little but has ample food and does not need to steal to get it. Should the poor person be more morally blameworthy than the rich person? After all, it is not this person's fault that they were born into such circumstances, but a matter of "luck".

A related case is ''resultant moral luck.'' For instance, two persons behave in a morally culpable way, such as driving carelessly, but end up producing unequal amounts of harm: one strikes a pedestrian and kills him, while the other does not. That one driver caused a death and the other did not is no part of the drivers' intentional actions; yet most observers would likely ascribe greater blame to the driver who killed (compare [[consequentialism]] and
[[choice]]).

The fundamental question of moral luck is how our moral responsibility is changed by factors over which we have no control.

===Moral knowledge===
Are moral facts possible, what do they consist in, and how do we come to know them? Rightness and wrongness seem strange kinds of entities, and different from the usual properties of things in the world, such as wetness, being red, or solidity. Richmond Campbell&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/moral-epistemology/ Campbell, Richmond, "Moral Epistemology", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; has outlined these kinds of issues in his encyclopedia article [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-epistemology/#TheFac Moral Epistemology].

In particular, he considers three alternative explanations of moral facts as: theological, (supernatural, the commands of God); non-natural (based on intuitions); or simply natural properties (such as leading to pleasure or to happiness). There are cogent arguments against each of these alternative accounts, he claims, and there has not been any fourth alternative proposed. So the existence of moral knowledge and moral facts remains dubious and in need of further investigation. But moral knowledge supposedly already plays an important part in our everyday thinking, in our legal systems  and criminal investigations.

==Philosophy of mathematics==

===Mathematical objects===
{{Main|Mathematical structure}}
What are [[number]]s, [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Fixed point (mathematics)|points]], etc.? Are they real objects or are they simply relationships that necessarily exist in all structures? Although many disparate views exist regarding what a mathematical object is, the discussion may be roughly partitioned into two opposing schools of thought: [[platonism]], which asserts that mathematical objects are real, and [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]], which asserts that mathematical objects are merely [[Formal system|formal constructions]]. This dispute may be better understood when considering specific examples, such as the "[[continuum hypothesis]]". The continuum hypothesis has been proven independent of the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF axioms]] of [[set theory]], so within that system, the proposition can neither be proven true nor proven false. A formalist would therefore say that the continuum hypothesis is neither true nor false, unless you further refine the context of the question. A platonist, however, would assert that there either does or does not exist a transfinite set with a [[cardinality]] less than the [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]] but greater than any [[countable set]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} So, regardless of whether it has been [[Mathematical proof|proven]] unprovable, the platonist would argue that an answer nonetheless does exist.

==Metaphysics==

===Why there is something rather than nothing===
{{Main|Problem of why there is anything at all}}
The question about why is there anything at all instead of nothing has been raised or commented on by philosophers including [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;"''why is there something rather than nothing?''", section 7, [https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwor00leibuoft "Principles of Nature and Grace"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Heidegger]] − who called it the fundamental question of [[metaphysics]]&lt;!--"Warum ist überhaupt Seiendes und nicht vielmehr Nichts?"--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fundamental Question|url=https://www.hedweb.com/witherall/existence.htm|website=www.hedweb.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Manfred|title=Wittgenstein und Heidegger: Die letzten Philosophen|publisher=Rowohlt Verlag|isbn=9783644045118|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=JUiFDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP166|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; − and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;"Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is." [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] 6.44 https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5740/5740-pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The question is general, rather than concerning the existence of anything specific such as the [[universe]]/[[multiverse|s]], the [[Big Bang]], [[mathematics|mathematical laws]], [[physical law]]s, [[time]], [[consciousness]] or [[God]].

===Problem of universals===
{{Main|Problem of universals}}

===Principle of individuation===
{{Main|Principle of individuation}}
Related to the quarrel of universals, the principle of individuation is what individuates universals.

===Sorites paradox===
{{Main|Sorites paradox}}
Otherwise known as the "[[paradox]] of the heap", the question regards how one defines a "thing." Is a bale of hay still a bale of hay if you remove one straw? If so, is it still a bale of hay if you remove another straw? If you continue this way, you will eventually deplete the entire bale of hay, and the question is: at what point is it no longer a bale of hay? While this may initially seem like a superficial problem, it penetrates to fundamental issues regarding how we define objects. This is similar to [[Ship of Theseus|Theseus' paradox]] and the [[Continuum fallacy]].

=== Theseus' Paradox ===
Also known as the Ship of Theseus, this is a classical paradox on the first branch of metaphysics, Ontology (philosophy of existence &amp; identity). The paradox runs thus:              There used to be the great ship of Theseus which was made out of, say, 100 parts. Each part has a single corresponding replacement part in the ship's storeroom. The ship then sets out on a voyage. The ship sails through monster-infested waters, and every day, a single piece is damaged and has to be replaced. On the hundredth day, the ship sails back to port, the voyage completed. Through the course of this journey, everything on the ship has been replaced. So, is the ship sailing back home the ship of Theseus or no?

If yes, consider this: the broken original parts are repaired and re-assembled. Is this the ship of Theseus or no?                                                                                                               If no, let us name the ship that sails into port "The Argo". At what point (during the journey) did the crew of the Theseus become the crew of the Argo? And what ship is sailing on the fiftieth day? If both the ships trade a single piece, are they still the same ships?

This paradox is a minor variation of the Sorites Paradox above, and has many variations itself. Both sides of the paradox have convincing arguments and counter-arguments, though no one is close to proving it completely.

===Material implication===
{{Main|Material conditional}}
People have a pretty clear idea what if-then means. In [[formal logic]] however, material implication defines if-then, which is not consistent with the common understanding of conditionals. In formal logic, the statement "If today is Saturday, then 1+1=2" is true. However, '1+1=2' is true regardless of the content of the antecedent; a causal or meaningful relation is not required. The statement as a whole must be true, because 1+1=2 cannot be false. (If it could, then on a given Saturday, so could the statement). Formal logic has shown itself extremely useful in formalizing argumentation, philosophical reasoning, and mathematics. The discrepancy between material implication and the general conception of conditionals however is a topic of intense investigation: whether it is an inadequacy in formal logic, an ambiguity of ordinary [[language]], or as championed by [[Paul Grice|H.P. Grice]], that no discrepancy exists.

==Philosophy of mind==

===Mind–body problem===
The [[mind–body problem]] is the problem of determining the relationship between the human body and the human mind. Philosophical positions on this question are generally predicated on either a reduction of one to the other, or a belief in the discrete coexistence of both. This problem is usually exemplified by Descartes, who championed a dualistic picture. The problem therein is to establish how the mind and body communicate in a [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] framework. [[Neurobiology]] and [[emergence]] have further complicated the problem by allowing the material functions of the mind to be a representation of some further aspect emerging from the mechanistic properties of the brain. The brain essentially stops generating conscious thought during deep sleep; the ability to restore such a pattern remains a mystery to science and is a subject of current research (see also [[neurophilosophy]]).

===Cognition and AI===
This problem actually defines a field, however its pursuits are specific and easily stated. Firstly, what are the criteria for [[intelligence]]? What are the necessary components for defining [[consciousness]]? Secondly, how can an outside observer test for these criteria? The "[[Turing Test]]" is often cited as a prototypical test of intelligence, although it is almost universally regarded as insufficient. It involves a conversation between a sentient being and a machine, and if the being can't tell he is talking to a machine, it is considered intelligent. A well trained machine, however, could theoretically "parrot" its way through the test. This raises the corollary question of whether it is possible to [[artificial intelligence|artificially create consciousness]] (usually in the context of [[computer]]s or [[machine]]s), and of how to tell a well-trained mimic from a sentient entity.

Important thought in this area includes most notably: [[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room|Chinese Room]], [[Hubert Dreyfus]]' non-cognitivist critique, as well as [[Hilary Putnam]]'s work on [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]].

A related field is the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]], which addresses such problems as the existence of moral personhood of AIs, the possibility of moral obligations ''to'' AIs (for instance, the right of a possibly sentient computer system to not be turned off), and the question of making AIs that behave ethically towards humans and others.

===Hard problem of consciousness===
The [[hard problem of consciousness]] is the question of what consciousness is and why we have consciousness as opposed to being [[philosophical zombies]]. The adjective "hard" is to contrast with the "easy" consciousness problems, which seek to explain the mechanisms of consciousness ("why" versus "how", or [[final cause]] versus [[efficient cause]]). The hard problem of consciousness is questioning whether all beings undergo an experience of consciousness rather than questioning the neurological makeup of beings.

==Philosophy of science==

===Problem of induction===
{{Main|Problem of induction}}
Intuitively, it seems to be the case that we know certain things with absolute, complete, utter, unshakable certainty. For example, if you travel to the Arctic and touch an iceberg, you know that it would feel cold. These things that we know from experience are known through induction. The problem of induction in short; (1) any inductive statement (like the sun will rise tomorrow) can only be deductively shown if one assumes that nature is uniform. (2) the only way to show that nature is uniform is by using induction. Thus induction cannot be justified deductively.

===Demarcation problem===
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
‘The problem of demarcation’ is an expression introduced by [[Karl Popper]] to refer to ‘the problem of finding a criterion which would enable us to distinguish between the empirical sciences on the one hand, and mathematics and logic as well as "metaphysical" systems on the other’. Popper attributes this problem to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Although Popper mentions mathematics and logic, other writers focus on distinguishing [[science]] from [[metaphysics]].

===Realism===
{{Main|Scientific realism}}
Does a world independent of human beliefs and representations exist? Is such a world empirically accessible, or would such a world be forever beyond the bounds of human sense and hence unknowable? Can human activity and agency change the objective structure of the world? These questions continue to receive much attention in the philosophy of science. A clear "yes" to the first question is a hallmark of the scientific realism perspective. Philosophers such as [[Bas van Fraassen]] have important and interesting answers to the second question. In addition to the realism vs. [[empiricism]] axis of debate, there is a realism vs. [[social constructivism]] axis which heats many academic passions. With respect to the third question, [[Paul Boghossian]]'s {{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Philosophy/Epistemology/~~/dmlldz11c2EmY2k9OTc4MDE5OTI4NzE4NQ== |title=Fear of Knowledge: Against Relativism and Constructivism |author= |year=2006 |work= |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate= }} is a powerful critique of social constructivism, for instance. Ian Hacking's ''The Social Construction of What?'' (Harvard UP, 2000) constitutes a more moderate critique of constructivism, which usefully disambiguates confusing polysemy of the term "constructivism."

{{Utilitarianism |expanded=Problems}}

The '''mere addition paradox''', also known as the '''repugnant conclusion''', is a problem in [[ethics]], identified by [[Derek Parfit]] and discussed in his book ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1984). The paradox identifies the mutual incompatibility of four intuitively compelling assertions about the relative value of populations.

==The paradox==

Consider the four populations depicted in the following diagram: A, A+, B− and B. Each bar represents a distinct group of people, with the group's size represented by the bar's width and the [[happiness]] of each of the group's members represented by the bar's height. Unlike A and B, A+ and B− are complex populations, each comprising two distinct groups of people.

[[Image:MereAddition.svg|center]]

How do these populations compare in value? 

Parfit observes that i) A+ seems no worse than A. This is because the people in A are no worse-off in A+, while the additional people who exist in A+ are better off in A+ compared to A (if it is stipulated that their lives are good enough that living them is better than not existing).

Next, Parfit suggests that ii) B− seems better than A+. This is because B− has greater total and average happiness than A+.

Then, he notes that iii) B seems equally as good as B−, as the only difference between B− and B is that the two groups in B− are merged to form one group in B.

Together, these three comparisons entail that B is better than A. However, Parfit observes that when we directly compare A (a population with high average happiness) and B (a population with lower average happiness, but more total happiness because of its larger population), it may seem that B can be worse than A.

Thus, there is a paradox. The following intuitively plausible claims are jointly incompatible: (a) that A+ is no worse than A, (b) that B− is better than A+, (c) that B− is equally as good as B, and (d) that B can be worse than A.

==Criticisms and responses==
Some scholars, such as [[Larry Temkin]] and Stuart Rachels, argue that the apparent inconsistency between the four claims just outlined relies on the assumption that the "better than" relation is [[Transitive relation|transitive]]. We may resolve the inconsistency, thus, by rejecting the assumption. On this view, from the fact that A+ is no worse than A and that B− is better than A+ it simply does not follow that B− is better than A.

[[Torbjörn Tännsjö]] argues that the intuition that B is worse than A is wrong. While the lives of those in B are worse than those in A, there are more of them and thus the collective value of B is greater than A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torbjorn|first=Tannsjo|date=January 2009|title=Why We Ought to Accept the Repugnant Conclusion|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/utilitas/article/why-we-ought-to-accept-the-repugnant-conclusion/F60DB3A1B9CA4460650EA5DF9AA0540D|journal=Utilitas|volume=14|pages=|doi=10.1017/S0953820800003642|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Huemer]] also argues that the repugnant conclusion is not repugnant and that normal intuition is wrong.&lt;ref name="huemer"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/heathwood/6100/Huemer%20-%20Defence%20of%20Repugnance.pdf| title=In Defence of Repugnance| first=Michael| last=Huemer| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109034025/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/heathwood/6100/Huemer%20-%20Defence%20of%20Repugnance.pdf| archivedate=2016-01-09| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the above discussion fails to appreciate the true source of repugnance. On the face of it, it may not be absurd to think that B is better than A. Suppose, then, that B is in fact better than A, as Huemer argues. It follows that this revised intuition must hold in subsequent iterations of the original steps. For example, the next iteration would add even more people to B+, and then take the average of the total happiness, resulting in C-. If these steps are repeated over and over, the eventual result will be Z, a massive population with the minimum level of average happiness; this would be a population in which every member is leading a life barely worth living. Z is the repugnant conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reasons and Persons|last=Parfit|first=Derek|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1984|isbn=019824908X|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative usage==
An alternative use of the term ''mere addition paradox'' was presented in a paper by Hassoun in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/2010/en_GB/wp2010-120/ |title=Another Mere Addition Paradox? Some Reflections on Variable Population Poverty Measurement |publisher=UNU-WIDER |date=November 2010 |accessdate=31 March 2015 |isbn=978-92-9230-358-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies paradoxical reasoning that occurs when certain statistical measures are used to calculate results over a population. For example, if a group of 100 people together control $100 worth of resources, the average wealth per capita is $1. If a single rich person then arrives with 1 million dollars, then the total group of 101 people controls $1,000,100, making average wealth per capita $9,901, implying a drastic shift away from poverty even though nothing has changed for the original 100 people. Hassoun defines a ''no mere addition axiom'' to be used for judging such statistical measures: "merely adding a rich person to a population should not decrease poverty" (although acknowledging that in actual practice adding rich people to a population may provide some benefit to the whole population).

This same argument can be generalized to many cases where proportional statistics are used: for example, a game sold on a download service may be considered a failure if less than 20% of those who download the demo then purchase the game. Thus, if 10,000 people download the demo of a game and 2,000 buy it, the game is a borderline success; however, it would be rendered a failure by an extra 500 people downloading the demo and not buying, even though this "mere addition" changes nothing with regard to income or consumer satisfaction from the previous situation.

'''Moral luck''' describes circumstances whereby a [[moral agent]] is assigned moral [[blame]] or [[praise]] for an action or its consequences even if it is clear that said agent did not have full control over either the action or its consequences. This term, introduced by [[Bernard Williams]], has been developed, along with its significance to a coherent moral theory, by Williams and [[Thomas Nagel]] in their respective essays on the subject.

==Responsibility and voluntarism==
Broadly speaking, human beings tend to correlate, at least [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitively]], responsibility and voluntary action. Thus, the most blame is assigned to persons for their actions and the consequences they [[logical consequence|entail]] when we have good cause to believe that both:
* the action was performed voluntarily and without outside coercion
* the agent understood the full range of the consequences of their decisions and actions, as could have reasonably been foreseen either at or prior to the time that the action was performed.

Conversely, there is a tendency to be much more sympathetic to those who satisfy any of the following conditions:
* the agent was coerced to perform the action
* the agent performed the action through accident and without any fault or negligence of their own
* at the time of their actions, the agent did not know, and had no way of knowing, the consequences that their actions would bring

Parenthetically, the above criteria do not correlate exactly with moral praise – while it may be true that one can, and should assign a good deal of [[moral praise]] to those who had performed a good action, or an action entailing good consequences, completely on their own volition and uncoerced, it is debatable that the same distinction holds for involuntary actions that happened to turn out well or happened to produce good outcomes.

This correlation between responsibility and voluntary action is acceptable to most people on an intuitive level; indeed, this correlation is echoed in American and European law: for this reason, for example, [[manslaughter]], or killing in self-defense carries a significantly different type of legal punishment (i.e., formalized [[moral blame]]) than premeditated murder.

==The problem of moral luck==
Given the notion of equating moral responsibility with voluntary action, however, moral luck leads to counterintuitive solutions. This is illustrated by an example of a traffic accident. Driver A, in a moment of inattention, runs a red light as a child is crossing the street. Driver A tries to avoid hitting the child but fails and the child dies. Driver B also runs a red light, but no one is crossing and only gets a traffic ticket. 

If a bystander is asked to morally evaluate Drivers A and B, they may assign Driver A more moral blame than Driver B because Driver A's course of action resulted in a death. However, there are no differences in the controllable actions performed by Drivers A and B. The only disparity is an external uncontrollable event. If it is given that moral responsibility should only be relevant when the agent voluntarily performed or failed to perform some action, Drivers A and B should be blamed equally. This may be intuitively problematic, as one situation resulted in a death.

==Four types of moral luck==
Thomas Nagel (1979) identified four kinds of moral luck in his essay. The kind most relevant to the above example is "resultant moral luck".

===Resultant moral luck (consequential)===
Resultant moral luck concerns the consequences of actions and situations. In the above example, both drivers were affected by resultant moral luck in that a particular set of circumstances turned out in two different ways: in one situation, a pedestrian appeared on the road; in the other, the pedestrian did not.

===Circumstantial moral luck===
Circumstantial moral luck concerns the surroundings of the moral agent. The best-known example is provided in Nagel's essay. Consider [[Nazism|Nazi]] followers and supporters in [[Hitler]]'s [[Germany]]. They were and are worthy of moral blame either for committing morally reprehensible deeds or for allowing them to occur without making efforts to oppose them. But, if in 1929, those people were moved to some other country, away from the coming hostilities by their employers, it is quite possible that they would have led very different lives, and we could not assign the same amount of moral blame to them. It is down, then, to the luck of the circumstances in which they find themselves.

===Constitutive moral luck===
Constitutive moral luck concerns the personal character of a moral agent. There can be little argument that education, upbringing, genes and other largely uncontrollable influences shape personality to some extent. Furthermore, one's personality dictates one's actions to some extent. Moral blame is assigned to an individual for being extremely selfish, even though that selfishness is almost certainly due in part to external environmental effects.

===Causal moral luck===
Causal moral luck, which equates largely with the problem of [[free will]], is the least-detailed of the varieties that Thomas Nagel describes. The general definition is that actions are determined by external events and are thus consequences of events over which the person taking the action has no control. Since people are restricted in their choice of actions by the events that precede them, they should not be held accountable or responsible for such actions.

Thomas Nagel has been criticized by Dana Nelkin for including causal moral luck as a separate category, since it appears largely redundant. It does not cover any cases that are not already included in constitutive and circumstantial luck, and seems to exist only for the purpose of bringing up the problem of free will.{{sfn|Nelkin|2013}}

==Alternatives==
Some philosophers, such as [[Susan Wolf]], have tried to come up with "happy mediums" that strike a balance between rejecting moral luck outright and accepting it wholesale. Wolf introduced the notions of rationalist and irrationalist positions as part of such a reconciliation.

The rationalist position, stated simply, is that equal fault deserves equal blame. For example, given two drivers, both of whom failed to check their brakes before driving, one of them runs over a pedestrian as a consequence while the other does not. The rationalist would say that since both of the drivers were equally at fault in failing to check their brakes, it should make no difference that one of them was lucky in not hitting a pedestrian while the other was unlucky – moral fault is independent of consequence. Since the fault here is equal, the agents should receive equal blame.

The consequentialist position argues that equal fault need not deserve equal blame, as blame should depend on the consequences. By this logic, the lucky driver certainly does not deserve as much blame as the unlucky driver, even though their faults were identical.

Wolf combines these two approaches in trying to reconcile the tensions associated with moral luck by introducing the concept of a virtuous agent. A virtuous agent should accept that they have a special connection with the consequences of their actions, including equal-fault cases (such as the lucky/unlucky drivers above), and even in no-fault cases. This argument essentially retains the rationalist claim that equal fault is equally deserving of blame while also retaining the consequentialist claim that different outcomes should result in moral agents feeling and acting differently.

It is important to underline the distinction between internal and external moral blame or praise. Wolf believes that the outsiders should blame the lucky and unlucky drivers equally despite their intuition that the two of them should not feel equally bad (i.e., the unlucky driver that ran over a pedestrian should feel worse). ''However'', the unlucky driver themselves should voluntarily accept the notion of the special connection between their actions and the unfortunate consequences, and assign more blame to themselves than the lucky driver should.

'''Neo-scholasticism''' (also known as '''neo-scholastic [[Thomism]]'''&lt;ref name=:0&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html |author=[[Edward Feser]] |title=The Thomistic tradition, Part I (archived copy) |accessdate=2011-01-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129133527/http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Accessed 27 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; or '''neo-Thomism'''&lt;!--'Neo-Thomism' and 'Neo-Thomist' redirect here--&gt; because of the great influence of the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]] on the movement), is a revival and development of medieval [[scholasticism]] in [[Roman Catholic]] [[theology]] and [[scholastic philosophy|philosophy]] which began in the second half of the 19th century.

==Origins==
During the medieval period, [[scholasticism]] became the standard accepted method of philosophy and theology. The Scholastic method declined with the advent of [[humanism]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, after which time it came to be viewed by some as rigid and formalistic. "Scholastic philosophy did not, however, completely disappear.  An important movement of Thomistic revival took place during the 16th century and enriched Scholastic literature with many eminent contributions. [[Thomas Cajetan|Thomas de Vio Cajetan]] (1469–1534), [[Gabriel Vásquez]] (1551–1604), [[Francisco de Toledo (Jesuit)|Toletus]] (1532–1596), [[Pedro da Fonseca (philosopher)|Fonseca]] (1528–1599), and especially [[Francisco Suárez]] (1548–1617) were profound thinkers, worthy of the great masters whose principles they had adopted."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Louis Perrier, The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century'', "Chapter VIII: "Chapter VIII: Forerunners of the Neo-Scholastic Revival," Accessed 1 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as J. A. Weisheipl [[Order of Preachers|O.P.]] emphasizes, within the [[Dominican Order]] Thomistic scholasticism has been continuous since the time of Aquinas: "Thomism was always alive in the Dominican Order, small as it was after the ravages of the Reformation, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic occupation. Repeated legislation of the General Chapters, beginning after the death of St. Thomas, as well as the Constitutions of the Order, required all Dominicans to teach the doctrine of St. Thomas both in philosophy and in theology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927202339/http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}  “The Revival of Thomism: An Historical Survey, ” James Weisheipl, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;  A further idea of the longstanding historic continuity of Dominican scholasticism and neo-scholasticism may be derived from the [[list of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas]].

In the mid–19th century, interest in Roman Catholic circles in scholastic methodology and thought began once again to flourish, in large part in reaction against the "[[Modernism in the Catholic Church|Modernism]]" inspired by thinkers such as [[Descartes]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and [[Hegel]], the use of which was perceived as inimical to Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Kerr, ''Twentieth-century Catholic theologians'', (Blackwell, 2007), p1.&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning and core beliefs of theological Modernism were never tightly defined; in large part, Modernism simply represented that which was attacked by Rome in 1907 as ‘the sum of all heresies’. Moreover, given that Modernism remained the perceived enemy of neo-Scholasticism throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were certainly changes over the decades in what was attacked. Certainly, however, common threads of thought can be detected.  These include (1) the belief that revelation continued up to and including the present day and, therefore, did not stop with the death of the last apostle; (2) the belief that dogmas were not immutable and that ecclesial dogmatic formulas could change both in interpretation and in content; (3) the use of the historical-critical method in biblical exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;See Jürgen Mettepenningen, ''Nouvelle Théologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2010), p20.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many thinkers, the dangers of Modernism could only be overcome by a complete return to scholastic theology. In particular, Catholic interest came to focus on the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]], whose writings were increasingly viewed as the ultimate expression of philosophy and theology, to which all Catholic thought must remain faithful.&lt;ref&gt;This way of approaching Thomas was itself scholastic in inspiration. The scholastics used a book by a renowned scholar, called [[auctor]], as basic course literature. By reading this book thoroughly and critically, the disciples learned to appreciate the theories of the auctor and, thus, of the problems studied in the whole discipline, in a critical and self-confident way. Scholastic works therefore have a tendency to take the form of a long list of "footnotes" to the works studied, not being able to take a stand as theories on their own.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was particularly vigorous at first in Italy. "The direct initiator of the neo-Scholastic movement in Italy was [[Gaetano Sanseverino]], (1811–1865), a canon at Naples."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Louis Perrier, ''The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century'', "Chapter IX: The Neo-Scholastic Revival in Italy", {{cite web |url=http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/perrier9.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009074833/http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/perrier9.html |archivedate=2015-10-09 |df= }} Accessed 1 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The German Jesuit J [[Kleutgen]] (1811–83), who taught at Rome, was a particularly influential figure in his defences of pre-modern theology and philosophy, his argument that a theology based upon a post-Cartesian philosophy undermined Catholic doctrine, and his recommendation that the Aristotelian scientific method of Aquinas was the theology the Church now needed.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Kerr, ‘Thomism’, in ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Christian Theology'', (Cambridge, 2011), p507.&lt;/ref&gt; The Accademia di San Tommaso, founded in 1874, published until 1891 a review entitled ''La Scienza Italiana''. Numerous works were produced by [[Giovanni Maria Cornoldi]] (1822–92), [[Giuseppe Pecci]], [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]] (1833–93), Satolli (1839–1909), Liberatore (1810–92), Barberis (1847–96), Schiffini (1841–1906), de Maria, Talamo, Lorenzelli, Ballerini, Matussi and others. The Italian writers at first laid special emphasis on the metaphysical features of Scholasticism, and less to the empirical sciences or to the history of philosophy.

Papal support for such trends had begun under Pope [[Pius IX]], who had recognized the importance of the movement in various letters. The dogma of the Immaculate Conception (1854), the [[syllabus of errors|''Syllabus errorum'']] (1864) and the proclamation of papal infallibility (1870) all heralded a move away from Modernist forms of theological thought.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Mettepenningen, ''Nouvelle Théologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2010), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important moment for the spread of the movement occurred with Pope [[Leo XIII]]’s [[encyclical]] "[[Aeterni Patris]]", issued on 4 August 1879. ''Aeterni Patris'' set out what would come to be seen as the principles of neo-scholasticism, and provided the stimulus for the donation of increased support to neo-scholastic thought. It called for ‘Christian philosophy to be restored according to the spirit of St Thomas’.

==Key principles==
Neo-scholasticism sought to restore the fundamental doctrines embodied in the scholasticism of the 13th century. The essential conceptions may be summarized as follows:

1. [[God]], [[Actus purus|pure actuality]] and absolute perfection, is substantially distinct from every finite thing: He alone can create and preserve all beings other than Himself. His infinite knowledge includes all that has been, is, or shall be, and likewise all that is possible.

2. As to our knowledge of the material world: whatever exists is itself, an incommunicable, individual substance. To the core of self-sustaining reality, in the [[oak]]-tree for instance, other realities (accidents) are added—size, form, roughness, and so on. All oak-trees are alike, indeed are identical in respect of certain constituent elements. Considering this likeness and even identity, our human intelligence groups them into one species and again, in view of their common characteristics, it ranges various species under one genus. Such is the Aristotelean solution of the [[problem of universals]]. Each substance is in its nature fixed and determined; and nothing is farther from the spirit of Scholasticism than a theory of [[evolution]] which would regard even the essences of things as products of change.

But this statism requires as its complement a moderate dynamism, and this is supplied by the central concepts of [[Entelechy|act]] and potency. Whatsoever changes is, just for that reason, limited. The oak-tree passes through a process of growth, of becoming: whatever is actually in it now was potentially in it from the beginning. Its vital functions go on unceasingly (accidental change); but the tree itself will die, and out of its decayed trunk other substances will come forth (substantial change). The theory of matter and form is simply an interpretation of the substantial changes which bodies undergo. The union of matter and form constitutes the essence of concrete being, and this essence is endowed with existence. Throughout all change and becoming there runs a rhythm of finality; the activities of the countless substances of the universe converge towards an end which is known to God; finality involves optimism.

3.  Man, a compound of body (matter) and of [[soul]] (form), puts forth activities of a higher order—knowledge and volition. Through his senses he perceives concrete objects, e.g. this oak; through his intellect he knows the abstract and universal (the oak). All our intellectual activity rests on sensory function; but through the active intellect (intellectus agens) an abstract representation of the sensible object is provided for the intellectual possibility. Hence the characteristic of the idea, its non-materiality, and on this is based the principal argument for the spirituality and [[immortality]] of the soul. Here, too, is the foundation of logic and of the theory of knowledge, the justification of our judgments and [[syllogism]]s.

Upon knowledge follows the appetitive process, sensory or intellectual according to the sort of knowledge. The [[Will (philosophy)|will]] (''appetitus intellectualis'') in certain conditions [[Free will|is free]], and thanks to this liberty man is the master of his destiny. Like all other beings, we have an end to attain and we are morally obliged, though not compelled, to attain it.

Natural happiness would result from the full development of our powers of knowing and loving. We should find and possess God in this world since the corporeal world is the proper object of our intelligence. But above nature is the order of grace and our supernatural happiness will consist in the direct intuition of God, the beatific vision. Here philosophy ends and theology begins.

==Late-19th-century spread==
In the period from the publication of [[Aeterni Patris]] in 1879 until the 1920s, neo-scholasticism gradually established itself as exclusive and all-pervading.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Mettepenningen, ''Nouvelle Théologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2010), p20.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 1879, Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]], and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called "Leonine Edition", of the complete works of Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;Previous critical editions of Thomas’s work had been published before, at Parma in 1852-73, and in Paris in 1871-80, but the Leonine edition, produced under the guidance of [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor of theology at the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe'' (the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']]), superseded both of these.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Leo XIII increased Thomist studies in his support for the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe'' (the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']]), by founding its Faculty of [[Philosophy]] in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.

Accordingly, the thought of Thomas Aquinas came to be assessed positively in relation to all other ‘modern’ systems of thought. In particular, the Aristotelianism of Thomas was seen in contrast to the thought of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (itself seen as representative of ‘modern’ thought).&lt;ref&gt;For example, Boutroux thought that Aristotle's system might well serve as an offset to [[Kantism]] and evolution. ''Aristote, Etudes d'histoire et de philosophie'', (Paris, 1901, 202). Moreover, [[Paulsen]], ‘Kant der Philosoph des Protestantismus’, ''Kantstudien'', (1899) and [[Eucken]], ''Thomas von Aquino u. Kant, Ein Kampf zweier Welten'', loc. cit., 1901 declared neo-Thomism the rival of Kantism, and the conflict between them the "clash of two worlds". [[Adolf Harnack]], ''Lehrbuch d. Dogmengesch'', III, 3rd. ed., 327, [[Seeberg]], ''Realencyklopädie f. Prot. Theol. '' 5. v. "Scholastik" and others argued against underrating the value of scholastic doctrine.&lt;/ref&gt; Other ‘modern’ forms of thought, including [[Ontologism]], [[Tradition]]alism, the [[Dualistic_cosmology#In_Christianity|dualism]]{{dn|date=March 2018}} of [[Anton Günther]], and the thought of [[Descartes]], were also seen as flawed in comparison to Thomism.

The movement also spread into other countries. It found supporters in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[Kleutgen]] (1811–83) and [[Stöckl]] (1823–95), and the authors of the "Philosophia Lacensis" published at Maria Laach by the Jesuits (Pesch, Hontheim, Cathrein), Gutberlet, Commer, Willmann, Kaufmann, Glossner, Grabmann and Schneid.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Such as Gonzalez (1831–92), Orti y Lara, Urráburu, and Gómez Izquierdo&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;Such as de Groot&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;Such as de San (1832–1904), Dupont and Lepidi&lt;/ref&gt; England,&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Maher, John Rickaby, [[Joseph Rickaby]], Boedder (Stonyhurst Series)&lt;/ref&gt;  Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[Mandonnet]] at Freiburg.&lt;/ref&gt; France,&lt;ref&gt;Such as Farges, Dormet de Vorges (1910), Vallet, Gardair, Fonsegrive and Piat&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary,&lt;ref&gt;Kiss and Pécsi.&lt;/ref&gt; the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Such as Coppens, Poland, Brother Chrysostom, and the professors at the Catholic University (Shanahan, Turner, and Pace).&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina,&lt;ref&gt;[[Julio Meinvielle]] and [[Nimio de Anquín]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;Garcia&lt;/ref&gt; and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Santroul&lt;/ref&gt; In Belgium, a particularly important moment was the establishment by Leo XIII at [[Leuven|Louvain]] (then still a francophone university) in 1891 of the "Institut de philosophie" for the special purpose of teaching the doctrine of St. Thomas together with history and the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute was placed in charge of Mgr (later Cardinal) [[Désiré-Joseph Mercier|Mercier]] whose "Cours de philosophie" was translated into many major European languages.&lt;/ref&gt; It was endorsed by four [[Catholic Congress]]es: Paris (1891); Brussels (1895); Freiburg (1897); Munich (1900).

==Early-20th-century development==
In the early 20th century, neo-Thomism became official Catholic doctrine, and became increasingly defined in opposition to Modernism. In July 1907, Pope [[Pius X]] issued the decree ''Lamentabili sane exitu'', which condemned 65 Modernist propositions. Two months later, he issued the encyclical ''Pascendi Dominici Gregis'', in which he unequivocally condemned the agnosticism, immanentism, and relativism of Modernism as the 'synthesis of all heresies'.&lt;ref name="Hans Boersma 2009 p18"&gt;[[Hans Boersma]], ''Nouvelle Theologie and Sacramental Ontology: A Return to Mystery'', (Oxford: OUP, 2009), p18.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Modernist oath of 1910 was very important; this remained in force until 1966. .&lt;ref name="Hans Boersma 2009 p18"/&gt; In 1914, Pope [[Pius X]] acted against Modernism by ordering, though the Sacred Congregation of Studies, the publication of a list of 24 philosophical propositions, propositions summarising the central tenets of neo-scholasticism to be taught in all colleges as fundamental elements of philosophy, which was intended to promote a purer form of Thomism; in 1916, these 24 propositions were confirmed as normative. In 1917, the Church’s new Code of Canon Law (''Codex Iuris Canonici'') insisted that the doctrine, methods, and principles of Thomas should be used in teaching philosophy and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Mettepenningen, ''Nouvelle Théologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II'', (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2010), p25.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomist thought therefore became reflected in the manuals and textbooks widely in use in Roman Catholic colleges and seminaries before [[Vatican II]].

==Variation within the tradition&lt;!--'Strict observance Thomism' redirects here--&gt;==
While writers such as [[Edouard Hugon]], [[Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], and [[Henri Grenier]] were maintaining the tradition of the manuals this did not mean that there was no variation or disagreement among thinkers about how best to formulate Thomism, especially in response to contemporary trends. Variation within the tradition of neo-scholastic Thomism is represented by [[Martin Grabmann]] (1875–1949), Amato Masnovo (1880–1955), Francesco Olgiati (1886–1962), and [[Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges]] (1863–1948).&lt;ref&gt;Battista Mondin's Metafisica di san Tommaso d'Aquino e i suoi interpreti (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Authors such as [[Étienne Gilson]], [[Jacques Maritain]], and [[Joseph Maréchal]] investigated alternative interpretations of Aquinas from the 1920s until the 1950s.  Gilson and Maritain in particular taught and lectured throughout Europe and North America, influencing a generation of English-speaking Catholic philosophers.

The growth in historical investigation into Thomas’s thought led some to believe that neo-Thomism did not always reflect the thought of Thomas Aquinas himself. This historically oriented theology was particularly carried out by writers such as [[Étienne Gilson]], [[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], and [[Henri de Lubac]].  At [[Vatican II]], traditional neo-Thomist thought was opposed by such exponents of the ''[[nouvelle théologie]]''.

Many Thomists however continue in the neo-scholastic tradition.  Some relatively recent proponents are treated in Battista Mondin's ''Metafisica di san Tommaso d'Aquino e i suoi interpreti'' (2002), which treats Carlo Giacon (1900–1984), Sofia Vanni Rovighi (1908–1990), [[Cornelio Fabro]] (1911–1995), Carlo Giacon (1900–1984),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-giacon_(Dizionario-Biografico)/  Accessed 9 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomas Tyn]] (1950–1990), Abelardo Lobato (1925–2012), Leo Elders (1926–), and Enrico Berti (1935–), among others.  Due to its suspicion of attempts to harmonize Aquinas with non-Thomistic categories and assumptions, neo-scholastic Thomism has sometimes been called "'''strict observance Thomism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;."&lt;ref name=:0/&gt;

Also [[Edward Feser]] in discussing anglophone authors has indicated that proponents of the more traditional Thomist perspective such as [[Ralph McInerny]] foster the possibility of a contemporary revival of neo-scholastic Thomism.&lt;ref&gt;http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2008/11/neo-scholastic-revival.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Feser could be included along with these thinkers and other such as [[Brian Davies (philosopher)|Brian Davies]] as engaging in a contemporary polemic in defense of the traditional system of Thomistic metaphysics in response to modern philosophy.&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Thomistic tradition (Part 1)|url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html|author=Feser, Edward|date=15 October 2009|accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ordinary language philosophy''' is a [[philosophical methodology]] that sees traditional philosophical problems as rooted in misunderstandings philosophers develop by [[stipulative definition|distorting or forgetting what words actually mean]] in [[natural language|everyday use]]. "Such 'philosophical' uses of language, on this view, create the very philosophical problems they are employed to solve."&lt;ref name=ParkerRyan/&gt; Ordinary language philosophy is a branch of [[linguistic philosophy]] closely related to [[logical positivism]].&lt;ref name=ParkerRyan/&gt;

This approach typically involves eschewing philosophical "theories" in favor of close attention to the details of the use of everyday "ordinary" language. It is sometimes associated with the later work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and a number of mid-20th century philosophers that can be split into two main groups, neither of which could be described as an organized "school".&lt;ref name=Chappell/&gt; In its earlier stages contemporaries of Wittgenstein at Cambridge University such as [[Norman Malcolm]], [[Alice Ambrose]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Oets Kolk Bouwsma]] and [[Morris Lazerowitz]] started to develop ideas recognisable as ordinary language philosophy. These ideas were further elaborated from 1945 onwards through the work of some Oxford University philosophers led initially by [[Gilbert Ryle]], then followed by [[J. L. Austin]]. This Oxford group also included [[H. L. A. Hart]], [[Geoffrey Warnock]], [[J. O. Urmson]] and [[P. F. Strawson|Peter Strawson]]. The close association between ordinary language philosophy and these later thinkers has led to it sometimes being referred to as "Oxford philosophy". More recent philosophers with at least some commitment to the method of ordinary language philosophy include [[Stanley Cavell]], [[John Searle]] and [[Oswald Hanfling]].

== Central ideas ==
The later Wittgenstein held that the meanings of words reside in their ordinary uses and that this is why philosophers trip over words taken in [[abstraction]]. From this came the idea that philosophy had gotten into trouble by trying to use words outside of the context of their use in ordinary language. For example, "understanding" is what you mean when you say "I understand". "Knowledge" is what you mean when you say "I know that". The point is, you ''already know'' what "understanding" or "knowledge" are, at least implicitly. Philosophers are ill-advised to construct new definitions for these terms, because this is necessarily a ''re''definition, and the argument may unravel into self-referential nonsense. Rather, philosophers must explore the definitions that these terms already have, without forcing a convenient redefinition onto them. 

The controversy really begins when ordinary language philosophers apply the same leveling tendency to questions such as ''What is Truth?'' or ''What is Consciousness?'' Philosophers in this school would insist that we cannot assume that (for example) 'Truth' 'is' a 'thing' (in the same sense that tables and chairs are 'things'), which the word 'truth' represents. Instead, we must look at the differing ways in which the words 'truth' and 'conscious' actually function in ordinary language. We may well discover, after investigation, that there is no single entity to which the word 'truth' corresponds, something Wittgenstein attempts to get across via his concept of a 'family resemblance' (cf. ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''). Therefore, ordinary language philosophers tend to be anti-[[essentialism|essentialist]].

Anti-essentialism and the linguistic philosophy associated with it are often important to contemporary accounts of [[feminism]], [[Marxism]], and other social philosophies that are critical of the injustice of the [[status quo]]. The essentialist 'Truth' as 'thing' is argued to be closely related to projects of domination, where the denial of alternate truths is understood to be a denial of alternate forms of living. Similar arguments sometimes involve ordinary language philosophy with other anti-essentialist movements like [[post-structuralism]]. However, strictly speaking, this is not a position derived from Wittgenstein, as it still involves 'misuse' (ungrammatical use) of the term "truth" in reference to "alternate truths".

== History ==
{{Wittgenstein|Movements}}
Early analytic philosophy had a less positive view of ordinary language. [[Bertrand Russell]] tended to dismiss language as being of little philosophical significance, and ordinary language as just being too confused to help solve metaphysical and epistemological problems.  [[Frege]], the [[Vienna Circle]] (especially [[Rudolf Carnap]]), the young Wittgenstein, and [[W.V. Quine]], all attempted to improve upon it, in particular using the resources of modern [[logic]]. Wittgenstein's view in the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' more or less agreed with Russell's that language ought to be reformulated so as to be unambiguous, so as to accurately represent the world, so that we could better deal with the questions of philosophy.

By contrast, Wittgenstein would later describe his task as bringing "words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use".&lt;ref name=Wittgenstein/&gt; The sea-change brought on by his unpublished work in the 1930s centered largely on the idea that there is nothing ''wrong'' with ordinary language as it stands, and that many traditional philosophical problems were only illusions brought on by misunderstandings about language and related subjects. The former idea led to rejecting the approaches of earlier analytic philosophy – arguably, of any earlier philosophy – and the latter led to replacing them with the careful attention to language in its normal use, in order to "dissolve" the appearance of philosophical problems, rather than attempt to solve them. At its inception, ordinary language philosophy (also called linguistic philosophy) had been taken as either an extension of or as an alternative to analytic philosophy. Now that the term "[[analytic philosophy]]" has a more standardized meaning, ordinary language philosophy is viewed as a stage of the analytic tradition that followed logical positivism and that preceded the yet-to-be-named stage analytic philosophy continues in today. According to Preston, analytic philosophy is now in a fifth, eclectic or pluralistic, phase he calls 'post-linguistic analytic philosophy' that tends to 'emphasize precision and thoroughness about a narrow topic, and to deemphasize the imprecise or cavalier discussion of broad topics'.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

Ordinary language analysis largely flourished and developed at [[Oxford]] in the 1940s, under Austin and [[Gilbert Ryle]], and was quite widespread for a time before declining rapidly in popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is now not uncommon to hear that Ordinary Language philosophy is no longer an active force.&lt;ref name=Forguson/&gt; Wittgenstein is perhaps the only one among the major figures of linguistic philosophy to retain anything like the reputation he had at that time. On the other hand, the attention to language remains one of the most important techniques in contemporary analytic thought, and many of the effects of ordinary language philosophy can still be felt across many academic disciplines.

== Criticism ==

One of the most ardent critics of ordinary language philosophy was a student at Oxford, [[Ernest Gellner]] who said:&lt;ref name=Gellner/&gt;

{{quote|"[A]t that time the orthodoxy best described as linguistic philosophy, inspired by Wittgenstein, was crystallizing and seemed to me totally and utterly misguided. Wittgenstein's basic idea was that there is no general solution to issues other than the custom of the community. Communities are ultimate. He didn't put it this way, but that was what it amounted to. And this doesn't make sense in a world in which communities are not stable and are not clearly isolated from each other. Nevertheless, Wittgenstein managed to sell this idea, and it was enthusiastically adopted as an unquestionable revelation. It is very hard nowadays for people to understand what the atmosphere was like then. This was ''the'' Revelation. It wasn't doubted. But it was quite obvious to me it was wrong. It was obvious to me the moment I came across it, although initially, if your entire environment, and all the bright people in it, hold something to be true, you assume ''you'' must be wrong, not understanding it properly, and they must be right. And so I explored it further and finally came to the conclusion that I did understand it right, and it ''was'' rubbish, which indeed it is."|Ernest Gellner|Interview with John Davis, 1991}}

The '''pantheism controversy''' ({{lang-de|Pantheismusstreit}}) was an event in German cultural history that lasted between 1785–1789 which had an effect throughout Europe.

==History==
A conversation between the German philosopher [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] and the German dramatist [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] in 1780 led Jacobi to a protracted study of [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s works. Lessing had avowed that he knew no philosophy, in the true sense of that word, save [[Spinozism]].

Jacobi's ''Über die Lehre des Spinozas'' (1st ed. 1785, 2nd ed. 1789) expressed sharply and clearly his strenuous objection to a dogmatic system in philosophy, and drew upon him the vigorous enmity of the [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] group, led by [[Moses Mendelssohn]]. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure [[materialism]], because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]] and it would finally end in absolute [[atheism]]. Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and [[pantheism]]. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which [[Immanuel Kant]] rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to [[antinomy|antinomies]] in thought.

Jacobi was ridiculed for trying to reintroduce into philosophy the antiquated notion of unreasoning belief, was denounced as an enemy of reason, as a [[pietist]], and as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] in disguise, and was especially attacked for his use of the ambiguous term ''Glaube'' ([[German (language)|German]]: "belief, faith"). 

Willi Goetschel argues that Jacobi's publication significantly shaped the reception of Spinoza's doctrine for centuries following its publication, obscuring the nuance of Spinoza's philosophic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goetschel|first1=Willi|title=Spinoza's Modernity: Mendelssohn, Lessing, and Heine|date=2004|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=0299190803|pages=12-13|ref=Goetschel2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pantheism controversy is also notable for its development of and influence upon prominent philosophical terms in German culture, including the idea of [[nihilism]] and claims that [[God is dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 74 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobi's next important work, ''[[David Hume]] Über den Glauben, oder Idealismus und Realismus'' (1787), was an attempt to show not only that the term ''Glaube'' had been used by the most eminent writers to denote what he had employed it for in the ''Letters on Spinoza'', but that the nature of the cognition of facts as opposed to the construction of inferences could not be otherwise expressed. In this writing, and especially in the appendix, Jacobi came into contact with the [[critical philosophy]], and subjected the Kantian view of knowledge to searching examination.

The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late eighteenth-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and [[deism]]. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
*the unity of all that exists;
*the regularity of all that happens; and
*the identity of spirit and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lange|first1=Frederick Albert|title=History of Materialism and Criticism of its Present Importance, Vol. II|date=1880|publisher=Houghton, Osgood, &amp; Co.|location=Boston|page=147|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmateria02lang|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''philosopher''' is someone who practices [[Philosophy|philosophy]], which involves [[reason|rational]] inquiry into areas that are outside either [[theology]] or [[science]].&lt;ref name="RussellHistory10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=10|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "philosopher" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|φιλόσοφος}} (''philosophos'') meaning "lover of wisdom". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker [[Pythagoras]] (6th century BC).&lt;ref name="tufts"&gt;{{LSJ|filo/sofos|φιλόσοφος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Classics|classical]] sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing on resolving [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]], and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''The Inner Citadel''. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these particular brands of philosophy are [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers. A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense, doesn’t know when to stop asking questions, and reexamines the old ways of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Perry |first= Prof. Ralph Barton |year= 1914 |chapter= Philosophy I: General Introduction: Philosophy and Common Sense |editors= William Allan Neilson, et al.  |title= Lectures on the Harvard Classics |url= https://archive.org/details/harvardclassics51eliouoft |website= Internet Archive |publisher= P.

In a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy, such as [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[social theory]], and [[political philosophy]]. A philosopher may also be one who worked in the [[humanities]] or other sciences which have since split from philosophy proper over the centuries, such as [[the arts]], [[history]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[theology]], and [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Shook|editor-first1=John R. |title=Dictionary of Modern American philosophers |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-miscMatter-0004 |date=2010 |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780199754663 |page=Introduction |doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001 |oclc=686766412 |subscription=yes |quote=The label of "philosopher" has been broadly applied in this Dictionary to intellectuals who have made philosophical contributions regardless of an academic career or professional title. The wide scope of philosophical activity across the timespan of this dictionary would now be classed among the various humanities and social sciences which gradually separated from philosophy over the last one hundred and fifty years. Many figures included were not academic philosophers but did work at the philosophical foundations of such fields as pedagogy, rhetoric, the arts, history, politics, economics, sociology,turtles , psychology, linguistics, anthropology, religion, and theology. Philosophy proper is heavily represented, of course, encompassing the traditional areas of metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, logic, ethics, social/political theory, and aesthetics, along with the narrower fields of philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of law, applied ethics, philosophy of religion, and so forth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Hatnote|This section is about the history of philosophers as an occupation. For a history of philosophy in general, see [[History of philosophy]].}}

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
The separation of philosophy and science from theology began in Greece during the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="RussellHistory11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=11|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thales]], an astronomer and mathematician, was considered by Aristotle to be the first philosopher of the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Pythagoras]] coined the word, the first known elaboration on the topic was conducted by [[Plato]]. In his ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', he concludes that Love is that which lacks the object it seeks. Therefore, the philosopher is one who seeks wisdom; if he attains wisdom, he would be a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]]. Therefore, the philosopher in antiquity was one who lives in the constant pursuit of wisdom, and living in accordance to that wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;That is to say philosophically – [[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 27: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements arose as to what living philosophically entailed. These disagreements gave rise to different [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic schools of philosophy]]. In consequence, the ancient philosopher thought in a tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 5: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Theologie, exegese, revelation' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; As the ancient world became schism by philosophical debate, the competition lay in living in manner that would transform his whole way of living in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 30: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, Dictionnaire des philosophes antiques, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the last of these philosophers was [[Marcus Aurelius]], who is widely regarded as a philosopher in the modern sense, but personally refused to call himself by such a title, since he had a duty to live as an [[List of Roman emperors|emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Meditations#THE EIGHTH BOOK]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transition====
According to the [[Classicist]] [[Pierre Hadot]], the modern conception of a philosopher and philosophy developed predominately through three changes:

The first is the natural inclination of the philosophical mind. Philosophy is a tempting discipline which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 31: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The second is the historical change through the Medieval era. With the rise of Christianity, the philosophical way of life was adopted by its theology. Thus, philosophy was divided between a way of life and the conceptual, logical, physical and metaphysical materials to justify that way of life. Philosophy was then the servant to theology.&lt;ref name='Hadot32'&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 32: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third is the sociological need with the development of the university. The modern university requires professionals to teach. Maintaining itself requires teaching future professionals to replace the current faculty. Therefore, the discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists, completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life.&lt;ref name='Hadot32'/&gt;

===Medieval era===
In the fourth century, the word philosopher began to designate a man or woman who led a monastic life. [[Gregory of Nyssa]], for example, describes how his sister [[Macrina the Younger|Macrina]] persuaded [[Emmelia of Caesarea|their mother]] to forsake "the distractions of material life" for a life of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Readings in World Christian History'' (2013), pp. 147, 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Later during the [[Middle Ages]], persons who engaged with [[alchemy]] was called a philosopher – thus, the [[Philosopher's Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=philosopher&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern era===
{{rquote|right|''Generally speaking, university philosophy is mere fencing in front of a mirror. In the last analysis, its goal is to give students opinions which are to the liking of the minister who hands out the Chairs... As a result, this state-financed philosophy makes a joke of philosophy. And yet, if there is one thing desirable in this world, it is to see a ray of light fall onto the darkness of our lives, shedding some kind of light on the mysterious enigma of our existence.''|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]}}

Many philosophers still emerged from the Classical tradition, as saw their philosophy as a way of life. Among the most notable are [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. With the rise of the university, the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent. Many of the esteemed philosophers of the eighteenth century and onward have attended, taught, and developed their works in university. Early examples include: [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 271: ''Philosophy as a Way of Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

After these individuals, the Classical conception had all but died with the exceptions of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The last considerable figure in philosophy to not have followed a strict and orthodox academic regime was [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]]. Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern academia===
In the modern era, those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system. According to a 1993 study by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (as reported by the [[American Philosophical Association]]), 77.1% of the 7,900 holders of a PhD in philosophy who responded were employed in educational institutions ([[academia]]). Outside academia, philosophers may employ their writing and reasoning skills in other careers, such as medicine{{vague|date=November 2015}}, [[bioethics]], business, publishing, [[free-lance writing]], media, and law.&lt;ref name=APA-nonacademic&gt;{{cite web|author=APA Committee on Non-Academic Careers|title=A non-academic career?|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?page=nonacademic|edition=3rd|date=June 1999|publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]]|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key thinkers===
====French social thought====
Some known [[French people|French]] social thinkers are [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri Saint-Simon]], Auguste Comte, and [[Émile Durkheim]].

====British social thought====
[[United Kingdom|British]] social thought, with thinkers such as [[Herbert Spencer]], addressed questions and ideas relating to [[political economy]] and [[social evolution]]. The political ideals of [[John Ruskin]] were a precursor of [[social economy]] (''[[Unto This Last]]'' had a very important impact on [[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s philosophy).

====German social thought====
Important [[Germany|German]] philosophers and social thinkers included [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Georg Simmel]], and [[Martin Heidegger]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3732">A '''philosophical theory''' or '''philosophical position'''&lt;ref name="dot"&gt;''Dictionary of Theories'', [[Jennifer Bothamley]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a set of beliefs that explains or accounts for a general [[philosophy]] or specific branch of philosophy.{{cn|date=December 2017}} The use of the term theory here is a statement of colloquial English and not reflective of the term [[theory]].&lt;ref name="Lacey"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lacey |first=A.R. |title=A Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |date=1976 |edition=second |page=122 |isbn=0-415-05872-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While any sort of [[thesis]] or opinion may be termed a position, in [[analytic philosophy]] it is thought best to reserve the word "theory" for systematic, comprehensive attempts to solve problems.&lt;ref name="Sparkes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sparkes |first=A.W. |title=Talking Philosophy: a wordbook |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, New York |date=1991 |page=114 |isbn=0-415-04222-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The elements that comprise a philosophical position consist of [[statement (logic)|statements]] which are [[belief|believed]] to be [[truth|true]] by the thinkers who accept them, and which may or may not be [[empiricism|empirical]]. The sciences have a very clear idea of what a theory is; however in the arts such as philosophy, the definition is more hazy.&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt; Philosophical positions are not necessarily [[scientific theory|scientific theories]], although they may consist of both empirical and non-empirical statements.

In essence, the collective statements of all [[philosophical movement]]s, [[school of thought|schools of thought]], and [[belief system]]s consist of philosophical positions. Also included among philosophical positions are many [[principle]]s, [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[Norm (philosophy)|rules]], [[paradox]]es, [[law]]s, as well as 'ologies, 'isms, 'sis's, and [[List of effects|effects]].&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt;

Some examples of philosophical positions include:
* [[Metatheory]]; positions about the formation and content of theorems, such as [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]].
* [[Political theory]]; positions that underlie a [[political philosophy]], such as [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]].
* [[Ethical theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]; positions about the nature and purpose of [[ethical]] statements,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard T. Garner]] and [[Bernard Rosen]], ''Moral Philosophy: A Systematic Introduction to Normative Ethics and Meta-ethics.'' (Macmillan, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Kantianism#Ethics|ethical theory]] of [[Immanuel Kant]].
* [[Critical theory]]; in its narrow sense, a [[Western Europe]]an body of [[Frankfurt School]] [[Marxist]] thought that aims at criticizing and transforming, rather than merely explaining, social structures.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[Max Horkheimer]], ''Traditional and Critical Theory'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; In a broader sense, "critical theory" relates to a wide variety of political, literary, and philosophical positions that take at least some of their inspiration from the Frankfurt School and its dialectic, and that typically contest the possibility of objectivity or aloofness from political positions and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/ Critical theory]" at the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  

Philosophical positions may also take the form of a [[life stance]], [[religion]], [[world view]], or [[ideology]].

== Introduction ==

=== Knowledge ===
Traditionally, the term "philosophy" referred to any body of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name="auto23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=philosophy|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education and politics. Newton's 1687 "[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]" is classified in the 2000s as a book of physics; he used the term  "[[natural philosophy]]" because it used to encompass disciplines that later became associated with sciences such as [[astronomy]], [[medicine]] and [[physics]].{{sfn|Lindberg|2007|p=3}}

In the first part of the first book of his ''Academics'', [[Cicero]] introduced the division of philosophy into logic, physics, and ethics; in section thirteen of the first book of his [[Lives_and_Opinions_of_Eminent_Philosophers|''Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers'']], the 3rd-century [[Diogenes_Laërtius|Diogenes Laërtius]], the first historian of philosophy, established the traditional division of philosophical inquiry into three parts: 

* [[Science|Natural philosophy]] ("physics," from ''ta physika'', "things having to do with nature (''physis'')" was the study of the constitution and processes of transformation in the physical world;
* [[Ethics|Moral philosophy]] ("ethics," from ''êthika,'' literally, "having to do with character, disposition, manners") was the study of goodness, right and wrong, justice and virtue.
* [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical philosophy]] ("logic") was the study of [[existence]], causation, [[God]], [[logic]], [[Universal (metaphysics)|forms]] and other abstract objects ("''meta ta physika"'' lit: "After [the book] the Physics").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kant: Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|date=2012|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=YASbAEhCLw0C}}|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107401068|edition=2nd|quote="Ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three branches of knowledge: natural science, ethics, and logic."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This division is not obsolete but has changed. Natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences, especially astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and cosmology. Moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences, but still includes value theory (including aesthetics, ethics, political philosophy, etc.). Metaphysical philosophy has birthed formal sciences such as logic, mathematics and philosophy of science, but still includes epistemology, cosmology and others.

=== Philosophical progress ===
Many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today. [[Colin McGinn]] and others claim that no [[philosophical progress]] has occurred during that interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Problems in Philosophy: The Limits of Inquiry|last=McGinn|first=Colin|date=1993|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=o_xMMPWzIecC}}|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-55786-475-8|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]] and others, by contrast, see progress in philosophy similar to that in science,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sms.cam.ac.uk/media/1484158|title=Video &amp; Audio: Why isn't there more progress in philosophy? – Metadata|website=www.sms.cam.ac.uk|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Talbot Brewer argued that "progress" is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Retrieval of Ethics|last=Brewer|first=Talbot|date=2011|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=d15rGnw_6rUC}}|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969222-4|edition=1st|location=Oxford; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|History}}Historical overview&lt;!--'History of philosophy' redirects here--&gt; ==
In one general sense, philosophy is associated with wisdom, intellectual culture and a search for knowledge. In that sense, all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions such as "how are we to live" and "what is the nature of reality". A broad and impartial conception of philosophy then, finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as reality, morality and life in all world civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield  (Editor), Edelglass (Editor), ''The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Western philosophy]] is the philosophical tradition of the [[Western world]] and dates to [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] thinkers who were active in [[Ancient Greece]] in the 6th century BCE such as [[Thales]] (c. 624–546 BCE) and [[Pythagoras]] (c. 570–495 BCE) who practiced a "love of wisdom" (''philosophia'')&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=b_VvghYDArwC}}|title=Lectures on the History of Philosophy: Greek philosophy|last=Hegel|first=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich|last2=Brown|first2=Robert F.|date=2006|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-927906-7|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were also termed ''physiologoi'' (students of ''physis'', or nature). [[Socrates]] was a very influential philosopher, who insisted that he possessed no ''wisdom'' but was a ''pursuer of'' wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DSym.%3Asection%3D201d|title=Plato's "Symposium"|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|page=201d and following|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western philosophy]] can be divided into three eras: [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient]] (Greco-Roman), [[Medieval philosophy]] (Christian European), and [[Modern philosophy]].

The Ancient era was dominated by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophical schools]] which arose out of the various pupils of Socrates, such as [[Plato]], who founded the [[Platonic Academy]] and his student [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref name="process"/&gt; founding the [[Peripatetic school]], who were both extremely influential in Western tradition. Other traditions include [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], [[Stoicism]], [[Skepticism#Philosophical skepticism|Greek Skepticism]] and [[Epicureanism]]. Important topics covered by the Greeks included [[metaphysics]] (with competing theories such as [[atomism]] and [[monism]]), [[cosmology]], the nature of the well-lived life ([[eudaimonia]]), the possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason ([[logos]]). With the rise of the [[Roman empire]], Greek philosophy was also increasingly discussed in [[Latin language|Latin]] by [[Romans]] such as [[Cicero]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].

[[Medieval philosophy]] (5th – 16th century) is the period following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and was dominated by the rise of [[Christianity]] and hence reflects [[Judeo-Christian]] theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of [[God]], the nature of [[faith]] and reason, metaphysics, the [[problem of evil]] were discussed in this period. Some key Medieval thinkers include [[St. Augustine]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Boethius]], [[Anselm of Laon|Anselm]] and [[Roger Bacon]]. Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to [[Theology]] (''ancilla theologiae'') and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the development of [[Scholasticism]], a text critical method developed in [[medieval universities]] based on close reading and disputation on key texts. The [[Renaissance]] period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust [[Humanism]].
[[Early modern philosophy]] in the Western world begins with thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650).&lt;ref name="diane"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fifty Major Philosophers, A Reference Guide|page=125|author=Diane Collinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rise of natural science, [[Modern philosophy]] was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;ref name="philosophical12"&gt;Rutherford, ''The Cambridge Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'', p. 1: "Most often this [period] has been associated with the achievements of a handful of great thinkers: the so-called 'rationalists' (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz) and 'empiricists' (Locke, Berkeley, Hume), whose inquiries culminate in Kant's 'Critical philosophy.' These canonical figures have been celebrated for the depth and rigor of their treatments of perennial philosophical questions..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="traditional"&gt;Nadler, ''A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'', p. 2: "The study of early modern philosophy demands that we pay attention to a wide variety of questions and an expansive pantheon of thinkers: the traditional canonical figures (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), to be sure, but also a large 'supporting cast'..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philosophical13"&gt;[[Bruce Kuklick]], "Seven Thinkers and How They Grew: Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz; Locke, Berkeley, Hume; Kant" in Rorty, Schneewind, and Skinner (eds.), ''Philosophy in History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984), p. 125: "Literary, philosophical, and historical studies often rely on a notion of what is ''canonical''. In American philosophy scholars go from Jonathan Edwards to John Dewey; in American literature from James Fenimore Cooper to F. Scott Fitzgerald; in political theory from Plato to Hobbes and Locke […] The texts or authors who fill in the blanks from A to Z in these, and other intellectual traditions, constitute the canon, and there is an accompanying narrative that links text to text or author to author, a 'history of' American literature, economic thought, and so on. The most conventional of such histories are embodied in university courses and the textbooks that accompany them. This essay examines one such course, the History of Modern Philosophy, and the texts that helped to create it. If a philosopher in the United States were asked why the seven people in my title comprise Modern Philosophy, the initial response would be: they were the best, and there are historical and philosophical connections among them."&lt;/ref&gt; [[19th-century philosophy]] is influenced by the wider movement termed [[the Enlightenment]], and includes figures such as [[Hegel]] a key figure in [[German idealism]], [[Kierkegaard]] who developed the foundations for [[existentialism]], [[Nietzsche]] a famed anti-Christian, [[J.S. Mill]] who promoted [[Utilitarianism]], [[Karl Marx]] who developed the foundations for [[Communism]] and the American [[William James]]. The 20th century saw the split between [[Analytic philosophy]] and [[Continental philosophy]], as well as philosophical trends such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], [[Existentialism]], [[Logical Positivism]], [[Pragmatism]] and the [[Linguistic turn]].

===Middle Eastern philosophy===

The regions of the [[fertile Crescent]], [[Iran]] and [[Arabia]] are home to the earliest known philosophical [[Wisdom literature]] and is today mostly dominated by [[Islamic culture]]. Early wisdom literature from the fertile crescent was a genre which sought to instruct people on ethical action, practical living and virtue through stories and proverbs. In [[Ancient Egypt]], these texts were known as [[sebayt]] ('teachings') and they are central to our understandings of [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy]]. [[Babylonian astronomy]] also included much philosophical speculations about cosmology which may have influenced the Ancient Greeks. [[Jewish philosophy]] and [[Christian philosophy]] are religio-philosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe, which both share certain early Judaic texts (mainly the [[Tanakh]]) and monotheistic beliefs. Jewish thinkers such as the [[Geonim]] of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]] and [[Maimonides]] engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophy. Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] who ushered in the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish Enlightenment), [[Jewish existentialism]] and [[Reform Judaism]].

Pre-Islamic [[Iranian philosophy]] begins with the work of [[Zoroaster]], one of the first promoters of [[monotheism]] and of the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] between good and evil. This dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as [[Manichaeism]], [[Mazdakism]], and [[Zurvanism]].

After the [[Muslim conquests]], [[Early Islamic philosophy]] developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions. This [[Islamic Golden Age]] influenced European intellectual developments. The two main currents of early Islamic thought are [[Kalam]] which focuses on [[Islamic theology]] and [[#Falsafa|Falsafa]] which was based on [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. The work of Aristotle was very influential among the falsafa such as [[al-Kindi]] (9th century), [[Avicenna]] (980 – June 1037) and [[Averroes]] (12th century). Others such as [[Al-Ghazali]] were highly critical of the methods of the Aristotelian falsafa. Islamic thinkers also developed a [[scientific method]], experimental medicine, a theory of optics and a legal philosophy. [[Ibn Khaldun]] was an influential thinker in [[philosophy of history]].

In [[History of Iran|Iran]] several schools of Islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the Golden Age and include currents such as [[Illuminationist philosophy]], [[Sufi philosophy]], and [[Transcendent theosophy]]. The 19th- and 20th-century [[Arab world]] saw the [[Al-Nahda|Nahda]] (awakening or renaissance) movement which influenced [[contemporary Islamic philosophy]].

===Indian philosophy===
{{Main|Eastern philosophy|Indian philosophy}}
[[Indian philosophy]] ({{lang-sa|{{IAST|darśana}}}}; 'world views', 'teachings')&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=darzana&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 Soken Sanskrit, ''darzana'']&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the diverse philosophical traditions that emerged since the ancient times on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Jainism and Buddhism originated at the end of the Vedic period, while Hinduism emerged as a fusion of diverse traditons, starting after the end of the Vedic period.

Hindus generally classify these traditions as either orthodox or heterodox – [[Āstika and nāstika|āstika or nāstika]] – depending on whether they accept the authority of the [[Vedas]] and the theories of [[Brahman]] and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self) therein.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=On Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8vRAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-936008-6|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orthodox schools include the Hindu traditions of thought, while the heterodox schools include the Buddhist and the Jain traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karl Potter| title=A Fresh Classification of India’s Philosophical Systems|journal = Journal of Asian Studies|volume=21| issue=1|year=1961| pages=25-32|jstor=2050985}}, Quote: "Whatever the source of the generally accepted classification of Indian philosophical systems, its six divisions do not appear to most scholars in this field to stem from logic. As a systematic attempt to deal with theoretical problems of metaphysics, logic, epistemology, and related topics, the “six systems” account has several glaring deficiencies. Two of these will be mentioned briefly. [...] A second deficiency in the “six-system” account is that it only covers orthodox philosophers, i.e., the Hindu schools of thought. From a philosophical standpoint, the views of the Buddhists and Jains are equally important."&lt;/ref&gt; Other schools include the [[Ajñana]], [[Ajivika]] and [[Cārvāka]] which became extinct over their history.&lt;ref name=andrewoverview&gt;Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 2-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bilimoriaastika&gt;P Bilimoria (2000), Indian Philosophy (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1135703226}}, page 88&lt;/ref&gt; 

Important Indian philosophical concepts shared by the Indian philosophies include [[dharma]], [[karma]], [[artha]], [[kama]], [[dukkha]] (suffering), [[anitya]] (anicca, impermanence), [[meditation|dhyana]] (jhana, meditation), renunciation (with or without monasticism or asceticism), various [[samsara]] with cycles of rebirth, [[moksha]] (nirvana, kaivalya, liberation from rebirth), and virtues such as [[ahimsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William A.

{{Main|Jain philosophy}}
Jain philosophy accepts the concept of a permanent soul (jiva) as one of the five ''astikayas'', or eternal infinite categories that make up the substance of existence. The other four being ''dharma'', ''adharma'', ''akasha'' (space) and ''pudgala'' (matter).

====Buddhist philosophy====
{{Main|Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist ethics}}
[[File:Monks debating at Sera monastery, 2013.webm|thumb|Monks debating at [[Sera monastery]], Tibet, 2013.]]
[[Buddhist philosophy]] begins with the thought of [[Gautama Buddha]] (fl. between sixth and fourth centuries BCE) and is preserved in the [[Buddhist texts#Texts of the Early schools|early Buddhist texts]]. It originated in India and later spread to [[East Asia]], [[Tibet]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]], developing syncretic traditions in these regions. The Buddhist philosophy is traditionally classified into four schools, states Karl Potter – the editor of ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies''. These are the Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, Yogacara (or Vijnanavada), and Madhyamika schools. They contributed to the two major surviving traditions of Buddhism, the Mahayana and the Theravada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karl Potter| title=A Fresh Classification of India’s Philosophical Systems|journal = Journal of Asian Studies|volume=21| issue=1|year=1961| pages=25-32|jstor=2050985}}, Quote: "Within Buddhist philosophy there is also a traditional classification into four schools — Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, Yogacara (or Vijnanavada), and Madhyamika."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahayana form of Buddhist thought is the dominant philosophical tradition in East Asian regions such as [[China]], [[South Korea|Korea]] and [[Japan]]. The Theravada form is dominant in Southeast Asian countries such as [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]]. Buddhist philosophy incorporates epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and psychology to end rebirth and associated [[dukkha]]. Key innovative concepts include the [[Four Noble Truths]], [[Anatta]] (not-self), [[Anicca]] (impermanence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ| year=2006| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}, '''Quote:''' "All phenomenal existence [in Buddhism] is said to have three interlocking characteristics: impermanence, suffering and lack of soul or essence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E. Buswell Jr.|author2=Donald S. Lopez Jr.|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXN2AAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-4805-8|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Buddhist philosophical traditions developed complex phenomenological psychologies termed '[[Abhidharma]]'. [[Mahayana]] philosophers such as [[Nagarjuna]] and [[Vasubandhu]] developed the theories of [[Shunyata]] (emptiness of all phenomena) and Vijnapti-matra (appearance only), a form of phenomenology or [[transcendental idealism]]. The [[Dignāga]] school of [[Pramāṇa]] promoted a complex form of [[epistemology]] and [[Buddhist logic]]. After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the [[Tibetan Buddhist]], [[East Asian Buddhist]] and [[Theravada Buddhist]] traditions.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

They represent a "collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection", according to Chadha.&lt;ref&gt;M Chadha (2015), The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion (Editor: Graham Oppy), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1844658312}}, pages 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; They also reflect a tolerance for a diversity of philosophical interpretations within Hinduism while sharing the same foundation.&lt;ref name="Sharma1990p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=A Hindu Perspective on the Philosophy of Religion|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jKewCwAAQBAJ|year=1990|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-20797-8|pages=1–2}}, Quote: "The attitude towards the existence of God varies within the Hindu religious tradition.

Some of the earliest surviving Hindu mystical and philosophical texts are the [[Upanishads]] of the [[Vedic period#Later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE)|later Vedic period]] (1000–500 BCE). Hindu philosophers of the six schools developed systems of epistemology ([[pramana]]) and investigated topics such as metaphysics, ethics, psychology (''guna''), [[hermeneutics]] and [[soteriology]] within the framework of the Vedic knowledge, while presenting a diverse collection of interpretations.&lt;ref name=frazierintrop2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=Jessica|title=The Continuum companion to Hindu studies | date=2011|publisher=Continuum| location=London|isbn=978-0-8264-9966-0|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|978-0813540689}}, pages 101-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 245-248;&lt;br&gt;John A.

It is certainly its most distinct, as has been pointed out by G.P. Malalasekera: "In its denial of any real permanent Soul or Self, Buddhism stands alone." A similar modern Sinhalese perspective has been expressed by Walpola Rahula: "Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence of such a Soul, Self or Ātman." The "no Self" or "no soul" doctrine (Sanskrit: anātman; Pāli: anattan) is particularly notable for its widespread acceptance and historical endurance. It was a standard belief of virtually all the ancient schools of Indian Buddhism (the notable exception being the Pudgalavādins), and has persisted without change into the modern era. [...] both views are mirrored by the modern Theravādin perspective of Mahasi Sayadaw that "there is no person or soul" and the modern Mahāyāna view of the fourteenth Dalai Lama that "[t]he Buddha taught that … our belief in an independent self is the root cause of all suffering".&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the teachings and enlightenment of [[Gautama Buddha]].

East Asian philosophical thought began in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] begins during the [[Western Zhou]] Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]" flourished (6th century to 221 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Garfield  (Editor), Edelglass (Editor); ''The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy'', Chinese philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pe"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ebrey |first=Patricia|year=2010 |page= 42|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major philosophical schools of China, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Daoism]] as well as numerous other less influential schools. These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories such  [[Tao]], [[Yin and yang]], [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]] and [[Li (Confucianism)|Li]] which, along with [[Chinese Buddhism]], directly influenced [[Korean philosophy]], [[Vietnamese philosophy]] and [[Japanese philosophy]] (which also includes the native [[Shinto]] tradition). Buddhism began arriving in China during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), through a [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|gradual Silk road transmission]] and through native influences developed distinct Chinese forms (such as Chan/[[Zen]]) which spread throughout the [[East Asian cultural sphere]]. During later Chinese dynasties like the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644) as well as in the Korean [[Joseon dynasty]] (1392–1897) a resurgent [[Neo-Confucianism]] led by thinkers such as [[Wang Yangming]] (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought, and was promoted by the imperial state.

In the Modern era, Chinese thinkers incorporated ideas from Western philosophy. [[Chinese Marxist philosophy]] developed under the influence of [[Mao Zedong]], while a Chinese pragmatism under [[Hu Shih]] and [[New Confucianism]]'s rise was influenced by [[Xiong Shili]]. Modern Japanese thought meanwhile developed under strong Western influences such as the study of Western Sciences ([[Rangaku]]) and the modernist [[Meirokusha]] intellectual society which drew from European enlightenment thought. The 20th century saw the rise of [[State Shinto]] and also [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|Japanese nationalism]]. The [[Kyoto School]], an influential and unique Japanese philosophical school developed from Western phenomenology and Medieval Japanese Buddhist philosophy such as that of [[Dogen]].

===African philosophy===
{{Main|African philosophy}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Frantz Fanon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Frantz Fanon]].]] --&gt;
African philosophy is philosophy produced by [[African people]], philosophy that presents African worldviews, ideas and themes, or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods. Modern African thought has been occupied with [[Ethnophilosophy]], with defining the very meaning of African philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be [[African people|African]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce B. Janz, Philosophy in an African Place (2009), pp. 74–79, Plymouth, UK: Lexington Books, https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0739136682&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, [[Ethiopian philosophy]] developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]]. Another early African philosopher was [[Anton Wilhelm Amo]] (c. 1703–1759) who became a respected philosopher in Germany. Distinct African philosophical ideas include [[Ujamaa]], the Bantu idea of [[Bantu Philosophy|'Force']], [[Négritude]], [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]]. Contemporary African thought has also seen the development of Professional philosophy and of [[Africana philosophy]], the philosophical literature of the [[African diaspora]] which includes currents such as [[black existentialism]] by [[African-Americans]]. Modern African thinkers have been influenced by [[Marxism]], [[African-American literature]], [[Critical theory]], [[Critical race theory]], [[Postcolonialism]] and [[Feminism]].

===Indigenous American philosophy===
{{Main|Indigenous American philosophy}}
[[File:1479 Stein der fünften Sonne, sog. Aztekenkalender, Ollin Tonatiuh anagoria.JPG|thumb|The Aztec [[Aztec calendar stone|Sun Stone]], also known as the Aztec Calendar Stone, at [[National Museum of Anthropology]], [[Mexico City]].]]
Indigenous American philosophy is the philosophy of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas]]. There is a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among these different American cultures. Among some of the [[Native Americans in the United States]] there is a belief in a metaphysical principle called the "Great Mystery" ([[Siouan]]: [[Wakan Tanka]], [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]: [[Gitche Manitou]]). Another widely shared concept was that of [[Orenda]] or "spiritual power". According to Peter M. Whiteley, for the Native Americans, "Mind is critically informed by transcendental experience (dreams, visions and so on) as well as by reason."&lt;ref name="rep.routledge.com"&gt;Whiteley; Native American philosophy, https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/native-american-philosophy/v-1&lt;/ref&gt; The practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed [[Shamanism]]. Another feature of the indigenous American worldviews was their extension of ethics to non-human animals and plants.&lt;ref name="rep.routledge.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierotti, Raymond; Communities as both Ecological and Social entities in Native American thought, http://www.se.edu/nas/files/2013/03/5thNAScommunities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mesoamerica]], [[Aztec philosophy]] was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called [[Tlamatini]] ('those who know something') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OI9J7R-R1awC&amp;q=120#v=onepage&amp;q=Tlamatini&amp;f=false |title=Use of "Tlamatini" in ''Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind – Miguel León Portilla'' |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its ideas are preserved in various [[Aztec codices]]. The Aztec worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called [[Ometeotl]] which can be translated as "Dual Cosmic Energy" and sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing, "slippery" world. The theory of Teotl can be seen as a form of [[Pantheism]].&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;IEP, Aztec Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/aztec/&lt;/ref&gt; Aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics, epistemology, values, and aesthetics. Aztec ethics was focused on seeking ''tlamatiliztli'' (knowledge, wisdom) which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the Nahua proverb "the middle good is necessary".&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

The [[Inca civilization]] also had an elite class of philosopher-scholars termed the Amawtakuna who were important in the [[Inca education]] system as teachers of religion, tradition, history and ethics. Key concepts of Andean thought are [[Yanantin]] and [[Yanantin#Masintin|Masintin]] which involve a theory of “complementary opposites” that sees polarities (such as male/female, dark/light) as interdependent parts of a harmonious whole.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Hillary S.; Yanantin and Masintin in the Andean World: Complementary Dualism in Modern Peru Hardcover – March 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories ==
Philosophical questions can be grouped into categories. These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions. The groupings also make philosophy easier for students to approach. Students can learn the basic principles involved in one aspect of the field without being overwhelmed with the entire set of philosophical theories.

Various sources present different categorical schemes. The categories adopted in this article aim for breadth and simplicity.

These five major branches can be separated into sub-branches and each sub-branch contains many specific fields of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consc.net/taxonomy.html|title=A Taxonomy of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]
* [[Value theory]]
* Science, [[logic]] and mathematics
* History of Western philosophy{{sfn|Kenny|2012}}
* Philosophical traditions

These divisions are neither exhaustive, nor mutually exclusive. (A philosopher might specialize in [[Kant]]ian epistemology, or [[Plato]]nic aesthetics, or modern political philosophy.) Furthermore, these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science, religion or mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/religion-science/|title=Religion and Science|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|date=2014|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysics ===
{{Main|Metaphysics}}

Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of [[reality]], such as [[existence]], [[time]], [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and their [[Property (philosophy)|properties]], wholes and their parts, events, processes and [[Causality|causation]] and the relationship between [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]]. Metaphysics includes [[cosmology]], the study of the [[world]] in its entirety and [[ontology]], the study of [[being]].

A major point of debate is between [[Philosophical realism|realism]], which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception and [[idealism]], which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial. Metaphysics deals with the topic of [[Personal identity|identity]]. [[Essence]] is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]] is a property that the object has, without which the object can still retain its identity. [[Particular]]s are objects that are said to exist in space and time, as opposed to [[abstract object]]s, such as numbers, and [[universals]], which are properties held by multiple particulars, such as redness or a gender. The type of existence, if any, of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate.

=== Epistemology ===
{{Main|Epistemology}}
[[File:Dignaga.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Dignaga]] founded a school of [[Buddhist logic|Buddhist epistemology and logic]].]]
Epistemology is the study of knowledge (Greek episteme).&lt;ref name="WebsterRUD"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = G &amp; C. Merriam Co. |author1-link = Merriam-Webster |title = Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |edition = 1913 |editors = Noah Porter |publisher = G &amp; C. Merriam Co. |year = 1913 |page = 501 |url = http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=epistemology&amp;use1913=on |accessdate = 13 May 2012 |quote = E*pis`te*mol"o*gy (?), n. [Gr. knowledge + -logy.] The theory or science of the method or grounds of knowledge. |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131015165808/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=epistemology&amp;use1913=on |archivedate = 15 October 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epistemologists study the putative sources of knowledge, including intuition, a priori reason, memory, perceptual knowledge, self-knowledge and testimony. They also ask: What is [[truth]]? Is knowledge justified true belief? Are any beliefs [[Theory of justification|justified]]? Putative knowledge includes propositional knowledge (knowledge that something is the case), know-how (knowledge of how to do something) and acquaintance (familiarity with someone or something). Epistemologists examine these and ask whether knowledge is really possible.

[[Philosophical skepticism|Skepticism]] is the position which doubts claims to knowledge. The [[regress argument]], a fundamental problem in epistemology, occurs when, in order to completely prove any statement, its justification itself needs to be supported by another justification. This chain can go on forever, called [[infinitism]], it can eventually rely on [[basic beliefs]] that are left unproven, called [[foundationalism]], or it can go in a circle so that a statement is included in its own chain of justification, called [[coherentism]].

[[Rationalism]] is the emphasis on reasoning as a source of knowledge. It is associated with [[a priori knowledge]], which is independent of experience, such as math and logical deduction. [[Empiricism]] is the emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge.

Among the numerous topics within metaphysics and epistemology, broadly construed are:
* [[Philosophy of language]] explores the nature, the origins and the use of language.
* [[Philosophy of mind]] explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body. It is typified by disputes between [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and [[materialism]]. In recent years this branch has become related to [[cognitive science]].
* [[Human nature|Philosophy of human nature]] analyzes the unique characteristics of human beings, such as rationality, politics and culture.
* [[Metaphilosophy]] explores the aims of philosophy, its boundaries and its methods.

=== Value theory ===
Value theory (or [[axiology]]) is the major branch of philosophy that addresses topics such as goodness, beauty and justice. Value theory includes ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, feminist philosophy, philosophy of law and more.

==== Ethics ====
{{Main|Ethics}}
[[File:BeijingConfuciusTemple9.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|The [[Beijing]] [[Guozijian (Beijing)|imperial college]] was an intellectual center for Confucian ethics and classics during the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties.]]
Ethics, or "moral philosophy", studies and considers what is good and bad [[Action (philosophy)|conduct]], right and [[wrong]] [[values (philosophy)|values]], and [[good and evil]]. Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of [[morality]]. It also includes [[Meta-analysis|meta-investigations]] about whether a best way to live or related standards exists. The main branches of ethics are [[normative ethics]], [[meta-ethics]]  and [[applied ethics]].

A major area of debate involves [[consequentialism]], in which actions are judged by the potential results of the act, such as to maximize happiness, called [[utilitarianism]], and [[deontology]], in which actions are judged by how they adhere to principles, irrespective of negative ends.

==== Aesthetics ====
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
Aesthetics is the "critical reflection on art, culture and [[nature]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1998) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlisna.org/artdoc/vol18/iss2/01.pdf Review] by Tom Riedel ([[Regis University]])&lt;/ref&gt; It addresses the nature of [[art]], [[beauty]] and [[Taste (sociology)|taste]], enjoyment, emotional values, perception and with the creation and appreciation of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aesthetic|title=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aesthetics Definition 1 of ''aesthetics''] from the [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] Online.&lt;/ref&gt; It is more precisely defined as the study of [[Senses|sensory]] or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called [[judgment]]s of [[Feeling|sentiment]] and taste.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Nick. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/ Aesthetic Judgment]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 02-28-2003/10-22-2007. Retrieved 24 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Its major divisions are art theory, [[literary theory]], [[film theory]] and [[music theory]]. An example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the [[Cubist]] aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/aesthetic|title=aesthetic – definition of aesthetic in English from the Oxford dictionary|website=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[philosophy of film]] analyzes films and filmmakers for their philosophical content and explores film (images, cinema, etc.) as a medium for philosophical reflection and expression.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==== Political philosophy ====
{{Main|Political philosophy}}
[[File:Thomas_Hobbes_(portrait).jpg|left|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]]]]

Political philosophy is the study of [[government]] and the relationship of individuals (or families and clans) to communities including the [[State (polity)|state]]. It includes questions about justice, law, property and the rights and obligations of the citizen. Politics and ethics are traditionally linked subjects, as both discuss the question of how people should live together.

Other branches of value theory:
* [[Philosophy of law]] (often called [[jurisprudence]]) explores the varying theories explaining the nature and interpretation of laws.
* [[Philosophy of education]] analyzes the definition and content of education, as well as the goals and challenges of educators.
* [[Feminist philosophy]] explores questions surrounding gender, sexuality and the body including the nature of [[feminism]] itself as a social and philosophical movement.
* [[Philosophy of sport]] analyzes sports, games and other forms of play as sociological and uniquely human activities.

=== Logic, science and mathematics ===
Many academic disciplines generated philosophical inquiry. The relationship between "X" and the "philosophy of X" is debated. [[Richard Feynman]] argued that the philosophy of a topic is irrelevant to its primary study, saying that "[[philosophy of science]] is as useful to scientists as [[ornithology]] is to birds." [[Curtis White (author)|Curtis White]], by contrast, argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities, sciences and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Science Delusion: Asking the Big Questions in a Culture of Easy Answers|last=White|first=Curtis|date=2014|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=e2mPgcXPNNIC}}|publisher=Melville House|isbn=9781612193908|location=Brooklyn, NY|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The topics of philosophy of science are [[number]]s, symbols and the formal methods of reasoning as employed in the [[social science]]s and [[natural sciences]].

==== Logic ====
{{Main|Logic}}Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. An argument is "''a'' ''connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition''." The connected series of statements are "[[premise]]s" and the proposition is the conclusion. For example:
# All humans are mortal. (premise)
# Socrates is a human. (premise)
# Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion)
[[Deductive reasoning]] is when, given certain premises, conclusions are [[Logical consequence|unavoidably implied]]. [[Rules of inference]] are used to infer conclusions such as, [[modus ponens]], where given “A” and “If A then B”, then “B” must be concluded.

Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carnap|first=Rudolf|date=1953|title="Inductive Logic and Science"|jstor=20023651|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume=80|issue=3|pages=189–197|doi=10.2307/20023651|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; social sciences and humanities disciplines, logic became a [[formal science]]. Sub-fields include [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophical logic]], [[Modal logic]], [[computational logic]] and [[non-classical logic]]s. A major question in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] is whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered, called mathematical realism, or invented, called mathematical antirealism.

==== Philosophy of science ====
{{Main|Philosophy of science}}
This branch explores the foundations, methods, history, implications and purpose of science. Many of its sub-divisions correspond to a specific branch of science. For example, [[philosophy of biology]] deals specifically with the metaphysical, epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences. The [[philosophy of mathematics]] studies the philosophical assumptions, foundations and implications of mathematics.

=== History of philosophy ===
{{See also|Metaphilosophy|History of ethics}}
{{further|Philosophical progress|List of years in philosophy}}
Some philosophers specialize in one or more historical periods. The history of philosophy (study of a specific period, individual or school) is related to but not the same as the [[philosophy of history]] (the theoretical aspect of history, which deals with questions such as the nature of historical evidence and the possibility of objectivity).

Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'' influenced many philosophers to interpret truth in light of history, a view called [[historicism]].

=== Philosophy of religion ===
{{Main|Philosophy of religion}}

Philosophy of religion deals with questions that involve [[religion]] and religious ideas from a philosophically neutral perspective (as opposed to [[theology]] which begins from religious convinctions).&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590855/theology/14945/Relationship-to-philosophy Theology; Relationship of theology to the history of religions and philosophy; Relationship to philosophy.]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, religious questions were not seen as a separate field from philosophy proper, the idea of a separate field only arose in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, WJ., [https://books.google.com/books?id=GbcuCf9TlDgC&amp;dq=oxford+handbook+Philosophy+religion&amp;q=%22come+into+general%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22come%20into%20general%22&amp;f=false ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion''], Oxford Handbooks Online, 2004, p. 3. "The expression “philosophy of religion” did not come into general use until the nineteenth century, when it was employed to refer to the articulation and criticism of humanity's religious consciousness and its cultural expressions in thought, language, feeling, and practice."&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues include the [[existence of God]], the relationship between reason and [[faith]], questions of [[religious epistemology]], the [[relationship between religion and science]], how to interpret [[religious experiences]], questions about the possibility of an [[afterlife]], the [[problem of religious language]] and the existence of [[souls]] and responses to [[religious pluralism]] and diversity.

=== Philosophical schools ===
Some philosophers specialize in one or more of the major philosophical schools, such as [[Continental philosophy]], [[Analytical philosophy]], [[Thomism]], [[Asian philosophy]] or [[African philosophy]].

== Other approaches ==
A variety of other academic and non-academic approaches have been explored.

=== Applied philosophy {{anchor|Applied philosophy}} ===
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of academic disciplines]] and target of redirect [[Applied philosophy]] --&gt;
[[File:Martin Luther King Jr NYWTS.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Martin Luther King Jr]] ]]
The ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs. [[Richard M. Weaver|Weaver]] argued that ideas have consequences. Philosophy yields applications such as those in [[ethics]] – [[applied ethics]] in particular – and [[political philosophy]]. The political and economic philosophies of [[Confucius]], [[Sun Tzu]], [[Chanakya]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Ibn Rushd]], [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Adam Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions. Progressive education as championed by [[John Dewey|Dewey]] had a profound impact on 20th-century US educational practices. Descendants of this movement include efforts in [[philosophy for children]], which are part of [[philosophy education]]. [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]]'s political [[philosophy of war]] has had a profound effect on [[Public administration|statecraft]], [[international politics]] and [[military strategy]] in the 20th century, especially around [[World War II]]. Logic is important in [[mathematics]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering]].

Other important applications can be found in [[epistemology]], which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge, sound evidence and justified belief (important in [[law]], [[economics]], [[decision theory]] and a number of other disciplines). The [[philosophy of science]] discusses the underpinnings of the [[scientific method]] and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation. Philosophy thus has fundamental implications for science as a whole. For example, the strictly empirical approach of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment. [[Deep ecology]] and [[animal rights]] examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non-human occupants to consider also. [[Aesthetics]] can help to interpret discussions of [[music]], [[literature]], the [[plastic arts]] and the whole artistic dimension of life. In general, the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields.

== Society ==
Some of those who study philosophy become professional philosophers, typically by working as [[professor]]s who teach, research and write in academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/where-can-philosophy-take-me|title=Where Can Philosophy Take Me? {{!}} Philosophy|website=philosophy.as.uky.edu|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law, journalism, religion, sciences, politics, business, or various arts.&lt;ref name="whystudyphilosophy.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/26/business/philosophers-find-the-degree-pays-off-in-life-and-in-work.html|title=Philosophers Find the Degree Pays Off in Life And in Work|last=Cropper|first=Carol Marie|date=1997-12-26|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, public figures who have degrees in philosophy include comedians [[Steve Martin]] and [[Ricky Gervais]], filmmaker [[Terrence Malick]], [[Pope John Paul II]], Wikipedia co-founder [[Larry Sanger]], technology entrepreneur [[Peter Thiel]], Supreme Court Justice [[Stephen Breyer|Stephen Bryer]] and vice presidential candidate [[Carly Fiorina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mansfield.edu/philosophy/famous-philosophy-majors.cfm|title=Famous Philosophy Majors {{!}} Mansfield University|last=Marketing|first=Mansfield University Department of|website=www.mansfield.edu|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailynous.com/2014/12/08/famous-philosophy-majors-poster/|title=Famous Philosophy Majors Poster (updated with new link)|last=W|first=Justin|date=2014-12-08|website=Daily Nous|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent efforts to avail the general public to the work and relevance of philosophers include the million-dollar [[Berggruen Prize for Philosophy|Berggruen Prize]], first awarded to [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/books/canadian-philosopher-wins-1-million-prize.html|title=Canadian Philosopher Wins $1 Million Prize|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|date=October 4, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional==
Germany was the first country to professionalize philosophy. The [[doctorate of philosophy|doctorate of philosophy (PhD)]] developed in Germany as the terminal Teacher's credential in the mid 17th century.&lt;ref name=EWG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |title=Erhard-Weigel-Gesellschaft: Biographie Weigels |website=Erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de |date= |accessdate=2016-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124147/http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |archivedate=2016-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1817, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was the first philosopher to be appointed Professor by the State, namely by the Prussian Minister of Education, as an effect of Napoleonic reform in Prussia. In the United States, the professionalisation grew out of reforms to the American higher-education system largely based on the German model.

[[File:Honourable_Bertrand_Russell.jpg|thumb|[[Bertrand Russell]]]]
Within the last century, philosophy has increasingly become a professional discipline practiced within universities, like other academic disciplines. Accordingly, it has become less general and more specialized. In the view of one prominent recent historian: "Philosophy has become a highly organized discipline, done by specialists primarily for other specialists. The number of philosophers has exploded, the volume of publication has swelled, and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied. Not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind, something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields."&lt;ref name="philosophical16"/&gt; Some philosophers argue that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/socrates-tenured|title=Socrates Tenured – Rowman &amp; Littlefield International|website=www.rowmaninternational.com|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end result of professionalization for philosophy has meant that work being done in the field is now almost exclusively done by university professors holding a doctorate in the field publishing in highly technical, peer-reviewed journals. While it remains common among the population at large for a person to have a set of religious, political or philosophical views that they consider their "philosophy", these views are rarely informed by or connected to the work being done in professional philosophy today. Furthermore, unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books, magazines, and television shows meant to popularize science and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace, works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare. Philosopher [[Michael Sandel]]'s book ''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?'' and [[Harry Frankfurt]]'s ''[[On Bullshit]]'' are examples of works that hold the uncommon distinction of having been written by professional philosophers but directed at and ultimately popular among a broader audience of non-philosophers. Both works became '''New York Times'' best sellers.

==Non-professional==
Many inquiries outside of academia are philosophical in the broad sense. Novelists, playwrights, filmmakers, and musicians, as well as scientists and others engage in recognizably philosophical activity.

[[Ayn Rand]] is the foremost example of an intellectual working contemporaneously with contemporary philosophy but whose contributions were not made within the professional discipline of "philosophy": "For all her [Ayn Rand's] popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in non-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the bibliography reflects this fact."[15]

Also working from outside the profession were philosophers such as [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] (''Die reine und die praktische Philosophie. Drei Vorträge zur philosophischen'' Praxis, 1983) and [[Michel Weber]] (see his ''Épreuve de la philosophie'', 2008) who have proposed since the 1980s various forms of philosophical counseling claiming to bring Socratic dialogues back to life in a quasi-psychotherapeutic framework.

[[Pierre Hadot]] is famous for his analysis on the conception of philosophy during Greco-Roman antiquity. Hadot identified and analyzed the "spiritual exercises" used in ancient philosophy (influencing Michel Foucault's interest in such practices in the second and third volumes of his History of Sexuality). By "spiritual exercises" Hadot means "practices ... intended to effect a modification and a transformation in the subjects who practice them.[6] The philosophy teacher's discourse could be presented in such a way that the disciple, as auditor, reader, or interlocutor, could make spiritual progress and transform himself within."[7] Hadot shows that the key to understanding the original philosophical impulse is to be found in Socrates. What characterizes Socratic therapy above all is the importance given to living contact between human beings. Hadot's recurring theme is that philosophy in antiquity was characterized by a series of spiritual exercises intended to transform the perception, and therefore the being, of those who practice it; that philosophy is best pursued in real conversation and not through written texts and lectures; and that philosophy, as it is taught in universities today, is for the most part a distortion of its original, therapeutic impulse. He brings these concerns together in ''What Is Ancient Philosophy?'',[7] which has been critically reviewed.[8]

==Role of women==
{{Main|Women in philosophy}}
[[File:Langer.Susanne.foto 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|American philosopher of mind and philosopher of art [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985).]]
Although men have generally dominated philosophical discourse, women have engaged in philosophy throughout history. [[Women in philosophy|Women philosophers]] have contributed since ancient times–notably [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active c. 325 BCE) and [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BCE). More were accepted during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]] and [[Modern philosophy|modern]] eras, but no women philosophers became part the [[Western canon]] until the 20th and 21st century, when some sources indicate that [[Susanne Langer]], [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] entered the canon.&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane.

In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], producing more female academics. Nevertheless, [[U.S. Department of Education]] reports from the 1990s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy, and that philosophy is one of the least gender-proportionate fields in the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"&gt;"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities."National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000–173; 1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93).

U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 97-973;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF-93).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline's own long history of [[misogyny]] and [[sexual harassment]]" of women students and professors.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/19/unofficial-internet-campaign-outs-professor-alleged-sexual-harassment-attempted|title=Unofficial Internet campaign outs professor for alleged sexual harassment, attempted assault|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Sheffield]] philosophy professor [[Jennifer Saul]] stated in 2015 that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jan/05/philosophy-is-for-posh-white-boys-with-trust-funds-why-are-there-so-few-women|title=Philosophy is for posh, white boys with trust funds' – why are there so few women?|first1=Rebecca|last1=Ratcliffe|first2=Claire|last2=Shaw|date=5 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] noted a gender imbalance and [[gender bias]] in the academic field of philosophy.&lt;ref name="nas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/women_in_philosophy_problems_with_the_discrimination_hypothesis|title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis |publisher=National Association of Scholars}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Neven |last1=Sesardic |first2=Rafael |last2=De Clercq |title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis |doi= 10.1007/s12129-014-9464-x|journal=Academic Questions|volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=461 |year=2014 |url=http://www.ln.edu.hk/philoso/staff/sesardic/WIP-AQ.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males – the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/reviving-the-female-canon/393110/|title=Reviving the Female Canon|first=Susan|last=Price|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan Thompson suggests that discrimination, differences in abilities, grade differences and the lack of role models in philosophy could be potential factors for the gender gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Morgan|date=2017-03-01|title=Explanations of the gender gap in philosophy|journal=Philosophy Compass|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=n/a|doi=10.1111/phc3.12406|issn=1747-9991}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the [[humanities]], is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|first=Jennifer M.|last=Saul|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
In 2000, the [[Open Court Publishing Company]] began publishing a series of books on philosophy and [[popular culture]]. Each book consists of essays written by philosophers for general readers. The books "explore the meanings, concepts and puzzles within television shows, movies, music and other icons of popular culture"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opencourtbooks.com/categories/pcp.htm|title=Popular Culture and Philosophy|website=www.opencourtbooks.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzing topics such as the TV shows ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies and related media and new technological developments such as the [[iPod]] and [[Facebook]]. Their most recent publication ({{As of|2016|lc=y}}) is titled ''Louis C.K. and Philosophy''; its subject is the comedian [[Louis C.K.]].

''[[The Matrix]]'' makes numerous references to philosophy including [[Buddhism]], [[Vedanta]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Messianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]. The film's premise resembles [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave|Allegory of the cave]], Descartes's [[evil demon]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reflections on the [[Phenomenon]] versus the [[Noumenon|Ding an sich]], [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'s "[[Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly]]", Marxist social theory and the [[brain in a vat]] thought experiment. Many references to [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]]'s ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'' appear in the film, although Baudrillard himself considered this a misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm |title=IJBS |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021010544/http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm |archivedate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved.}} in {{harvnb|Honderich|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''philosophy of copyright''' considers philosophical issues linked to [[copyright]] [[policy]], and other [[jurisprudence|jurisprudential]] problems that arise in legal systems' interpretation and application of copyright law.

One debate concerns the purpose of copyright.  Some take the approach of looking for coherent ''justifications'' of established copyright systems, while others start with general ethical theories, such as [[utilitarianism]] and try to analyse policy through that lens.  Another approach denies the meaningfulness of any ethical justification for existing copyright law, viewing it simply as a result (and perhaps an undesirable result) of political processes.

Another widely debated issue is the relationship between [[copyrights]] and other forms of "[[intellectual property]]", and material property.  Most scholars of copyright agree that it can be called a kind of [[property]], because it involves the [[exclusive right|exclusion]] of others from something.  But there is disagreement about the extent to which that fact should allow the transportation of other beliefs and intuitions about material possessions.

There are many other [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions which arise in the jurisprudence of copyright.  They include such problems as determining when one work is "derived" from another, or deciding when information has been placed in a "tangible" or "material" form.

==Justifications for copyright==

Legal scholars often approach copyright in search of a coherent ethical justification for its existence and character.  This approach may seem to be backwards—it might make more sense to start with an objective and then examine the law against it—but it is widely practised.  Thus, the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] or ethical theories that might naively be regarded as tests for copyright law to pass are often called "justifications" of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaver|first=David|title=Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks|year=2011|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-007-9|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justifications for copyright can generally be approximated into two groups: deontological or consequentialist. Deontological justifications for copyright seek to justify copyright as a matter of rights or duty; they seek to assert a justification for copyright (or intellectual property more generally) on the basis that it is morally correct to do so. Contrariwise, consequentialist theories of copyright seek to justify or criticise copyright protection based on the consequences of that protection, by asserting or providing evidence that the protection of copyright produces some desirable effect. Examples of such theories include incentives theories that view intellectual property as a necessary way of incentivising the creation of new creative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dutfield|first=Graham|last2=Suthersanen|first2=Uma|title=Global intellectual property law|year=2008|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham, UK|isbn=978-1-84720-364-9|pages=51–52, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural rights===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Natural rights]] are linked to the logic{{clarify|date=June 2013}} of [[property]]. [[John Locke]] is often cited as an authority, although it is not clear that Locke actually viewed copyright as a natural right.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} {{citation needed span|text=[[Personality rights]] are the basis of German copyright law.This position regards copyrightable works to be extensions of the author's personality. The author is given certain powers to control those works on account of his or her connection to them.|date=June 2013}}

===Morality===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
Proponents of copyright and patent laws believe that morality supports their stance.

=== Economics ===
{{Disputed section|date=June 2013}}
Many economists{{who|date=June 2013}} believe that, {{citation needed span|text=in the absence of intellectual property protections such as [[copyright]] and [[patents]], various types of intangible assets would be under-produced{{according to whom|date=June 2013}}, because there would be [[free-rider problem|insufficient incentives]] for commercial organisations to produce them.|date=June 2013}}  From this perspective, the objective of [[copyright law]] is primarily to balance the public benefits{{how|date=June 2013}} that can arise from the widespread circulation, use and reuse of a copyright work with the need to provide protection, incentive and reward to the creator or owner of the copyright by granting a limited{{clarify|date=June 2013}} [[monopoly]] to exploit the copyright to that body or individual.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Lilley (July 2006) Inside the Creative Industries - Copyright on the ground, [[ippr]],[http://www.ippr.org.uk/publicationsandreports/publication.asp?id=483] {{Unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}

===Consequentialist theories===
Consequentialist theories of copyright hold that we should have the laws that will produce the 'best' results for society.  The most common consequentialist position is [[utilitarianism]], which defines the 'best' situations to be those in which people are in total as happy or fulfilled as possible.  Economists' analyses of copyright tend to follow this philosophical approach.

A related class of theories is called [[instrumentalism]]; it holds that copyright law must exist for clear, coherent and necessary purposes, without being so strict as to require that it maximise some kind of 'goodness' in its outcome.

Some copyright scholars believe that, regardless of contemporary advances in technology, copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works, and that without a significant period of legal protection of their future income, many valuable books and artworks would not be created.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; They argue that the public interest is best served by repeated extension of copyright terms to encompass multiple generations beyond the copyright holder's life, as this increases the present value of the copyright, encouraging the creation for new works and making additional investments in older works (for example, the restoration of old movies) economically viable.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{cite journal| author = Scott M. Martin | date = September 24, 2002 | title = The Mythology of the Public Domain: Exploring the Myths Behind Attacks on the Duration of Copyright Protection | journal = Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review | volume = 36| issue = 1| page = 280| publisher = Loyola Law Review| issn = 1533-5860 | url = http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2343&amp;context=llr| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors' heirs continue to profit if copyrights are enforced post-death and this provides a substantial incentive for continued  fresh work even as authors age.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

The modern, market-driven copyright system provides authors with independent financing (through royalties). Without a feasible way to recoup investments of creative time through copyright, there would be little economic incentive to produce and works would need to be motivated by a desire for fame from already affluent authors or those able to obtain patronage (with associated constraints on independence). Proponents of copyright dispute that copyright erodes precepts for creators to be able to build on published expression pointing to concepts such as [[Scènes à faire]] and [[Idea-expression divide]]. Copyright only protects the artist's expression of his/her work and not the ideas, systems, or factual information conveyed in it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaver|first=David|title=Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks|year=2011|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-007-9|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus artists are free to get ideas from copyrighted works.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

Defenders of the present system of strong copyrights argue that it has been largely successful in financing the creation and distribution of a wide variety of works, especially those requiring significant labor and capital. Moderate scholars seem to support that view while recognizing the need for exceptions and limitations, such as the [[fair use]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaver|first=David|title=Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks|year=2011|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-007-9|page=673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, a substantial portion of the current U.S. Copyright Act (sections 107–120) is devoted to such exceptions and limitations.

====Consequentialism in the United States====

[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] of the [[United States Constitution]] authorizes [[United States Congress|Congress]] to "''promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries''".

Many authors thought that this wording would actually require U.S. copyright laws to serve the purpose of "promoting the progress of science and useful arts". {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In the US in 2003 controversial changes implemented by the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] extending the length of copyright under [[U.S. copyright law]] by 20 years were challenged in the [[United States Supreme Court]]. However, the Court, in the case called [[Eldred v. Ashcroft]], held, ''inter alia'', that in placing existing and future copyrights in parity in the CTEA, Congress acted within its authority and did not transgress constitutional limitations. Other jurisdictions have enacted legislation to provide for similar extensions of the copyright term.

== Opposition to copyright ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Copyright]] --&gt;
{{main article|Anti-copyright}}
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2008}}
[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Anti-copyright demonstration in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], 2006.]]
Critics of copyright as a whole fall broadly into two categories: Those who assert that the very concept of copyright has never benefited society, and has always served simply to enrich a few at the expense of creativity; and those who assert that the existing copyright regime must be reformed to maintain its relevance in the new [[Information society]]. The [[French copyright law|French ''droit d'auteur'']] ("Rights of the Author"), which influenced the 1886 [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]], must also be noted as a significant alternative to the usual Anglo-Saxon concept of copyright.

Among the latter group, there are also some who continue to agree with copyright as a way to grant authors rights, but feel that it "outlives its welcome" by granting copyright for too long (e.g., far beyond the lifetime of the author), and is therefore of little direct benefit to him or her.  The prolongation of copyright term is commonly attributed to effective corporate [[lobbying]], based on a desire for the continuance of a profitable monopoly. In the US, this is often phrased as a conspiracy to 'control the Mouse' (meaning [[Mickey Mouse]], a [[trademark]]ed character controlled by the Disney Company whose early works would have moved into the public domain save for such an extension).

To many critics, the general problem is that the current (international) copyright system undermines its own goal.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The concepts of the [[public domain]] and the intrinsic freedom of information are necessary precepts for creators to be able to build on published expression.  But these are gradually being eroded, as copyright terms are repeatedly extended to last beyond the lifetime of the audience which experienced and knows of the original work.

Another effect of the repeated extension of copyright term is that current authors are shielded from competition from a wide public domain: by the time current works enter the public domain, they will almost always have become obsolete. This reduces the risk of commoditization of topical non-fiction. Out-of-copyright publishing, such as classic literature where margins are very low, generally offers only the best of each genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karjala|first=Dennis|title=About Copyright Term Extension|url=http://www.law.asu.edu/HomePages/Karjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/what.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030827220623/http://www.law.asu.edu/homepages/karjala/opposingcopyrightextension/what.html|archivedate=2003-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Luck|first=Randolph|title=Letter to Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, opposing copyright term extension in the 104th Congress, June 28th 1996|url=http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~dkarjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/letters/Luck%27sMusic01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to current copyright practice also relates to the non-observance of the principal requirement of the original Queen Anne Act, which specified that for a work to obtain copyright a copy had to be deposited in a library of record, so that unlimited copies could be made when the copyright expired. This was observed for many years but was later successfully opposed by the motion picture industry, which refused to provide copies of their films, resulting in the loss of many early films. Civilization experiences a similar loss of ancient documents from being held in private collections until they rot.

The recent success of [[free software]] projects such as [[Linux|GNU/Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and the [[Apache web server]] has demonstrated that quality works can be created even in the absence of a copyright-enforced monopoly rent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.cio.com/consultant/report2214.html&lt;/ref&gt;  These products use copyright to enforce their license terms, which are designed to ensure the free nature of the work, rather than securing exclusive rights for the holder for monetary gain. Such licenses include [[copyleft]], [[free software license|free software]], and [[open source license]]s.

Even in more traditional forms such as prose, some authors, such as [[Cory Doctorow]], retain the copyright to their work but license it for free distribution (for example under a [[Creative Commons license]]).  This has the benefit of providing a structured scheme under which authors can loosen some of the barriers that copyright imposes on others, allowing them to partially contribute the work to the community (in the form of giving a general grant on copying, reproduction, use or adaptation subject to certain conditions) while retaining other exclusive rights they hold in it.

Copyright can also be used to stifle political criticism. For example, in the US the contents of talk shows and similar programs are covered by copyright. [[Robert Greenwald]], a director of ''Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War'' documentary was refused the right to use a clip of a [[George W. Bush]] interview from [[NBC]]'s ''Meet the Press''. Although the fair use provisions of statute and common law may apply in such cases, the risks of loss in court should there be a lawsuit and pressure from insurance companies, who regard use of almost anything (e.g., three words forming the opening of a song,) without permission as too risky, usually precludes use of materials without explicit permission, and so without a license fee.

Copyright is also conceived by some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Electronic Frontier Foundation|url=https://www.eff.org/work}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be an artificial barrier in that "expressions" could be freely exchanged between individuals and groups if there were no copyright or other legal restrictions preventing. Such people believe that as the [[State (polity)|state]] does not necessarily possess the [[moral authority]] to enact copyright laws, individuals may vary in their observation of such laws. Others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Copyright Alliance|url=http://www.copyrightalliance.org/issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Motion Picture Association of America|url=http://www.mpaa.org/contentprotection/copyright-info}}&lt;/ref&gt; disagree, believing that copyright (which in the United States system, for instance, arises from provisions in the U.S. Constitution), has made and continues to make a valuable even essential contribution to the creation and dissemination of works. They also point out the social dangers inherent in the view that each individual is entitled to judge the "moral authority" of laws and to observe them or not according to individual judgments.

==Modern challenges to copyright==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=March 2017}}
Copyright concepts are under challenge in the modern era, primarily from the increasing use of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]]. Major copyright holders, such as the major [[record labels]] and the [[major film studios|movie industry]], blame the ease of copying for their decreasing profits. Alternative explanations have been put forward, such as poor product content and excessive license charges.

In the United States [[public interest]] groups, major corporations and the like, are entering the public education system to teach the curriculum from their perspectives. The lobbying group for the [[MPAA]] provide a curriculum entitled ''What's the Diff?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediainfocenter.org/story.asp?story_id=61684893 What's the Diff?]&lt;/ref&gt; taught by a group of volunteers called Junior Achievement. The [[Business Software Alliance]] also has their own curriculum program called ''Play it Cybersafe'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playitcybersafe.com Play it Cybersafe]&lt;/ref&gt; which is distributed to school children through a magazine called ''[[The Weekly Reader]]''. The American Librarian Association released their own curriculum for librarians that was distributed in the winter of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org The American Librarian Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy of psychedelics''' is the philosophical investigation of the [[psychedelic experience]]. While [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]], [[entheogenic]] or [[hallucinogenic]] substances have been used by many traditional cultures throughout history mostly for religious purposes, recorded philosophical speculation and analysis of these substances, their [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] effects and the relevance of these [[altered states of consciousness]] to philosophical questions is a relatively late phenomenon in the [[history of philosophy]]. Traditional cultures who use psychedelic substances such as the Amazonian and [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Indigenous Mexican]] peoples hold that ingesting medicinal plants such as [[Ayahuasca]] and [[Peyote]] allows one to commune with the beings of the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]].

The Indian Yogi and scholar [[Patanjali]] in his Yoga sutras mentions that mystic powers (''siddhaya'') can arise from certain "herbs" or "healing plants"&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Anthony Macdonell, Arthur Berriedale; Vedic Index of Names and Subjects, Volume 1; Volume 5&lt;/ref&gt; (''osadhi''):

:janmauṣadhi-mantra-tapaḥ samādhi jāḥ siddhayaḥ||
:The mystic powers arise due to birth, herbs, [[mantras]], the performance of austerity and [[samadhi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin F.; The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali: A New Edition, Translation, and Commentary, chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

Later commentators on the Yoga sutras like [[Vyasa]] mention elixirs of the [[asuras]], and also state these herbal concoctions can be found in this world. [[Adi Shankara]] meanwhile refers to the Vedic drink [[Soma (drink)|Soma]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin F.; The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali: A New Edition, Translation, and Commentary, chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vajrayana]] Buddhist [[Tantras]] mention the nectar "[[amrita]]" (literally "immortal", "deathless") which was drunk during rituals and which is associated in the tradition with 'spiritual intoxication'.&lt;ref&gt;Gimian, Carolyn Rose; The Essential Chogyam Trungpa, Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; A biography of the scholar [[Gampopa]] mentions how one of his teachers stated that "You can obtain [[Buddhahood]]: by taking a medicine pill which will make you immortal like the sun and moon."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, J. M. The Life of Gampopa, The Incomparable Dharma Lord of Tibet, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, N. Y., USA, 1995, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reference to the Vajrayana practice of [[rasayana]] (Skt: "alchemy") to create certain potions or pills. According to M.L. Walter's study of Indo-Tibetan rasayana, ingestion of these substances were said to "strengthen the yogin and procure the [[siddhi]] for him, as well as bringing him to the final goal." &lt;ref&gt;Walter, M. L, Preliminary Results from a study of two Rasayana systems in Indo-Tibetan Esoterism published in Tibetan Studies in Honour of Hugh Richardson (M. Aris, ed.), Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd., Warminster, England 1980, page 319&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mike Crowley there are two traditions of Indo Tibetan-rasayana preserved in Tibet, one founded by [[Padmasambhava]] and the other by his contemporary, [[Vimalamitra]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Mike; When the Gods Drank Urine A Tibetan myth may help solve the riddle of soma, sacred drug of ancient India, Fortean Studies, vol. III, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Chogyam Trungpa]] (1939 – 1987), a modern teacher is the [[Kagyu]] tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;amrita... is used in conferring the second abhisheka, the secret abhisheka. This transmission dissolves the student's mind into the mind of the teacher of the lineage. In general, amrita is the principle of intoxicating extreme beliefs, belief in ego, and dissolving the boundary between confusion and sanity so that coemergence can be realized.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, C.; Sacred Outlook: The Vajrayogini Shrine and Practice (in The Silk Route and the Diamond Path, D. E. Klimburg-Salter, editor ), UCLA Art Council, Los Angeles, 1982, page 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==19th century==
European literature such as [[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]] by [[Thomas De Quincey]] (one of the first English commentators on [[Kant]])&lt;ref&gt;Stirling, James Hutchison (1867). "De Quincey and Coleridge Upon Kant," Fortnightly Review, Vol. 8, pp. 377–97.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s [[Kubla Khan]] described the use and phenomenal character of mind-altering substances such as [[Opium]]. De Quincey held that [[Opium]] allowed one to access the earliest of memories and that therefore no memories were ever truly forgotten:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The minutest incidents of childhood, or forgotten scenes of later years, were often revived: I could not be said to recollect them; for if I had been told of them when waking, I should not have been able to acknowledge them as parts of my past experience. But placed as they were before me, in dreams like intuitions, and clothed in all their evanescent circumstances and accompanying feelings, I recognized them instantaneously […] I feel assured that there is no such thing as forgetting possible to the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Quincey, Thomas de.  Confessions of an English Opium-Eater and Other Writings.London: Penguin Books, 2003, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jacques-Joseph Moreau, who reported his experiments with mental patients and drugs, believed that “the hashish experience was a way to gain insight into mental disease.”&lt;ref&gt;Nahas, Gabriel G.  Marihuana—Deceptive Weed.  New York: Raven Press, 1973. see: Baudelaire on Drugs : Marijuana Consumption in the Age of Colonialism http://evitanza.bol.ucla.edu/baudelaire.html#_ftn15&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Poet [[Baudelaire]] wrote about the effects of [[Hashish]] and [[Opium]] in [[Les Paradis artificiels]] (1860) and theorized about how they could be used to allow the individual to reach "ideal" states of mind. Charles Baudelaire was member of the '[[Club des Hashischins]]', a Parisian literary group dedicated to the exploration of altered states of consciousness which included literary figures such as [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Gerard de Nerval]], [[Honore de Balzac]], and [[Theophile Gautier]].&lt;ref&gt;Levinthal, C. F. (2012). Drugs, behavior, and modern society. (6th ed.). Boston: Pearson College Div.&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire's opinion of the drug was generally negative, believing that it weakened and dampened artistic capacities, the personal Will and even the very identity of the hashish eater. He compared it to suicide and a false happiness, and saw wine as the true intoxicant of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;Vitanza, Baudelaire on Drugs : Marijuana Consumption in the Age of Colonialism&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[The Hasheesh Eater]] (1857) an autobiographical book by [[Fitz Hugh Ludlow]] became popular. Ludlow wrote that a [[Marijuana]] user sought "the soul’s capacity for a broader being, deeper insight, grander views of Beauty, Truth and Good than she now gains through the chinks of her cell."&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, Fitz Hugh "The Visionary", The Hasheesh Eater 1857&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[William James]] was one of the first academic philosophers to write about the effects of hallucinogenic substances in his ''The Subjective Effects of Nitrous Oxide'' (1882) in which he writes that the gas can produce a "tremendously exiting sense of an intense metaphysical illumination. Truth lies open to the view in depth beneath depth of almost blinding evidence. The mind sees all logical relations of being with an apparent subtlety and instantaniety to which its normal consciousness offers no parallel".&lt;ref&gt;James; ''The Subjective Effects of Nitrous Oxide'' (1882), https://erowid.org/chemicals/nitrous/nitrous_article1.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that the experience gave him the sense that the philosophy of [[Hegel]] was true. In his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' he likewise writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nitrous oxide and ether, especially nitrous oxide … stimulate the mystical consciousness in an extraordinary degree. … [In] the nitrous oxide trance we have a genuine metaphysical revelation. … [Our] normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.&lt;ref&gt;James, William; The Varieties of Religious Experience, ch. XVI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==20th century== 
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}

After using [[mescaline]] in 1953, [[Aldous Huxley]] wrote the [[Doors of Perception]] where he advanced the theory that psychedelic compounds could produce mystical experiences and knowledge, "what the visionary, the medium, even the mystic were talking about" and what eastern philosophy described with terms like [[Satcitananda]], the Godhead, [[Suchness]], [[Shunyata|Void]], [[Anatta|Not-self]] and [[Dharmakaya]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, The Doors of Perception&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley also quotes the philosopher [[C. D. Broad]], which held that the brain and nervous might act as a reducing valve of all the stimuli in the universe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to such a theory, each one of us is potentially [[Mind at Large]]. But in so far as we are animals, our business is at all costs to survive. To make biological survival possible, Mind at Large has to be funneled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this Particular planet.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, The Doors of Perception&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huxley wrote that it was possible that certain human beings could, through drugs, meditation, etc. circumvent the 'reducing valve' and experience something far beyond everyday consciousness. This experience Huxley saw as the source of all mysticism, a theory termed the [[Perennial philosophy]]. He also discusses art and the legality of various drugs in the West as well as arguing for the importance for self-transcendence. Huxley's philosophical novel [[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]] also described a Utopian society that used a psychedelic substance for spiritual purposes.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the early 1960s a group that eventually came to be called "Harvard Psychedelic Club" which included [[Timothy Leary]], [[Huston Smith]] and [[Ram Dass]] administered psychedelics to Harvard students. The group experimented with psychedelics in experiments such as the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]]. Huston Smith's last work, [[Cleansing the Doors of Perception]], describes the Harvard Project in which he participated.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Ram Dass' [[Be Here Now (book)|Be here now]] and Tim Leary's [[The Psychedelic Experience|The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead]] compared the psychedelic experiences to [[eastern philosophy]] and mystical states of consciousness. These books further popularized the idea that eastern - particularly Indian philosophical and spiritual insights could be obtained from using psychedelics. One of these experiences described in ''The Psychedelic Experience'' is that of [[ego death]] or depersonalization.{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The idea that the psychedelic experience could grant access to eastern spiritual insights was also promoted by the popular philosopher [[Alan Watts]] in his writings such as ''The Joyous Cosmology'', who also argued that one should not remain dependent on them for spiritual growth: "If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen."&lt;ref&gt;The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book).&lt;/ref&gt;

Various psychologists during the 1960s also studied psychedelic substances and worked with [[Psychedelic therapy]] and later developed various theories about their effects and significance. [[Stanislav Grof]] is known for his extensive work in LSD psychotherapy and for developing a theory which stated that the psychedelic experience allowed one to relive birth trauma and to explore the depths of the unconscious mind. Grof observed four levels of the LSD experience, which for him correspond to areas of the human unconscious: (1) Abstract and aesthetic experiences (2) Psychodynamic experiences (3) Perinatal experiences, and (4) Transpersonal experiences. Grof defined the last level as "experiences involving an expansion or extension of consciousness beyond the usual ego boundaries and beyond the limitations of time and/or space."&lt;ref&gt;PSYPRESSUK CONTRIBUTORS; Realms of the Human Unconscious by Stanislav Grof PUBLISHED JANUARY 19, 2011 · UPDATED FEBRUARY 5, 2015, http://psypressuk.com/2011/01/19/literary-review-realms-of-the-human-unconscious-by-stanislav-grof/&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[Transpersonal psychology]] focuses on this type of experience. Grof included topics such as consciousness, mysticism and metaphysics in his later writings.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The scientist and philosopher [[John C. Lilly]] discussed his experiments with psychedelics and [[altered states of consciousness]] in [[The Center of the Cyclone: An Autobiography of Inner Space]] and Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer. Other psychologists who studied and wrote on psychedelic use include [[Walter Pahnke]], [[Ralph Metzner]] and [[Claudio Naranjo]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

According to writer James Oroc, the 1990s brought about a second phase in modern psychedelic culture. The 'philosophical foundation' of this new wave of psychedelic thought was based on the works of [[Alexander Shulgin]], [[Alex Grey]] and [[Terence McKenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Oroc, James; The Second Psychedelic Revolution, http://realitysandwich.com/216613/the-second-psychedelic-revolution-part-one-the-end-of-acid/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Psychedelic sidebar}}
{{refexample|section|date=March 2017}}
Neuroscientist [[Rick Strassman]] has written about his research into the psychedelic [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine]] in his book ''DMT: The Spirit Molecule'' (2001). In his book Strassman investigates the possible connection between natural DMT in mystical and [[Near Death Experiences]] and psychedelic states caused by outwardly administered DMT. He also describes the psychedelic experiences of the volunteers in his experiments and their encounter with certain strange "beings" after being administered DMT.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In his study of recent scientific research on psychedelics and its [[neurophilosophy]] (''Neuropsychedelia'', 2012), Nicolas Langlitz has argued that Huxley's view expressed in the Doors of perception of the brain as a "reducing valve" which when released produced a perennial mystical experience has been a very influential theory among contemporary psychopharmacologists who study psychedelics, who have given it a materialist 'neurobiological reinterpretation' which he calls “mystic materialism”.&lt;ref&gt;Langlitz; Nicolas; IS THERE A PLACE FOR

[[Thomas Metzinger]] has discussed the effects of substances such as LSD, dimethyltryptamine, and mescaline in his ''Being No One'' (2003). Metzinger describes the hallucinatory component of the psychedelic experience as "epistemically vacuous" i.e. it provides no [[epistemic]] knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Langlitz; Nicolas; IS THERE A PLACE FOR

The American philosopher [[Sam Harris]] has discussed his use of psychedelics in his book [[Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion]] which also attempts to argue for a [[spiritual naturalism|naturalized spirituality]].

Another contemporary philosopher write about psychedelics is Peter Sjöstedt-H. His recent ''Noumenautics'' (2015) discusses psychedelic phenomenology and its metaphysical implications. 

In his encyclopedic overview of psychedelic culture and thought ''Psychedelia'' (2012), [[Patrick Lundborg]] developed a psychedelic philosophy he called "Unified Psychedelic Theory" (UPT) which draws from [[Platonism]], the phenomenology of [[Husserl]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]], [[Paul D. MacLean]]'s [[Triune brain]] theory, the work of [[Eugen Fink]] and other thinkers.

Predeterminism is closely related to [[determinism]].&lt;ref name=ONeill1981&gt;{{cite book|author=William F.

In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 |work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

==Definitional difficulties==
Predeterminism is difficult to discuss because its simple definition can logically lead to a variety of similar, complex (and, perhaps, better defined) concepts in [[metaphysics]], [[theology]], and the philosophy of [[free will]]. The term ''predeterminism'' suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). Due to this, predeterminism and the similar term [[predetermination]] are easily and often confused or associated with ideas ranging, for instance, from the [[Physicalism|physicalist]] (and often scientific) notion of ''[[causal determinism]]'' to even the theological (and often religious) notion of ''[[predestination]]''.

A [[secular]] example to try to illustrate predeterminism is that a fetus's future physical, emotional, and other personal characteristics as a matured human being may be considered "predetermined" by heredity, [[i.e.]] derived from a chain of events going back long before her eventual birth. However, one of the difficulties with defining predeterminism using this example is that the word ''predetermine'' necessarily implies a conscious being "doing" the determining ahead of time. With regards to predetermined heredity, a conscious being (perhaps a genetic scientist) is presumed to be the one speculating on what the fetus's personal characteristics will turn out to be, for example, based on looking at the genomes of the fetus and its ancestors. If there were not this conscious entity, the scientist, then one could say merely that the fetus's characteristics are ''determined'' by heredity, rather than ''pre''determined. Predeterminism necessarily implies, at the very least, a passive but all-knowing observer, if not an active planner, designer, or manipulator (of the fetus's personal characteristics). This basic scientific idea of hereditary determination, though, already fulfills the definition of [[causal determinism]], a metaphysical concept.

While determinism usually refers to a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistically]] explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events ''before'' they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. This creates a definitional conflict because predeterminism, by this understanding, logically leads to a belief in the existence of a conscious being who must determine ''all'' actions and events in advance and who, possessing such seeming [[omnipotence]], almost certainly operates outside of the laws of nature. This conscious entity is probably, then, a being who is omnipotent as well as presumably [[supernatural]] and [[omniscient]]. The definitional confusion here is that there is already a name for this very concept: [[predestination]]. Predestination asserts that a supremely powerful being has, in advance, fixed all events and outcomes in the universe; it is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinist]]s in [[Christian]] theology.

Likewise, the doctrine of [[fatalism]] already explicitly attributes all events and outcomes to the will of a (vaguer) higher power such as fate or destiny. Furthermore, in philosophic debates about the compatibility of [[free will]] and [[determinism]], some argue that ''predeterminism'' back to the origin of the universe is simply what philosophers mean by the more common term "determinism." Others have suggested that the term "[[self-determination]]" be used to describe actions as merely "determined" by an agent's reasons, motives, and desires.

When various interpretation of the word ''predeterminism'' can be defined even better by other terms, such as the aforementioned determinism, predestination, or fatalism, then the definition of predeterminism itself appears awkward, unclear, and perhaps even worthless in terms of practical or philosophic discussion.

==R. E. Hobart==

R. E. Hobart is the pseudonym of [[Dickinson S. Miller]], a student of [[William James]] who was later one of James' closest personal friends and for some years a colleague in the Harvard philosophy department. Hobart (Miller) criticized the core idea of James' ''The Will to Believe'', namely that it was acceptable to hold religious faith in the absence of evidence for or against that faith. James referred to Miller as "my most penetrating critic and intimate enemy."

Nearly 25 years after James' death, R. E. Hobart published a short article in ''Mind'' in 1934 that is considered one of the definitive statements of [[determinism]] and [[compatibilism]]. It was entitled ''Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It''.&lt;ref name="Hobart"&gt;R. E. Hobart "Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It," ''Mind'', Vol XLIII, No. 169, January, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobart's compatibilism was similar to earlier landmark positions by [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Hume]], as refined in the 19th-century compatibilist views of [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Henry Sidgwick]], and [[F. H. Bradley]]. But unlike them Hobart explicitly did not endorse ''strict'' logical or physical determinism, and he explicitly did endorse the existence of [http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/possibilities.html alternative possibilities], which can depend on absolute [[Randomness|chance]].

He was writing just a few years after the discovery of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[Indeterminacy principle|indeterminacy]], and also makes passing mention of the ancient "swerve" of the atoms espoused by [[Epicurus]]:

'I am not maintaining that determinism is true...it is not here affirmed that there are no small exceptions, no slight undetermined swervings, no ingredient of absolute chance.'&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

'"We say," I can will this or I can will that, whichever I choose". Two courses of action present themselves to my mind. I think of their consequences, I look on this picture and on that, one of them commends itself more than the other, and I will an act that brings it about. I knew that I could choose either. That means that I had the power to choose either.'&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Hobart supports the existence of alternative possibilities for action and the capability to do otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/possibilities.html Alternative Possibilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

And he clearly prefers "determination" to "determinism." Hobart's article is frequently misquoted as "Free Will as Involving Determinism."&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ncN3TuDQ7cC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Free+Will+As+Involving+Determinism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3Q3OHYTn66&amp;sig=Rj7QYcAoy8x7oLrfDO9ZtACXhgk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Vqu6S7jgEcWqlAfc1-3XBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Free%20Will%20As%20Involving%20Determinism%22&amp;f=false Fischer and Ravizza, Perspectives on moral responsibility], and even in the [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article-bibliography/V014 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731000518/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article-bibliography/V014 |date=2009-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippa Foot==

[[Philippa Foot]] is one who misquoted Hobart's title, but who had the same misgivings about determinism.

In 1957 she wrote an article in The Philosophical Review entitled "Free Will As Involving Determinism."

Nevertheless, she criticized arguments that free will requires indeterminism, and in particular the idea that one could not be held responsible for "chance" actions chosen for no particular reason.

Her article begins with the observation that determinism has become widely accepted as compatible with free will.

"The idea that free will can be reconciled with the strictest determinism is now very widely accepted. To say that a man acted freely is, it is often suggested, to say that he was not constrained, or that he could have done otherwise if he had chosen, or something else of that kind; and since these things could be true even if his action was determined it seems that there could be room for free will even within a universe completely subject to causal laws."&lt;ref name="Foot"&gt;Philippa Foot "Free Will As Involving Determinism," ''The Philosophical Review'', vol LXVI, (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|439}}

Foot doubted that the ordinary language meaning of saying our actions are "determined" by motives has the same meaning as strict physical determinism, which assumes a causal law that determines every event in the future of the universe.

She notes that our normal use of "determined" does not imply universal determinism.

"For instance, an action said to be determined by the desires of the man who does it is not necessarily an action for which there is supposed to be a sufficient condition. In saying that it is determined by his desires we may mean merely that he is doing something that he wants to do, or that he is doing it for the sake of something else that he wants. There is nothing in this to suggest determinism in [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s sense."&lt;ref name="Foot"/&gt;{{rp|441}}

Foot cited Bertrand Russell's view of causal determinism:

"The law of universal causation . . . may be enunciated as follows:...given the state of the whole universe,...every previous and subsequent event can theoretically be determined."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22414">In [[metaphysics]], the '''problem of universals''' refers to the question of whether properties exist, and if so, what they are.&lt;ref name="Moreland, Universals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moreland|first=J.P.|title=Universals|year=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=0773522697|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[property (philosophy)|Properties]] are qualities or relations that two or more entities have in common. The various kinds of properties, such as qualities and [[relation (philosophy)|relations]], are referred to as [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]. For instance, one can imagine three cup holders on a table that have in common the quality of ''being circular'' or ''exemplifying circularity'',&lt;ref&gt;Loux (1998), p. 20; (2001), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; or two daughters that have in common ''being the female offsprings of Frank.'' There are many such properties, such as being human, red, male or female, liquid, big or small, taller than, father of, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Loux (2001), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

While philosophers agree that human beings talk and think about properties, they disagree on whether these universals exist in [[reality]] or merely in thought and speech.

==Positions&lt;!--'Extreme realism' and 'Strong realism' redirect here--&gt;==
There are many philosophical positions regarding universals. Taking "beauty" as example, three positions are:
* [[Platonic realism]] (also called "'''extreme realism'''"&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Herbert Hochberg, "Nominalism and Idealism," ''Axiomathes'', June 2013, '''23'''(2), pp. 213–234.&lt;/ref&gt;): beauty is a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or description.
* [[Aristotelian realism]] (also called "'''strong realism'''"&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;): beauty is a property that exists only when beautiful things exist.
* [[Anti-realism]]: beauty is a property constructed in the mind, so exists only in descriptions of things.

Extreme realism and strong realism are also known as [[exaggerated realism]] and [[moderate realism]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism|Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism – ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)]]&lt;/ref&gt; A notable variant of anti-realism is [[nominalism]].&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt;

===Realism&lt;!--Linked from 'Philosophical realism'--&gt;===
{{main|Metaphysical realism}}
The realist school claims that universals are real—they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them. There are various forms of realism. Two major forms are [[Platonic realism]] (''universalia ante res'') and [[Aristotelian realism]] (''universalia in rebus'').&lt;ref&gt;Price (1953), among others, sometimes uses such Latin terms.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Platonic realism'' is the view that universals are real entities existing independent of particulars. ''Aristotelian realism'', on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.

Realists tend to argue that universals must be posited as distinct entities in order to account for various phenomena. For example, a common realist argument, supposedly found in Plato, is that universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false. Take the sentence "[[Djivan Gasparyan]] is a musician". The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual, Djivan Gasparyan, who possesses a certain quality: musicianship. Thus it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property.&lt;ref&gt;(MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein, 2006, §1b)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominalism&lt;!--&lt;!--linked from 'Anti-realism'--&gt;===
{{main|Nominalism}}
Nominalists assert that only individuals or particulars exist and deny that universals are real (i.e. that they exist as entities or beings; ''universalia post res''). The term "nominalism" comes from the Latin ''nomen'' ("name"), since the nominalist philosopher agrees that we predicate the same property of multiple entities but argues that the entities only share a name, not a real quality, in common. There are various forms of nominalism; four major varieties are [[predicate nominalism]], [[resemblance nominalism]], [[trope nominalism]], and [[conceptualism]].&lt;ref name="IEP"/&gt; 

Nominalists often argue for their view by claiming that nominalism can account for all the relevant phenomena, and therefore—by [[Occam's razor]] or some sort of principle of simplicity—nominalism is preferable, since it posits fewer entities.

Nominalism has been endorsed or defended by many, including [[Chrysippus]],&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: "[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Ockham]], [[Rudolf Carnap]],&lt;ref name=:0&gt;[https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/resemblance-nominalism-a-solution-to-the-problem-of-universals/ "Review of Gonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra, ''Resemblance Nominalism: A Solution to the Problem of Universals''" – ndpr.nd.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nelson Goodman]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goodman/supplement.html "Nelson Goodman: The Calculus of Individuals in its different versions", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; [[H. H. Price]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; and [[D. C. Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/ Donald Cary Williams, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcendental idealism===
{{main|Transcendental idealism}}
{{see also|German idealism}}

[[Transcendental idealist]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] posited that universals are not real, but are ideas in the mind of rational beings. Transcendental idealists do not reject universals as arbitrary names; rather, they treat universals as fundamental categories of pure reason (or as secondary concepts derived from those fundamental categories). Universals, in transcendental idealism, are intrinsically tied to the rationality of the subject making the judgment.

Thus, for transcendental idealists, the problem of universals is only tangentially a metaphysical problem; it is more of a problem of [[psychology]] and [[epistemology]]. Kant's position has been interpreted as a conceptualist one.&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient philosophy==

===Plato===
[[Plato]] believed there to be a sharp distinction between the world of perceivable objects and the world of universals or [[substantial form|forms]]: one can only have mere opinions about the former, but one can have [[knowledge]] about the latter.  For Plato it was not possible to have knowledge of anything that could change or was particular, since knowledge had to be forever unfailing and general.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §1b.&lt;/ref&gt;  For that reason, the world of the forms is the real world, like [[Allegory of the cave|sunlight]], while the sensible world is only imperfectly or partially real, like [[Allegory of the cave|shadows]]. This [[Platonic realism]], however, in denying that the [[theory of forms|eternal Forms]] are mental artifacts, differs sharply with modern forms of idealism.

One of the first nominalist critiques of Plato's realism was that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said "I've seen Plato's cups and table, but not his cupness and tableness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Guy|others=Translated by Guy Davenport|title=Herakleitos and Diogenes|publisher=Grey Fox Press|location=Bolinas|year=1979|pages=57|isbn=0-912516-35-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] disagreed with his tutor. Aristotle transformed Plato's forms into "[[Four causes#Formal cause|formal causes]]", the blueprints or [[essence]]s of individual things. Whereas Plato idealized [[geometry]], Aristotle emphasized [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] and related disciplines and therefore much of his thinking concerns living beings and their properties. The nature of universals in Aristotle's philosophy therefore hinges on his view of [[natural kind]]s.

Consider for example a particular [[oak]] tree. This is a member of a species and it has much in common with other oak trees, past, present and future. Its universal, its oakness, is a part of it. A biologist can study oak trees and learn about oakness and more generally the intelligible order within the sensible world. Accordingly, Aristotle was more confident than Plato about coming to know the sensible world; he was a prototypical [[Empiricism|empiricist]] and a founder of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. Aristotle was a new, [[Moderate realism|moderate]] sort of realist about universals.

==Medieval philosophy==

===Boethius===
The problem was introduced to the medieval world by [[Boethius]], by his translation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s [[Isagoge]]. It begins:

"I shall omit to speak about genera and species, as to whether they subsist (in the nature of things) or in mere conceptions only; whether also if subsistent, they are bodies or incorporeal, and whether they are separate from, or in, sensibles, and subsist about these, for such a treatise is most profound, and requires another more extensive investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_isagogue_02_translation.htm|title=Porphyry, Introduction (or Isagoge) to the logical Categories of Aristotle (1853) vol. 2. pp.609-633.|first=|last=Porphyry|date=|website=www.tertullian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duns Scotus===
[[Duns Scotus]] argued strongly against both nominalism and conceptualism, arguing instead for [[Scotist realism]], a medieval response to the conceptualism of Abelard.

===Ockham===
[[William of Ockham]] argued strongly that universals are a product of abstract human thought. According to Ockham, universals are just words/names that only exist in the mind and have no real place in the external world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/ockham/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Spade|first=Paul Vincent|last2=Panaccio|first2=Claude|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval realism===
{{main|Medieval realism}}
Realism was argued for by both [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. Aquinas argued that both the essence of a thing and its existence were clearly distinct;&lt;ref&gt;On Being and Essence, Ch I.&lt;/ref&gt; in this regard he is close to the teaching of Aristotle. [[Scotist realism]] argues that in a thing there is no real distinction between the essence and the existence, instead there is only a [[Formal distinction]].&lt;ref&gt;Opus Oxoniense I iii 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these opinions were denied by Scotus' pupil William of Ockham.

===Medieval nominalism===
{{main|Medieval nominalism}}
In [[medieval philosophy]], the French philosopher and [[Theology|theologian]] [[Roscellinus]] (c. 1050 – c. 1125) was an early, prominent proponent of nominalism.

==Modern and contemporary philosophy==

===Mill===
{{also|Psychologism}}
The 19th-century British philosophy [[John Stuart Mill]] discussed the problem of universals in the course of a book that eviscerated the philosophy of Sir [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]. Mill wrote, "The formation of a concept does not consist in separating the attributes which are said to compose it from all other attributes of the same object and enabling us to conceive those attributes, disjoined from any others. We neither conceive them, nor think them, nor cognize them in any way, as a thing apart, but solely as forming, in combination with numerous other attributes, the idea of an individual object".

However, he then proceeds to state that Berkeley's position is factually wrong by stating the following:

{{Quotation |But, though meaning them only as part of a larger agglomeration, we have the power of fixing our attention on them, to the neglect of the other attributes with which we think them combined. While the concentration of attention lasts, if it is sufficiently intense, we may be temporarily unconscious of any of the other attributes and may really, for a brief interval, have nothing present to our mind but the attributes constituent of the concept.|as quoted in William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}

In other words, we may be "temporarily unconscious" of whether an image is white, black or yellow and concentrate our attention on the fact that it is a man and on just those attributes necessary to identify it as a man (but not as any particular one). It may then have the significance of a universal of manhood.

===Peirce===
The 19th-century American logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], known as the father of [[pragmatism]], developed his own views on the problem of universals in the course of a review of an edition of the writings of George Berkeley. Peirce begins with the observation that "Berkeley's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1871), Review: Fraser's Edition of the ''Works of George Berkeley'' in ''North American Review'' 113(October):449-72, reprinted in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]]'' v. 8, paragraphs 7-38 and in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce]]'' v. 2, pp. 462-486. ''Peirce Edition Project'' [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_48/v2_48.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; He includes among these paradoxical doctrines Berkeley's denial of "the possibility of forming the simplest general conception". He wrote that if there is some mental fact that works ''in practice'' the way that a universal would, that fact is a universal. "If I have learned a formula in gibberish which in any way jogs my memory so as to enable me in each single case to act as though I had a general idea, what possible utility is there in distinguishing between such a gibberish... and an idea?" Peirce also held as a matter of [[ontology]] that what he called "thirdness", the more general facts about the world, are extra-mental realities.

===James===
[[William James]] learned pragmatism, this way of understanding an idea by its practical effects, from his friend Peirce, but he gave it new significance. (Which was not to Peirce's taste - he came to complain that James had "kidnapped" the term and eventually to call himself a "pragmaticist" instead.) Although James certainly agreed with Peirce and against Berkeley that general ideas exist as a psychological fact, he was a nominalist in his ontology:

{{Quotation | From every point of view, the overwhelming and portentous character ascribed to universal conceptions is surprising. Why, from Plato and Aristotle, philosophers should have vied with each other in scorn of the knowledge of the particular and in adoration of that of the general, is hard to understand, seeing that the more adorable knowledge ought to be that of the more adorable things and that the things of worth are all concretes and singulars. The only value of universal characters is that they help us, by reasoning, to know new [[truth]]s about individual things.|William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}

There are at least three ways in which a realist might try to answer James' challenge of explaining the reason why universal conceptions are more lofty than those of particulars:  the moral/political answer, the mathematical/scientific answer, and the anti-paradoxical answer. Each has contemporary or near-contemporary advocates.

===Weaver===
The moral or political response is given by the conservative philosopher [[Richard M. Weaver]] in ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' (1948), where he describes how the acceptance of "the fateful doctrine of nominalism" was "the crucial event in the history of Western culture; from this flowed those acts which issue now in modern decadence".&lt;ref name="Hoeveler1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. David Hoeveler|title=Watch on the right: conservative intellectuals in the Reagan era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JocfGWYGciMC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=15 February 1991|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-12810-4|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotchie1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Scotchie|title=The vision of Richard Weaver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHUZ7Mjv4WMC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-56000-212-3|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cocchiarella===
[[Nino Cocchiarella]] put forward the idea that realism is the best response to certain logical paradoxes to which nominalism leads ("Nominalism and Conceptualism as Predicative Second Order Theories of Predication", ''[[Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic]]'', vol. 21 (1980)). It is noted that in a sense Cocchiarella has adopted Platonism for anti-Platonic reasons. Plato, as seen in the dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', was willing to accept a certain amount of paradox with his forms. Cocchiarella adopts the forms to avoid paradox.

===Armstrong===
The Australian philosopher [[David Malet Armstrong]] has been one of the leading realists in the twentieth century, and has used a concept of universals to build a naturalistic and scientifically realist ontology. In both ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' (1978) and ''Universals: An Opinionated Introduction'' (1989), Armstrong describes the relative merits of a number of nominalist theories which appeal either to "natural classes" (a view he ascribes to [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]]), concepts, resemblance relations or predicates, and also discusses non-realist "trope" accounts (which he describes in the ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' volumes as "particularism"). He gives a number of reasons to reject all of these, but also dismisses a number of realist accounts.

===Penrose===
[[Roger Penrose]] contends that the [[philosophy of mathematics|foundations of mathematics]] can't be understood absent the Platonic view that "mathematical truth is absolute, external and eternal, and not based on man-made criteria ... mathematical objects have a timeless existence of their own..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198519737|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pseudophilosophy''' is a term, often considered derogatory{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}, applied to criticize philosophical ideas or systems which are claimed not to meet an expected set of standards. The etymology of the term is based on appending the prefix [[pseudo-]] ("false") to the word [[philosophy]] ("love of wisdom"); another term to describe false philosophy is "cod philosophy".

==Targets==
{{Cleanup-list|section|date=August 2016}}
The term has been used against many different targets, including:
* To criticise [[dogmatism]] in general, “which is dissolved when philosophy incorporates the scientific method”;{{sfn|Kearney|Rainwater|1996|p=60}}
* To criticise any philosophy in general which does not meet the criteria of [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] or [[Positivism|positivistic philosophy]];{{sfn|Taylor|Kelly|2013|p=116-117}} 
* To criticise specific philosophical schools, traditions and systems:

==Definitions==
According to Christopher Heumann, an 18th-century scholar, pseudo-philosophy has six characteristics:{{sfn|Hanegraaf|2012|p=131-134}}
# A preference for useless speculation
# It appeals merely to human authority
# It appeals to tradition instead of reason
# It syncretises philosophy with superstition
# It has a preference for obscure and enigmatic language and symbolism
# It is immoral

According to [[Michael Oakeshott]], pseudo-philosophy "is theorizing that proceeds partly within and partly outside a given mode of inquiry."{{sfn|Nardin|2001}}

Pieper notes that there cannot be a closed system of philosophy, and that any philosophy that claims to have discovered a "cosmic formula" is a pseudo-philosophy.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} In this he follows Kant, who rejected the postulation of a "highest principle" from which to develop [[Transcendental idealism]], calling this pseudo-philosophy and mysticism.{{sfn|Baur|Dahlstrom|1999|p=37}}

[[Nicholas Rescher]], in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', describes ''pseudo-philosophy'' as "deliberations that masquerade as philosophical but are inept, incompetent, deficient in intellectual seriousness, and reflective of an insufficient commitment to the pursuit of truth." Rescher adds that the term is particularly appropriate when applied to "those who use the resources of reason to substantiate the claim that rationality is unachievable in matters of inquiry."

==History==
{{See also|Philosophy}}

According to Pieper, for Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle philosophy  is the human search "oriented toward [[Sophia (wisdom)|wisdom]] such as God possesses".{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} It suggests that philosophy includes, in its essence, an orientation toward theology.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} Pieper notes:
{{quote|Thus something is being expressed here that clearly contradicts what in the modern age has become the accepted notion of philosophy; for this new conception of philosophy assumes that it is the decisive feature of philosophical thought to disentangle itself from theology, faith and tradition.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}}}}

The term "pseudo-philosophy" appears to have been coined by [[Jane Austen]].{{sfn|Johnson|Tuite|2011}}

[[Ernest Newman]] (30 November 1868 – 7 July 1959), an English music critic and [[musicologist]], who aimed at intellectual objectivity in his style of criticism, in contrast to the more subjective approach of other critics, published in 1897 ''Pseudo-Philosophy at the End of the Nineteenth Century'', a critique of imprecise and subjective writing.

==Usage==
The term is almost always used [[pejorative]]ly and is often contentious.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Romanticism===
{{Main|Romanticism}}{{See also|Age of Enlightenment}}

According to Bunge,
{{quote|Pseudophilosophy is nonsense parading as deep philosophy. It may have existed since Lao-Tzu, but it was not taken seriously until about 1800, when the Romantics challenged the Enlightenment. By giving up rationality, they generated a lot of pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}}}}

For Kant, intellectual knowledge is discursive knowledge, not intuitive knowledge.{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}} According to Kant, intuition is limited to the realm of senses, while knowledge is "essentially realised in the acts of researching, relating, comparing, differentiating, inferring, proving".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}} Kant criticised Romantic philosophy, which is based on feeling and intuition,{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13}} and not on "philosophical work":{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13}}
{{quote|In philosophy, Kant writes, "the law of reason, of acquiring possessions through work", prevails. And because it is not work, the Romantic philosophy is not genuine philosophy - an objection that is also leveled by Kant against Plato, the "father of all rapturous fantasizing in philosophy", while it is noted, with both approval and assent, that "the philosophy of Aristotle is, by contrast, work".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13-14}}}}

Kant called Romantic philosophy pseudo-philosophy, "in which one is entitled not to work, but only to heed and enjoy the oracle in oneself in order to take complete possession of that wisdom toward which philosophy aims".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}}

===Mysticism===
{{Main|Mysticism}}

Mysticism has a long history. In the Age of Enlightenment mysticism had fallen into disrepute.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}} Kant called mysticism pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}} In the 19th century, with the rise of Romanticism, interest in mysticism was renewed. Rationalists and Lutherans wrote histories of mysticism to reject its claims, but there was a widespread interest in spiritualism and related phenomena.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}}

Interest in [[Meister Eckhart|Eckhart's works]] was revived in the early nineteenth century, especially by German Romantics and [[German idealism|Idealist]] philosophers.{{sfn|McGinn|2001|p=1}}{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxvii}} Since the 1960s debate has been going on in Germany whether Eckhart should be called a "mystic".{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxii}} The philosopher Karl Albert had already argued that Eckhart had to be placed in the tradition of philosophical mysticism of [[Parmenides]], [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Proclus]] and other [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonistic]] thinkers.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}} Heribert Fischer argued in the 1960s that Eckhart was a mediaeval theologian.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}}

===German Idealism===
{{Main|German Idealism}}

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] wrote the following about [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]:
{{quote|If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudophilosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.{{sfn|Schopenhauer|1965|p=15-16}}}}

However his opinion is not widely held of Hegelianism or German Idealism.

===Continental philosophy===
{{Main|Continental philosophy|Analytic philosophy}}

Soccio notes that analytical inclined philosophers tend to dismiss Heidegger's philosophy as pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Soccio|2011|p=497}} According to Christensen, Heidegger himself called the philosophy of Husserl ''scheinphilosophy''.{{sfn|Christensen|2008|p=7}}

===Scientism===
{{Main|Scientism}}

[[Dietrich von Hildebrand]] used the term to critique the central place modern science is occupying in western society:
{{quote|This pseudo philosophy, in which science takes the place of metaphysics and religion, more and more corrodes the life of man, making him more and more blind to the real cosmos, in all its plenitude, depth and mystery ... Today we are witnessing a revolt against the deformation expressed in this pseudo philosophy.{{sfn|Von Hildebrand|1960|p=7}}}}

===Objectivism===
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Jonathan Chait  used  the term in the title "Ayn Rand's Pseudo-Philosophy" of an article in ''New Republic'', in which he wrote, "She was a true amateur who insisted on seeing herself as the greatest human being who ever lived because she was almost completely unfamiliar with the entire philosophical canon."&lt;ref name="chait"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6884">'''Public philosophy''' is a label used for at least two separate philosophical projects. One project often called "public philosophy" is to address issues of public importance through philosophy, especially in the areas of [[public policy]], [[morality]] and [[social issues]].{{cn|date=June 2017}} In this conception, public philosophy is a matter of content, not style.{{cn|date=June 2017}} It must concern certain philosophical issues, but may be undertaken in any venue.{{cn|date=June 2017}}   The second project often called public philosophy is to engage in philosophy in public venues. This view  is exemplified by the ''Essays in Philosophy'' special issue on public philosophy (Vol 15, issue 1, 2014), which defined public philosophy as "doing philosophy with general audiences in a non-academic setting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = Jack Russell | year = 2014 | title = Public Philosophy: Introduction | url = | journal = Essays in Philosophy | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 1–4 | doi = 10.7710/1526-0569.1485 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public philosophy, in this conception, is a matter of style not content. It must be undertaken in a public venue but might deal with any philosophical issue. 

Some public philosophers are academic professionals, but others may work outside of the usual academic contexts of teaching and writing for [[peer-reviewed journals]].

==Perspectives==
According to one of the founders of the Public Philosophy Network, Sharon Meagher, “'public philosophy' is not simply a matter of doing philosophy in public. A truly public philosophy is one that demands that the
philosopher both become a student of community knowledge and reflect on his or her public engagement, recognizing that philosophy can benefit at as much from public contact as can the public benefit from contact with philosophy. The publicly engaged philosopher does not assume that he or she knows the questions in advance, but draws on his or her experiences in the community to
develop and frame questions. Further, publicly engaged philosophy demands accountability on the part of the philosopher to his or her publics—understanding that philosophers are themselves members of those publics."&lt;ref&gt;http://api.ning.com/files/C*75Xw4bA4cU7vHOHS-zlLRmkdBskXa9IzuVBCJKtjhmSgMrQy8tWTu1s9vqumPuG2gyJfaPzwWJ1Tu4*NoJIUVYUXtPpC37/KetteringreportfinalcorrectedFeb2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who hold the alternative view, that public philosophy is simply philosophy undertaken in public venues, are engaged in two projects. One of these is to educate the public and the other to engage with the public collaboratively to identify and address public problems. The second approach is often inspired by  [[John Dewey]]'s work on democracy and the need to reconstruct philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See part two of Volume I of The Essential Dewey: Pragmatism, Education, Democracy edited by Larry A Hickman and Thomas M. Alexander, Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The two approaches are not exclusive. For instance, John Pace Dewey, philosopher [[Michael J. Sandel]] describes public philosophy as having two aspects. The first is to "find in the political and legal controversies of our day an occasion for philosophy". The second is "to bring moral and political philosophy to bear on contemporary public discourse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael J. |last=Sandel |authorlink=Michael J. Sandel |title=Public Philosophy: Essays on Morality in Politics |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2005 |isbn=0-674-01928-8 |oclc=60321410 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]] says, "The role of a public philosophy is to address public affairs", but this "can be done in many different ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Tully |authorlink=James Tully (philosopher) |title=Public Philosophy in a New Key: Volume 1, Democracy and Civic Freedom |series=Ideas in Context series |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0-521-44961-8 |oclc=316855971 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tully's approach emphasizes ''practice'' through the contestable concepts of citizenship, civic freedom, and nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]], especially Chapter 9 "On local and global citizenship: an apprenticeship manual," ''Public Philosophy in a New Key, Volume II: Imperialism and Civic Freedom''. Ideas in Context series. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. pp. 243-309.&lt;/ref&gt; Public philosophy, in some conceptions, is a matter of content rather than style. Public philosophy, in this sense, need not be undertaken in a public venue but must deal with a particular subset of philosophical problems.

==Public philosophers==
The American Philosophical Association created a Committee on Public Philosophy in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apaonline.org/members/group.aspx?id=110441&lt;/ref&gt; Also the Public Philosophy Network has been holding conferences once every two years on advancing public philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;http://publicphilosophynetwork.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of individuals have been identified, either by themselves or others, as public philosophers.

Confucian role ethics centers around [[filial piety]] or ''xiao'', a respect for family members.&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wonsuk Chang|author2=Leah Kalmanson|title=Confucianism in Context: Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UC1mvUKaU8C&amp;pg=PA68|date=8 November 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3191-8|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is elaborated in the Confucian text ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'': "In serving his parents, a filial son reveres them in daily life; he makes them happy while he nourishes them; he takes anxious care of them in sickness; he shows great sorrow over their death; and he sacrifices to them with solemnity."&lt;ref name="Ikels"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edited by Charlotte Ikels|title=Filial Piety: Practice and Discourse in Contemporary East Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PpSpC15JHeoC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=21 November 2012|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4791-2|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filial duty requires the desire to be filial, and not just the act of filial piety.&lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Fraser|author2=Dan Robins|author3=Timothy O'Leary|title=Ethics in Early China: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2Qqf6ZXxh0C&amp;pg=PA35|date=1 May 2011|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-988-8028-93-1|pages=17–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Confucian societies, filial piety determines the "moral worth" of an individual in a community and acts as a form of [[social capital]].&lt;ref name="Ikels"/&gt;

According to [[Roger T. Ames]] and Henry Rosemont, "Confucian normativity is defined by living one's family roles to maximum effect." In Confucian role ethics, morality is based on a person's fulfillment of a role, such as that of a parent or a child. These roles are established as relationships, and are not individualistic. Confucian roles are not [[rationalism|rational]], and originate through the ''xin'', or human emotions.&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;

The concept of ''[[Li (Confucian)|li]]'' or ritual propriety is crucial to Confucian roles. Propriety reinforces family relationships, and binds together the community. The performance of li expresses a person's moral commitment as a human being.&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;

In Japan, modern Confucian scholars like [[Uno Tetsuto]] and [[Ichimura Sanjiro]] have attempted to mix Confucian role ethics with concepts such as [[democracy]] and [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="Leaman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Leaman|title=Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=snU6hyIVMawC&amp;pg=PA191|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17281-3|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters''''' ({{lang-es|El sueño de la razón produce monstruos}}) is an [[etching]] by the Spanish painter and printmaker [[Francisco Goya]]. Created between 1797 and 1799,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eeweems.com/goya/sleep_of_reason.html |title=Goya - The Sleep of Reason |publisher=Eeweems.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107043903/http://eeweems.com/goya/sleep_of_reason.html |archivedate=2012-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the 43rd of 80 etchings making up the suite of satires ''[[Los caprichos|Los Caprichos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.cornell.edu/collections/view/the-sleep-of-reason-produces-monsters.html ''The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters''] [[Johnson Museum of Art]], [[Cornell University]], 2013. Retrieved 11 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Goya imagines himself asleep amidst his drawing tools, his reason dulled by slumber and bedeviled by creatures that prowl in the dark. The work includes owls that may be symbols of folly and bats symbolizing ignorance. The artist's nightmare reflected his view of Spanish society, which he portrayed in the ''Caprichos'' as demented, corrupt, and ripe for ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = The Metropolitan Museum of Art | authorlink = Metropolitan Museum of Art | title = Francisco de Goya y Lucientes: The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters: Plate 43 of The Caprices (Los Caprichos) | url = http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/09/eusi/ho_18.64.43.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work is held at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and was the gift of M. Knoedler &amp; Co. in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/338473]&lt;/ref&gt;

The full epigraph for capricho No. 43 reads; "Fantasy abandoned by reason produces impossible monsters: united with her (reason), she (fantasy) is the mother of the arts and the origin of their marvels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Robin M. |last2=Vrudny |first2=Kimberly J. |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=if4hQec2ClEC&amp;pg=PA39 |title=Visual Theology: Forming and Transforming the Community Through the Arts |publisher=Liturgical Press |page=39 |isbn=978-0-814-65399-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of [[C. P. Snow]]'s [[Strangers and Brothers|''The Sleep of Reason'', tenth book in his "Strangers and Brothers" series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/23/archives/an-elegiac-ending-to-cp-snows-11novel-cycle-last-things.html?_r=0|title=An elegiac ending to C. P. Snow's 11‐novel cycle|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' novel ''[[The Sleep of Reason]]'' are drawn from this print. It also inspired the cover of the [[Andrew Miller (novelist)|Andrew Miller]] novel [[Pure (Miller novel)|''Pure'']], as well as the 2017 album by Swedish metal band Meshuggah, entitled ''[[The Violent Sleep of Reason]].'' Also the names of Finnish occult metal band [[Sleep of Monsters]] and their first album, ''[[Produces Reason]]'' derive from the name of the title.

Occasionally the title phrase is rendered as "The dream of reason produces monsters", since the Spanish word "sueño" can mean either "sleep" or "dream". However, Goya's epigraph makes it clear that his intended interpretation is "the sleep of reason".

'''Virtue ethics''' (or '''aretaic ethics'''&lt;ref&gt;David Carr, Jan Steutel (eds.), ''Virtue Ethics and Moral Education'', Routledge, 1999, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ə|ˈ|t|eɪ|.|ɪ|k}}, from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]] (''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'')) are [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] theories which emphasize [[virtues]] of mind and character. Virtue ethicists discuss the nature and definition of [[virtues]] and other related problems. These include how virtues are acquired, how they are applied in various real life contexts, and whether they are rooted in a universal human nature or in a plurality of cultures.

== Key concepts ==
The western tradition's key concepts derive from [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. These theories include ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'' (excellence or virtue), ''[[phronesis]]'' (practical or moral wisdom), and ''[[eudaimonia]]'' (flourishing).

A virtue is generally agreed to be a character trait, such as a habitual action or settled sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/ethics-virtue/|title=Virtue Ethics|last=Hursthouse|first=Rosalind|date=2013-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, a virtue is a positive trait that makes its possessor a good human being. A virtue is thus to be distinguished from single actions or feelings. [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] says:  &lt;blockquote&gt;A virtue such as honesty or generosity is not just a tendency to do what is honest or generous, nor is it to be helpfully specified as a “desirable” or “morally valuable” character trait. It is, indeed a character trait—that is, a disposition which is well entrenched in its possessor, something that, as we say “goes all the way down”, unlike a habit such as being a tea-drinker—but the disposition in question, far from being a single track disposition to do honest actions, or even honest actions for certain reasons, is multi-track. It is concerned with many other actions as well, with emotions and emotional reactions, choices, values, desires, perceptions, attitudes, interests, expectations and sensibilities. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex mindset. (Hence the extreme recklessness of attributing a virtue on the basis of a single action.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Practical wisdom is an acquired trait that enables its possessor to identify the thing to do in any given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Pincoffs, Edmund (1971). Quandary ethics. _Mind_ 80 (320):552-571.
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike theoretical wisdom, practical reason results in action or decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/aristotle-ethics/|title=Aristotle's Ethics|last=Kraut|first=Richard|date=2016-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As John McDowell puts it, practical wisdom involves a "perceptual sensitivity" to what a situation requires.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, John. "Virtue and Reason". _The Monist_. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Eudaimonia]]'' (εὐδαιμονία) is a state variously translated from Greek as 'well-being', 'happiness', 'blessedness', and in the context of virtue ethics, 'human flourishing'.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman, L.P. &amp; Fieser, J. (2009). Virtue Theory. In ''Ethics: Discovering Right and Wrong'' (pp. 146-169). (6th ed.)  Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eudaimonia'' in this sense is not a subjective, but an objective, state. It characterizes the well-lived life. According to Aristotle, the most prominent exponent of ''eudaimonia'' in the Western philosophical tradition, "eudaimonia" is the proper goal of human life. It consists of exercising the characteristic human quality—[[reason]]—as the soul's most proper and nourishing activity. In his ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Aristotle, like Plato before him, argued that the pursuit of ''eudaimonia'' is an "activity of the soul in accordance with perfect virtue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=Nicomachean Ethics|pages=Book I}}&lt;/ref&gt; which further could only properly be exercised in the characteristic human community—the ''[[polis]]'' or [[city-state]].

Although ''eudaimonia'' was first popularized by Aristotle, it now belongs to the tradition of virtue theories generally. For the virtue theorist, ''eudaimonia'' describes that state achieved by the person who lives the proper human life, an outcome that can be reached by practicing the virtues.  A virtue is a habit or quality that allows the bearer to succeed at his, her, or its purpose. The virtue of a knife, for example, is sharpness; among the virtues of a racehorse is speed. Thus, to identify the virtues for human beings, one must have an account of what the human purpose is.

==History of virtue==
{{Catholic philosophy |expanded=all}}
Like much of the Western tradition, virtue theory seems to have originated in ancient [[Greek Philosophy|Greek philosophy]].

Another way to say this is that in virtue ethics, morality stems from the identity or character of the individual, rather than being a reflection of the actions (or consequences thereof) of the individual.  Today, there is debate among various adherents of virtue ethics concerning what specific virtues are morally praiseworthy.  However, most theorists agree that morality comes as a result of intrinsic virtues. Intrinsic virtues are the common link that unites the disparate normative philosophies into the field known as virtue ethics. Plato and Aristotle's treatment of virtues are not the same. Plato believes virtue is effectively an end to be sought, for which a friend might be a useful means. Aristotle states that the virtues function more as means to safeguard human relations, particularly authentic friendship, without which one's quest for happiness is frustrated.

Discussion of what were known as the [[Four Cardinal Virtues]] – [[wisdom]], [[justice]], [[Cardinal virtues|fortitude]], and [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] – can be found in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. The virtues also figure prominently in Aristotle's moral theory (see below). Virtue theory was inserted into the study of [[history]] by moralistic historians such as [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Tacitus]].  The Greek idea of the virtues was passed on in Roman philosophy through [[Cicero]] and later incorporated into [[Christian]] moral theology by [[St. Ambrose]] of Milan. During the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] period, the most comprehensive consideration of the virtues from a theological perspective was provided by St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' and his ''Commentaries on the [[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.

Though the tradition receded into the background of European philosophical thought in these centuries, the term "virtue" remained current during this period, and in fact appears prominently in the tradition of [[classical republicanism]] or [[classical liberalism]]. This tradition was prominent in the intellectual life of 16th-century [[Italy]], as well as 17th- and 18th-century Britain and America; indeed the term "virtue" appears frequently in the work of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[David Hume]], the republicans of the [[English Civil War]] period, the 18th-century English [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], and the prominent figures among the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and the [[Founding Fathers|American Founding Fathers]].

===Contemporary "aretaic turn"&lt;!--"Aretaic turn" redirects here--&gt;===
Although some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers (e.g. [[David Hume|Hume]]) continued to emphasise the virtues, with the ascendancy of [[utilitarianism]] and [[deontology]], virtue theory moved to the margins of Western philosophy. The contemporary revival of virtue theory is frequently traced to the philosopher [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s 1958 essay "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]". Following this:
* In the 1976 paper "[[The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories]]", Michael Stocker summarises the main aretaic criticisms of deontological and consequentialist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stocker | first1 = Michael | year = 1976 | title = The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories | url = | journal = The Journal of Philosophy | volume = 73 | issue = 14| pages = 453–466 | doi = 10.2307/2025782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Philippa Foot]], who published a collection of essays in 1978 entitled ''Virtues and Vices.''
* [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has made an effort to reconstruct a virtue-based theory in dialogue with the problems of modern and [[postmodernism|postmodern]] thought; his works include ''[[After Virtue]]'' and ''Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry''.
* [[Paul Ricoeur]] has accorded an important place to Aristotelian [[teleological ethics]] in his [[hermeneutical]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of the subject, most notably in his book ''Oneself as Another''.
* Theologian [[Stanley Hauerwas]] has also found the language of virtue quite helpful in his own project.
* [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] has published ''On Virtue Ethics''.
* [[Roger Crisp]] and [[Michael Slote]] have edited a collection of important essays titled ''Virtue Ethics''.
* [[Martha Nussbaum]] and [[Amartya Sen]] have employed virtue theory in theorising the [[capability approach]] to [[international development]].
* [[Julia Annas]] wrote ''The Morality of Happiness'' (1993).
* [[Lawrence C. Becker]] identified current virtue theory with [[Stoicism]] (or [[Modern Stoicism]]) in ''A New Stoicism.'' (1998).

The '''aretaic turn'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in moral philosophy is paralleled by analogous developments in other philosophical disciplines. One of these is [[epistemology]], where a distinctive [[virtue epistemology]] has been developed by [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Linda Zagzebski]] and others. In political theory, there has been discussion of "virtue politics", and in legal theory, there is a small but growing body of literature on [[virtue jurisprudence]]. The aretaic turn also exists in [[United States of America|American]] [[constitutional theory]], where proponents argue for an emphasis on virtue and vice of constitutional [[adjudicator]]s.

Aretaic approaches to morality, epistemology, and jurisprudence have been the subject of intense debates. One criticism that is frequently made focuses on the problem of guidance; opponents, such as Robert Louden in his article "Some Vices of Virtue Ethics", question whether the idea of a virtuous moral actor, believer, or judge can provide the guidance necessary for action, belief formation, or the decision of legal disputes.

== Lists of virtues ==
There are several different lists of particular virtues. Socrates argued that virtue is knowledge, which suggests that there is really only one virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Meno.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics concurred, claiming the four cardinal virtues were only aspects of true virtue. John McDowell is a recent defender of this conception. He argues that virtue is a "perceptual capacity" to identify how one ought to act, and that all particular virtues are merely "specialized sensitivities" to a range of reasons for acting.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, John. "Virtue and reason." ''The monist'' 62.3 (1979): 331-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Aristotle's list

Aristotle identifies approximately eighteen virtues that enable a person to perform their human function well.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics.''&lt;/ref&gt;  He distinguished virtues pertaining to emotion and desire from those pertaining to the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Nicomachean Ethics, Book II.&lt;/ref&gt; The first he calls "moral" virtues, and the second intellectual virtues (though both are "moral" in the modern sense of the word).  Each moral virtue was a mean (see [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]) between two corresponding vices, one of excess and one of deficiency. Each intellectual virtue is a mental skill or habit by which the mind arrives at truth, affirming what is or denying what is not.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'' Book VI&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' he discusses about 11 moral virtues:

;Moral Virtues

1. '''Courage''' in the face of fear

2. '''Temperance''' in the face of pleasure and pain

3. '''Liberality''' with wealth and possessions

4. '''Magnificence''' with great wealth and possessions

5. '''Magnanimity''' with great honors

6. '''Proper ambition''' with normal honors

7. '''Truthfulness''' with self-expression

8. '''Wittiness''' in conversation

9. '''Friendliness''' in social conduct

10. '''Modesty''' in the face of shame or shamelessness

11. '''Righteous indignation''' in the face of injury

;Intellectual virtues
# [[Nous]] (intelligence), which apprehends fundamental truths (such as definitions, self-evident principles)
# [[Episteme]] (science), which is skill with inferential reasoning (such as proofs, syllogisms, demonstrations)
# Sophia (theoretical wisdom), which combines fundamental truths with valid, necessary inferences to reason well about unchanging truths.
Aristotle also mentions several other traits: 
* Gnome (good sense) -- passing judgment, "sympathetic understanding" 
* Synesis (understanding) -- comprehending what others say, does not issue commands
* [[Phronesis]] (practical wisdom) -- knowledge of what to do, knowledge of changing truths, issues commands
* Techne (art, craftsmanship)
Aristotle's list is not the only list, however. As [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] observed in ''[[After Virtue]]'',  thinkers as diverse as: [[Homer]]; the authors of the [[New Testament]]; [[Thomas Aquinas]]; and [[Benjamin Franklin]]; have all proposed lists.&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, ''After Virtue'', chp 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some philosophers criticise virtue ethics as [[culturally relative]]. Since different people, cultures and societies often have different opinions on what constitutes a virtue, perhaps there is no one objectively right list.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

For example, regarding what are the most important virtues, Aristotle proposed the following nine: wisdom; prudence; justice; fortitude; courage; liberality; magnificence; magnanimity; temperance.  In contrast, one modern-era philosopher proposed as the four cardinal virtues:  ambition/humility;  love;  courage;  and honesty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Kaufmann, W.]], 1961. The Faith Of A Heretic. Doubleday &amp; Co., pages 317-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, regarding virtues once supposedly applicable to women, many would have once considered a virtuous woman to be quiet, servile, and industrious. This conception of female virtue no longer holds true in many modern societies. Proponents of virtue theory sometimes respond to this objection by arguing that a central feature of a virtue is its ''universal applicability''. In other words, any character trait defined as a virtue must reasonably be universally regarded as a virtue for all sentient beings. According to this view, it is inconsistent to claim for example servility as a female virtue, while at the same time not proposing it as a male one.

Other proponents of virtue theory, notably [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], respond to this objection by arguing that any account of the virtues must indeed be generated out of the community in which those virtues are to be practiced: the very word ''ethics'' implies "[[ethos]]". That is to say that the virtues are, and necessarily must be, grounded in a particular time and place. What counts as virtue in 4th-century Athens would be a ludicrous guide to proper behavior in 21st-century Toronto, and vice versa. To take this view does not necessarily commit one to the argument that accounts of the virtues must therefore be static: moral activity—that is, attempts to contemplate and practice the virtues—can provide the cultural resources that allow people to change, albeit slowly, the ethos of their own societies. [[Alasdair MacIntyre|MacIntyre]] appears to take this position in his seminal work on virtue ethics, ''[[After Virtue]]''. One might cite (though [[Alasdair MacIntyre|MacIntyre]] does not) the rapid emergence of [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] thought in the [[slave]]-holding societies of the 18th-century [[Atlantic world]] as an example of this sort of change: over a relatively short period of time, perhaps 1760 to 1800, in Britain, France, and British America, slave-holding, previously thought to be morally neutral or even virtuous, rapidly became seen as vicious among wide swathes of society. While the emergence of abolitionist thought derived from many sources, the work of [[David Brion Davis]], among others,{{who|date=January 2011}} has established that one source was the rapid, internal evolution of moral theory among certain sectors of these societies, notably the [[Quakers]].

Another objection to virtue theory is that the school does not focus on what ''sorts of actions'' are morally permitted and which ones are not, but rather on what sort of qualities someone ought to foster in order to become a good person. In other words, while some virtue theorists may not condemn, for example, murder as an inherently immoral or impermissible sort of action, they may argue that someone who commits a murder is severely lacking in several important virtues, such as [[compassion]] and [[wikt:fairness|fairness]]. Still, antagonists of the theory often object that this particular feature of the theory makes virtue ethics useless as a universal norm of acceptable conduct suitable as a base for [[legislation]]. Some virtue theorists concede this point, but respond by opposing the very notion of legitimate legislative [[authority]] instead, effectively advocating some form of [[anarchism]] as the political ideal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Others argue that laws should be made by virtuous legislators. Still others argue that it is possible to base a judicial system on the moral notion of virtues rather than rules.

Some virtue theorists might respond to this overall objection with the notion of a "bad act" also being an act characteristic of [[vice]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} That is to say that those acts that do not aim at virtue, or stray from virtue, would constitute our conception of "bad behavior". Although not all virtue ethicists agree to this notion, this is one way the virtue ethicist can re-introduce the concept of the "morally impermissible".  One could raise objection with Foot that she is committing an [[argument from ignorance]] by postulating that what is not virtuous is unvirtuous.  In other words, just because an action or person 'lacks of evidence' for virtue does not, [[ceteris paribus|all else constant]], imply that said action or person is unvirtuous.

=== Subsumed in deontology and utilitarianism ===

[[Martha Nussbaum]] has suggested that while virtue ethics is often considered to be anti-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], "suspicious of theory and respectful of the wisdom embodied in local practices",&lt;ref name="Nussbaum" /&gt; it is actually neither fundamentally distinct from, nor does it qualify as a rival approach to deontology and utilitarianism. She argues that philosophers from these two Enlightenment traditions often include theories of virtue. She pointed out that [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] "Doctrine of Virtue" (in ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'') "covers most of the same topics as do classical Greek theories", "that he offers a general account of virtue, in terms of the strength of the will in overcoming wayward and selfish inclinations; that he offers detailed analyses of standard virtues such as courage and self-control, and of vices, such as avarice, mendacity, servility, and pride; that, although in general he portrays inclination as inimical to virtue, he also recognizes that sympathetic inclinations offer crucial support to virtue, and urges their deliberate cultivation."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha C.|title=Virtue Ethics: A Misleading Category?|journal=The Journal of Ethics|year=1999|volume=3|issue=3|pages=163–201|jstor=25115613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum also points to considerations of virtue by utilitarians such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] (''[[The Methods of Ethics]]''), [[Jeremy Bentham]] (''[[The Principles of Morals and Legislation]]''), and [[John Stuart Mill]], who writes of moral development as part of an argument for the moral equality of women (''[[The Subjection of Women]]''). She argues that contemporary virtue ethicists such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Philippa Foot]], and [[John McDowell]] have few points of agreement, and that the common core of their work does not represent a break from Kant.

=== Utopianism and pluralism ===

[[Robert Louden]] criticises virtue ethics on the basis that it promotes a form of unsustainable [[utopianism]]. Trying to come to ''a'' single set of virtues is immensely difficult in contemporary societies as, according to Louden, they contain "more ethnic, religious, and class groups than did the moral community which Aristotle theorized about" with each of these groups having "not only its own interests but its own set of virtues as well". Louden notes in passing that MacIntyre, a supporter of virtue-based ethics, has grappled with this in ''[[After Virtue]]'' but that ethics cannot dispense with building rules around acts and rely only on discussing the moral character of persons.&lt;ref name="Louden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Louden|first=Robert B.|title=On Some Vices of Virtue Ethics|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|date=July 1984|volume=21|issue=3|pages=227–236|jstor=20014051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics in virtue ethics ==

=== Virtue ethics as a category ===
Virtue ethics can be contrasted to [[deontological]] ethics and [[consequentialist]] ethics by an examination of the other two (the three being together the most predominant contemporary normative ethical theories).

[[Deontological ethics]], sometimes referred to as duty ethics, places the emphasis on adhering to ethical principles or duties.  How these duties are defined, however, is often a point of contention and debate in deontological ethics.  One of the predominant rule schemes utilized by deontologists is the [[Divine Command Theory]]. Deontology also depends upon meta-ethical [[Philosophical realism|realism]], in that it postulates the existence of [[moral absolute]]s that make an action moral, regardless of circumstances.  For more information on deontological ethics refer to the work of [[Immanuel Kant]].

The next predominant school of thought in normative ethics is [[consequentialism]].  While deontology places the emphasis on doing one's duty, which is established by some kind of moral imperative (in other words, the emphasis is on obedience to some higher moral absolute), consequentialism bases the morality of an action upon the consequences of the outcome.  Instead of saying that one has a moral duty to abstain from murder, a consequentialist would say that we should abstain from murder because it causes undesirable effects.  The main contention here is what outcomes should/can be identified as objectively desirable.  The [[Greatest Happiness Principle]] of [[John Stuart Mill]] is one of the most commonly adopted criteria.  Mill asserts that our determinant of the desirability of an action is the net amount of happiness it brings, the number of people it brings it to, and the duration of the happiness.  He also tries to delineate classes of happiness, some being preferable to others, but there is a great deal of difficulty in classifying such concepts.  
{{see|Utilitarianism|Utilitarianism (book)|On Liberty}}
Virtue ethics differs from both deontology consequentialism as it focuses on being over doing. A virtue ethicist identifies [[virtues]], desirable characteristics, that the moral or virtuous person embodies.  Possessing these virtues is what makes one moral, and one's actions are a mere reflection of one's inner morality.  To the virtue philosopher, action cannot be used as a demarcation of morality, because a virtue encompasses more than just a simple selection of action.  Instead, it is about a way of being that would cause the person exhibiting the virtue to make a certain "virtuous" choice consistently in each situation.  There is a great deal of disagreement within virtue ethics over what are virtues and what are not.  There are also difficulties in identifying what is the "virtuous" action to take in all circumstances, and how to define a virtue.

Consequentialist and deontological theories often still employ the term 'virtue', but in a restricted sense, namely as a tendency or disposition to adhere to the system's principles or rules.  These very different senses of what constitutes virtue, hidden behind the same word, are a potential source of confusion.  This disagreement over the meaning of virtue points to a larger conflict between virtue theory and its philosophical rivals.  A system of virtue theory is only intelligible if it is [[teleological]]: that is, if it includes an account of the purpose (''telos'') of human life, or in popular language, the [[meaning of life]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Obviously, strong claims about the purpose of human life, or of what the good life for human beings is, will be highly controversial.  Virtue theory's necessary commitment to a teleological account of human life thus puts the tradition in sharp tension with other dominant approaches to normative ethics, which, because they focus on actions, do not bear this burden.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Virtue ethics mainly deals with the honesty and morality of a person. It states that practicing good habits such as honesty, generosity makes a moral and virtuous person. It guides a person without specific rules for resolving the ethical complexity.

=== Virtue and politics ===
Virtue theory emphasises [[Aristotle]]'s belief in the [[polis]] as the acme of political organisation, and the role of the virtues in enabling human beings to flourish in that environment. Classical republicanism in contrast emphasises [[Tacitus]]' concern that power and luxury can corrupt individuals and destroy liberty, as Tacitus perceived in the transformation of the [[Roman Republic]] into the [[Roman Empire]]; virtue for classical republicans is a shield against this sort of corruption and a means to preserve the good life one has, rather than a means by which to achieve the good life one does not yet have. Another way to put the distinction between the two traditions is that virtue ethics relies on Aristotle's fundamental distinction between the human-being-as-he-is from the human-being-as-he-should-be, while classical republicanism relies on the Tacitean distinction of the human-being-as-he-is from the human-being-as-he-is-at-risk-of-becoming.&lt;ref&gt;J.G.A. Pocock, The Machiavellian Moment&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applied virtue ethics ===
Virtue ethics has a number of contemporary applications.

;Social and political philosophy
Within the field of social ethics, [[Deirdre McCloskey]] argues that virtue ethics can provide a basis for a balanced approach to understanding capitalism and capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, D. ''The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce.'' (2007) Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-55664-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Education
Within the field of [[philosophy of education]], [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] argues that virtue ethics can provide a rationale and foundation for [[peace education]].&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) '' Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations. '' Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Health care and medical ethics

[[Thomas Alured Faunce]] has argued that whistleblowing in the healthcare setting would be more respected within clinical governance pathways if it had a firmer academic foundation in virtue ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA Developing and Teaching the Virtue-Ethics Foundations of Healthcare Whistle Blowing Monash Bioethics Review 2004; 23(4): 41-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA and Jefferys S.

{{distinguish|Wilderness}}

'''Wildness''', in its literal sense, is the quality of being [[Wildlife|wild]] or [[Domestication|untamed]]. Beyond this, it has been defined as a quality produced in [[nature]],&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; as that which emerges from a forest,&lt;ref&gt;Micoud 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a level of achievement in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Cookson 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "a quality of interactive processing between organism and nature where the realities of base natures are met, allowing the construction of durable systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cookson |first=L. J. |title=A definition for wildness |journal=Ecopsychology |year=2011 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=187–193 |doi=10.1089/eco.2011.0028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[wilderness]] is a place where wildness occurs.

== Cultural perceptions of wildness ==
People have explored the contrast of wildness versus tameness throughout recorded history. The earliest great work of literature, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], tells a story of a wild man [[Enkidu]] in opposition to [[Gilgamesh]] who personifies civilization. In the story, Enkidu is defeated by Gilgamesh and becomes civilized. Cultures vary in their perception of the separation of humans from nature, with [[western civilization]] drawing a sharp contrast between the two while the traditions of many [[indigenous peoples]] have always seen humans as part of nature. The perception of man's place in nature and civilization has also changed over time. In western civilization, for example, [[Darwinism]] and environmentalism have renewed the perception of humans as part of nature, rather than separate from it.
 
Wildness is often mentioned in the writings of naturalists, such as [[John Muir]] and [[David Brower]], where it is admired for its freshness and otherness. [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote the famous phrase, “In wildness is the preservation of the world.” Some artists and photographers such as [[Eliot Porter]] explore wildness in the themes of their works. The benefits of reconnecting with nature by seeing the achievements of wildness is an area being investigated by [[ecopsychology]].

Attempts to identify the characteristics of wildness are varied. One consideration sees wildness as that part of nature which is not controllable by humans. Nature retains a measure of autonomy, or wildness, apart from human constructions (Evanoff, 2005). Another version of this theme is that wildness produces things that are natural, while humans produce things that are artificial (man-made). Ambiguities about the distinction between the natural and the artificial animate much of art, literature and philosophy. There is the perception that naturally produced items have a greater elegance over artificial things. Modern zoos seek to improve the health and vigour of animals by simulating natural settings, in a move away from stark man-made structures.

Another view of wildness is that it is a social construct (Callicott 1994), and that humans cannot be considered innately ‘unnatural’. As wildness is claimed to be a quality that builds from animals and ecosystems, it often fails to be considered within reductionist theories for nature.

Meanwhile, an [[Ecology|ecological]] perspective sees wildness as "(the degree of) subjection to [[natural selection]] pressures", many of which emerge independently from the [[biosphere]].  Thus [[modern civilization]] - contrasted with all [[human]]ity – can be seen as an 'unnatural' force (lacking wildness) as it strongly insulates its population from many natural selection mechanisms, including [[interspecific competition]] such as predation and disease, as well as some [[intraspecific]] phenomena.

== Wildness in animals ==

The importance of maintaining wildness in animals is recognized in the management of [[Wilderness areas]]. Feeding wild animals in national parks for example, is usually discouraged because the animals may lose the skills they need to fend for themselves. Human interventions may also upset continued [[natural selection]] pressures upon the population, producing a version of [[domestication]] within wildlife (Peterson et al. 2005).

Tameness implies a reduction in wildness, where animals become more easily handled by humans. Some animals are easier to tame than others, and are amenable to domestication.

===Rating scales for mouse wildness===
In a clinical setting, ''wildness'' has been used as a scale to rate the ease with which various strains of laboratory mice can be captured and handled ([http://phenome.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=projects/doc&amp;sym=Wahlsten2&amp;doc=protocol Wahlsten et al. 2003]):

In this sense, "wildness" may be interpreted as "tendency to respond with anxiety to handling".  That there is no ''necessary'' connection between this factor and the state of wildness ''per se'', given that some animals in the wild may be handled with little or no cause of anxiety. However, this factor does clearly indicate an animal's resistance to being handled.

===Degrees of domestication===
{{main|Domestication}}
A [[Categorization|classification]] system can be set out showing the spectrum from wild to domesticated animal states:
* '''Wild''': These species experience their full life cycles without deliberate human intervention.
* '''Raised at [[zoo]]s or [[botanical garden]]s''' (captive): These species are nurtured and sometimes bred under human control, but remain as a group essentially indistinguishable in appearance or behaviour from their wild counterparts. (Zoos and botanical gardens sometimes exhibit domesticated or feral animals and plants such as [[camel]]s, [[Mustang (horse)|mustang]]s, and some [[orchids]].)
* '''Raised commercially''' (captive or semidomesticated): These species are [[ranch]]ed or [[farm]]ed in large numbers for food, commodities, or the pet trade, but as a group they are not substantially altered in appearance or behavior.  Examples include the [[elephant]], [[ostrich]], [[deer]], [[alligator]], [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], [[pearl]] [[oyster]], and [[ball python]]. (These species are sometimes referred to as ''partially domesticated''.)
* '''Domesticated''': These species or varieties are bred and raised under human control for many generations and are substantially altered as a group in appearance or behaviour. Examples include the [[domestic canary|canary]], [[pigeon]]s, the [[budgerigar]], the [[peach-faced lovebird]], [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[llama]]s, [[guinea pig]]s and laboratory [[mouse|mice]].

This classification system does not account for several complicating factors: [[genetically modified]] organisms, [[feral]] populations, and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].  Many species that are farmed or ranched are now being genetically modified. This creates a unique category of them because it alters the organisms as a group but in ways unlike traditional domestication. Feral organisms are members of a population that was once raised under human control, but is now living and multiplying outside of human control.  Examples include [[Mustang (horse)|mustangs]].  Hybrids can be wild, domesticated, or both: a [[liger]] is a hybrid of two wild animals, a [[mule]] is a hybrid of two domesticated animals, and a [[beefalo]] is a cross between a wild and a domestic animal.

== Wildness in human psychology ==
{{main|Ecopsychology}}

The basic idea of ecopsychology is that while the human mind is shaped by the modern social world, it can be readily inspired and comforted by the wider natural world, because that is the arena in which it originally evolved. Mental health or unhealth cannot be understood in the narrow context of only intrapsychic phenomena or social relations. One also has to include the relationship of humans to other species and ecosystems. These relations have a deep evolutionary history; reach a natural affinity within the structure of their brains and they have deep psychic significance in the present time, in spite of urbanization. Humans are dependent on healthy nature not only for their physical sustenance, but for mental health, too.

== Wildness in political philosophy ==
{{main|State of nature}}

The concept of a state of nature was first posited by the 17th century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''. Hobbes described the concept in the Latin phrase ''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]'', meaning "the war of all against all." In this state any person has a [[natural right]] to do anything to preserve their own liberty or safety. Famously, he believed that such a condition would lead to a "war of every man against every man" and make life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

Hobbes's view was challenged in the eighteenth century by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who claimed that Hobbes was taking socialized persons and simply imagining them living outside of the society they were raised in. He affirmed instead that people were born neither good nor bad; men knew neither vice nor virtue since they had almost no dealings with each other. Their bad habits are the products of [[civilization]] specifically social hierarchies, [[property]], and markets. Another criticism put forth by [[Karl Marx]] is his concept of [[species-being]], or the unique potential of humans for dynamic, creative, and cooperative relations between each other. For Marx and others in his line of [[critical theory]], [[Social alienation|alienated]] and [[reification (Marxism)|abstracted]] social relations prevent the fulfillment of this potential (see [[anomie]]).

[[David Hume]]'s view brings together and challenges the theories of Rousseau and Hobbes. He posits that in the natural state we are born wicked and evil because of, for instance, the cry of the baby that demands attention. Like Rousseau, he believes that society shapes us, but that we are born evil and it is up to society to shape us into who we become.

[[Thoreau]] made many statements on wildness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute Freedom and Wildness, as contrasted with a Freedom and Culture merely civil, — to regard man as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society.  — "Walking"

I long for wildness, a nature which I cannot put my foot through, woods where the wood thrush forever sings, where the hours are early morning ones, and there is dew on the grass, and the day is forever unproved, where I might have a fertile unknown for a soil about me.  — Journal, 22 June 1853

As I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my pole, it being now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight, and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw; not that I was hungry then, except for that wildness which he represented.  — Walden

What we call wildness is a civilization other than our own.  — Journal, 16 February 1859

In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

We need the tonic of wildness — to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hearing the booming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close o the ground.  — Walden

It is in vain to dream of a wildness distant from ourselves. There is none such.  — Journal, 30 August 1856

The most alive is the wildest.  — "Walking"

Whatever has not come under the sway of man is wild. In this sense original and independent men are wild — not tamed and broken by society.  — Journal, 3 September 1851

Trench says a wild man is a willed man. Well, then, a man of will who does what he wills or wishes, a man of hope and of the future tense, for not only the obstinate is willed, but far more the constant and persevering. The obstinate man, properly speaking, is one who will not. The perseverance of the saints is positive willedness, not a mere passive willingness. The fates are wild, for they will; and the Almighty is wild above all, as fate is.  — Journal, 27 June 1853&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Zeno's paradoxes''' are a set of [[philosophy|philosophical]] problems generally thought to have been devised by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] (c. 490–430 BC) to support [[Parmenides]]' doctrine that contrary to the evidence of one's senses, the belief in [[Ontological pluralism|plurality]] and change is mistaken, and in particular that [[motion (physics)|motion]] is nothing but an [[illusion]].  It is usually assumed, based on [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Parmenides (dialogue)|''Parmenides'']] (128a–d), that Zeno took on the project of creating these [[paradox]]es because other philosophers had created paradoxes against Parmenides' view.  Thus Plato has Zeno say the purpose of the paradoxes "is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one."&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'' 128d&lt;/ref&gt; Plato has [[Socrates]] claim that Zeno and Parmenides were essentially arguing exactly the same point.&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'' 128a–b&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Zeno's nine surviving paradoxes (preserved in [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Physics'']]&lt;ref name=aristotle&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.html Aristotle's ''Physics''] "Physics" by Aristotle translated by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye

and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius's]] commentary thereon) are essentially equivalent to one another. Aristotle offered a refutation of some of them.&lt;ref name=aristotle/&gt;  Three of the strongest and most famous—that of Achilles and the tortoise, the [[Dichotomy]] argument, and that of an arrow in flight—are presented in detail below.

Zeno's arguments are perhaps the first examples of a method of proof called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' also known as [[proof by contradiction]].  They are also credited as a source of the [[dialectic]] method used by Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;([fragment 65], Diogenes Laertius. [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlzeno-eleatic.htm IX] 25ff and VIII 57).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mathematicians and historians, such as [[Carl Boyer]], hold that Zeno's paradoxes are simply mathematical problems, for which modern [[calculus]] provides a mathematical solution.&lt;ref name=boyer&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyer |first=Carl |title=The History of the Calculus and Its Conceptual Development |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w3xKLt_da2UC&amp;dq=zeno+calculus&amp;q=zeno#v=snippet&amp;q=zeno |year=1959 |publisher=Dover Publications  |accessdate=2010-02-26 |page=295 | quote=If the paradoxes are thus stated in the precise mathematical terminology of continuous variables (...) the seeming contradictions resolve themselves. |isbn=978-0-486-60509-8 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[philosopher]]s, however, say that Zeno's paradoxes and their variations (see [[Thomson's lamp]]) remain relevant [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] problems.&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=FMoorcroft&gt;{{cite web |first=Francis |last=Moorcroft |title=Zeno's Paradox |url=http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/paradox5.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418141459/http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/paradox5.htm |archivedate=2010-04-18 }}

The origins of the paradoxes are somewhat unclear. [[Diogenes Laertius]], a fourth source for information about Zeno and his teachings, citing [[Favorinus]], says that Zeno's teacher Parmenides was the first to introduce the Achilles and the tortoise paradox. But in a later passage, Laertius attributes the origin of the paradox to Zeno, explaining that Favorinus disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', 9.23 and 9.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paradoxes of motion ==

=== Achilles and the tortoise ===
{{Redirect|Achilles and the Tortoise}}
[[File:Race between Achilles and the tortoise.gif|thumb|Distance vs. time, assuming the tortoise to run at Achilles' half speed]]
[[File:Zeno Achilles Paradox.png|thumb|left|Achilles and the tortoise]]
{{ quote
| In a race, the quickest runner can never overtake the slowest, since the pursuer must first reach the point whence the pursued started, so that the slower must always hold a lead.| as recounted by [[Aristotle]], [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']] VI:9, 239b15
}}
In the paradox of [[Achilles]] and the [[tortoise]], Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] of 100 meters, for example. Supposing that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite [[time]], Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise.&lt;ref&gt;

Suppose Homer wishes to walk to the end of a path. Before he can get there, he must get halfway there. Before he can get halfway there, he must get a quarter of the way there. Before traveling a quarter, he must travel one-eighth; before an eighth, one-sixteenth; and so on.

The resulting sequence can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt; \left\{ \cdots,  \frac{1}{16},  \frac{1}{8},  \frac{1}{4},  \frac{1}{2},  1 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

This description requires one to complete an infinite number of tasks, which Zeno maintains is an impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48205-7|page=33|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sequence also presents a second problem in that it contains no first distance to run, for any possible ([[wikt:finite|finite]]) first distance could be divided in half, and hence would not be first after all. Hence, the trip cannot even begin. The paradoxical conclusion then would be that travel over any finite distance can neither be completed nor begun, and so all motion must be an [[illusion]]. An alternative conclusion, [[Duration (philosophy)#Responses to Kant and Zeno|proposed]] by [[Henri Bergson]], is that motion (time and distance) is not actually divisible.

This argument is called the ''[[Dichotomy]]'' because it involves repeatedly splitting a distance into two parts. It contains some of the same elements as the ''Achilles and the Tortoise'' paradox, but with a more apparent conclusion of motionlessness. It is also known as the '''Race Course''' paradox. Some, like Aristotle, regard the Dichotomy as really just another version of ''Achilles and the Tortoise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#Dic |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 3.1 The Dichotomy |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrow paradox ===
[[File:Zeno Arrow Paradox.png|thumb|The arrow]]

{{quote|If everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html#752 |work=The Internet Classics Archive |title=Physics |author=Aristotle |quote=Zeno's reasoning, however, is fallacious, when he says that if everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless. This is false, for time is not composed of indivisible moments any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;|as recounted by [[Aristotle]], [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']] VI:9, 239b5}}

In the arrow paradox (also known as the '''[[fletching|fletcher's]] paradox'''), Zeno states that for motion to occur, an object must change the position which it occupies. He gives an example of an arrow in flight. He states that in any one (duration-less) instant of time, the arrow is neither moving to where it is, nor to where it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | chapter-url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_IX#Pyrrho | first=Diogenes |last=Laertius |authorlink=Diogenes Laërtius | title=[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]] | volume=IX |chapter=Pyrrho  |at= passage 72 | year=c. 230| isbn=1-116-71900-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It cannot move to where it is not, because no time elapses for it to move there; it cannot move to where it is, because it is already there. In other words, at every instant of time there is no motion occurring.  If everything is motionless at every instant, and time is entirely composed of instants, then motion is impossible.

Whereas the first two paradoxes divide space, this paradox starts by dividing time—and not into segments, but into points.&lt;ref name=HuggettArrow&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#Arr |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 3.3 The Arrow |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three other paradoxes as given by Aristotle ==

=== Paradox of Place ===
From Aristotle:
{{quote
|If everything that exists has a place, place too will have a place, and so on ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.4.iv.html ''Physics'' IV:1, 209a25]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Paradox of the Grain of Millet ===
Description of the paradox from the ''Routledge Dictionary of Philosophy'':
{{quote
|The argument is that a single grain of [[millet]] makes no sound upon falling, but a thousand grains make a sound. Hence a thousand nothings become something, an absurd conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;The Michael Proudfoot, A.R. Lace. Routledge Dictionary of Philosophy. Routledge 2009, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle's refutation:
{{quote
|Zeno is wrong in saying that there is no part of the millet that does not make a sound: for there is no reason why any such part should not in any length of time fail to move the air that the whole bushel moves in falling. In fact it does not of itself move even such a quantity of the air as it would move if this part were by itself: for no part even exists otherwise than potentially.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.7.vii.html ''Physics'' VII:5, 250a20]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Description from Nick Huggett:
{{quote
|This is a [[Parmenides|Parmenidean]] argument that one cannot trust one's sense of hearing. Aristotle's response seems to be that even inaudible sounds can add to an audible sound.&lt;ref&gt;Huggett, Nick, "Zeno's Paradoxes", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#GraMil&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The Moving Rows (or Stadium) ===
[[File:Zeno Moving Rows Paradox.png|thumb|The moving rows]]From Aristotle:
{{quote
|... concerning the two rows of bodies, each row being composed of an equal number of bodies of equal size, passing each other on a race-course as they proceed with equal velocity in opposite directions, the one row originally occupying the space between the goal and the middle point of the course and the other that between the middle point and the starting-post. This...involves the conclusion that half a given time is equal to double that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html ''Physics'' VI:9, 239b33]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], [[Diogenes the Cynic]] said nothing upon hearing Zeno's arguments, but stood up and walked, in order to demonstrate the falsity of Zeno's conclusions (see ''[[solvitur ambulando]]''). To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show what is wrong with the argument, not just the conclusions. Through history, several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] (384 BC−322 BC) remarked that as the distance decreases, the time needed to cover those distances also decreases, so that the time needed also becomes increasingly small.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. Physics 6.9
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Aristotle's observation that the fractional times also get shorter does not guarantee, in every case, that the task can be completed. One case in which it does not hold is that in which the fractional times decrease in a [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], while the distances decrease geometrically, such as: 1/2 s for 1/2 m gain, 1/3 s for next 1/4 m gain, 1/4 s for next 1/8 m gain, 1/5 s for next 1/16 m gain, 1/6 s for next 1/32 m gain, etc. In this case, the distances form a convergent series, but the times form a [[divergent series]], the sum of which has no limit. Archimedes developed a more explicitly mathematical approach than Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle also distinguished "things infinite in respect of divisibility" (such as a unit of space that can be mentally divided into ever smaller units while remaining spatially the same) from things (or distances) that are infinite in extension ("with respect to their extremities").&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. Physics 6.9; 6.2, 233a21-31&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle's objection to the arrow paradox was that "Time is not composed of indivisible nows any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html |title=Physics |volume=VI |at=Part 9 verse: 239b5 |isbn=0-585-09205-2 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thomas Aquinas ===
[[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;!-- please do not change to Saint Thomas Aquinas, see [[MOS:SAINTS]] --&gt; commenting on Aristotle's objection, wrote "Instants are not parts of time, for time is not made up of instants any more than a magnitude is made of points, as we have already proved. Hence it does not follow that a thing is not in motion in a given time, just because it is not in motion in any instant of that time."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. Commentary on Aristotle's Physics, Book 6.861
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archimedes ===
Before 212 BC, [[Archimedes]] had developed a method to derive a finite answer for the sum of infinitely many terms that get progressively smaller. (See: [[Geometric series]], [[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · ·]], ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''.) Modern calculus achieves the same result, using more rigorous methods (see [[convergent series]], where the "reciprocals of powers of 2" series, equivalent to the Dichotomy Paradox, is listed as convergent). These methods allow the construction of solutions based on the conditions stipulated by Zeno, i.e. the amount of time taken at each step is geometrically decreasing.&lt;ref name=boyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George B. Thomas, ''Calculus and Analytic Geometry'', Addison Wesley, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bertrand Russell ===
[[Bertrand Russell]] offered what is known as the "at-at theory of motion". It agrees that there can be no motion "during" a durationless instant, and contends that all that is required for motion is that the arrow be at one point at one time, at another point another time, and at appropriate points between those two points for intervening times. In this view motion is a function of position with respect to time.&lt;ref name=HuggettBook&gt;{{ cite book |title=Space From Zeno to Einstein |first=Nick |last=Huggett |year=1999 |isbn=0-262-08271-3 }}

=== Nick Huggett ===
Nick Huggett argues that Zeno is [[begging the question|assuming the conclusion]] when he says that objects that occupy the same space as they do at rest must be at rest.&lt;ref name=HuggettArrow/&gt;

=== Peter Lynds ===
Peter Lynds has argued that all of Zeno's motion paradoxes are resolved by the conclusion that instants in time and instantaneous magnitudes do not physically exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1197/|title=Zeno's Paradoxes: A Timely Solution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Lynds, Peter. Time and Classical and Quantum Mechanics: Indeterminacy vs. Discontinuity. Foundations of Physics Letter s (Vol. 16, Issue 4, 2003). doi:10.1023/A:1025361725408
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time’s Up Einstein"&gt;
[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.06/physics.html Time’s Up Einstein], Josh McHugh, [[Wired Magazine]], June 2005
&lt;/ref&gt;
Lynds argues that an object in relative motion cannot have an instantaneous or determined relative position (for if it did, it could not be in motion), and so cannot have its motion fractionally dissected as if it does, as is assumed by the paradoxes. For more about the inability to know both speed and location, see [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].

=== Hermann Weyl ===
Another proposed solution is to question one of the assumptions Zeno used in his paradoxes (particularly the Dichotomy), which is that between any two different points in space (or time), there is always another point. Without this assumption there are only a finite number of distances between two points, hence there is no infinite sequence of movements, and the paradox is resolved. The ideas of [[Planck length]] and [[Planck time]] in modern physics place a limit on the measurement of time and space, if not on time and space themselves. According to [[Hermann Weyl]], the assumption that space is made of finite and discrete units is subject to a further problem, given by the "[[Weyl's tile argument|tile argument]]" or "distance function problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Bendegem|first=Jean Paul|title=Finitism in Geometry|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/geometry-finitism/#SomParSolProDea|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2012-01-03|date=17 March 2010 }}

&lt;/ref&gt;
According to this, the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle in discretized space is always equal to the length of one of the two sides, in contradiction to geometry. [[Jean Paul Van Bendegem]] has argued that the Tile Argument can be resolved, and that discretization can therefore remove the paradox.&lt;ref name=boyer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=187807 |title=Discussion:Zeno's Paradoxes and the Tile Argument |first=Jean Paul |last=van Bendegem |location= Belgium |year=1987 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=295–302|doi=10.1086/289379}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== The paradoxes in modern times ==
Infinite processes remained theoretically troublesome in mathematics until the late 19th century. The [[Ε-δ definition|epsilon-delta]] version of [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]] and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] developed a rigorous formulation of the logic and calculus involved. These works resolved the mathematics involving infinite processes.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Harold | title=Are Zeno's Paradoxes Based on a Mistake? |jstor=2251675 |year=1965 |journal= [[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |volume=74 |issue=296 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages= 563–570 |doi=10.1093/mind/LXXIV.296.563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=russell&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|B Russell]] (1956) ''Mathematics and the metaphysicians'' in "The World of Mathematics" (ed. [[James R. Newman|J R Newman]]), pp 1576-1590.&lt;/ref&gt;

While mathematics can calculate where and when the moving Achilles will overtake the Tortoise of Zeno's paradox, philosophers such as Brown and Moorcroft&lt;ref name=KBrown&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FMoorcroft/&gt;
claim that mathematics does not address the central point in Zeno's argument, and that solving the mathematical issues does not solve every issue the paradoxes raise.

Popular literature often misrepresents Zeno's arguments. For example, Zeno is often said to have argued that the sum of an infinite number of terms must itself be infinite–with the result that not only the time, but also the distance to be travelled, become infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Benson|first= Donald C.|title= The Moment of Proof : Mathematical Epiphanies|year= 1999|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0195117219|page= 14|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8_vbuzxrpfIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A humorous take is offered by [[Tom Stoppard]] in his play Jumpers (1972), in which the principal protagonist, the philosophy professor George Moore, suggests that according to Zeno’s paradox, [[Saint Sebastian]], a 3rd Century Christian saint supposedly martyred by being shot with arrows, died of fright.  However, none of the original ancient sources has Zeno discussing the sum of any infinite series. Simplicius has Zeno saying "it is impossible to traverse an infinite number of things in a finite time". This presents Zeno's problem not with finding the ''sum'', but rather with ''finishing'' a task with an infinite number of steps: how can one ever get from A to B, if an infinite number of (non-instantaneous) events can be identified that need to precede the arrival at B, and one cannot reach even the beginning of a "last event"?&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=FMoorcroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=Papa-G /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#ZenInf |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 5. Zeno's Influence on Philosophy |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate continues on the question of whether or not Zeno's paradoxes have been resolved. In ''The History of Mathematics: An Introduction'' (2010) Burton writes, "Although Zeno's argument confounded his contemporaries, a satisfactory explanation incorporates a now-familiar idea, the notion of a 'convergent infinite series.'".&lt;ref&gt;Burton, David, ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', McGraw Hill, 2010, {{isbn|978-0-07-338315-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] offered a "solution" to the paradoxes based on the work of [[Georg Cantor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |date=2002 |title=Our Knowledge of the External World: As a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy |chapter=Lecture 6. The Problem of Infinity Considered Historically |publisher=Routledge |page=169 |orig-year=First published in 1914 by The Open Court Publishing Company |isbn=0-415-09605-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Brown concludes "Given the history of 'final resolutions', from Aristotle onwards, it's probably foolhardy to think we've reached the end. It may be that Zeno's arguments on motion, because of their simplicity and universality, will always serve as a kind of [[Rorschach test|'Rorschach image']] onto which people can project their most fundamental phenomenological concerns (if they have any)."&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;

==A similar ancient Chinese philosophic consideration==
[[History of Science and Technology in China|Ancient Han Chinese]] philosophers from the [[School of Names|Mohist School of Names]] during the [[Warring States period|Warring States period of China (479-221 BCE)]] independently developed equivalents to some of Zeno's paradoxes. The scientist and historian [[Joseph Needham|Sir Joseph Needham]], in his ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'', describes an [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]] paradox from the surviving [[School of Names|Mohist School of Names]] book of logic which states, in the [[archaism|archaic]] [[Old Chinese|ancient Chinese script]], "a one-foot stick, every day take away half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted." Several other paradoxes from this philosophical school (more precisely, movement) are known, but their modern interpretation is more speculative.

== Quantum Zeno effect ==
{{Main article|Quantum Zeno effect}}

In 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |bibcode=1977JMP....18..756M |last=Sudarshan |first=E. C. G. |authorlink=E. C. G.

&lt;/ref&gt; physicists [[E. C. George Sudarshan]] and B. Misra discovered that the dynamical evolution (motion) of a quantum system can be hindered (or even inhibited) through observation of the system.&lt;ref name="u0"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/858.pdf |format=PDF |author1=W.M.Itano |author2=D.J.

&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is usually called the "quantum Zeno effect" as it is strongly reminiscent of Zeno's arrow paradox. This effect was first theorized in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |last=Khalfin |first=L.A. |author-link=   |journal=Soviet Phys.

== Zeno behaviour ==
In the field of verification and design of [[timed event system|timed]] and [[hybrid system]]s, the system behaviour is called ''Zeno'' if it includes an infinite number of discrete steps in a finite amount of time.&lt;ref name="Fishwick2007"&gt;{{cite book | editor=Paul A.

Mosterman, The Mathworks, Inc. }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[formal verification]] techniques exclude these behaviours from analysis, if they are not equivalent to non-Zeno behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lamport |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Lamport |year=2002 |title=Specifying Systems |format=PDF |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-14306-X |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book-02-08-08.pdf |page=128 |accessdate=2010-03-06 }}

In [[systems design]] these behaviours will also often be excluded from system models, since they cannot be implemented with a digital controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Henzinger |first2=Thomas |last1=Franck |first1=Cassez |first3=Jean-Francois |last3=Raskin |url=http://mtc.epfl.ch/~tah/Publications/a_comparison_of_control_problems_for_timed_and_hybrid_systems.html |title=A Comparison of Control Problems for Timed and Hybrid Systems |year=2002 |accessdate=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528193234/http://mtc.epfl.ch/~tah/Publications/a_comparison_of_control_problems_for_timed_and_hybrid_systems.html |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
