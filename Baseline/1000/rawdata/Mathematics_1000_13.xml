      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24755">In [[mathematics]], the term "'''almost all'''" means "all but a negligible amount". More precisely, if &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], "almost all elements of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;" means "all elements of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; but those in a [[negligible set|negligible]] [[subset]] of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;". The meaning of "negligible" depends on the mathematical context; for instance, it can mean [[finite set|finite]], [[countable set|countable]], or [[null set|null]].

In contrast, "'''almost no'''" means "a negligible amount"; that is, "almost no elements of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;" means "the elements of some negligible subset of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;".

==Meanings in areas of mathematics==
===Prevalent meaning===
{{further|Cofinite set}}
Throughout mathematics, "almost all" is sometimes used to mean "all (elements of an [[infinite set]]) but [[finite set|finite]]ly many".{{r|Cahen1|Cahen2|Halmos}} This use occurs in philosophy as well.{{r|Gardenfors}} Similarly, "almost all" can mean "all (elements of an [[uncountable set]]) but [[countable set|countably]] many".{{r|Schwartzman|group=sec}}

Examples:
* Almost all positive integers are greater than 1,000,000,000,000.{{r|Courant|page=293}}
* Almost all [[prime number]]s are odd, as 2 is the only exception.
* Almost all [[polyhedra]] are [[regular polyhedron#The regular polyhedra|irregular]], as there are only nine exceptions: the five [[platonic solid]]s and the four [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].
* If &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; is a [[zero polynomial|nonzero]] polynomial, &lt;var&gt;P(x)&lt;/var&gt;&amp;ne;0 for almost all &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;.

===Meaning in measure theory===
{{further|Almost everywhere}}
[[File:CantorEscalier.svg|thumb|right|250px| The Cantor function]]

When speaking about the [[real number|reals]], sometimes "almost all" means "all reals but a [[null set]]".{{r|Korevaar|Natanson}}{{r|Clapham|group=sec}} Similarly, if &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; is some set of reals, "almost all numbers in &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;" can mean "all numbers in &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; but those in a null set".{{r|Sohrab}} The [[real line]] can be thought of as a one-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. In the more general case of an &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;-dimensional space (where &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; is a positive integer), these definitions can be [[generalised]] to "all points but those in a null set"{{r|James|group=sec}} or "all points in &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; but those in a null set" (this time, &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; is a set of points in the space).{{r|Helmberg}} Even more generally, "almost all" is sometimes used in the sense of "[[almost everywhere]]" in [[measure theory]],{{r|Vestrup|Billingsley}}{{r|Bityutskov|group=sec}} or in the closely related sense of "[[almost surely]]" in [[probability theory]].{{r|Billingsley}}{{r|Ito2|group=sec}}

Examples:
* In a [[measure space]], such as the real line, countable sets are null. The set of [[rational number]]s is countable, and thus almost all real numbers are irrational.{{r|Niven}}
* As [[Georg Cantor]] proved in [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|his first set theory article]], the set of [[algebraic number]]s is countable as well, so almost all reals are [[transcendental number|transcendental]].{{r|Baker}}
* Almost all reals are [[normal number|normal]].{{r|Granville}}
* The [[Cantor set]] is null as well. Thus, almost all reals are not members of it even though it is uncountable.{{r|Korevaar}}
* The derivative of the [[Cantor function]] is 0 for almost all numbers in the [[unit interval]].{{r|Burk}} It follows from the previous example because the Cantor function is [[locally constant function|locally constant]]&amp;mdash;and thus with derivative 0&amp;mdash;outside the Cantor set.

===Meaning in number theory===
{{further|Asymptotically almost surely}}
In [[number theory]], "almost all positive integers" can mean "the positive integers in a set whose [[natural density]] is 1". That is, if &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; is a set of positive integers, and if the proportion of positive integers below &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; that are in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; (out of all positive integers below &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;) [[limit of a sequence|tends to]] 1 as &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to infinity, then almost all positive integers are in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;.{{r|Hardy1|Hardy2}}{{r|Weisstein|group=sec}} More generally, let &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; be an infinite set of positive integers, such as the set of even positive numbers or of [[prime number|primes]]. If &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; is a subset of &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;, and if the proportion of elements of &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; below &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; that are in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; (out of all elements of &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; below &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;) tends to 1 as &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to infinity, then it can be said that almost all elements of &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; are in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;.

Examples:
* The natural density of [[cofinite set]]s of positive integers is 1, so each of them contains almost all positive integers.
* Almost all positive integers are [[composite number|composite]].{{r|Weisstein|group=sec}}{{refn |group=proof |According to the [[prime number theorem]], the number of primes less than or equal to &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; is asymptotically equal to &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;/ln(&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;). Therefore, the proportion of primes is roughly ln(&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;)/&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;, which tends to 0 as &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to [[infinity]], so the proportion of composite numbers less than or equal to &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to 1 as &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to [[infinity]].{{r|Hardy2}}}}
* Almost all even positive numbers can be expressed as the sum of two primes.{{r|Courant|page=489}}
* Almost all primes are [[twin prime#Isolated prime|isolated]]. Moreover, for every positive integer &lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;, almost all primes have [[prime gap]]s of more than &lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt; both to their left and to their right (no other primes between &lt;var&gt;p+g&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;p-g)&lt;/var&gt;.{{r|Prachar}}

===Meaning in graph theory===
In [[graph theory]], if &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; is a set of (finite [[graph labeling|labelled]]) [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, it can be said to contain almost all graphs if the proportion of graphs with &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; vertices that are in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; tends to 1 as &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to infinity.{{r|Babai}} However, it is sometimes easier to work with probabilities,{{r|Spencer}} so the definition is reformulated as follows. The proportion of graphs with &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; vertices that are in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; equals the probability that a random graph with &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; vertices (chosen with the [[discrete uniform distribution|uniform distribution]]) is in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;, and choosing a graph in this way has the same outcome as generating a graph by flipping a coin for each pair of vertices to decide whether to connect them.{{r|Bollobas}} Therefore, equivalently to the preceding definition, &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; contains almost all graphs if the probability that a coin flip-generated graph with &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; vertices is in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; tends to 1 as &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to infinity.{{r|Spencer|Gradel}} Sometimes the latter definition is modified so that the graph is chosen randomly in some [[random graph#Models|other way]], where not all graphs with &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; vertices have the same probability,{{r|Bollobas}} and those modified definitions are not always equivalent to the main one.

The use of the term "almost all" in graph theory is not standard; the term "[[asymptotically almost surely]]" is more commonly used for this concept.{{r|Spencer}}

Example:
* Almost all graphs are [[asymmetric graph|asymmetric]].{{r|Babai}}
* Almost all graphs have [[diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] 2.{{r|Buckley}}

===Meaning in topology===
In [[topology]]{{r|Oxtoby}} and especially [[dynamical systems theory]]{{r|Baratchart|Broer|Sharkovsky}} (including applications in economics),{{r|Yuan}} "almost all" of a [[topological space]]'s points can mean "all of the space's points but those in a [[meagre set]]". Some use a more limited definition, where a subset only contains almost all of the space's points if it contains some [[open set|open]] [[dense set]].{{r|Broer|Albertini|Fuente}}

Example:
* Given an [[hyperconnected space|irreducible]] [[algebraic variety]], the [[property (mathematics)|properties]] that hold for almost all points in the variety are exactly the [[generic property|generic properties]].{{r|Ito1|group=sec}} It is because in an irreducible algebraic variety equipped with the [[Zariski topology]], all nonempty open sets are dense.

===Meaning in algebra===
In [[abstract algebra]] and [[mathematical logic]], if &lt;var&gt;U&lt;/var&gt; is an [[ultrafilter#Special case: ultrafilter on the powerset of a set|ultrafilter]] on a set &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;, "almost all elements of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;" sometimes means "the elements of some ''element'' of &lt;var&gt;U&lt;/var&gt;".{{r|Komjath|Salzmann|Schoutens|Rautenberg}} For any [[partition of a set|partition]] of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; into two [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] sets, one of them necessarily contains almost all elements of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;. It is possible to think of the elements of a [[filter (mathematics)#Filter on a set|filter]] on &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; as containing almost all elements of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; even if it isn't an ultrafilter.{{r|Rautenberg}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2836">The '''Arditi–Ginzburg equations''' describe [[ratio]] dependent [[Predation|predator–prey]] dynamics. Where ''N'' is the population of a prey species and ''P'' that of a predator, the population dynamics are described by the following two equations:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: Ratio-Dependence|url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022519389802115/1-s2.0-S0022519389802115-main.pdf?_tid=1565d0da-6588-11e5-a81d-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1443407265_75f5fff588be891df9d652f2e3d694ff|website = ac.els-cdn.com|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{dN}{dt} &amp; = f(N)\,N-g{\left(\!\tfrac N P \!\right)}P \\[4pt]
\frac{dP}{dt} &amp; = e \,g{\left(\!\tfrac N P\! \right)}P-uP
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''f''(''N'') captures any change in the prey population not due to predator activity including inherent [[Birth rate|birth]] and [[Mortality rate|death rates]]. The per capita effect of predators on the prey population (the harvest rate) is modeled by a function ''g'' which is a function of the [[ratio]] ''N''/''P'' of prey to predators. Predators receive a reproductive payoff, ''e,'' for consuming prey, and die at rate ''u''. Making predation pressure a function of the ratio of prey to predators contrasts with the prey dependent [[Lotka–Volterra equations]], where the effect of predators on the prey population is simply a function of the magnitude of the prey population ''g''(''N''). Because the number of prey harvested by each predator decreases as predators become more [[Population density|dense]], ratio dependent predation represents an example of a [[trophic function]]. Ratio dependent predation may account for [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]]  in large-scale natural systems in which predator efficiency decreases when prey is scarce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The merit of ratio dependent versus prey dependent models of predation has been the subject of much controversy, especially between the biologists [[Lev R. Ginzburg]] and Peter A. Abrams.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title = The nature of predation: prey dependent, ratio dependent or neither?|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953470001908X||accessdate = 2015-09-28|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(00)01908-X|volume=15|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|pages=337–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginzburg purports that ratio dependent models more accurately depict predator-prey interactions while Abrams maintains that these models make unwarranted complicating assumptions.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The '''Arithmeum''' is a mathematics [[museum]] owned by the Forschungsinstitut für Diskrete Mathematik (Research Institute for Discrete Mathematics) at the [[University of Bonn]].

It was founded by the Director of the Institute, [[Bernhard Korte]], who contributed his private collection of [[calculating machine]]s.

The building's steel-glass facade - located at Lennéstrasse 2 - is meant to represent the "transparency of science".

== Exhibitions ==

The permanent exhibit "Calculating in Olden and Modern Times" ({{lang-de|Rechnen Einst und Heute}}) shows the progression of mechanical calculating machines through 1,200 pieces.

It holds the very large,(4000 pieces), IJzebrand Schuitema (1929-2013) 400 year collection of [[slide rules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arithmeum.uni-bonn.de/en/shop/article/72 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108044739/http://www.arithmeum.uni-bonn.de/en/shop/article/72 |archivedate=2015-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rekeninstrumenten.nl/MIR/MIR%20Articles/MIR49%20p%209-13%20Schuitema%20Collection.pdf (English)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.de/dp/3894798335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;lulu.com/shop/ijzebrand-schuitema-and-otto-van-poelje/the-schuitema-collection-hardcover-version/ebook/product-17414042.html Free&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

There are also exhibits on very-large-scale integrated ([[VLSI]]) logic chips, historical arithmetic books dating back to [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s times, and the relationship between art and science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1169">{{confuse|Control variable}}
A '''control variable''' in [[computer programming]] is a [[program variable]] that is used to regulate the [[flow of control]] of the program.

In definite iteration, control variables are variables which are successively assigned (or bound to) values from a predetermined sequence of values.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watt |first1=David A. |title=Programming Language Design Concepts |date=2004 |publisher=Wiley |pages=84-85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special rules ==

In some programming languages control variables are just ordinary variables used for manipulating the program flow. This is the case of [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Fortran]], and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], which allow for control variables to have their values changed within the loop body.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt; However, some languages have special rules for control variables. In [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], for instance, the control variable of the for loop must remain constant within the loop body.

'''Counting rods''' ({{cjkv|t=籌|s=筹|p=chóu|j=算木|r=sangi|k=sangaji}}) are small bars, typically 3–14&amp;nbsp;cm long, that were used by mathematicians for calculation in ancient [[East Asia]].  They are placed either horizontally or vertically to represent any [[integer]] or [[rational number]].

The written forms based on them are called '''rod numerals'''.  They are a true [[positional numeral system]] with [[numerical digit|digits]] for 1–9 and a blank for 0, from the [[Warring States period|Warring states]] period (circa 475 BCE) to the 16th century.

==History==
Chinese arithmeticians used counting rods well over two thousand years ago. In 1954 forty-odd counting rods of the [[Warring States period]] (5th century BCE to 221 BCE) were found in Zuǒjiāgōngshān (左家公山) [[Chu (state)|Chu]] Grave No.15 in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tutorvista.com/math/ancient-china-math Ancient China Math] – Copyright © 2010 – TutorVista.com, All rights reserved.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation| title= 中国独特的计算工具| url=http://mkd.lyge.cn/zhanzheng/a04/x3/040.htm| accessdate= 2007-12-16| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071121050945/http://mkd.lyge.cn/zhanzheng/a04/x3/040.htm| archivedate= 2007-11-21| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=March 2018}}

In 1973 archeologists unearthed a number of wood scripts from a  tomb in Hubei dating from the period of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE to 220 CE). On one of the wooden scripts was written: "当利二月定算[[File:Counting rod v6.png|15px]]".{{cn|date=March 2018}} This is one of the earliest examples of using counting-rod numerals in writing.

In 1976 a bundle of [[Western Han]]-era (202 BCE to 9 CE) counting rods made of bones was unearthed from [[Qianyang County]] in [[Shaanxi]].&lt;ref&gt;Wu Wenjun ed, Grand Series of History of Chinese Mathematics, vol 1, p371&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=March 2018}} The use of counting rods must predate it;  [[Sunzi]] ({{circa}} 544 to {{circa}} 496 BCE), a military strategist at the end of [[Spring and Autumn period]] of 771 BCE to 5th century BCE, mentions their use to make calculations to win wars before going into the battle&lt;ref&gt;孫子: 夫未戰而廟算勝者，得算多也&lt;/ref&gt;; [[Laozi]] (died 531 BCE), writing in the Warring States period,{{cn|date=March 2018}} said "a good calculator doesn't use counting rods".&lt;ref&gt;老子: 善數者不用籌策。&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Book of Han]]'' (finished 111 CE) recorded: "they calculate with bamboo, diameter one fen, length six cun, arranged into a hexagonal bundle of two hundred seventy one pieces".{{cn|date=March 2018}}

At first, calculating rods were round in cross-section, but by the time of the [[Sui dynasty]] (581 to 618 CE) mathematicians used triangular rods to represent positive numbers and rectangular rods for [[negative number]]s.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

After the [[abacus]] flourished{{when?|date=March 2018}}, counting rods were abandoned except in Japan, where rod numerals developed into a symbolic notation for [[algebra]].

==Using counting rods==

Counting rods represent digits by the number of rods, and the [[perpendicular]] rod represents five.  To avoid confusion, vertical and horizontal forms are alternately used.  Generally, vertical rod numbers are used for the position for the units, hundreds, ten thousands, etc., while horizontal rod numbers are used for the tens, thousands, hundred thousands etc.  It is written in ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'' that "one is vertical, ten is horizontal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%AD%AB%E5%AD%90%E7%AE%97%E7%B6%93 Chinese Wikisource] 孫子算經: 先識其位，一從十橫，百立千僵，千十相望，萬百相當。&lt;/ref&gt;

Red rods represent [[positive number]]s and black rods represent [[negative number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:zh:夢溪筆談/卷08|Chinese Wikisource]], 夢溪筆談: 如算法用赤籌、黑籌，以別正負之數。&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Chinese clearly understood negative numbers and zero (leaving a blank space for it), though they had no symbol for the latter.  [[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]], which was mainly composed in the first century CE, stated "(when using subtraction) subtract same signed numbers, add different signed numbers, subtract a positive number from zero to make a negative number, and subtract a negative number from zero to make a positive number".&lt;ref name=wang&gt;{{ Citation

This alternation of vertical and horizontal rod numeral form is very important to understanding written transcription of rod numerals on manuscripts correctly. For instance, in Licheng suanjin, 81 was transcribed as [[File:Counting rod h8.png]][[File:Counting rod v1.png]], and 108 was transcribed as [[File:Counting rod v1.png]][[File:Counting rod v8.png]]; it is clear that the latter clearly had a blank zero on the "counting board" (i.e., floor or mat), even though on the written transcription, there was no blank. In the same manuscript, 405 was transcribed as [[File:Counting rod v4.png]]      [[File:Counting rod v5.png]], with a blank space in between for obvious reasons, and could in no way be interpreted as "45"[[File:Counting rod h4.png]][[File:Counting rod v5.png]]. In other words, transcribed rod numerals may not be positional, but on the counting board, they are positional. [[File:Counting rod v4.png]]      [[File:Counting rod v5.png]] is an exact image of the counting rod number 405 on a table top or floor.

===Place value===
The value of a number depends on its physical position on the counting board.  A 9 at the rightmost position on the board stands for 9.  Moving the batch of rods representing 9 to the left one position (i.e., to the tens place) gives 9[] or 90.  Shifting left again to the third position (to the hundreds place) gives 9[][] or 900.  Each time one shifts a number one position to the left, it is multiplied by 10.  Each time one shifts a number one position to the right, it is divided by 10. This applies to single-digit numbers or multiple-digit numbers.

Song dynasty mathematician [[Jia Xian]] used hand-written Chinese decimal orders 步十百千萬 as rod numeral place value, as evident from a facsimile from a page of [[Yongle Encyclopedia]]. He arranged 七萬一千八百二十四 as

::::::::::::七一八二四
::::::::::::萬千百十步
He treated the Chinese order numbers as place value markers, and 七一八二四 became place value decimal number. He then wrote the rod numerals according to their place value:

In Japan, mathematicians put counting rods on a counting board, a sheet of cloth with grids, and used only vertical forms relying on the grids. An 18th-century Japanese mathematics book has a checker counting board diagram, with the order of magnitude symbols "千百十一分厘毛“(thousand, hundred, ten, unit, tenth, hundredth, thousandth).&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Menninger (mathematics)|Karl Menninger]], Number Words and Number Symbols, p 369, MIT Press, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rod numerals==
Rod numerals are a positional numeral system made from shapes of counting rods.  Positive numbers are written as they are and the negative numbers are written with a slant bar at the last digit. The vertical bar in the horizontal forms 6–9 are drawn shorter to have the same character height.

A circle (〇) is used for 0.  Many historians think it was imported from [[Indian numerals]] by [[Gautama Siddha]] in 718,&lt;ref name="wang"/&gt; but some think it was created from the Chinese text space filler "□", and others think that the Indians acquired it from China, because it resembles a Confucian philosophical symbol for ''nothing''.&lt;ref name="qian"&gt;{{ Citation

 | first=Baocong

 | publisher=Kexue Chubanshe
 | place=Beijing
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, [[Song Dynasty|Southern Song]] mathematicians changed digits for 4, 5, and 9 to reduce strokes.&lt;ref name="qian"/&gt;  The new horizontal forms eventually transformed into [[Suzhou numerals]].  Japanese continued to use the traditional forms.

In Japan, [[Seki Takakazu]] developed the rod numerals into symbolic notation for algebra and drastically improved [[Japanese mathematics]].&lt;ref name="wang"/&gt;  After his period, the [[positional numeral system]] using [[Chinese numerals#Numeral characters|Chinese numeral characters]] was developed, and the rod numerals were used only for the [[plus and minus signs]].

==Fractions==
[[File:Rod fraction.jpg|right|thumb|200px| Fraction 1/7]]
A fraction was expressed with rod numerals as two rod numerals one on top of another (without any other symbol, like the modern horizontal bar).

==Rod calculus==
{{Main|Rod calculus}}
The method for using counting rods for mathematical calculation was called ''rod calculation'' or [[rod calculus]] (筹算). Rod calculus can be used for a wide range of calculations, including finding the value of [[pi|{{pi}}]], finding [[square root]]s, [[cube root]]s, or [[Nth root|higher order roots]], and solving a [[system of linear equations]].

Before the introduction of written zero, there was no way to distinguish 10007 and 107 in written forms except by inserting a bigger space between 1 and 7, and so rod numerals were used only for doing calculations with counting rods.  Once written zero came into play, the rod numerals had become independent, and their use indeed outlives the counting rods, after its replacement by [[abacus]]. One variation of horizontal rod numerals, the [[Suzhou numerals]] is still in use for book-keeping and in herbal medicine prescription in [[Chinatown]]s in some parts of the world.

==Unicode==

{{Main|Counting Rod Numerals}}

[[Unicode]] 5.0 includes counting rod numerals in their own block in the [[Plane (Unicode)#Supplementary Multilingual Plane|Supplementary Multilingual Plane]] (SMP) from U+1D360 to U+1D37F. The [[code point]]s for the horizontal digits 1–9 are U+1D360 to U+1D368 and those for the vertical digits 1–9 are U+1D369 to U+1D371. The former are called ''unit digits'' and the latter are called ''tens digits'',&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Cullen et John H. Jenkins, [https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2004/04227-count-rod.pdf ''Proposal to add Chinese counting rod numerals to Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646''], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is opposite of the convention described above.  Zero should be represented by U+3007 (〇, ideographic number zero) and the negative sign should be represented by U+20E5 (combining reverse solidus overlay).&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2906">In [[mathematics]], two objects, especially systems of axioms or semantics for them, are called '''cryptomorphic''' if they are equivalent but not obviously equivalent.  This word is a play on the many [[morphism]]s in mathematics, but "cryptomorphism" is only very distantly related to "[[isomorphism]]", "[[homomorphism]]", or "morphisms". The equivalence may possibly be in some informal sense, or may be formalized in terms of a [[bijection]] or [[equivalence of categories]] between the mathematical objects defined by the two cryptomorphic axiom systems.

The word was coined by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] before 1967, for use in the third edition of his book ''Lattice Theory''.  Birkhoff did not give it a formal definition, though others working in the field have made some attempts since.

==Use in matroid theory==

Its informal sense was popularized (and greatly expanded in scope) by [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] in the context of [[matroid]] theory: there are dozens of equivalent axiomatic approaches to matroids, but two different systems of axioms often look very different.  

In his 1997 book ''Indiscrete Thoughts'', Rota describes the situation as follows:

{{cquote|Like many another great idea, matroid theory was invented by one of the great American pioneers, [[Hassler Whitney]].  His paper, which is still today the best entry to the subject, flagrantly reveals the unique peculiarity of this field, namely, the exceptional variety of cryptomorphic definitions for a matroid, embarrassingly unrelated to each other and exhibiting wholly different mathematical pedigrees.  It is as if one were to condense all trends of present day mathematics onto a single finite structure, a feat that anyone would ''a priori'' deem impossible, were it not for the fact that matroids do exist.}}

Though there are many cryptomorphic concepts in mathematics outside of matroid theory and [[universal algebra]], the word has not caught on among mathematicians generally.  It is, however, in fairly wide use among researchers in matroid theory.

'''Electoral Calculus''' is a [[political forecasting]] [[web site]] which attempts to predict future [[United Kingdom general election]] results. It considers national factors but excludes local issues.

== History ==
The site was developed by Martin Baxter,&lt;ref name="intute"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=20100408-11403823 | title=Electoral Calculus | publisher=[[Intute]]  |accessdate=17 October 2011 |quote=An independent UK election prediction site maintained by Martin Baxter. He attempts to apply scientific techniques to the electoral geography of Britain to predict the future general election results.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is a financial analyst specialising in [[mathematical modelling]].&lt;ref name="open ruppert 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruppert|first=Evelyn|title=Data mobilisation and the UK 2010 Election|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/cresc/?p=17|work=CReSC: The Social Life of Methods|publisher=[[Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change]]|date=16 April 2010|accessdate=28 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910073110/http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/cresc/?p=17|archive-date=10 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main features ==

The site includes maps, predictions and analysis articles. It has a separate section for [[elections in Scotland]].&lt;ref name="keele"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/por/scotland.htm | title=Scottish Government and Politics on the Internet | publisher=[[Keele University]] | work=School of Politics, International Relations and Philosophy website | accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

The site is based around the employment of scientific techniques on data about Britain's electoral geography,&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; which can be used to calculate the [[uniform national swing]].&lt;ref name="telegraph young 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Toby|title=Who predicted the result correctly?|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100038566/who-predicted-the-result-correctly/|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It takes account of national polls and trends but excludes local issues.&lt;ref name="thisiskent 2012"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/MP-s-course-lose-seat/story-15932772-detail/story.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505065719/http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/MP-s-course-lose-seat/story-15932772-detail/story.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=5 May 2013 | title=MP's on course to lose his seat | work=thisiskent.co.uk | publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]] | date=27 April 2012 | accessdate=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The calculations were initially based on what is termed the ''Transition Model'', which is derived from the additive [[uniform national swing]] model. This uses national swings in a proportional manner to predict local effects.&lt;ref name="electoralcalculus newmodel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/newmodel.html | title=Transition Model |publisher=Electoral Calculus |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |last=Baxter |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Strong Transition Model'' was introduced in October 2007, and considers the effects of strong and weak supporters.&lt;ref name="electoralcalculus strongmodel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/strongmodel.html | title=Strong Transition Model |publisher=Electoral Calculus |date=28 October 2007 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |last=Baxter |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The models are explained in detail on the web site.&lt;ref name="electoralcalculus newmodel" /&gt;

== Reception ==

It was listed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2004 as one of the "100 most useful websites", being "the best" for predictions.&lt;ref name="guardian 2004"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cream of the crop|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/dec/16/onlinesupplement.shopping|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was described by PhD student Chris Prosser at the [[University of Oxford]] as "probably the leading vote/seat predictor on the internet".&lt;ref name="politicsinspires prosser 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prosser|first=Chris|title=Predicting the next UK general election|url=http://politicsinspires.org/2012/05/predicting-the-next-uk-general-election/|work=Politics in Spires|date=7 May 2012|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its detailed predictions for individual seats have been noted by Paul Evans on the localdemocracy.org.uk [[blog]].&lt;ref name="localdemocracy evans 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Paul |title=Election websites to watch |url=http://blog.localdemocracy.org.uk/2010/03/30/election-websites-to-watch/ |work=localdemocracy.org.uk |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921111914/http://blog.localdemocracy.org.uk/2010/03/30/election-websites-to-watch/ |archivedate=21 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic [[Nick Anstead]] noted in his observations from a 2010 ''Personal Democracy Forum'' event, that [[Mick Fealty]] of [[Slugger O'Toole]] considered Electoral Calculus to be "massively improved" in comparison with the [[swingometer]].&lt;ref name="nickanstead.com 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anstead|first=Nick|authorlink=Nick Anstead|title=General Election 2010 – Action Replay (Personal Democracy Forum Event at the Royal Society for the Arts)|url=http://www.nickanstead.com/blog/?p=1886|work=nickanstead.com|date=15 May 2010|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With reference to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]], it was cited by journalists [[Andrew Rawnsley]]&lt;ref name="guardian doubly hung "&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/22/andrew-rawnsley-general-election-hung-parliament | title=Why it's very likely the next parliament will be doubly hung |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |last=Rawnsley |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Rawnsley | location=London | quote=The different formulas used by Electoral Calculus and Swingo both translate a six-point Tory poll lead into a Commons in which the Conservatives are short of a majority.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]]&lt;ref name="guardian too late for labour"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/apr/30/tony-blair-labour-cleggmania-michael-white | title=Tony Blair's back.

The '''Anna and Lajos Erdős Prize in Mathematics''' is a prize given by the [[Israel Mathematical Union]] to an [[Israel]]i [[mathematician]] (in any field of [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]]), "with preference to candidates up to the age of 40."  The prize was established by [[Paul Erdős]] in 1977 in honor of his parents, and is awarded annually or biannually.  The name was changed from "Erdős Prize" in 1996, after Erdős's death, to reflect his original wishes.

In [[mathematics]], and in particular, [[algebra]], a '''generalized inverse''' of an element ''x'' is an element ''y'' that has some properties of an [[inverse element]] but not necessarily all of them.  Generalized inverses can be defined in any [[mathematical structure]] that involves [[Associative property|associative]] multiplication, that is, in a [[semigroup]].  This article describes generalized inverses of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

Formally, given a matrix &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}&lt;/math&gt; and a matrix &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if it satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt; AA^\mathrm{g}A = A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|pp=2,7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nakamura|1991|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|pp=vii,20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of constructing a generalized inverse of a matrix is to obtain a matrix that can serve as an inverse in some sense for a wider class of matrices than invertible matrices.  A generalized inverse exists for an arbitrary matrix, and when a matrix has a [[#Motivation|regular inverse]], this inverse is its unique generalized inverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|pp=2,7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation == &lt;!-- [[Regular inverse]] links here.  Please do not change. --&gt;
Consider the [[System of linear equations|linear system]]

:&lt;math&gt;Ax = y&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; matrix and &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal R(A)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[column space]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[nonsingular]] (which implies &lt;math&gt;n = m&lt;/math&gt;) then &lt;math&gt;x = A^{-1}y&lt;/math&gt; will be the solution of the system.  Note that, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular, then

:&lt;math&gt;AA^{-1}A = A.&lt;/math&gt;

Now suppose &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is rectangular (&lt;math&gt;n \neq m&lt;/math&gt;), or square and singular. Then we need a right candidate &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal R(A)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;AGy = y.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;Gy&lt;/math&gt; is a solution of the linear system &lt;math&gt;Ax = y&lt;/math&gt;. 
Equivalently, we need a matrix &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;AGA = A.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence we can define the '''generalized inverse''' or '''g-inverse''' as follows:  Given an &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, an &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;AGA = A.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|pp=2,7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nakamura|1991|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|pp=vii,20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix &lt;math&gt;A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; has been termed a '''regular inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; by some authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The Penrose conditions define different generalized inverses for &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}:&lt;/math&gt;

# &lt;math&gt; A A^\mathrm{g} A = A &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; A^\mathrm{g} A A^\mathrm{g} = A^\mathrm{g} &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \left(A A^\mathrm{g}\right)^* = A A^\mathrm{g} &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \left(A^\mathrm{g} A\right)^* = A^\mathrm{g} A, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{}^*&lt;/math&gt; indicates conjugate transpose.  If &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the first condition, then it is a '''generalized inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. If it satisfies the first two conditions, then it is a '''reflexive generalized inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. If it satisfies all four conditions, then it is the '''pseudoinverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Campbell|Meyer|1991|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nakamura|1991|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|pp=20,28,51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A pseudoinverse is sometimes called the '''[[Moore–Penrose inverse]]''', after the pioneering works by [[E. H. Moore]] and [[Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Campbell|Meyer|1991|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|James|1978|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nakamura|1991|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

When &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is non-singular, any generalized inverse &lt;math&gt; A^\mathrm{g} = A^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; and is unique, but in all other cases, there are an infinite number of matrices that satisfy condition (1).  However, the Moore–Penrose inverse is unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|James|1978|pp=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other kinds of generalized inverse:
* [[One-sided inverse]] (right inverse or left inverse)
** Right inverse:  If the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \textrm{rank} (A) = n&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists an &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{R}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; called the '''right inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; A A_\mathrm{R}^{-1} = I_n &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; [[identity matrix]].
** Left inverse:  If the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{rank}(A) = m&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists an &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{L}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; called the '''left inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{L}^{-1} A = I_m &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_m&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;m \times m&lt;/math&gt; identity matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

               0 &amp;            0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\det(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is singular and has no regular inverse.  However, &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; satisfy conditions (1) and (2), but not (3) or (4).  Hence, &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; is a reflexive generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.

=== One-sided inverse ===
Let

: &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
    4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6
  \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
  A_\mathrm{R}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{17}{18} &amp;  \frac{8}{18} \\[4pt]
    -\frac{2}{18}  &amp;  \frac{2}{18} \\[4pt]
     \frac{13}{18} &amp; -\frac{4}{18}
  \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is not square, &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; has no regular inverse.  However, &lt;math&gt; A_\mathrm{R}^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; is a right inverse of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.  The matrix &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; has no left inverse.

== Construction ==
The following characterizations are easy to verify:
{{ordered list
| A right inverse of a [[square matrix|non-square matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{R}^{-1} = A^\mathsf{T} \left(A A^\mathsf{T}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, provided ''A'' has full row rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| A left inverse of a non-square matrix &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{L}^{-1} = \left(A^\mathsf{T}A\right)^{-1} A^\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt;, provided ''A'' has full column rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| If &lt;math&gt;A = BC&lt;/math&gt; is a [[rank factorization]],  then &lt;math&gt;G = C_\mathrm{R}^{-1} B_\mathrm{L}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a g-inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{R}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a right inverse of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_\mathrm{L}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is left inverse of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
| If &lt;math&gt;A = P\begin{bmatrix}I_r &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} Q&lt;/math&gt; for any non-singular matrices &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G = Q^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}I_r &amp; U \\ W &amp; V\end{bmatrix} P^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized inverse  of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;U, V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.
|  Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be of rank &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, let
: &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}B &amp; C\\ D &amp; E\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_{r \times r}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-singular submatrix of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Then,
: &lt;math&gt;G = \begin{bmatrix} B^{-1} &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
| Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have [[singular-value decomposition]] &lt;math&gt;U \boldsymbol{\Sigma} V^*&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;V^*&lt;/math&gt; is the conjugate transpose of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;). Then the pseudoinverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is
: &lt;math&gt;A^+ = V \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^+ U^*&lt;/math&gt;

where the diagonal matrix {{math|'''Σ'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the pseudoinverse of {{math|'''Σ'''}}, which is formed by replacing every non-zero diagonal entry by its [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] and transposing the resulting matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985|pp=421}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Uses ==

Any generalized inverse can be used to determine whether a [[system of linear equations]] has any solutions, and if so to give all of them. If any solutions exist for the ''n'' × ''m'' linear system

:&lt;math&gt;Ax = b&lt;/math&gt;,

with vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of unknowns and vector &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; of constants, all solutions are given by 

:&lt;math&gt;x = A^\mathrm{g}b + \left[I - A^\mathrm{g}A\right]w&lt;/math&gt;,

parametric on the arbitrary vector &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt; is any generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Solutions exist if and only if &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g}b&lt;/math&gt; is a solution, that is, if and only if &lt;math&gt;AA^\mathrm{g}b = b&lt;/math&gt;. If ''A'' has full column rank, the bracketed expression in this equation is the zero matrix and so the solution is unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|James|1978|pp=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transformation consistency properties ==

In practical applications it is necessary to identify the class of matrix transformations that must be preserved by a generalized inverse. For example, the Moore-Penrose inverse, &lt;math&gt; A^\mathrm{P}&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to transformations involving unitary matrices ''U'' and ''V'':

:&lt;math&gt;(UAV)^\mathrm{P} = V A^\mathrm{P} U^*&lt;/math&gt;.

The Drazin inverse, &lt;math&gt; A^\mathrm{D}&lt;/math&gt;  satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to similarity transformations involving a nonsingular matrix ''S'':

:&lt;math&gt;\left(SAS^{-1}\right)^\mathrm{P} = S A^\mathrm{D} S^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Unit-Consistent (UC) inverse,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Uhlmann|first= J.K.|title=A Generalized Matrix Inverse that is Consistent with Respect to Diagonal Transformations|series=SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis|year=2018|volume=239:2|pages=781–800}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{U}&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to transformations involving nonsingular diagonal matrices ''D'' and ''E'':

:&lt;math&gt;(DAE)^\mathrm{U} = E^{-1} A^\mathrm{U} D^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The fact that the Moore-Penrose inverse provides consistency with respect to rotations (which are orthonormal transformations) explains its widespread use in physics and other applications in which Euclidean distances must be preserved. The UC inverse, by contrast, is applicable when system behavior is expected to be invariant with respect to the choice of units on different state variables, e.g., miles versus kilometers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33463">'''Graduate Texts in Mathematics''' ('''GTM''') (ISSN 0072-5285) is a series of [[graduate school|graduate-level]] [[textbooks]] in [[mathematics]] published by [[Springer-Verlag]].  The books in this series, like the other Springer-Verlag mathematics series, are yellow books of a standard size (with variable numbers of pages).  The GTM series is easily identified by a white band at the top of the book.

The books in this series tend to be written at a more advanced level than the similar [[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]] series, although there is a fair amount of overlap between the two series in terms of material covered and difficulty level.

'''Historical dynamics''' broadly includes the scientific modeling of history.  This might also be termed computer modeling of history, historical simulation, or simulation of history - allowing for an extensive range of techniques in simulation and estimation.  Historical dynamics does not exist as a separate science, but there are individual efforts such as [[long range planning]], [[population modeling]], [[economic forecasting]], [[demographics]], [[global modeling]], [[country modeling]], [[regional planning]], [[urban planning]] and many others in the general categories of [[computer modeling]], [[planning]], [[forecasting]], and [[simulations]].

Some examples of "large" history where historical dynamics simulations would be helpful include; [[global history]], large structures, [[:category:histories of empires|histories of empires]], long duration history, [[philosophy of history]], [[Eurasian history]], [[comparative history]], long-range [[environmental history]], [[world systems theory]], non-Western political and economic development, and [[historical demography]].
 
==Information sources for simulations==
With the rise of technologies like wikis, and internet-wide search engines, some historical and social data can be mined to constrain models of history and society.  Data from social media sites, and busy sites, can be mined for human patterns of action.  These can provide more and more realistic behavioral models for individuals and groups of any size.  [[Agent-based model]]s and [[microsimulation]]s of [[human behavior]] can be embedded in larger historical simulations.  Related subfields are [[behavioral economics]] and [[human behavioral ecology]].

* [[Crowd computing]] has been applied to [[crowd computing#History|history]], and offers another tool for historical verification and validation.

==Sectoral databases==
In every sector of human activity, there are extensive databases for [[North american transportation statistics interchange|transportation data]], [[urban development]], [[health statistics]], [[education data]], [[social data]], [[economic data]]—along with many projections.  See [[:Category:economic databases]], [[:Category:statistical data sets]], [[:Category:social statistics data]], [[:Category:social statistics]] and [[:Category:statistics]].

Some examples of database activity include [[Asian Development Bank]] statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/data/statistics |title=Asian Development Bank - Statistics |publisher=Adb.org |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Bank]] data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/ |title=World Bank - Data |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Monetary Fund]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/data.htm |title=International Monetary Fund - Data |publisher=Imf.org |date=2014-06-27 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time series analysis]] and [[econometrics]] are well established fields for the analysis of trends and [[forecasting]]; but, survey data and microdatasets can also be used in forecasts and simulations.
&lt;!-- This section can be expanded considerably. Many relevant datasets --&gt;

==Global, country, and sectoral models in international development==

The United Nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/ |title=United Nations Population Division, Economic and Social Affairs |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organizations routinely project the population of individual countries and regions of the world decades into the future.  These demographic models are used by other organizations for projecting demand for services in all sectors of each economy.

* [[International Monetary Fund]] - Finance, Government Accounts
* [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]
* [[World Health Organization]] - Health
* [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] - Food and Agriculture
* [[International Labour Organization]] - Labour
* [[World Trade Organization]] - Trade
* [[World Bank]] - extensive modeling and data activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic#2 |title=World Bank topics by global practices |publisher=Worldbank.org |date=2014-06-30 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/0,,menuPK:476823~pagePK:64165236~piPK:64165141~theSitePK:469372,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country often has their corresponding modeling groups for each of these major sectors.  These can be grouped in separate articles according to sector.  Groups include government departments, [[List of development aid agencies|international aid agencies]], as well as nonprofit and [[non-governmental organization]]s.

A broad class of models used for economic and social modeling of countries and sectors are the [[Computable general equilibrium]] (CGE) model - also called [[applied general equilibrium]] models.  In the context of time based simulations and policy analysis, see [[dynamic stochastic general equilibrium]] models.

==Linked economic, social, and climate models==
Partly because of the controversy over [[global climate change]], there is an extensive network of global climate models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WMO Webteam |url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/climate_models.php |title=World Meteorological Organization models |publisher=Wmo.int |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/projects/gcm/ |title=NASA global climate models |publisher=Giss.nasa.gov |date=2014-07-17 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related social and economic models.  These seek to estimate, not only the change in climate and its physical effects, but also the impact on human society and the natural environment.  See [[global economic models]], [[social model]], [[microsimulation]], [[climate model]], [[global climate models]], and [[general circulation model]].

The relationship between the environment and society is examined through [[environmental social science]].  [[human ecology]], [[political ecology]], and [[ecology]], in general, can be areas where computer and mathematical modeling over time can be relevant to historical simulation.

==Historical simulations==
Web-based historical simulations, [[simulations of history]], interactive historical simulations, are increasingly popular for entertainment and educational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialstudiescentral.com/?q=content/online-interactive-simulations |title=Social Studies Central, Interactive History Simulations |publisher=Socialstudiescentral.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field is expanding rapidly and no central index seems to be available.  Another example is &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wadsworth.cengage.com/history_d/special_features/ext/hist_sims/ |title=History Simulations |publisher=Wadsworth.cengage.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several computer games allow players to interact with the game to model societies over time. The [[Civilization (series)]] is one example.  Others include [[Age of Empires]], [[Rise of Nations]], [[Spore]], [[Colonization]], [[Alpha Centauri]], [[Call to Power]], and [[CivCity: Rome]].  A longer list of games in historical context, which might include degrees of simulation, are found at [[:Category:Video games with historical settings]].

[[Military simulation]] is a well-developed field and increasingly accessible on the internet.

==Simulating society==
Computer models for simulating society fall under [[artificial society]], [[social simulation]], [[computational sociology]], [[computational social science]], and [[mathematical sociology]].  There is an interdisciplinary [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]] for computer simulation of social processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/ |title=Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation |publisher=Jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[European Social Simulation Association]] promotes social simulation research in Europe; it is the publisher of JASSS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essa.eu.org/ European Social Simulation Association]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a corresponding [[Computational Social Science Society of the Americas]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://computationalsocialscience.org/ |title=Computational Social Science Society of the Americas |publisher=Computationalsocialscience.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Pan-Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paaa.asia/ |title=Pan-Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences |publisher=Paaa.asia |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PAAA lists some related Japanese associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paaa.asia/related-associations/ |title=Related social simulation associations |publisher=Paaa.asia |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SimSoc ([[Simulated Society]] tool) is in its fifth edition.

==Cities==
There has been extensive research in [[urban planning]], [[environmental planning]] and related fields: [[regional planning]], [[land-use planning]], [[transportation planning]], [[urban studies]], and [[regional science]].  Journals for these fields are listed at [[List of planning journals]].

[[SimCity]] is a game for simulations of artificial cities.  It has spawned a range of "sim" games.  The planning groups try to simulate changes in real cities.  The game groups allow experiments with artificial cities.  And the two are merging in such efforts as Vizicities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geospatial.blogs.com/geospatial/2013/09/simcity-with-real-data-modeling-real-cities-in-3d-in-a-web-environment.html |title=SimCity with real data: modeling real cities in 3D in a Web environment |publisher=Geospatial.blogs.com |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==
The profiling of industries is well developed, and most industries make forecasts and plans.  See [[industrial history]], [[history of steel]], [[history of mining]], [[history of construction]], [[history of the petroleum industry]], and many other histories of specific industries.  See [[cyclical industrial dynamics]] for modeling of industries in the sense of "historical dynamics of industries".  Some related terms are [[industrial planning]], [[history of industry]], [[industrial evolution]], [[technology change]], and [[technology forecasting]]. An example of "history friendly" industrial models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=F Malerba a |author2=R Nelson b |author3=L Orsenigo |author4=S Winter d |url=http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/1/3.abstract |title='History-friendly' models of industry evolution: the computer industry |publisher=Icc.oxfordjournals.org |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the journal, Industrial and Corporate Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/ |title=Journal: Industrial and Corporate Change |publisher=Icc.oxfordjournals.org |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economy-wide models must take into account the interactions between industry and the rest of the economy.  See [[Input–output model]], [[economic planning]], and [[social accounting matrix]] for some relevant techniques.

==Futures==
Many of the techniques from [[futures studies]] are applicable to historical dynamics.  Whether projecting forward from a point in the past to the present for validation studies, or projecting backwards from the present into the past - many of the techniques are useful.  Likewise, simulations of the past, or alternative pasts, provide a groundwork of techniques for futures studies.

'''''Introduction to Commutative Algebra''''' is a well-known [[commutative algebra]] textbook written by [[Michael Atiyah]] and [[Ian G. Macdonald]]. It deals with elementary concepts of commutative algebra including [[localization of a ring|localization]], [[primary decomposition]], [[integrality|integral dependence]], [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] and [[Artinian ring|Artinian]] [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[Dedekind ring]]s, [[completion (ring theory)|completions]] and a moderate amount of [[Krull dimension|dimension theory]]. It is notable for being among the shorter English-language introductory [[textbook]]s in the subject, relegating a good deal of material to the [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]]s.

The '''Inverse Symbolic Calculator''' is an online [[number checker]] established July 18, 1995 by [[Peter Benjamin Borwein]], [[Jonathan Michael Borwein]] and [[Simon Plouffe]] of the Canadian Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics (Burnaby, Canada). A user will input a number and the Calculator will use an algorithm to search for and calculate [[closed-form expression]]s or suitable functions that have roots near this number. Hence, the calculator is of great importance for those working in numerical areas of [[experimental mathematics]].

The ISC contains 54 million mathematical constants. [[Plouffe's Inverter]] (opened in 1998) contains 214 million. A newer version of the tables with 3.702 billion entries (as of June 19, 2010) exists.

In 2016, Plouffe released a portable version of Plouffe's Inverter containing 3 billion entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plouffe.fr/Simon%20Plouffe.htm |title=''Page maison de Simon Plouffe'' |publisher=plouffe.fr |accessdate=29 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2721">The '''Krieger–Nelson Prize''' is presented by the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]] in recognition of an outstanding woman in mathematics. It was first
awarded in 1995. The award is named after [[Cecilia Krieger]] and [[Evelyn Nelson (mathematician)|Evelyn Nelson]], both known for their contributions to [[mathematics]] in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="cmsAward"&gt;[http://www.cms.math.ca/Prizes/info/kn.html Krieger–Nelson Prize], [[Canadian Mathematical Society]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipients==
While the award has largely been awarded to a female mathematician working at a [[List of universities in Canada|Canadian University]], it has also been awarded to [[Canada|Canadian]]-born or -educated women working outside of the country. For example, [[Cathleen Synge Morawetz|Cathleen Morawetz]], past president of the [[American Mathematical Society]], and a faculty member at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] (a division of [[New York University]]) was awarded the Krieger–Nelson Prize in 1997. (Morawetz was educated at the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]). According to the call for applications, the award winner should be a "member of the Canadian mathematical community".&lt;ref name="cmsCall"&gt;[http://www.math.ca/Prizes/kn-nom.html Call for Applications Krieger–Nelson Prize Lectureship], [[Canadian Mathematical Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The recipient of the Krieger–Nelson Prize delivers a lecture to the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]], typically during its summer meeting.&lt;ref name="cmsCall" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2622">In [[mathematics]], a "helping theorem" or '''lemma''' (plural '''lemmas''' or '''lemmata''') is a proven [[Theorem#Terminology|proposition]] which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result rather than as a statement of interest by itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Higham |first= Nicholas J. |title= Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences |publisher= [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-89871-420-6 |pages= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:en:λῆμμα#Ancient Greek|λῆμμα]] ("anything which is received, such as a gift, profit, or a bribe"). 

==Comparison with theorem==
There is no formal distinction between a lemma and a [[theorem]], only one of intention&amp;nbsp;– see [[Theorem#Terminology|Theorem terminology]].  However, a lemma can be considered a minor result whose sole purpose is to help prove a theorem &amp;nbsp;– a step in the direction of proof&lt;ref&gt;[http://divisbyzero.com/2008/09/22/what-is-the-difference-between-a-theorem-a-lemma-and-a-corollary/ "What is the difference between a theorem, a lemma, and a corollary?"]&lt;/ref&gt; – or a short theorem appearing at an intermediate stage in a proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1176|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Well-known lemmas==
A good stepping stone can lead to many others. Some powerful results in mathematics are known as lemmas, such as [[Bézout's identity|Bézout's lemma]], [[Dehn's lemma]], [[Euclid's lemma]], [[Farkas' lemma]], [[Fatou's lemma]], [[Gauss's lemma (disambiguation)|Gauss's lemma]], [[Small_cancellation_theory#Greendlinger.27s_lemma|Greendlinger's lemma]], [[Itō's lemma]], [[Jordan's lemma]], [[Nakayama's lemma]], [[Closed_and_exact_differential_forms#Poincar.C3.A9_lemma|Poincaré's lemma]], [[Riesz's lemma]], [[Schur's lemma]], [[Schwarz's lemma]], [[Urysohn's lemma]], [[Vitali covering lemma]], [[Yoneda lemma|Yoneda's lemma]] and [[Zorn's lemma]]. While these results originally seemed too simple or too technical to warrant independent interest, they have turned out to be central to the theories in which they occur.

In [[geometry]], a '''polygon''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|ɪ|ɡ|ɒ|n}} is traditionally a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] [[Shape|figure]] that is bounded by a finite chain of straight [[line segment]]s closing in a loop to form a [[Polygonal chain|closed chain]]. These segments are called its ''edges'' or ''sides'', and the points where two edges meet are the polygon's ''[[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]]'' (singular: vertex) or ''corners''.

The word [[polygon]] comes from [[Late Latin]] ''polygōnum'' (a noun), from [[Greek language|Greek]] πολύγωνον (''polygōnon/polugōnon''), noun use of neuter of πολύγωνος (''polygōnos/polugōnos'', the masculine adjective), meaning "many-angled". Individual polygons are named (and sometimes classified) according to the number of sides, combining a [[Greek language|Greek]]-derived [[numerical prefix]] with the suffix ''-gon'', e.g. ''[[pentagon]]'', ''[[dodecagon]]''. The [[triangle]], [[quadrilateral]] and [[nonagon]] are exceptions, although the regular forms ''trigon'', ''tetragon'', and ''enneagon'' are sometimes encountered as well.

== Greek numbers==
Polygons are primarily named by prefixes from Greek numbers.

'''''Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth''''' is a [[graphic novel]] about the [[Foundational crisis of mathematics|foundational quest in mathematics]], written by [[Apostolos Doxiadis]], author of ''[[Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture]]'', and theoretical computer scientist [[Christos Papadimitriou]] of the University of California, Berkeley. Character design and artwork are by [[Alecos Papadatos]] and color is by Annie Di Donna.  The book was originally written in English, and was translated into Greek by author Apostolos Doxiadis for the release in Greece, which preceded the UK and U.S. releases.

==Plot==
Set between the late 19th century and the present day, the graphic novel ''Logicomix'' is based on the story of the so-called "foundational quest" in mathematics.

''Logicomix'' intertwines the philosophical struggles with the characters' own personal turmoil.  These are in turn played out just upstage of the momentous historical events of the era and the ideological battles which gave rise to them. The narrator of the story is [[Bertrand Russell]], who stands as an icon of many of these themes: a deeply sensitive and introspective man, Russell was not just a philosopher and pacifist, he was also one of the prominent figures in the foundational quest.  Russell's life story, depicted by ''Logicomix'', is itself a journey through the goals and struggles, and triumph and tragedy shared by many great thinkers of the 20th century: [[Georg Cantor]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Kurt Gödel]], and [[Alan Turing]].

A parallel tale, set in present-day [[Athens]], records the creators’ disagreement on the meaning of the story, thus setting in relief the foundational quest as a quintessentially modern adventure.  It is on the one hand a tragedy of the hubris of rationalism, which descends inextricably on madness, and on the other an origin myth of the computer.

==Reception==
Jim Holt reviewed the book for the ''[[New York Times]]'' and says the story "is presented with real graphic verve. (Even though I’m a text guy, I couldn’t keep my eyes off the witty drawings.)" although he does note "one serious misstep" involving the overplaying of the impact [[Russell's paradox]] had on mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/books/review/Holt-t.html?_r=1 Algorithm and Blues], ''[[New York Times]]'', September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A review at ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that the "authors tell the story with a humour and lightness of touch that pokes fun at the philosophers and mathematicians involved, but never trivialises the philosophy or the mathematics" concluding that "Doxiadis has shown that by using fiction to provide an emotional context to mathematical discoveries it can make for a gripping read. Uncle Petros was a bestseller and the much more ambitious Logicomix deserves to be one too."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/03/logicomix-alex-bellos-review Logicomix by Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos H Papadimitriou], ''[[The Guardian]]'', October 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was recommended by the ''[[New Statesman]]'' in late September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/theatre/2009/10/search-doxiadis-papadimitriou The NS Recommends]., ''[[New Statesman]]'', 28 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2 the book made the New York Times, Sunday Book Review, Editor's Choice list&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/books/review/EdChoice-t.html Editor's Choice], ''New York Times'', October 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the next week it was #1 on the NYT Graphic Novel Best Seller list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/graphic-books-best-seller-list-10/ Graphic Books Best Seller List], ''New York Times'', October 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The book sold out on the day it was released in the United States and United Kingdom, and also got into the Top 10 on [[Amazon.com]] and [[Amazon.co.uk]], leading the manager of a major [[Athens]] bookstore to say "No Greek book has sold abroad like this in 30 years."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gOUgVjW1LstTkSlC6i0H2J1cDwxw Bertrand Russell 'maths comic' hits bestseller lists], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], October 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==

According to [[Paolo Mancosu]], the authors "admittedly take liberties with the real course of events", for example with reference to the alleged meetings Russell would have had with Frege and Cantor. Although "such departures from reality can be fruitful for narrative purposes", according to Mancosu, in some cases they are objectionable, as the portrayal of Frege as a "rabid paranoid antisemite", and the "constant refrain of the alleged causal link between logic and madness". From "the conceptual point of view, some of the major ideas about the foundation of mathematics are conveyed with reasonable accuracy", although sometimes errors, mistakes and inaccuracies occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mancosu|first=Paolo|title=Review|journal=The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic|date=September 2010|volume=16|issue=3|pages=39–40|url=http://www.math.ucla.edu/~asl/bsl/1603/1603-005.ps|accessdate=7 August 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the global judgement by Mancosu is positive:
{{quote|I enjoyed reading Logicomix immensely. The authors have tackled an extremely complicated subject with thought provoking ideas in an aesthetically pleasing and entertaining fashion. Thus, my few critical remarks should not mislead you.  I highly recommend Logicomix even though my recommendation is qualified: the reader should provide his/her grain of salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mancosu|first=Paolo|title=Book Review: Logicomix by Apostolos Doxiadis, Christos H.

Mathematicians seek and use [[patterns]]&lt;ref name=future/&gt;&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt; to formulate new [[conjecture]]s; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by [[mathematical proof]]. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] and [[logic]], mathematics developed from [[counting]], [[calculation]], [[measurement]], and the systematic study of the [[shape]]s and [[motion (physics)|motions]] of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as [[History of Mathematics|written records]] exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

[[Logic|Rigorous arguments]] first appeared in [[Greek mathematics]], most notably in [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. Since the pioneering work of [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1858–1932), [[David Hilbert]] (1862–1943), and others [[Foundations of mathematics|on axiomatic systems in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century]], it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing [[truth]] by [[Mathematical rigor|rigorous]] [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from appropriately chosen [[axiom]]s and [[definition]]s. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the [[Renaissance]], when mathematical innovations interacting with new [[timeline of scientific discoveries|scientific discoveries]] led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics is essential in many fields, including [[natural science]], engineering, medicine, finance and the [[social sciences]]. [[Applied mathematics]] has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and [[game theory]]. Mathematicians engage in [[pure mathematics]], or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind. Practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wigner1960 /&gt;

[[File:Bakhshali numerals 2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The numerals used in the [[Bakhshali manuscript]], dated between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE.]]
The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstractions]]. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abstract representations of numbers in the animal and human brain |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=21 |issue=8 |date=Aug 1998 |pages=355–61 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(98)01263-6 |pmid=9720604 |ref=harv |last1=Dehaene |first1=Stanislas |last2=Dehaene-Lambertz |first2=Ghislaine |last3=Cohen |first3=Laurent}}&lt;/ref&gt; was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.

As evidenced by [[tally sticks|tallies]] found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to [[counting|count]] physical objects, [[prehistoric]] peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time&amp;nbsp;– days, seasons, years.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Raymond L. Wilder, ''Evolution of Mathematical Concepts; an Elementary Study'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000&amp;nbsp;[[Before Christ|BC]], when the [[Babylonia]]ns and Egyptians began using [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1990, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient mathematical texts from [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] are from 2000–1800 BC. Many early texts mention [[Pythagorean triple]]s and so, by inference, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in [[Babylonian mathematics]] that [[elementary arithmetic]] ([[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]]) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system, and used a [[sexagesimal]] numeral system, still in use today for measuring angles and time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 24–27}}

Beginning in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], the [[Ancient Greeks]] began a systematic study of mathematics as a subject in its own right with [[Greek mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heath |first=Thomas Little |url=https://books.google.com/?id=drnY3Vjix3kC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=A History of Greek Mathematics: From Thales to Euclid |location=New York |publisher=Dover Publications |date=1981 |orig-year=originally published 1921 |isbn=978-0-486-24073-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 300 BC, [[Euclid]] introduced the [[axiomatic method]] still used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. His textbook ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 119}} The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be [[Archimedes]] (c. 287–212 BC) of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]].{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 120}} He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of [[solids of revolution]] and used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the [[Series (mathematics)|summation of an infinite series]], in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 130}} Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are [[conic sections]] ([[Apollonius of Perga]], 3rd century BC),{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 145}} [[trigonometry]] ([[Hipparchus of Nicaea]] (2nd century BC),{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc= "Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 162}} and the beginnings of algebra ([[Diophantus]], 3rd century AD).{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc= "Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 180}}

The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and were transmitted to the [[Western world]] via [[Islamic mathematics]]. Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition of [[sine]] and [[cosine]], and an early form of [[infinite series]].

[[File:Image-Al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A page from al-Khwārizmī's ''Algebra'']]
During the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]], especially during the 9th and 10th&amp;nbsp;centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of [[Islamic mathematics]] was the development of [[algebra]]. Other notable achievements of the Islamic period are advances in [[spherical trigonometry]] and the addition of the [[decimal point]] to the Arabic numeral system. Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarismi]], [[Omar Khayyam]] and [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]]. 

During the [[early modern period]], mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in [[Western Europe]]. The development of [[calculus]] by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics. [[Leonhard Euler]] was the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, contributing numerous theorems and discoveries. Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who made numerous contributions to fields such as [[algebra]], [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[differential geometry and topology|differential geometry]], [[matrix theory]],[[number theory]], and [[statistics]]. In the early 20th century, [[Kurt Gödel]] transformed mathematics by publishing his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]], which show that any axiomatic system that is consistent will contain unprovable propositions.

Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January&amp;nbsp;2006 issue of the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The number of papers and books included in the ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9&amp;nbsp;million, and more than 75&amp;nbsp;thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical [[theorem]]s and their [[mathematical proof|proofs]]."{{sfn|Sevryuk|2006|pp=101–09}}

===Etymology===
The word ''mathematics'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] μάθημα (''máthēma''), meaning "that which is learnt",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=mathematic |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307093926/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=March 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "what one gets to know", hence also "study" and "science". The word for "mathematics" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning "mathematical study" even in Classical times.&lt;ref&gt;Both senses can be found in Plato. {{LSJ|maqhmatiko/s|μαθηματική|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its adjective is {{lang|grc|μαθηματικός}} (''mathēmatikós''), meaning "related to learning" or "studious", which likewise further came to mean "mathematical". In particular, {{lang|grc|μαθηματικὴ τέχνη}} (''mathēmatikḗ tékhnē''), {{lang-la|ars mathematica}}, meant "the mathematical art".

Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in [[Pythagoreanism]] was known as the ''mathēmatikoi'' (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant "teachers" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense.

In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term ''mathematics'' more commonly meant "astrology" (or sometimes "astronomy") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations. For example, [[Saint Augustine]]'s warning that Christians should beware of ''mathematici'', meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lion Hunting and Other Mathematical Pursuits: A Collection of Mathematics, Verse, and Stories by the Late Ralph P. Boas, Jr | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Boas, Ralph | authorlink=Ralph P. Boas Jr. | year=1995 | orig-year=1991 | page=257 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-EWj5WtQHgC&amp;pg=PA257 | chapter=What Augustine Didn't Say About Mathematicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form {{lang|fr|les mathématiques}} (and the less commonly used singular derivative {{lang|fr|la mathématique}}), goes back to the Latin neuter plural {{lang|la|mathematica}} ([[Cicero]]), based on the Greek plural {{lang|el|τὰ μαθηματικά}} (''ta mathēmatiká''), used by [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC), and meaning roughly "all things mathematical"; although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective ''mathematic(al)'' and formed the noun ''mathematics'' anew, after the pattern of ''[[physics]]'' and ''[[metaphysics]]'', which were inherited from Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''sub'' "mathematics", "mathematic", "mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the noun ''mathematics'' takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to ''maths'' or, in North America, ''math''.&lt;ref name=maths&gt;[http://oed.com/view/Entry/114982 "maths, ''n.''"] and [http://oed.com/view/Entry/114962 "math, ''n.3''"].

Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, D.

Rowe), p. 14, Basel, Birkhäuser (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955) stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."&lt;ref name=certain/&gt;

Starting in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as [[group theory]] and [[projective geometry]], which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions.&lt;ref name="Cajori"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Mathematics |publisher=American Mathematical Society (1991 reprint) |author=Cajori, Florian |authorlink=Florian Cajori |year=1893 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGJRjIC9fZgC&amp;pg=PA285 285–86] |isbn=978-0-8218-2102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics, some emphasize its abstractness, some emphasize certain topics within mathematics.

Three leading types of definition of mathematics are called [[logicist]], [[intuitionist]], and [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]], each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought.&lt;ref name=Snapper&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2689412 |title=The Three Crises in Mathematics: Logicism, Intuitionism, and Formalism |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=September 1979 |first=Ernst |last=Snapper |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=207–16 |id= |jstor=2689412 |ref=harv|bibcode=1975MathM..48...12G }}&lt;/ref&gt; All have severe problems, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.&lt;ref name=Snapper/&gt;

An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was [[Benjamin Peirce]]'s "the science that draws necessary conclusions" (1870).&lt;ref name="Peirce"&gt;{{cite book |title=Linear Associative Algebra |author=Peirce, Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Peirce |year=1882 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=De0GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906135700/https://books.google.com/books?id=De0GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] advanced the philosophical program known as [[logicism]], and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of [[symbolic logic]]. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's "All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic" (1903).&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kj0a_aV2mxIC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=5|title=The Principles of Mathematics|year=1903|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intuitionist]] definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is "Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other."&lt;ref name=Snapper/&gt; A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct.

[[Formalism (mathematics)|Formalist]] definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. [[Haskell Curry]] defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Outlines of a Formalist Philosophy of Mathematics |publisher=Elsevier |author=Curry, Haskell |authorlink=Haskell Curry |year=1951 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZHrBQgp1bkC 56] |isbn=978-0-444-53368-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[formal system]] is a set of symbols, or ''tokens'', and some ''rules'' telling how the tokens may be combined into ''formulas''. In formal systems, the word ''axiom'' has a special meaning, different from the ordinary meaning of "a self-evident truth". In formal systems, an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.

===Mathematics as science===
[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], known as the prince of mathematicians]]
The German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".&lt;ref name="Waltershausen"/&gt; More recently, [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has called mathematics "the Queen of Science&amp;nbsp;... the main driving force behind scientific discovery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nicolas Bourbaki |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |access-date=26 October 2017 |series=A Brief History of Mathematics |first=Marcus |last=du Sautoy |station=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2010 |time=min. 12:50 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216050402/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |archivedate=December 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original Latin ''Regina Scientiarum'', as well as in German ''Königin der Wissenschaften'', the word corresponding to ''science'' means a "field of knowledge", and this was the original meaning of "science" in English, also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge. The specialization restricting the meaning of "science" to ''[[natural science]]'' follows the rise of [[Baconian method|Baconian science]], which contrasted "natural science" to [[scholasticism]], the [[Organon|Aristotelean method]] of inquiring from [[first principles]]. The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as [[biology]], [[chemistry]], or [[physics]]. [[Albert Einstein]] stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."&lt;ref name=certain&gt;Einstein, p. 28. The quote is Einstein's answer to the question: "How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" This question was inspired by [[Eugene Wigner]]'s paper "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally [[falsifiability|falsifiable]], and thus not a science according to the definition of [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists |author1=Shasha, Dennis Elliot |author2=Lazere, Cathy A. |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] convinced many mathematicians{{Who|date=January 2011}} that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that "most mathematical theories are, like those of [[physics]] and [[biology]], [[hypothesis|hypothetico]]-[[deductive]]: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently."&lt;ref&gt;Popper 1995, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Other thinkers, notably [[Imre Lakatos]], have applied a version of [[falsificationism]] to mathematics itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imre Lakatos]] (1976), ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hps.elte.hu/~kutrovatz/LakatosEng.pdf |title=Gábor Kutrovátz, "Imre Lakatos's Philosophy of Mathematics" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view is that certain scientific fields (such as [[theoretical physics]]) are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality. Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the [[deductive reasoning|exploration of the logical consequences]] of assumptions. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.

The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[Bertrand Russell]]'s statement "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ..." in his ''History of Western Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others{{Who|date=August 2009}} feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science). It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of ''Science and Mathematics'', indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, [[land measurement]], architecture and later [[astronomy]]; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus |journal=Physics Today |volume=54 |issue=8 |page=48 |author=Meinhard E. Mayer |year=2001 |bibcode=2001PhT....54h..48J |doi=10.1063/1.1404851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact, that even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]".&lt;ref name=wigner1960&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=Eugene |year=1960 |title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102 |ref=harv |bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152633/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091144/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].

For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner beauty. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G. H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-521-42706-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians often strive to find proofs that are particularly elegant, proofs from "The Book" of God according to [[Paul Erdős]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie|author1-link=Bonnie Gold |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proofs from ''The Book'' |last1=Aigner |first1=Martin |last2=Ziegler |first2=Günter&amp;nbsp;M. |authorlink2=Günter M. Ziegler |publisher=Springer |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-540-40460-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.

==Notation, language, and rigor==
{{main|Mathematical notation}}
[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leonhard Euler]], who created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today]]

Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |publisher= |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220073955/http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |archivedate=February 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, p. 140, on [[Diophantus]]; p. 261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language."&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live ''cow'' chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters ''c–o–w'' on the page. But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after – the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''."&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for "[[if and only if]]" belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".

[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "[[theorem]]s", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics&lt;!--This part needs improvement |&gt;&gt;--&gt;. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.&lt;ref&gt;Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 "A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly", (in reference to the Haken–Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic.&lt;ref&gt;"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil." [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|0-486-61630-4}}. p. 1, "Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields of mathematics==
{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}
[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|An [[abacus]], a simple calculating tool used since ancient times]]
Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]]. While some areas might seem unrelated, the [[Langlands program]] has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].

===Foundations and philosophy===
In order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. [[Category theory]], which deals in an abstract way with [[mathematical structure]]s and relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Howard Hodgkin &amp; Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer–Hilbert controversy]].

Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].

[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model&amp;nbsp;– the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5Qj76uCbF?url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].

===Pure mathematics===
====Quantity====
{{Main|Arithmetic}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are two unsolved problems in number theory.

As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s ("[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]"). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s, which are used to represent [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to [[complex number]]s. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of "[[infinity]]". According to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the [[cardinal number]]s. These include the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.

====Structure====
{{Main|Algebra}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
Many mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].

By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.

====Space====
{{Main|Geometry}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
The study of space originates with [[geometry]]&amp;nbsp;– in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]], which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Convex geometry|Convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] were developed to solve problems in [[geometry of numbers|number theory]] and [[functional analysis]] but now are pursued with an eye on applications in [[convex optimization|optimization]] and [[computational geometry|computer science]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincaré conjecture]], and the still unsolved areas of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. Other results in geometry and topology, including the [[four color theorem]] and [[Kepler conjecture]], have been proved only with the help of computers.

====Change====
{{Main|Calculus}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.

===Applied mathematics===
{{Main|Applied mathematics}}
[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the "formulation, study, and use of mathematical models" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.

In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].

====Statistics and other decision sciences====
{{Main|Statistics}}
Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that makes sense" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]];&lt;ref&gt;[[C.R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|981-02-3111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians "make sense of the data" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]]&amp;nbsp;– with [[model selection]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].{{efn|Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.}}

[[Statistical theory]] studies [[statistical decision theory|decision problems]] such as minimizing the [[risk]] ([[expected loss]]) of a statistical action, such as using a [[statistical method|procedure]] in, for example, [[parameter estimation]], [[hypothesis testing]], and [[selection algorithm|selecting the best]]. In these traditional areas of [[mathematical statistics]], a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an [[objective function]], like expected loss or [[cost]], under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.&lt;ref name="RaoOpt"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Arthanari |editor1-first=T.S. |editor2-last=Dodge |editor2-first=Yadolah |editor2-link=Yadolah Dodge |last=Rao |first=C.R. |authorlink=C.R.

====Computational mathematics====
[[Computational mathematics]] proposes and studies methods for solving [[mathematical problem]]s that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. [[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using [[functional analysis]] and [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially [[algorithm]]ic [[numerical linear algebra|matrix]] and [[graph theory]]. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]].

==Mathematical awards==
Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the [[Fields Medal]],{{sfn|Monastyrsky|2001|p=1|ps=: "The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics."}}{{sfn|Riehm|2002|pp=778–82}} established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.

The [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.

A famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called "[[Hilbert's problems]]", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "[[Millennium Prize Problems]]", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a $1&amp;nbsp;million reward.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8127">A '''multi-compartment model''' is a type of [[mathematical model]] used for describing the way materials or energies are transmitted among the ''compartments'' of a system. Each compartment is assumed to be a homogeneous entity within which the entities being modelled are equivalent. For instance, in a pharmacokinetic model, the compartments may represent different sections of a body within which the concentration of a drug is assumed to be uniformly equal.

Hence a multi-compartment model is a [[lumped parameters]] model.

Multi-compartment models are used in many fields including [[pharmacokinetics]], [[compartmental models in epidemiology|epidemiology]], [[biomedicine]], [[systems theory]], [[Complex systems|complexity theory]], engineering, physics, information science and social science. The circuits systems can be viewed as a multi-compartment model as well.

In systems theory, it involves the description of a network whose components are compartments that represent a population of elements that are equivalent with respect to the manner in which they process input signals to the compartment.

*The exchange rate of materials or energies among the compartments is related to the densities of these compartments.
*Usually, it is desirable that the materials do not undergo chemical reactions while transmitting among the compartments.
*When concentration of the cell is of interest, typically the volume is assumed to be constant over time, though this may not be totally true in reality. 
     
Most commonly, the mathematics of multi-compartment models is simplified to provide only a single parameter—such as concentration—within a compartment.

== Single-compartment model ==
[[Image:Singlecell.PNG]]

Possibly the simplest application of multi-compartment model is in the single-cell concentration monitoring (see the figure above). If the volume of a cell is ''V'', the [[mass]] of [[solution|solute]] is ''q'', the input is ''u''(''t'') and the secretion of the solution is proportional to the density of it within the cell, then the concentration of the solution ''C'' within the cell over time is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}=u(t)-kq&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{q}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the proportionality.

==Multi-Compartment Model==
As the number of compartments increases, the model can be very complex and the solutions usually beyond ordinary calculation.

The formulae for '''n-cell''' multi-compartment models become:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\dot{q}_1=q_1 k_{11}+q_2 k_{12}+\cdots+q_n k_{1n}+u_1(t) \\
\dot{q}_2=q_1 k_{21}+q_2 k_{22}+\cdots+q_n k_{2n}+u_2(t) \\
\vdots\\
\dot{q}_n=q_1 k_{n1}+q_2 k_{n2}+\cdots+q_n k_{nn}+u_n(t)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where 
:&lt;math&gt;0=\sum^n_{i=1}{k_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=1,2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt; (as the total 'contents' of all compartments is constant in a closed system)

Or in matrix forms:
: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\dot{q}}=\mathbf{Kq}+\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}=\begin{bmatrix}
k_{11}&amp; k_{12} &amp;\cdots &amp;k_{1n}\\
k_{21}&amp; k_{22} &amp; \cdots&amp;k_{2n}\\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\ddots&amp;\vdots \\
k_{n1}&amp; k_{n2} &amp;\cdots &amp;k_{nn}\\
\end{bmatrix} 
\mathbf{q}=\begin{bmatrix}
q_1 \\
q_2 \\
\vdots \\
q_n
\end{bmatrix}
\mathbf{u}=\begin{bmatrix}
u_1(t) \\
u_2(t) \\
\vdots \\
u_n(t)
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp;\cdots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{K}=\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp;\cdots &amp; 0\\
\end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; (as the total 'contents' of all compartments is constant in a closed system)

In the special case of a closed system (see below) i.e. where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=0&lt;/math&gt; then there is a general solution.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = c_1 e^{\lambda_1 t} \mathbf{v_1} + c_2 e^{\lambda_2 t} \mathbf{v_2} + \cdots + c_n e^{\lambda_n t} \mathbf{v_n}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;, ... and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;, ... and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_n}&lt;/math&gt; are the respective [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;, .... and &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; are constants.

However it can be shown that given the above requirement to ensure the 'contents' of a closed system are constant, then for every pair of [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] and [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]] then either &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp;\cdots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{v}=0&lt;/math&gt; and also that one [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] is 0, say &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt;

So
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = c_1  \mathbf{v_1} + c_2 e^{\lambda_2 t} \mathbf{v_2} + \cdots + c_n e^{\lambda_n t} \mathbf{v_n}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp;\cdots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{v_i}=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}=2, 3, \dots n&lt;/math&gt;

This solution can be rearranged:

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{q} = 
\Bigg[ \mathbf{v_1}\begin{bmatrix}
 c_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
 \end{bmatrix}
+ \mathbf{v_2}\begin{bmatrix}
 0 &amp; c_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
 \end{bmatrix}
+ \dots + \mathbf{v_n}\begin{bmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; c_n \\
 \end{bmatrix} \Bigg]
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
e^{\lambda_2t} \\
 \vdots \\
e^{\lambda_nt} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This somewhat inelegant equation demonstrates that all solutions of an ''n-cell'' multi-compartment model with constant or no inputs are of the form:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{A}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
e^{\lambda_2t} \\
 \vdots \\
e^{\lambda_nt} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''nxn'' matrix and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;, ... and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; are constants.
Where &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp;\cdots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}
 a &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Model topologies==
Generally speaking, as the number of compartments increase, it is challenging both to find the algebraic and numerical solutions of the model. However, there are special cases of models, which rarely exist in nature, when the topologies exhibit certain regularities that the solutions become easier to find. The model can be classified according to the interconnection of cells and input/output characteristics:

#'''Closed model''': No sinks or source, lit. all ''k''&lt;sub&gt;oi&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0;
#'''Open model''': There are sinks or/and sources among cells.
#'''Catenary model''': All compartments are arranged in a chain, with each pool connecting only to its neighbors. This model has two or more cells.
#'''Cyclic model''': It's a special case of the catenary model, with three or more cells, in which the first and last cell are connected, i.e. ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0 or/and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0.
#'''Mammillary model''': Consists of a central compartment with peripheral compartments connecting to it. There are no interconnections among other compartments. 
#'''Reducible model''': It's a set of unconnected models. It bears great resemblance to the computer concept of '''forest''' as against '''trees'''.

In mathematics, for example in the study of statistical properties of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], a '''null model''' is type of random object that matches one specific object in some of its features, or more generally satisfies a collection of constraints, but which is otherwise taken to be an unbiasedly random structure. The null model is used as a term of comparison, to verify whether the object in question displays some non-trivial features (properties that wouldn't be expected on the basis of chance alone or as a consequence of the constraints), such as community structure in graphs. An appropriate null model behaves in accordance with a reasonable [[null hypothesis]] for the behavior of the system under investigation.

One null model of utility in the study of [[complex networks]] is that proposed by Newman and Girvan, consisting of a randomized version of an original graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, produced through edges being rewired at random, under the constraint that the expected degree of each vertex matches the degree of the vertex in the original graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=M.E.J|first=Newman|author2=M.Girvan |title=Finding and evaluating community structure in networks|journal=Phys. Rev. E|year=2004|volume=69|issue=2|doi=10.1103/physreve.69.026113 |arxiv=cond-mat/0308217|bibcode=2004PhRvE..69b6113N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The null model is the basic concept behind the definition of [[Modularity (networks)|modularity]], a function which evaluates the goodness of partitions of a graph into clusters. In particular, given a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and a specific community partition &lt;math&gt;\sigma:V(G)\rightarrow \{1,...,b\}&lt;/math&gt; (an assignment of a community-index &lt;math&gt;\sigma(v)&lt;/math&gt; (here taken as an integer from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) to each vertex &lt;math&gt;v\in V(G)&lt;/math&gt; in the graph), the modularity measures the difference between the number of links from/to each pair of communities, from that expected in a graph that is completely random in all respects other than the set of degrees of each of the vertices (the [[degree sequence]]). In other words, the modularity contrasts the exhibited community structure in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with that of a null model, which in this case is the [[configuration model]] (the maximally random graph subject to a constraint on the degree of each vertex).

The '''one-shot deviation principle''' (also known as '''one-deviation property'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategy: An Introduction to Game Theory|last=Watson|first=Joel|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2013|isbn=978-0393123876|location=New York|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the principle of optimality of [[dynamic programming]] applied to [[game theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackwell|first=David|date=1965|title=Discounting Dynamic Programming|url=|journal=Annals of Mathematical Statistics|volume=36|pages=226–235|via=|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177700285}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It says that a strategy profile of a finite [[extensive-form game]] is a [[subgame perfect equilibrium]] (SPE) if and only if there exist no profitable one-shot deviations for each subgame and every player.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tirole|first1=Jean|last2=Fudenberg|first2=Drew|title=Game theory|year=1991|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-262-06141-4|edition=6. printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In simpler terms, if no player can increase their payoffs by deviating a single decision, or period, from their original strategy, then the strategy that they have chosen is a SPE. As a result, no player can profit from deviating from the strategy for one period and then reverting to the strategy. 

Furthermore, the one-shot deviation principle is very important for infinite horizon games, in which the principle typically does not hold&lt;ref&gt;Obara, I. (2012). Subgame Perfect Equilibrium [PDF document]. Slide 13. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.econ.ucla.edu/iobara/SPE201B.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, since it is not plausible to consider an infinite number of strategies and payoffs in order to solve. In an infinite horizon game where the [[discount factor]] is less than 1, a strategy profile is a subgame perfect equilibrium if and only if it satisfies the one-shot deviation principle&lt;ref&gt;Ozdaglar, A. (2010). Repeated Games [PDF document]. Slide 13. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-254-game-theory-with-engineering-applications-spring-2010/lecture-notes/MIT6_254S10_lec15.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definitions ==

The following is the paraphrased definition from Watson (2013)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To check whether strategy ''s'' is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, we have to ask every player ''i'' and every subgame, if considering ''s'', there is a strategy ''s’'' that yields a strictly higher payoff for player ''i'' than does ''s'' in the subgame. This analysis is equivalent to looking at single deviations from ''s'', meaning ''s’'' differs from s at only one information set. Note that the choices associated with ''s'' and ''s’'' are the same at all nodes that are successors of nodes in the information set where s and ''s’'' prescribe different actions. 

=== Example ===
Consider a [[symmetric game]] with two players in which each player makes binary choice decisions, A or B, in three sequences. There are 8 (2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) total number of pure strategies for each player: {AAA, AAB, ABA, ABB, BBB, BBA, BAB, BAA}. In this example, consider that a player chooses strategy (AAA). To check whether this strategy is a SPE, the one-shot deviation principle states that the player needs to check the payoffs of only three other strategies which differ from the original strategy by a single deviation, instead of all seven others. These three strategies are: ('''B'''AA), (A'''B'''A), and (AA'''B'''). If none of these three strategies yields a higher payoff than (AAA), then the player can conclude that (AAA) is a SPE.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7622">In [[mathematic]]s an '''operand''' is the object of a [[mathematical operation]], i.e. it is the object or quantity that is operated on.&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example ==
The following [[arithmetic]] expression shows an example of operators and operands:

:&lt;math&gt;3 + 6 = 9&lt;/math&gt;

In the above example, '+' is the symbol for the operation called [[addition]]. 

The '''operand''' '3' is one of the inputs (quantities) followed by the addition [[Operator_(mathematics)|operator]], and the operand '6' is the other input necessary for the operation.

The result of the operation is 9. (The number '9' is also called the sum of the augend 3 and the addend 6.)

An operand, then, is also referred to as "one of the inputs (quantities) for an operation".

==Notation==

===Expressions as operands===
Operands may be complex, and may consist of expressions also made up of operators with operands.

:&lt;math&gt;(3 + 5) \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

In the above expression '(3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5)' is the first operand for the multiplication operator and '2' the second. The operand '(3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5)' is an expression in itself, which contains an addition operator, with the operands '3' and '5'.

===Order of operations===
{{See also|Order of operations}}
Rules of precedence affect which values form operands for which operators:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publish.aps.org/files/styleguide-pr.pdf |title=Physical Review Style and Notation Guide |publisher=[[American Physical Society]]|accessdate=5 August 2012|at=Section IV&amp;ndash;E&amp;ndash;2&amp;ndash;e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;3 + 5 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

In the above expression, the multiplication operator has the higher precedence than the addition operator, so the multiplication operator has operands of '5' and '2'. The addition operator has operands of '3' and '5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2'.

===Positioning of operands===
Depending on the [[mathematical notation]] being used the position of an operator in relation to its operand(s) may vary. In everyday usage [[infix notation]] is the most common,&lt;ref name="Infix, Postfix and Prefix"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pjj/cs212/fix.html | title=The Implementation and Power of Programming Languages | accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however other notations also exist, such as the [[prefix notation|prefix]] and [[postfix notation|postfix]] notations. These alternate notations are most common within [[computer science]].

Below is a comparison of three different notations — all represent an addition of the numbers '1' and '2'

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2&lt;/math&gt; (infix notation)

:&lt;math&gt;+\;1\;2&lt;/math&gt; (prefix notation)

:&lt;math&gt;1\;2\;+&lt;/math&gt; (postfix notation)

===Infix notation and the order of operation===
{{main|Order of operations}}

In a mathematical expression, the order of operation is carried out from left to right. Start with the left most value and seek the first operation to be carried out in accordance with the order specified above (i.e., start with parentheses and end with the addition/subtraction group). For example, in the expression

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2^2 - (2 + 2^2)&lt;/math&gt;,

the first operation to be acted upon is any and all expressions found inside a parenthesis. So beginning at the left and moving to the right, find the first (and in this case, the only) parenthesis, that is, (2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Within the parenthesis itself is found the expression 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The reader is required to find the value of 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; before going any further. The value of 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 4. Having found this value, the remaining expression looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2^2 - (2 + 4)&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to calculate the value of expression inside the parenthesis itself, that is, (2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6. Our expression now looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2^2 - 6&lt;/math&gt;

Having calculated the parenthetical part of the expression, we start over again beginning with the left most value and move right. The next order of operation (according to the rules) is exponents. Start at the left most value, that is, 4, and scan your eyes to the right and search for the first exponent you come across. The first (and only) expression we come across that is expressed with an exponent is 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  We find the value of 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 4. What we have left is the expression

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 4 - 6&lt;/math&gt;.

The next order of operation is multiplication. 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4 is 16. Now our expression looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;16 - 6&lt;/math&gt;

The next order of operation according to the rules is division. However, there is no division operator sign (÷) in the expression, 16&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6. So we move on to the next order of operation, i.e., addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence and are done left to right.

:&lt;math&gt;16 - 6 = 10&lt;/math&gt;. 

So the correct value for our original expression, 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), is 10. 

It is important to carry out the order of operation in accordance with rules set by convention. If the reader evaluates an expression but does not follow the correct order of operation, the reader will come forth with a different value. The different value will be the incorrect value because the order of operation was not followed. The reader will arrive at the correct value for the expression if and only if each operation is carried out in the proper order.

===Arity===
The number of operands of an operator is called its [[arity]].&lt;ref name="Hazewinkel2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Michiel Hazewinkel]]|title=Encyclopaedia of Mathematics, Supplement III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47YC2h295JUC&amp;pg=PA3|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-0198-7|page=3}}: "Each connective has associated with it a natural number, called its ''rank'', or ''arity''."&lt;/ref&gt; Based on arity, operators are classified as nullary (no operands), [[unary operation|unary]] (1 operand), [[binary operation|binary]] (2 operands), [[ternary operation|ternary]] (3 operands) etc.

==Computer science==
In computer [[programming language]]s, the definitions of [[operator (programming)|operator]] and '''operand''' are almost the same as in mathematics.

In computing, an '''operand''' is the part of a computer instruction which specifies what data is to be manipulated or operated on, while at the same time representing the data itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |author =Nell Dale and John Lewis
  |title = Computer Science Illuminated, 5th Edition
  |year = 2012
  |publisher = Jones and Bartlett
  |ISBN =978-1449672843
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A computer instruction describes an operation such as add or multiply X, while the operand (or operands, as there can be more than one) specify on which X to operate as well as the value of X.

Additionally, in [[assembly language]], an '''operand''' is a value (an argument) on which the [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]], named by [[mnemonic]], operates.  The operand may be a [[processor register]], a [[memory address]], a literal constant, or a label.  A simple example (in the [[x86]] architecture) is
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="asm"&gt;
MOV DS, AX
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
where the value in register operand &lt;code&gt;AX&lt;/code&gt; is to be moved (&lt;code&gt;[[MOV (x86 instruction)|MOV]]&lt;/code&gt;) into register &lt;code&gt;DS&lt;/code&gt;. Depending on the [[instruction set|instruction]], there may be zero, one, two, or more operands.

It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed [[arity|number of operands]].

The term ''Polish notation'' is sometimes taken (as the opposite of ''infix notation'') to also include reverse Polish notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Data structures and other objects using Java |edition=3rd |author-first=Michael |author-last=Main |publisher=[[Pearson PLC]] [[Addison-Wesley]] |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-321-37525-4 |page=334 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tok_AQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Polish notation is used as a syntax for mathematical expressions by [[programming language]] [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]s, it is readily parsed into [[abstract syntax tree]]s and can, in fact, define a [[Bijection|one-to-one representation]] for the same. Because of this, [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] ([[#Implementations|see below]]) and related programming languages define their entire syntax in terms of prefix notation (and others use postfix notation).

A quotation from a paper by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], ''Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction"'', page 180, states how the notation was invented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I came upon the idea of a parenthesis-free notation in 1924. I used that notation for the first time in my article Łukasiewicz(1), p. 610, footnote.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reference cited by Łukasiewicz is apparently a lithographed report in [[Polish language|Polish]]. The referring paper by Łukasiewicz ''Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction"'' was reviewed by [[Henry Pogorzelski|Henry A. Pogorzelski]] in the ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Pogorzelski, Henry A., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2269644 "Reviewed work(s): Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction" by Jan Łukasiewicz; Jerzy Słupecki; Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe"], ''The Journal of Symbolic Logic'', Vol. 30, No. 3 (September 1965), pp. 376–377. The original paper by Łukasiewicz was published in [[Warsaw]] in 1961 in a volume edited by Jerzy Słupecki.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Behmann]], editor in 1924 of the article of [[Moses Schönfinkel]]&lt;ref&gt;"Über die Bausteine der mathematischen Logik", ''Mathematische Annalen'' '''92''', pages 305-316. Translated by Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg as "On the building blocks of mathematical logic" in [[Jean van Heijenoort]], 1967. ''A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931''. [[Harvard University Press]]: 355-66.&lt;/ref&gt; already had the idea of eliminating parentheses in logic formulas.

[[Alonzo Church]] mentions this notation in his classic book on [[mathematical logic]] as worthy of remark in notational systems even contrasted to [[Alfred North Whitehead|Alfred Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]'s logical notational exposition and work in [[Principia Mathematica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Alonzo |author-last=Church |title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic |location=Princeton, New Jersey, USA |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=1944 |page=38 |quote=[…] Worthy of remark is the parenthesis-free notation of Jan Łukasiewicz. In this the letters N, A, C, E, K are used in the roles of negation, disjunction, implication, equivalence, conjunction respectively. […]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Łukasiewicz's 1951 book, ''Aristotle's Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic'', he mentions that the principle of his notation was to write the [[Function symbol|functor]]s before the [[Argument of a function|argument]]s to avoid brackets and that he had employed his notation in his logical papers since 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Łukasiewicz, (1951) ''Aristotle's Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic'', Chapter IV "Aristotle's System in Symbolic Form" (section on "Explanation of the Symbolism"), p. 78 and on.&lt;/ref&gt; He then goes on to cite, as an example, a 1930 paper he wrote with [[Alfred Tarski]] on the [[Propositional calculus|sentential calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Łukasiewicz, Jan; Tarski, Alfred, "Untersuchungen über den Aussagenkalkül" ["Investigations into the sentential calculus"], ''Comptes Rendus des Séances de la Société des Sciences et des Lettres de Varsovie'', Vol. 23 (1930) Cl. III, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

While no longer used much in logic,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Mhy bib I fail logic?

[…]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish notation has since found a place in [[computer science]].

==Explanation==
The expression for adding the numbers 1 and 2 is written in Polish notation as {{nowrap|+ 1 2}} (pre-fix), rather than as {{nowrap|1 + 2}} (in-fix). In more complex expressions, the operators still precede their operands, but the operands may themselves be expressions including again operators and their operands. For instance, the expression that would be written in conventional infix notation as
: {{nowrap|(5 − 6) × 7}}
can be written in Polish notation as
: {{nowrap|× (− 5 6) 7}}
Assuming a given [[arity]] of all involved operators (here the "−" denotes the binary operation of subtraction, not the unary function of sign-change), any well formed prefix representation thereof is unambiguous, and brackets within the prefix expression are unnecessary. As such, the above expression can be further simplified to
: {{nowrap|× − 5 6 7}}

The processing of the product is deferred until its two operands are available (i.e., 5 minus 6, and 7). As with ''any'' notation, the innermost expressions are evaluated first, but in Polish notation this "innermost-ness" can be conveyed by the sequence of operators and operands rather than by bracketing.

In the conventional infix notation parentheses are required to override the standard [[Order of operations|precedence rules]], since, referring to the above example, moving them
: {{nowrap|5 − (6 × 7)}}
or removing them
: {{nowrap|5 − 6 × 7}}
changes the meaning and the result of the expression. This version is written in Polish notation as
: {{nowrap|− 5 × 6 7}}.

When dealing with non-commutative operations, like division or subtraction, it is necessary to coordinate the sequential arrangement of the operands with the definition of how the operator takes its arguments, i.e., from left to right.  For example, {{nowrap|÷ 10 5}}, with 10 left to 5, has the meaning of 10 ÷ 5 (read as "divide 10 by 5"), or {{nowrap|- 7 6}}, with 7 left to 6, has the meaning of 7 - 6 (read as "subtract from 7 the operand 6").

==Evaluation algorithm==
Prefix/postfix notation is especially popular for its innate ability to express the intended order of operations without the need for parentheses and other precedence rules, as are usually employed with [[infix notation]]. Instead, the notation uniquely indicates which operator to evaluate first. The operators are assumed to have a fixed [[arity]] each, and all necessary operands are assumed to be explicitly given. A valid prefix expression always starts with an operator and ends with an operand. Evaluation can either proceed from left to right, or in the opposite direction. Starting at the left, the input string, consisting of tokens denoting operators or operands, is pushed token for token on a [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]], until the top entries of the stack contain the number of operands that fits to the top most operator (immediately beneath). This group of tokens at the stacktop (the last stacked operator and the according number of operands) is replaced by the result of executing the operator on these/this operand(s). Then the processing of the input continues in this manner. The rightmost operand in a valid prefix expression thus empties the stack, except for the result of evaluating the whole expression. When starting at the right, the pushing of tokens is performed similarly, just the evaluation is triggered by an operator, finding the appropriate number of operands that fits its arity already at the stacktop. Now the leftmost token of a valid prefix expression must be an operator, fitting to the number of operands in the stack, which again yields the result. As can be seen from the description, a [[Deterministic pushdown automaton|push-down store]] with no capability of arbitrary stack inspection suffices to implement this [[parsing]].

The above sketched stack manipulation works –with mirrored input– also for expressions in [[reverse Polish notation]].

==Polish notation for logic==
The table below shows the core of [[Jan Łukasiewicz]]'s notation for [[sentential logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 8 |author-first=Edward |author-last=Craig |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |date=1998 |isbn=9780415073103 |page=496 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxpFwcAplaAC&amp;pg=PA496}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some letters in the Polish notation table stand for particular words in [[Polish language|Polish]], as shown:

|}

Note that the quantifiers ranged over propositional values in Łukasiewicz's work on many-valued logics.

[[Józef Maria Bocheński|Bocheński]] introduced a system of Polish notation that names all 16 binary [[logical connective|connectives]] of classical propositional logic. For classical propositional logic, it is a compatible extension of the notation of Łukasiewicz. But the notations are incompatible in the sense that Bocheński uses L and M (for nonimplication and converse nonimplication) in propositional logic and Łukasiewicz uses L and M in modal logic.&lt;ref&gt;Bocheński, Józef Maria (1959). A Precis of Mathematical Logic, translated by Otto Bird from the French and German editions, D. Reidel: Dordrecht, Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
Prefix notation has seen wide application in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] [[s-expressions]], where the brackets are required since the operators in the language are themselves data ([[first-class function]]s). Lisp functions may also be [[Variadic function|variadic]]. The [[Tcl]] programming language, much like Lisp also uses Polish notation through the mathop library. The Ambi&lt;ref&gt;https://code.google.com/p/ambi/&lt;/ref&gt; programming language uses Polish notation for arithmetic operations and program construction.

Postfix notation is used in many [[stack-oriented programming language]]s like [[PostScript]] and [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]]. [[CoffeeScript]] syntax also allows functions to be called using prefix notation, while still supporting the unary postfix syntax common in other languages.

The number of return values of an expression equals the difference between the number of operands in an expression and the total arity of the operators minus the total number of return values of the operators.

Polish notation, usually in postfix form, is the chosen notation of certain [[calculator]]s, notably from [[HP calculators|Hewlett-Packard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://h20331.www2.hp.com/Hpsub/downloads/35_02_RPN_Mode.pdf |title=HP calculators {{!}} '''HP 35s''' RPN Mode |publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a lower level, postfix operators are used by some [[stack machines]] such as the [[Burroughs large systems]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7153">'''Predictive intake modelling''' uses [[mathematical model]]ling strategies to estimate intake of food, [[personal care]] products, and their [[Formulations#Other examples of product formulations|formulations]].

== Definition ==

Predictive intake modelling seeks to estimate intake of products and/or their constituents which may enter the body through various routes such as ingestion, [[inhalation]] and [[Absorption (skin)|absorption]].

Predictive intake modelling can be applied to determine trends in food consumption and product use for the purpose of [[extrapolation]].

== Applications ==

A predictive intake modelling approach is used to estimate voluntary food intake (VFI) by animals where their eating habits cannot be exactly measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hackmann T.

Predictive intake modelling has applications in [[public health]], [[Risk assessment#Risk assessment and human health|risk assessment]] and [[exposure assessment]], where estimating intake or exposure to different substances can influence the decision making process.

== Predictive intake modelling strategies ==

=== Regression approach ===

The [[regression analysis]] approach is based on estimations through extrapolation or interpolation where there is a cause-and-effect relationship found by data fitting.  These trends tend to be [[phenomenological model|phenomenological]].

=== Mechanistic modelling approach ===

A mechanistic modelling approach is one where a model is derived from basic theory. Examples of these include compartmental models which can be used to describe the circulation and concentration of airborne particles in a room or household for estimating intake of inhalants.&lt;ref&gt;M. Singal, "RIFM 2-Box Indoor Air Dispersion Model Is An Alternative Method To Calculate Inhalation Exposure To Fragrance," Research Institute for Fragrance Materials, 2012. [Online]. Available: http://www.rifm.org/press-detail.php?id=68. [Accessed: 28-Nov-2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population-based approach ===

A population-based approach tracks consumer intake from individual members of a sample population over time. Mathematical models are used to combine these habits and practices databases with separate databases on product or food formulation to estimate intake or exposure for the sample population. Moreover, [[Sampling (statistics)#Survey weights|survey weights]] may be applied to each subject in the study based on their age, demographic and location allowing the sample of subjects to correctly represent an entire population, and thus estimate intake for that population.

=== Probabilistic modelling approach ===
Probabilistic models are based on the [[Monte Carlo methods|Monte Carlo]] method where distributions of data from various sources are randomly sampled from to calculate percentile statistics. Such probabilistic techniques typically utilise product or consumption survey data from a sample population combined with distributions of substances that may be found within those foods or products. For example, [[The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA)|The Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) suggest that the estimation of intake of substances in food can be probabilistically conducted through food consumption surveys ([[NHANES]]/[http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=7764 CSFII]) from sample populations combined with distributions of substance concentration data to calculate the Estimated Daily Intake.&lt;ref&gt;FDA, "Guidance for Industry: Estimating Dietary Intake of Substances in Food," 2006. [Online]. Available: http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/IngredientsAdditivesGRASPackaging/ucm074725.htm#mode. [Accessed: 24-Feb-2014].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) funded the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment (MCRA) tool to estimate usual intake exposure distributions based on statistical models which utilise the EFSA Comprehensive Database, which contains detailed food consumption survey data.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. van Klaverena, P. W. Goedhartb, D. Wapperoma, and H. van der Voet, "A European tool for usual intake distribution estimation in relation to data collection by EFSA," Bilthoven, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; EFSA also funded Creme Global to develop a model and databases of European food consumption on which statistical models can be run to assess intake and exposure on a pan-European basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vilone G. |author2=Comiskey D |author3=Heraud F |author4=O'Mahony C | year = 2014 | title = Statistical method to assess usual dietary intakes in the European population | url = | journal = Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess | volume = 31 | issue = 10| pages = 1639–51 | doi = 10.1080/19440049.2014.955886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.

In [[mathematics]], a '''projection''' is a mapping of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (or other [[mathematical structure]]) into  a subset (or sub-structure), which is equal to its square for [[function composition|mapping composition]] (or, in other words, which is [[idempotence|idempotent]]). The [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] to a subspace of a projection is also called a ''projection'', even if the idempotence property is lost.
An everyday example of a projection is the casting of shadows onto a plane (paper sheet).  The projection of a point is its shadow on the paper sheet. The shadow of a point on the paper sheet is this point itself (idempotence). The shadow of a three-dimensional sphere is a closed disk.  Originally, the notion of projection was introduced in [[Euclidean geometry]] to denote the projection of the [[Euclidean space]] of three dimensions onto a plane in it, like the shadow example. The two main projections of this kind are: 
* {{anchor|Central projection}}The '''projection from a point onto a plane''' or '''central projection''': If ''C'' is a point, called the '''center of projection''', then the projection of a point ''P'' different from ''C'' onto a plane that does not contain ''C'' is the intersection of the line ''CP'' with the plane. The points ''P'' such that the line ''CP'' is parallel to the plane do not have any image by the projection, but one often says that they project to a point at infinity of the plane (see [[projective geometry]] for a formalization of this terminology). The projection of the point ''C'' itself is not defined.
* The '''projection parallel to a direction D, onto a plane''' or '''[[parallel projection]]''': The image of a point ''P'' is the intersection with the plane of the line parallel to ''D'' passing through ''P''. See {{slink|Affine space|Projection}} for an accurate definition, generalized to any dimension.

The concept of '''projection''' in [[mathematics]] is a very old one, most likely having its roots in the phenomenon of the shadows cast by real world objects on the ground. This rudimentary idea was refined and abstracted, first in a geometric context and later in other branches of mathematics. Over time differing versions of the concept developed, but today, in a sufficiently abstract setting, we can unify these variations.

In [[cartography]], a [[map projection]] is a map of a part of the surface of the Earth onto a plane, which, in some cases, but not always, is the restriction of a projection in the above meaning. The [[3D projection]]s are also at the basis of the theory of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. 

The need for unifying the two kinds of projections and of defining the image by a central projection of any point different of the center of projection are at the origin of [[projective geometry]]. However, a [[projective transformation]] is a [[bijection]] of a projective space, a property ''not'' shared with the ''projections'' of this article.

== Definition ==
[[File:Proj-map.svg|thumb|191x191px|The commutativity of this diagram is the universality of the projection π, for any map ''f'' and set X.]]
In an abstract setting we can generally say that a ''projection'' is a mapping of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (or of a [[mathematical structure]]) which is [[idempotent]], which means that a projection is equal to its [[Function composition|composition]] with itself. A '''projection''' may also refer to a mapping which has a right inverse. Both notions are strongly related, as follows. Let ''p'' be an idempotent [[map (mathematics)|map]] from a set ''A'' into itself (thus ''p''∘''p'' = ''p'') and ''B'' = ''p''(''A'') be the image of ''p''. If we denote by π the map ''p'' viewed as a map from ''A'' onto ''B'' and by ''i'' the [[Injective function|injection]] of ''B'' into ''A'', then we have π.''i''= Id&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. Conversely, π.''i'' = Id&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; implies that π∘''i'' is idempotent.

== Applications ==
The original notion of projection has been extended or generalized to various mathematical situations, frequently, but not always, related to geometry, for example:

* In [[set theory]]:
** An operation typified by the ''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[projection (set theory)|projection map]], written proj&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;, that takes an element '''x''' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) of the [[cartesian product]] ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; … &amp;times; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; … &amp;times; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to the value proj&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;.  This map is always [[surjective]].
** A mapping that takes an element to its [[equivalence class]] under a given [[equivalence relation]] is known as the '''{{visible anchor|canonical projection}}'''.
** The evaluation map sends a function ''f'' to the value ''f''(''x'') for a fixed ''x''.  The space of functions ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; can be identified with the cartesian product &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in X}Y_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the evaluation map is a projection map from the cartesian product.

* [[Relational database]]s and [[query language]]s, the [[Projection (relational algebra)|projection]] is a  [[unary operation]] written as &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{a_1, \ldots,a_n}( R )&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_n&lt;/math&gt; is a set of attribute names. The result of such projection is defined as the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that is obtained when all [[tuple]]s in ''R'' are restricted to the set &lt;math&gt;\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}&lt;/math&gt;.  ''R'' is a [[Relation (database)|database-relation]].

* In [[spherical geometry]], projection of a sphere upon a plane was used by [[Ptolemy]] (~150) in his [[Planisphaerium]]. The method is called [[stereographic projection]] and uses a plane tangent to a sphere and a ''pole'' C diametrically opposite the point of tangency.  Any point ''P'' on the sphere besides ''C'' determines a line ''CP'' intersecting the plane at the projected point for ''P''. The correspondence makes the sphere a [[one-point compactification]] for the plane when a [[point at infinity]] is included to correspond to ''C'', which otherwise has no projection on the plane. A common instance is the [[complex plane]] where the compactification corresponds to the [[Riemann sphere]]. Alternatively, a [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemisphere]] is frequently projected onto a plane using the [[gnomonic projection]].

* In [[linear algebra]], a [[linear transformation]] that remains unchanged if applied twice (''p''(''u'') = ''p''(''p''(''u''))), in other words, an [[idempotent]] operator.  For example, the mapping that takes a point (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') in three dimensions to the point (''x'', ''y'', 0) in the plane is a projection. This type of projection naturally generalizes to any number of dimensions ''n'' for the source and ''k'' ≤ ''n'' for the target of the mapping.  See [[orthogonal projection]], [[projection (linear algebra)]].  In the case of orthogonal projections, the space admits a decomposition as a product, and the projection operator is a projection in that sense as well.

* In [[differential topology]], any [[fiber bundle]] includes a projection map as part of its definition.  Locally at least this map looks like a projection map in the sense of the product topology, and is therefore open and surjective.

* In [[topology]], a [[retract]] is a continuous map ''r'': ''X'' → ''X'' which restricts to the identity map on its image.  This satisfies a similar idempotency condition ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r'' and can be considered a generalization of the projection map.  A retract which is [[homotopic]] to the identity is known as a [[deformation retract]].  This term is also used in category theory to refer to any split epimorphism.

* The [[scalar resolute|scalar projection]] (or resolute) of one [[vector (geometric)|vector]] onto another.

* In [[category theory]], the above notion of cartesian product of sets can be generalized to arbitrary [[category (mathematics)|categories]].  The [[product (category theory)|product]] of some objects has a '''canonical projection''' [[morphism]] to each factor.  This projection will take many forms in different categories.  The projection from the [[Cartesian product]] of [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the [[product topology]] of [[topological space]]s (which is always surjective and [[open map|open]]), or from the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of [[group (mathematics)|groups]], etc.  Although these morphisms are often [[epimorphism]]s and even surjective, they do not have to be.

'''Pseudomathematics''' or '''mathematical crankery''' is a form of [[mathematics]]-like activity that does not work within the framework, definitions, rules, or rigor of [[Formal system|formal]] mathematical practice. Pseudomathematics has equivalents in other scientific fields, such as [[pseudophysics]], and overlaps with these to some extent.

Excessive pursuit of pseudomathematics can result in the practitioner being labelled a [[crank (person)|crank]]. The topic of mathematical crankery has been extensively studied by mathematician [[Underwood Dudley]], who has written several popular works about mathematical cranks and their ideas. Because it is based on non-mathematical principles, pseudomathematics is not related to attempts at genuine proofs that contain mistakes. Indeed, such mistakes are common in the careers of [[List of amateur mathematicians|amateur mathematicians]] who go on to produce celebrated results.

==History and examples==
One common type of approach is claiming to have solved classical [[mathematical problem|problem]]s in terms that have been proven [[Logical possibility|mathematically impossible]]. Common examples include the following constructions in [[Euclidean geometry]] using only [[compass and straightedge]]:
* [[Squaring the circle]]: Given any circle drawing a square having the same area.
* [[Doubling the cube]]: Given any cube drawing a cube with twice its volume.
* [[Trisecting the angle]]: Given any angle dividing it into three smaller angles all of the same size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Dudley |first=Underwood | title = What To Do When the Trisector Comes | url = http://web.mst.edu/~lmhall/WhatToDoWhenTrisectorComes.pdf | journal = The Mathematical Intelligencer | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | year = 1983 | pages = 20–25 | doi=10.1007/bf03023502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schaaf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaaf |first=William L. |title=A Bibliography of Recreational Mathematics, Volume 3 |year=1973 |publisher=[[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] |author-link=William L.

A term coined by Augustus De Morgan to identify amateur or self-styled mathematicians, particularly circle-squarers, angle-trisectors, and cube-duplicators, although it can be extended to include those who deny the validity of non-Euclidean geometries. The typical pseudomath has but little mathematical training and insight, is not interested in the results of orthodox mathematics, has complete faith in his own capabilities, and resents the indifference of professional mathematicians. |pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than 2,000 years, many people had tried and failed to find such constructions; in the 19th century, they were all proven impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wantzel|first=P M L|title=Recherches sur les moyens de reconnaître si un problème de Géométrie peut se résoudre avec la règle et le compas.|journal=Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées|date=1837|volume=2|series=1|pages=366–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bold |first=Benjamin |title=Famous Problems of Geometry and How to Solve Them |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1982 |orig-year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 47}}

Another common approach is to misapprehend standard mathematical methods, and insisting that the use or knowledge of higher mathematics is somehow cheating or misleading.

The term ''pseudomath'' was coined by the logician [[Augustus De Morgan]], discoverer of [[De Morgan's laws]], in his ''A Budget of Paradoxes'' (1915). De Morgan wrote,
:The pseudomath is a person who handles mathematics as the monkey handled the razor. The creature tried to shave himself as he had seen his master do; but, not having any notion of the angle at which the razor was to be held, he cut his own throat. He never tried a second time, poor animal! but the pseudomath keeps on at his work, proclaims himself clean-shaved, and all the rest of the world hairy.&lt;ref name="de morgan"&gt;{{cite book|last=De Morgan |first=Augustus |author-link=Augustus De Morgan |year=1915 |title=A Budget of Paradoxes |edition=2nd |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26408/26408-h/26408-h.htm |location=Chicago |publisher=The Open Court Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
De Morgan gave as example of a pseudomath a certain James Smith who claimed persistently to have proved that &lt;math&gt;\pi = 3 \frac{1}{8}&lt;/math&gt;. Of Smith, De Morgan wrote, "He is beyond a doubt the ablest head at unreasoning, and the greatest hand at writing it, of all who have tried in our day to attach their names to an error."&lt;ref name="de morgan"/&gt; The term ''pseudomath'' was adopted later by [[Tobias Dantzig]].&lt;ref name="dantzig"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dantzig |first=Tobias |author-link=Tobias Dantzig |title=The Pseudomath |journal=[[The Scientific Monthly]] |volume=79 |year=1954 |pages=113&amp;ndash;117 |jstor=20921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dantzig observed,
:With the advent of modern times, there was an unprecedented increase in pseudomathematical activity. During the 18th century, all scientific academies of Europe saw themselves besieged by circle-squarers, trisectors, duplicators, and ''perpetuum mobile'' designers, loudly clamoring for recognition of their epoch-making achievements. In the second half of that century, the nuisance had become so unbearable that, one by one, the academies were forced to discontinue the examination of the proposed solutions.&lt;ref name="dantzig"/&gt;

More recently, the term ''pseudomathematics'' has been applied to [[creationism|creationist]] attempts to refute the [[theory of evolution]] by way of spurious arguments purportedly based in [[probability]] or [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elsberry |first1=Wesley |last2=Shallit |first2=Jeffrey |author-link1=Wesley R.

In [[mathematics]], '''''quadrature''''' is a historical term which means the process of determining [[area]]. This term is still used nowadays in the context of [[differential equation]]s, where "solving an equation by quadrature" means expressing its solution in terms of [[antiderivative|integrals]].

Quadrature problems served as one of the main sources of problems in the development of [[calculus]], and introduce important topics in [[mathematical analysis]].

== History ==
[[File:Geometric mean.svg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Antique method to find the [[geometric mean]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Greek mathematics|Mathematicians of ancient Greece]], according to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrine, understood determination of [[area]] of a figure as the process of geometrically constructing a [[square (geometry)|square]] having the same area  (''squaring''), thus the name ''quadrature'' for this process. The Greek geometers were not always successful (see [[quadrature of the circle]]), but they did carry out quadratures of some figures whose sides were not simply line segments, such as the [[lune of Hippocrates|lunes of Hippocrates]] and  [[The Quadrature of the Parabola|the quadrature of the parabola]]. By Greek tradition, these constructions had to be performed using only a [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]].

For a quadrature of a [[rectangle]] with the sides ''a'' and ''b'' it is necessary to construct a square with the side &lt;math&gt;x =\sqrt {ab}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[geometric mean]] of ''a'' and ''b''). For this purpose it is possible to use the following: if one draws the circle with diameter made from joining line segments of lengths ''a'' and ''b'', then the height (''BH'' in the diagram) of the line segment drawn perpendicular to the diameter, from the point of their connection to the point where it crosses the circle, equals the geometric mean of ''a'' and ''b''. A similar geometrical construction solves the problems of quadrature of a parallelogram and of a triangle.

[[File:Parabola and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;The area of a segment of a parabola is 4/3 that of the area of a certain inscribed triangle.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Problems of quadrature for [[curvilinear]] figures are much more difficult. The quadrature of the circle with compass and straightedge was proved in the 19th century to be impossible. Nevertheless, for some figures (for example a lune of Hippocrates) a quadrature can be performed. The quadratures of the surface of a sphere and a [[parabola]] segment discovered by [[Archimedes]] became the highest achievement of analysis in antiquity.
:* The area of the surface of a sphere is equal to four times the area of the circle formed by a [[great circle]] of this sphere.
:* The area of a segment of a parabola determined by a straight line cutting it is 4/3 the area of a triangle inscribed in this segment.
For the proof of these results, Archimedes used the [[method of exhaustion]]&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|title=A History of Mathematics: An Introduction|edition= 2nd|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|year=1998|isbn=0321016181}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113}} of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]].

In medieval Europe, quadrature meant the calculation of area by any method. Most often the [[method of indivisibles]] was used; it was less rigorous than the geometric constructions of the Greeks, but it was simpler and more powerful. With its help, [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Gilles de Roberval]] found the area of a [[cycloid]] arch, [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent]] investigated the area under a [[hyperbola]] (''Opus Geometricum'', 1647),&lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt;{{rp|491}} and [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]], de Saint-Vincent's pupil and commentator, noted the relation of this area to [[logarithm]]s.&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt;{{rp|492}}&lt;ref&gt;Enrique A. Gonzales-Velasco (2011) ''Journey through Mathematics'', § 2.4 Hyperbolic Logarithms, page 117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wallis]] algebrised this method; he wrote in his ''Arithmetica Infinitorum'' (1656) some series which are equivalent to what is now called the [[definite integral]], and he calculated their values. [[Isaac Barrow]] and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] made further progress: quadratures for some [[algebraic curves]] and [[spiral]]s. [[Christiaan Huygens]] successfully performed a quadrature of the surface area of some [[Solid of revolution|solids of revolution]].

The quadrature of the hyperbola by Saint-Vincent and de Sarasa provided a new [[function(mathematics)|function]], the [[natural logarithm]], of critical importance. With the invention of [[integral calculus]] came a universal method for area calculation. In response, the term ''quadrature'' has become traditional, and instead the modern phrase ''finding the area'' is more commonly used for what is technically the ''computation of a univariate definite integral''.

On the contrary the eigenmodes of a classically chaotic system (e.g. the stadium-shaped cavity on the right) tend to become gradually more uniform with increasing mode number.]]

In [[quantum chaos]], a branch of [[mathematical physics]], '''quantum ergodicity''' is a property of the [[Quantization (physics)|quantization]] of [[classical mechanics|classical mechanical systems]] that are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] in the sense of exponential sensitivity to initial conditions.   Quantum ergodicity states, roughly, that in the high-energy limit, the probability distributions associated to [[energy eigenstates]] of a quantized [[ergodic]] [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] tend to a [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] in the classical [[phase space]].  This is consistent with the intuition that the flows of ergodic systems are equidistributed in phase space.  By contrast, classical [[completely integrable system]]s generally have periodic orbits in phase space, and this is exhibited in a variety of ways in the high-energy limit of the eigenstates: typically that some form of concentration or "scarring" occurs in the limit.

The model case of a Hamiltonian is the [[geodesics as Hamiltonian flows|geodesic Hamiltonian]] on the [[cotangent bundle]] of a [[compact space|compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]].  The quantization of the geodesic flow is given by the [[fundamental solution]] of the [[Schrödinger equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;U_t=\exp(it\sqrt{\Delta})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\Delta}&lt;/math&gt; is the square root of the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator]]. The '''quantum ergodicity theorem''' of Shnirelman, [[Yves Colin de Verdière]], and [[Steven Zelditch|Zelditch]] states that a compact Riemannian manifold whose [[unit tangent bundle]] is ergodic under the geodesic flow is also ergodic in the sense that the probability density associated to the ''n''th eigenfunction of the Laplacian tends weakly to the uniform distribution on the unit cotangent bundle as ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin; in a subset of the natural numbers of [[natural density]] equal to one. Quantum ergodicity can be formulated as a non-commutative analogue of the classical ergodicity ([[Toshikazu Sunada|T. Sunada]]).

'''Sphuṭacandrāpti''' (Computation of True Moon) is a treatise in [[Sanskrit]] composed by the fourteenth-century CE [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics|Kerala astronomer-mathematician]] [[Sangamagrama Madhava]]. The treatise enunciates a method for the computation of the position of the moon at intervals of 40 minutes each throughout the day. This is one of only two works of Madhava that have survived to modern times, the other one being ''[[Venvaroha|Veṇvāroha]]''. However, both ''Sphuṭacandrāpti'' and ''Veṇvāroha'' have more or less the same contents, that of the latter being apparently a more refined version of that of the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=K.

==Details==
Stochastic quantization serves to quantize [[Euclidean field theory|Euclidean field theories]],&lt;ref name=damgaard&gt;{{cite journal|last=DAMGAARD|first=Poul|author2=Helmuth HUFFEL |title=STOCHASTIC QUANTIZATION|journal=Physics Reports|year=1987|volume=152|issue=5&amp;6|pages=227–398|url=http://homepage.univie.ac.at/helmuth.hueffel/PhysRep.pdf|accessdate=8 March 2013|bibcode = 1987PhR...152..227D |doi = 10.1016/0370-1573(87)90144-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used for numerical applications, such as [[numerical simulation]]s of [[Gauge theory|gauge theories]] with [[fermion]]s. This serves to address the problem of [[fermion doubling]] that usually occurs in these numerical calculations.

Stochastic quantization takes advantage of the fact that a Euclidean quantum field theory can be modeled as the [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium limit]] of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical system]] coupled to a [[heat bath]]. In particular, in the [[Path integral formulation|path integral]] representation of a Euclidean quantum field theory, the path integral measure is closely related to the [[Boltzmann distribution]] of a statistical mechanical system in equilibrium. In this relation, Euclidean [[Green's functions]] become [[correlation function]]s in the statistical mechanical system. A statistical mechanical system in equilibrium can be modeled, via the [[ergodic hypothesis]], as the [[stationary distribution]] of a [[stochastic process]]. Then the Euclidean path integral measure can also be thought of as the stationary distribution of a stochastic process; hence the name stochastic quantization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3581">A '''tetradic''' '''number''', also known as a '''four-way''' '''number''', is a number that remains the same when flipped back to front, flipped front to back, mirrored up-down, or flipped up-down. The only numbers that remain the same which turned up-side-down or mirrored are 0, 1, and 8, so a tetradic number is a [[palindromic number]] containing only 0, 1, and 8 as digits. The first few tetradic numbers are 1, 8, 11, 88, 101, 111, 181, 808, 818, ... ([[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]] A006072).&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, N. J. A. Sequences [[oeis:A006072|A006072]]/M4481 in "The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1420035223|edition=2nd|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TetradicNumber.html|title=Tetradic Number|last=|first=|date=|website=Wolfram MathWorld|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://everything2.com/title/tetradic+number|title=tetradic number|last=|first=|date=January 5, 2002|website=Everthing2|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetradic numbers are also known as four-way numbers due to the fact that they have four-way [[Symmetry in mathematics|symmetry]] and can flipped back to front, flipped front to back, mirrored up-down, or flipped up-down and always stay the same. The four-way symmetry explains the name, due to [[Numeral prefix|tetra-]] being the Greek prefix for four. Tetradic numbers are both [[Strobogrammatic number|strobogrammatic]] and [[Palindromic number|palindromic]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

If you have a tetradic number, a larger one can always be generated by adding another tetradic number to each end, retaining the symmetry.

== Tetradic primes ==
Tetradic primes are a specific type of tetradic number defined as tetradic numbers that are also [[Prime number|prime numbers]]. The first few tetradic primes are 11, 101, 181, 18181, 1008001, 1180811, 1880881, 1881881, ... ([[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]] A068188).&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, N. J. A.

The largest known tetradic prime {{as of|2010|April|lc=on}} is 

: &lt;math&gt;10^{180054} + 8 R_{58567} \cdot 10^{60744} + 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[repunit]]. The prime has 180,055 decimal digits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

1748: Italian mathematician [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi|Maria Agnesi]] published the first book discussing both differential and integral calculus, called ''Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della gioventù italiana''.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Dirk Jan Struik]], Agnesi is "the first important woman mathematician since [[Hypatia of Alexandria|Hypatia]] (fifth century A.D.)".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="epigenesys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epigenesys.eu/index.php/en/science-and-you/women-in-science/665-maria-gaetana-agnesi|title=Epigenesys - Maria Gaetana Agnesi &amp;#124; Women in science|publisher=epigenesys.eu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1759: French mathematician [[Émilie du Châtelet]]'s translation and commentary on Isaac Newton's work ''Principia Mathematica'' was published posthumously; it is still considered the standard French translation.&lt;ref name="brooklynmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/emilie_du_chatelet.php|title=Brooklyn Museum: Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: The Dinner Party: Heritage Floor: Emilie du Chatelet|publisher=brooklynmuseum.org|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1827: French mathematician [[Sophie Germain]] saw her theorem, known as [[Sophie Germain's theorem|Germain's Theorem]], published in a footnote of a book by the mathematician [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]].&lt;ref name="agnesscott.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/germain.htm|title=Sophie Germain|publisher=agnesscott.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rochester"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/UGpages/sophie.html|title=Sophie Germain page|publisher=math.rochester.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theorem Germain proved that if ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are integers and if ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; then either ''x'', ''y'', or ''z'' must be divisible by&amp;nbsp;5. Germain's theorem was a major step toward proving [[Fermat's last theorem]] for the case where n equals 5.&lt;ref name="agnesscott.edu"/&gt;

1829: The first public examination of an American girl in [[geometry]] was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4kEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=the+first+public+examination+of+a+girl+in+geometry+(1829)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iP5ShzK5u-&amp;sig=sBOKjFQxaCHgVm10oM2EE4g1BNg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=U-iYTdm4D-GS0QHBpZj6Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA# |title=History of Woman Suffrage: 1848–1861, Volume 1|page= 36|editor1=Elizabeth Cady Stanton |editor2=Susan B.

1874: Russian mathematician [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]] became the first woman in modern Europe to gain a doctorate in mathematics, which she earned from the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/323006/Sofya-Vasilyevna-Kovalevskaya|title=Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya (Russian mathematician) -- Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

1880: [[Charlotte Angas Scott]] of Britain obtained special permission to take the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]] Exam, as women were not normally allowed to sit for the exam. She came eighth on the Tripos of all students taking them, but due to her sex, the title of "eighth [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]]," a high honour, went officially to a male student.&lt;ref name=kenschaft&gt;{{cite book|title="Charlotte Angas Scott (1858–1931)" in Women of Mathematics: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook|year=1987|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=0-313-24849-4|pages=193–203|author=Patricia Clark Kenschaft|authorlink=Patricia Clark Kenschaft}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the ceremony, however, after the seventh wrangler had been announced, all the students in the audience shouted her name. Because she could not attend the award ceremony, Scott celebrated her accomplishment at Girton College where there were cheers and clapping at dinner, and a special evening ceremony where the students sang "See the Conquering Hero Comes", and she received an ode written by a staff member, and was crowned with laurels.&lt;ref name=kenschaft /&gt; 

1886: [[Winifred Edgerton Merrill]] became the first American woman to earn a PhD in mathematics, which she earned from Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201204/rtx120400504p.pdf |title=Winifred Edgerton Merrill : "She Opened the Door" |publisher=Ams.org |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1888: The [[Kovalevskaya top]], one of a brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion, was discovered by [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Kovalevskaya, Sur Le Probleme De La Rotation D'Un Corps Solide Autour D'Un Point Fixe, Acta Mathematica 12 (1889) 177–232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[E. T. Whittaker]], A Treatise on the Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies, Cambridge University Press (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

1889: [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]] was appointed as the first female professor in Northern Europe, at the [[University of Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chai-x"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chai-x.nl/blog.php?post=10|title=COOL, CREATIEF, HIP met ICT - Innovative women|publisher=chai-x.nl|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1890: British woman [[Philippa Fawcett]] became the first woman to obtain the top score in the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]] Exam.&lt;ref name="agnesscott"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/fawcett.htm|title=Philippa Garrett Fawcett|publisher=agnesscott.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-woman-who-bested-the-men-at-math-120480965/|title=The Woman Who Bested the Men at Math &amp;#124; History &amp;#124; Smithsonian|publisher=smithsonianmag.com|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1913: American mathematician [[Mildred Sanderson]] published her theorem about modular invariants in her thesis. It states: “To any modular invariant i of a system of forms under any group G of linear transformations with coefficients in the GF[pn], there corresponds a formal invariant I under G such that I = i for all sets of values in the field of the coefficients of the system of forms.” She was [[Leonard Dickson]]’s first female graduate student, and he later wrote of her thesis, “This paper is a highly important contribution to this field of work; its importance lies partly in the fact that it establishes a correspondence between modular and formal invariants. Her main theorem has already been frequently quoted on account of its fundamental character. Her proof is a remarkable piece of mathematics.” [[E.T. Bell]] wrote, “Miss Sanderson’s single contribution (1913) to modular invariants has been rated by competent judges as one of the classics of the subject.”&lt;ref name="agnesscott2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/sander.htm|title=Mildred Leonora Sanderson|publisher=agnesscott.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''tuple''' is a finite ordered list (sequence) of [[Element (mathematics)|elements]].  An '''{{math|''n''}}-tuple''' is a [[sequence]] (or ordered list) of {{math|''n''}} elements, where {{math|''n''}} is a non-negative [[integer]]. There is only one 0-tuple, an empty sequence, or empty tuple, as it is referred to. An {{math|''n''}}-tuple is [[Recursive definition|defined inductively]] using the construction of an [[ordered pair]].

Mathematicians usually write tuples by listing the elements within parentheses "&lt;math&gt;(\text{ })&lt;/math&gt;" and separated by commas; for example, &lt;math&gt;(2, 7, 4, 1, 7)&lt;/math&gt; denotes a 5-tuple. Sometimes other symbols are used to surround the elements, such as square brackets "[ ]" or angle brackets "&lt; &gt;". Braces "{ }" are only used in defining arrays in some programming languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and Visual Basic, but not in mathematical expressions, as they are the standard notation for [[set (mathematics)|sets]]. The term ''tuple'' can often occur when discussing other mathematical objects, such as [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]].

In [[computer science]], tuples come in many forms. In [[Dynamic programming language|dynamically typed languages]], such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], lists are commonly used as tuples.{{citation needed|date =May 2017}} Most typed [[functional programming|functional programming languages]] implement tuples directly as [[product type]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.haskell.org/Algebraic_data_type|title=Algebraic data type - HaskellWiki|author=|date=|website=wiki.haskell.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; tightly associated with [[algebraic data type]]s, [[pattern matching]], and [[Assignment_(computer_science)#Parallel_assignment|destructuring assignment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment|title=Destructuring assignment|author=|date=|website=MDN Web Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programming languages offer an alternative to tuples, known as [[Record (computer science)|record types]], featuring unordered elements accessed by label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5525795/does-javascript-guarantee-object-property-order|title=Does JavaScript Guarantee Object Property Order?|author=|date=|website=Stack Overflow}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few programming languages combine ordered tuple product types and unordered record types into a single construct, as in [[Struct (C programming language)|C structs]] and Haskell records. [[Relational database]]s may formally identify their [[row (database)|row]]s (records) as ''tuples''.

Tuples also occur in [[relational algebra]]; when programming the [[semantic web]]  with the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF); in [[linguistics]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199202720.001.0001/acref-9780199202720-e-2276|title= N‐tuple - Oxford Reference|work= oxfordreference.com|accessdate= 1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term originated as an abstraction of the sequence: single, double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, sextuple, septuple, octuple, ..., {{math|''n''}}‑tuple, ..., where the prefixes are taken from the [[Latin]] names of the numerals. The unique 0‑tuple is called the null tuple. A 1‑tuple is called a singleton, a 2‑tuple is called an ordered pair and a 3‑tuple is a triple or triplet. {{math|''n''}} can be any nonnegative [[integer]]. For example, a [[complex number]] can be represented as a 2‑tuple, a [[quaternion]] can be represented as a 4‑tuple, an [[octonion]] can be represented as an 8‑tuple and a [[sedenion]] can be represented as a 16‑tuple.

Although these uses treat ''‑tuple'' as the suffix, the original suffix was ''‑ple'' as in "triple" (three-fold) or "decuple" (ten‑fold). This originates from  [[medieval Latin]]  ''plus'' (meaning "more") related to [[Greek language|Greek]] ‑πλοῦς, which replaced the classical and late antique  ''‑plex'' (meaning "folded"), as in "duplex".&lt;ref&gt;''OED'', ''s.v.'' "triple", "quadruple", "quintuple", "decuple"&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Compare the etymology of [[ploidy]], from the Greek for -fold.}}

==Properties==
The general rule for the identity of two {{math|''n''}}-tuples is
: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n)&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;a_1=b_1,\text{ }a_2=b_2,\text{ }\ldots,\text{ }a_n=b_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a tuple has properties that distinguish it from a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].
# A tuple may contain multiple instances of the same element, so &lt;br/&gt;tuple &lt;math&gt;(1,2,2,3) \neq (1,2,3)&lt;/math&gt;; but set &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,2,3\} = \{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Tuple elements are ordered: tuple &lt;math&gt;(1,2,3) \neq (3,2,1)&lt;/math&gt;, but set &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\} = \{3,2,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
# A tuple has a finite number of elements, while a set or a [[multiset]] may have an infinite number of elements.

==Definitions==

There are several definitions of tuples that give them the properties described in the previous section.

===Tuples as functions===
If we are dealing with sets, an {{math|''n''}}-tuple can be regarded as a [[Function (mathematics)#Definition|function]], {{math|''F''}},  whose domain is the tuple's implicit set of element indices, {{math|''X''}}, and whose codomain, {{math|''Y''}}, is the tuple's set of elements. Formally:
: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) \equiv (X,Y,F)&lt;/math&gt;
where:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{align}
      X &amp; = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}                       \\
      Y &amp; = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}                \\
      F &amp; = \{(1, a_1), (2, a_2), \ldots, (n, a_n)\}. \\
    \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
In slightly less formal notation this says:
:&lt;math&gt; (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) := (F(1), F(2), \dots, F(n)).&lt;/math&gt;

===Tuples as nested ordered pairs===
Another way of modeling tuples in Set Theory is as nested [[ordered pair]]s. This approach assumes that the notion of ordered pair has already been defined; thus a 2-tuple 
# The 0-tuple (i.e. the empty tuple) is represented by the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
# An {{math|''n''}}-tuple, with {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, can be defined as an ordered pair of its first entry and an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-tuple (which contains the remaining entries when {{math|''n'' &gt; 1)}}:
#: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) = (a_1, (a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n))&lt;/math&gt;
This definition can be applied recursively to the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-tuple:
: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) = (a_1, (a_2, (a_3, (\ldots, (a_n, \emptyset)\ldots))))&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for example:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{align}
         (1, 2, 3) &amp; = (1, (2, (3, \emptyset)))      \\
      (1, 2, 3, 4) &amp; = (1, (2, (3, (4, \emptyset)))) \\
    \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;

A variant of this definition starts "peeling off" elements from the other end:
# The 0-tuple is the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
# For {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}:
#: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) = ((a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{n-1}), a_n)&lt;/math&gt;
This definition can be applied recursively:
: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) = ((\ldots(((\emptyset, a_1), a_2), a_3), \ldots), a_n)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for example:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{align}
         (1, 2, 3) &amp; = (((\emptyset, 1), 2), 3)      \\
      (1, 2, 3, 4) &amp; = ((((\emptyset, 1), 2), 3), 4) \\
    \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;

===Tuples as nested sets===
Using [[ordered pair#Kuratowski definition|Kuratowski's representation for an ordered pair]], the second definition above can be reformulated in terms of pure [[set theory]]:
# The 0-tuple (i.e. the empty tuple) is represented by the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;;
# Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; be an {{math|''n''}}-tuple &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow b \equiv (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, b)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow b \equiv \{\{x\}, \{x, b\}\}&lt;/math&gt;.  (The right arrow, &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;, could be read as "adjoined with".)

In this formulation:
: &lt;math&gt;
   \begin{array}{lclcl}
     ()      &amp; &amp;                     &amp;=&amp; \emptyset                                    \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp;                                              \\
     (1)     &amp;=&amp; ()    \rightarrow 1 &amp;=&amp; \{\{()\},\{(),1\}\}                          \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp;=&amp; \{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\}            \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp;                                              \\
     (1,2)   &amp;=&amp; (1)   \rightarrow 2 &amp;=&amp; \{\{(1)\},\{(1),2\}\}                        \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp;=&amp; \{\{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\}\},     \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp; \{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\},2\}\}    \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp;                                              \\
     (1,2,3) &amp;=&amp; (1,2) \rightarrow 3 &amp;=&amp; \{\{(1,2)\},\{(1,2),3\}\}                    \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp;=&amp; \{\{\{\{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\}\}, \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp; \{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\},2\}\}\}, \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp; \{\{\{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\}\},   \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp; \{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\},2\}\},3\}\}                                       \\
    \end{array}
  &lt;/math&gt;

=={{anchor|n-tuple}}{{math|''n''}}-tuples of {{math|''m''}}-sets ==

In [[discrete mathematics]], especially [[combinatorics]] and finite [[probability theory]], {{math|''n''}}-tuples arise in the context of various counting problems and are treated more informally as ordered lists of length {{math|''n''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Angelo|West|2000|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|''n''}}-tuples whose entries come from a set of {{math|''m''}} elements are also called ''arrangements with repetition'', ''[[Permutation#Permutations_of_multisets|permutations of a multiset]]'' and, in some non-English literature, ''variations with repetition''. The number of {{math|''n''}}-tuples of an {{math|''m''}}-set is {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This follows from the combinatorial [[rule of product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Angelo|West|2000|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|''S''}} is a finite set of [[cardinality]] {{math|''m''}}, this number is the cardinality of the {{math|''n''}}-fold [[Cartesian product#Cartesian power|Cartesian power]] {{math|''S'' × ''S'' × ... ''S''}}. Tuples are elements of this product set.

== Type theory ==
{{main|Product type}}
In [[type theory]], commonly used in [[programming language]]s, a tuple has a [[product type]]; this fixes not only the length, but also the underlying types of each component. Formally:
: &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) : \mathsf{T}_1 \times \mathsf{T}_2 \times \ldots \times \mathsf{T}_n&lt;/math&gt;
and the [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]]s are term constructors:
: &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(x) : \mathsf{T}_1,~\pi_2(x) : \mathsf{T}_2,~\ldots,~\pi_n(x) : \mathsf{T}_n&lt;/math&gt;

The tuple with labeled elements used in the [[#Relational_model|relational model]] has a [[Record (computer science)|record type]]. Both of these types can be defined as simple extensions of the [[simply typed lambda calculus]].&lt;ref name="pierce2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Benjamin|title=Types and Programming Languages|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0-262-16209-1|pages=126–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of a tuple in type theory and that in set theory are related in the following way: If we consider the natural [[model theory|model]] of a type theory, and use the Scott brackets to indicate the semantic interpretation&lt;!-- do not link; that article needs to be a dab first--&gt;, then the model consists of some sets &lt;math&gt;S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n&lt;/math&gt; (note: the use of italics here that distinguishes sets from types) such that:
: &lt;math&gt;[\![\mathsf{T}_1]\!] = S_1,~[\![\mathsf{T}_2]\!] = S_2,~\ldots,~[\![\mathsf{T}_n]\!] = S_n&lt;/math&gt;
and the interpretation of the basic terms is:
: &lt;math&gt;[\![x_1]\!] \in [\![\mathsf{T}_1]\!],~[\![x_2]\!] \in [\![\mathsf{T}_2]\!],~\ldots,~[\![x_n]\!] \in [\![\mathsf{T}_n]\!]&lt;/math&gt;.

The {{math|''n''}}-tuple of type theory has the natural interpretation as an {{math|''n''}}-tuple of set theory:&lt;ref&gt;Steve Awodey, [http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/preprints/stcsFinal.pdf ''From sets, to types, to categories, to sets''], 2009, [[preprint]]&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\![(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)]\!] = (\,[\![x_1]\!], [\![x_2]\!], \ldots, [\![x_n]\!]\,)&lt;/math&gt;
The [[unit type]] has as semantic interpretation the 0-tuple.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42985">'''Turing's proof''' is a proof by [[Alan Turing]], first published in January 1937 with the title '''On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]'''.&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; It  was the second proof of the assertion ([[Alonzo Church]]'s proof was first) that some [[decision problem]]s are "[[undecidable problem|undecidable]]": there is no single algorithm that infallibly gives a correct "yes" or "no" answer to each instance of the problem. In his own words:
"...what I shall prove is quite different from the well-known results of Gödel ... I shall now show that there is no general method which tells whether a given formula '''U''' is provable in '''K''' [''[[Principia Mathematica]]'']..." (''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;145).

Turing preceded this proof with two others. The second and third both rely on the first. All rely on his development of type-writer-like "computing machines" that obey a simple set of rules and his subsequent development of a "universal computing machine".

==Richard's paradox==
In 1905, Jules Richard presented this profound paradox. Alan Turing's first proof constructs this paradox with his so-called computing machine and proves that this machine cannot answer a simple question: will this machine be able to determine if ''any'' computing machine (including itself) will become trapped in an unproductive "infinite loop" (i.e. it fails to continue its computation of the diagonal number).

A succinct definition of [[Richard's paradox]] is found in Whitehead and Russell's ''Principia Mathematica'':

:Richard's paradox is as follows. Consider all decimals that can be defined by means of a finite number of words; let E be the class of such decimals. Then E has [aleph-sub-zero — an infinity of] terms; hence its members can be ordered as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... Let N be a number defined as follows [Whitehead &amp; Russell now employ the [[Cantor diagonal method]]]; if the nth figure in the nth decimal is p, let the nth figure in N be p+1 (or 0, if p = 9). Then N is different from all the members of E, since, whatever finite value n may have, the nth figure in N is different from the nth figure in the nth of the decimals composing E, and therefore N is different from the nth decimal. Nevertheless, we have defined N in a finite number of words [i.e. this very word-definition just above!] and therefore N ought to be a member of E. Thus N both is and is not a member of E (''Principia Mathematica'', 2nd edition 1927, p. 61).

==Complications==
Turing's proof is complicated by a large number of definitions, and confounded with what [[Martin Davis]] called "petty technical details" and "...technical details [that] are incorrect as given" (Davis's commentary in ''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;115). Turing himself published "A correction" in 1937: "The author is indebted to [[P. Bernays]] for pointing out these errors" (''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;152).

Specifically, in its original form the third proof is badly marred by technical errors. And even after Bernays' suggestions and Turing's corrections, errors remained in the description of the [[universal machine]]. And confusingly, since Turing was unable to correct his original paper, some text within the body harks to Turing's flawed first effort.

Bernays' corrections may be found in ''Undecidable'', pp.&amp;nbsp;152–154; the original is to be found as:
:"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem. A Correction," ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'' (2), 43 (1936–37), 544-546.''

The on-line version of Turing's paper has these corrections in an addendum; however, corrections to the Universal Machine must be found in an analysis provided by [[Emil Post]].

At first, the only mathematician to pay close attention to the details of the proof was Post (cf. Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;125) — mainly because he had arrived simultaneously at a similar reduction of "algorithm" to primitive machine-like actions, so he took a personal interest in the proof. Strangely (perhaps World War II intervened) it took Post some ten years to dissect it in the ''Appendix'' to his paper ''Recursive Unsolvability of a Problem of Thue'', 1947 (reprinted in ''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;293).

''Before readers tackle "Proof #3" they are advised to place those corrections on their copy of the proof.''

Other problems present themselves: In his ''Appendix'' Post commented indirectly on the paper's difficulty and directly on its "outline nature" (Post in ''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;299) and "intuitive form" of the proofs (''ibid''.). Post had to infer various points:

:"If our critique is correct, a machine is said to be circle-free if it is a Turing computing ... machine which prints an infinite number of 0s and 1s. And the two theorems of Turing's in question are really the following. There is no Turing ... machine which, when supplied with an arbitrary positive integer n, will determine whether n is the D.N of a Turing computing ... machine that is circle-free. [Secondly], There is no Turing convention-machine which, when supplied with an arbitrary positive integer n, will determine whether n is the D.N of a Turing computing ... machine that ever prints a given symbol (0 say)" (Post in ''Undecidable'', p. 300)

Anyone who has ever tried to read the paper will understand Hodges' complaint:

:"The paper started attractively, but soon plunged (in typical Turing manner) into a thicket of obscure German Gothic type in order to develop his instruction table for the universal machine. The last people to give it a glance would be the applied mathematicians who had to resort to practical computation..." (Hodges p. 124)

==Summary of the proofs==
In his proof that the Entscheidungsproblem can have no solution, Turing proceeded from two proofs that were to lead to his final proof. His first theorem is most relevant to the [[halting problem]], the second is more relevant to [[Rice's theorem]].

'''First proof''': that no "computing machine" exists that can decide whether or not an arbitrary "computing machine" (as represented by an integer 1, 2, 3, . . .) is "circle-free" (i.e. goes on printing its number in binary ad infinitum): "...we have no general process for doing this in a finite number of steps" (p.&amp;nbsp;132, ''ibid''.). Turing's proof, although it seems to use the "diagonal process", in fact shows that his machine (called H) cannot calculate its own number, let alone the entire diagonal number ([[Cantor's diagonal argument]]): "The fallacy in the argument lies in the assumption that B [the diagonal number] is computable" (''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;132). The proof does not require much mathematics.

'''Second proof''': This one is perhaps more familiar to readers as [[Rice's theorem]]: "We can show further that ''there can be no machine E which, when supplied with the S.D ["program"] of an arbitrary machine M, will determine whether M ever prints a given symbol (0 say)''" (his italics, ''Undecidable'', p. 134).

'''Third proof''': "Corresponding to each computing machine M we construct a formula Un(M) and we show that, if there is a general method for determining whether Un(M) is provable, then there is a general method for determining whether M ever prints 0" (''Undecidable'', p. 145)

[Readers who brave Proof #3 should come equipped with a solid background in (i) logic (ii) the paper of [[Kurt Gödel]] ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems'' (reprinted in ''Undecidable'', p. 5). For assistance with Gödel's paper they should consult e.g. [[Ernest Nagel]] and [[James R. Newman]], ''Godel's Proof'', New York University Press, 1958.]

This proof requires the use of formal logic to prove a first lemma, followed by a brief word-proof of the second:
:"Lemma 1: If S1 [symbol "0"] appears on the tape in some complete configuration of M, then Un(M) is provable" (''Undecidable'', p. 147)

:"Lemma 2: [The converse] If Un(M) is provable then S1 [symbol "0"] appears on the tape in some complete configuration of M" (''Undecidable'', p. 148)

Finally, in only 64 words and symbols Turing proves by ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' that "the Hilbert Entscheidungsproblem can have no solution" (''Undecidable'', p. 145).

===Summary of the first proof===
Turing created a thicket of abbreviations; see the glossary at the end of this for help.

Some key clarifications:
:Turing's machine H is attempting to print a diagonal number of 0s and 1s
::This diagonal number is created when H actually "simulates" each "successful" machine under evaluation and prints the R-th "figure" (1 or 0) of the R-th "successful" machine
* Turing spent much of his paper actually "constructing" his machines to convince us of their truth. This was required by his use of the ''reductio ad absurdum'' form of proof.
* We must emphasize the "constructive" nature of this proof. Turing describes what could be a real machine, really buildable. The only questionable element is the existence of machine D, which this proof will eventually show to be impossible.

Turing begins the proof with the assertion of the existence of a “decision/determination” machine D. When fed any S.D (string of symbols A, C, D, L, R, N, semicolon “;”) it will determine if this S.D (symbol string) represents a "computing machine" that is either "circular" — and therefore "un-satisfactory u" —  or "circle-free" — and therefore "satisfactory s".

:Turing has previously demonstrated in his commentary that all "computing machines'' — machines that compute a number as 1s and 0s forever — can be written as an S.D on the tape of the “universal machine” U. Most of his work leading up to his first proof is spent demonstrating that a universal machine truly exists, i.e.
::There truly exists a universal machine U
::For each number N, there truly exists a unique S.D,
::Every Turing machine has an S.D
::Every S.D on U’s tape can be “run” by U and will produce the same “output” (figures 1, 0) as the original machine.

Turing makes no comment about how machine D goes about its work. For sake of argument, we suppose that D would first look to see if the string of symbols is "well-formed" (i.e. in the form of an algorithm and not just a scramble of symbols), and if not then discard it. Then it would go “circle-hunting”. To do this perhaps it would use “heuristics” (tricks: taught or learned). For purposes of the proof, these details are not important.

Turing then describes (rather loosely) the algorithm (method) to be followed by a machine he calls H. Machine H contains within it the decision-machine D (thus D is a “subroutine” of H). Machine H’s algorithm is expressed in H’s table of instructions, or perhaps in H’s Standard Description on tape and united with the universal machine U; Turing does not specify this.

:In the course of describing universal machine U, Turing has demonstrated that a machine’s S.D (string of letters similar to a “program”) can be converted to an integer (base 8) and vice versa. Any number N (in base 8) can be converted to an S.D with the following replacements: 1 by A, 2 by C, 3 by D, 4 by L, 5 by R, 6 by N, 7 by semicolon ";".

::As it turns out, machine H's unique number (D.N) is the number "K". We can infer that K is some hugely long number, maybe tens-of-thousands of digits long. But this is not important to what follows.

Machine H is responsible for converting ''any'' number N into an equivalent S.D symbol string for sub-machine D to test.  (In programming parlance: H passes an arbitrary "S.D” to D, and D returns “satisfactory” or “unsatisfactory”.) Machine H is also responsible for keeping a tally R (“Record”?) of successful numbers (we suppose that the number of “successful” S.D's, i.e. R, is much less than the number of S.D's tested, i.e. N). Finally, H prints on a section of its tape a diagonal number “beta-primed” B’. H creates this B’ by “simulating” (in the computer-sense) the “motions” of each “satisfactory” machine/number; eventually this machine/number under test will arrive at its Rth “figure” (1 or 0), and H will print it. H then is responsible for “cleaning up the mess” left by the simulation, incrementing N and proceeding onward with its tests, ''ad infinitum''.

:Note: All these machines that H is hunting for are what Turing called "computing machines". These compute binary-decimal-numbers in an endless stream of what Turing called "figures": only the symbols 1 and 0.

An example: Suppose machine H has tested 13472 numbers and produced 5 satisfactory numbers, i.e. H has converted the numbers 1 through 13472 into S.D’s (symbol strings) and passed them to D for test. As a consequence H has tallied 5 satisfactory numbers and run the first one to its 1st “figure”, the second to its  2nd figure, the third to its 3rd figure, the fourth to its 4th figure, and the fifth to its 5th figure. The count now stands at N = 13472, R = 5, and B’ = “.10011” (for example). H cleans up the mess on its tape, and proceeds:

''H'' increments ''N'' = 13473 and converts "13473" to symbol string ADRLD. If sub-machine D deems ADLRD unsatisfactory, then H leaves the tally-record R at 5. H will increment the number N to 13474 and proceed onward. On the other hand, if D deems  ADRLD satisfactory then H will increment R to 6. H will convert N (again) into ADLRD [this is just an example, ADLRD is probably useless] and “run” it using the universal machine U until this machine-under-test (U "running" ADRLD) prints its 6th “figure” i.e. 1 or 0. H will print this 6th number (e.g. “0”) in the “output” region of its tape (e.g. B’ = “.100110”).

H cleans up the mess, and then increments the number ''N'' to 13474.

The whole process unravels when H arrives at its own number K. We will proceed with our example. Suppose the successful-tally/record R stands at 12. H finally arrives at its own number minus 1, i.e. N = K-1 = 4335...321'''4''', and this number is unsuccessful. Then H increments N to produce K = 4355...321'''5''', i.e. its own number. H converts this to “LDDR...DCAR” and passes it to decision-machine D. Decision-machine D must return “satisfactory” (that is: H must ''by definition'' go on and on testing, ''ad infinitum'', because it is "circle-free"). So H now increments tally R from 12 to 13 and then re-converts the number-under-test K into its S.D and uses U to simulate it. But this means that H will be simulating its own motions. What is the first thing the simulation will do? This simulation K-aka-H either creates a new N or “resets” the “old” N to 1. This "K-aka-H" either creates a new R or “resets” the “old” R to 0. Old-H “runs” new "K-aka-H" until it arrives at its 12th figure.

But it never makes it to the 13th figure; K-aka-H eventually arrives at 4355...321'''5''', again, and ''K-aka-H'' must repeat the test. ''K-aka-H'' will never reach the 13th figure. The H-machine probably just prints copies of itself ''ad infinitum'' across blank tape. But this contradicts the premise that H is a satisfactory, non-circular computing machine that goes on printing the diagonal numbers's 1's and 0's forever. (We will see the same thing if N is reset to 1 and R is reset to 0.)

If the reader does not believe this, they can write a "stub" for decision-machine D (stub "D" will return "satisfactory") and then see for themselves what happens at the instant machine H encounters its own number.

===Summary of the second proof===
Less than one page long, the passage from premises to conclusion is obscure.

Turing proceeds by ''reductio ad absurdum''. He asserts the existence of a machine E, which when given the S.D (Standard Description, i.e. "program") of an arbitrary machine M, will determine whether M ever prints a given symbol (0 say). He does not assert that this M is a "computing machine".

Given the existence of machine E, Turing proceeds as follows:
# If machine E exists then a machine G exists that determines if M prints 0 infinitely often, AND
# If E exists then another process exits [we can call the process/machine G' for reference] that determines if M prints 1 infinitely often, THEREFORE
# When we combine G with G' we have a process that determines if M prints an infinity of figures, AND
# IF the process "G with G'" determines M prints an infinity of figures, THEN "G with G'" has determined that M is circle-free, BUT
# This process "G with G'" that determine if M is circle-free, by proof 1, cannot exist, THEREFORE
# Machine E does not exist.

===Details of second proof===
The difficulty in the proof is step 1. The reader will be helped by realizing that Turing is not explaining his subtle handiwork. (In a nutshell: he is using certain equivalencies between the “existential-“ and “universal-operators” together with their equivalent expressions written with logical operators.)

Here's an example: Suppose we see before us a parking lot full of hundreds of cars. We decide to go around the entire lot looking for: “Cars with flat (bad) tires”. After an hour or so we have found two “cars with bad tires.” We can now say with certainty that “Some cars have bad tires”. Or we could say: “It’s not true that ‘All the cars have good tires’”. Or: “It is true that: ‘not all the cars have good tires”. Let us go to another lot. Here we discover that “All the cars have good tires.” We might say, “There’s not a single instance of a car having a bad tire.”  Thus we see that, if we can say something about each car separately then we can say something about ALL of them collectively.

This is what Turing does:
From ''M'' he creates a collection of machines {''M''1, ''M''2, ''M''3, ''M''4, ..., ''Mn''} and about each he writes a sentence: “''X'' prints at least one 0” and allows only two “[[truth value]]s”, True = blank or False = :0:. One by one he determines the truth value of the sentence for each machine and makes a string of blanks or :0:, or some combination of these. We might get something like this: “''M''1 prints a 0” = True AND “''M''2 prints a 0” = True AND “''M''3 prints a 0” = True AND “''M''4 prints a 0” = False, ... AND “''Mn'' prints a 0” = False. He gets the string
:BBB:0::0::0: ... :0: ... ad infinitum
if there are an infinite number of machines ''Mn''. If on the other hand if every machine had produced a "True" then the expression on the tape would be
:BBBBB....BBBB ... ad infinitum

Thus Turing has converted statements about each machine considered separately into a single "statement" (string) about all of them. Given the machine (he calls it G) that created this expression, he can test it with his machine E and determine if it ever produces a 0. In our first example above we see that indeed it does, so we know that not all the M's in our sequence print 0s. But the second example shows that, since the string is blanks then every Mn in our sequence has produced a 0.

All that remains for Turing to do is create a process to create the sequence of Mn's from a single M.

Suppose ''M'' prints this pattern:

:''M'' =&gt; ...AB01AB0010AB…

Turing creates another machine F that takes M and crunches out a sequence of Mn's that successively convert the first n 0's to “0-bar” ('''0'''):
:M1 = ...AB'''0'''1AB0010AB...
:M2 = ...AB'''0'''1AB'''0'''010AB...
:M3 = ...AB'''0'''1AB'''00'''10AB...
:M4 = ...AB'''0'''1AB'''00'''1'''0'''AB...
He claims, without showing details, that this machine F is truly build-able. We can see that one of a couple things could happen. F may run out of machines that have 0's, or it may have to go on ''ad infinitum'' creating machines to “cancel the zeros”.

Turing now combines machines E and F into a composite machine G. G starts with the original M, then uses F to create all the successor-machines M1, M2,. . ., Mn. Then G uses E to test each machine starting with M. If E detects that a machine never prints a zero, G prints :0: for that machine. If E detects that a machine does print a 0 (we assume, Turing doesn’t say) then G prints :: or just skips this entry, leaving the squares blank. We can see that a couple things can happen.
:G will print no 0’s, ever, if all the Mn’s print 0’s, OR,
:G will print ad infinitum 0’s if all the M’s print no 0’s, OR,
:G will print 0’s for a while and then stop.

Now, what happens when we apply E to G itself?
:If E(G) determines that G never prints a 0 then we know that all the Mn’s have printed 0’s. And this means that, because all the Mn came from M, that M itself prints 0’s ''ad infinitum'', OR
:If E(G) determines that G does print a 0 then we know that not all the Mn’s print 0’s; therefore M does not print 0’s ''ad infinitum''.

As we can apply the same process for determining if M prints 1 infinitely often. When we combine these processes, we can determine that M does, or does not, go on printing 1's and 0's ''ad infinitum''. Thus we have a method for determining if M is circle-free. By Proof 1 this is impossible. So the first assertion that E exists, is wrong: E does not exist.

===Summary of the third proof===
Here Turing proves "that the [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] [[Entscheidungsproblem]] can have no solution" (''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;145). Here he
:“…show(s) that there can be no general process for determining whether a given formula U of the functional calculus K is provable.” (''ibid''.)

* Both Lemmas #1 and #2 are required to form the necessary "IF AND ONLY IF" (i.e. [[logical equivalence]]) required by the proof:

:"A set E is computably decidable if and only if both E and its complement are computably enumerable" (Frankél, p. 67)

;Summary of the proof

Turing demonstrates the existence of a formula '''Un'''(M) which says, in effect, that "in some complete configuration of M, '''0''' appears on the tape" (p.&amp;nbsp;146). This formula is TRUE, that is, it is "constructible", and he shows how to go about this.

Then Turing proves two Lemmas, the first requiring all the hard work. (The second is the converse of the first.) Then he uses ''reductio ad absurdum'' to prove his final result:

# There exists a formula '''Un'''(M). This formula is TRUE, AND
# If the ''Entscheidungsproblem'' can be solved THEN a mechanical process exists for determining whether '''Un'''(M) is ''provable'' (derivable), AND
# By Lemmas 1 and 2: '''Un'''(M) is ''provable'' IF AND ONLY IF '''0''' appears in some "complete configuration" of M, AND
# IF '''0''' appears in some "complete configuration" of M THEN a mechanical process exists that will determine whether arbitrary M ever prints '''0''', AND
# By Proof 2 no mechanical process exists that will determine whether arbitrary M ever prints '''0''', THEREFORE
# '''Un'''(M) is not '''provable''' (it is TRUE, but not ''provable'') which means that the ''Entscheidungsproblem'' is unsolvable.

;Discussion of the third proof

''If readers intend to study the proof in detail they should correct their copies of the pages of the third proof with the corrections that Turing supplied''.

To (even attempt to) follow the technical details, the reader will need to understand the definition of "provable" and be aware of important "clues".

"Provable" means, in the sense of Gödel, that (i) the axiom system itself is powerful enough to produce (express) the sentence "This sentence is provable", and (ii) that in any arbitrary "well-formed" proof the symbols lead by axioms, definitions, and substitution to the symbols of the conclusion.

First clue: "Let us put the description of M into the first standard form of §6". Section 6 describes the very specific "encoding" of machine M on the tape of a "universal machine" U. This requires the reader to know some idiosyncrasies of Turing's universal machine U and the encoding scheme.

(i) The universal machine is a set of "universal" instructions that reside in an "instruction table". Separate from this, on U's tape, a "computing machine" M will reside as "M-code". The universal table of instructions can print on the tape the symbols '''A, C, D, 0, 1, u, v, w, x, y, z, :''' . The various machines M can print these symbols only indirectly by commanding U to print them.

(ii) The "machine code" of M consists of only a few letters and the semicolon, i.e. '''D, C, A, R, L, N, ;''' . Nowhere within the "code" of M will the numerical "figures" (symbols) '''1''' and '''0''' ever appear. If M wants U to print a symbol from the collection '''blank, 0,  1''' then it uses one of the following codes to tell U to print them. To make things more confusing, Turing calls these symbols S0, S1, and S2, i.e.
:'''blank''' = S0 = '''D'''
:'''0''' = S1 = '''DC'''
:'''1''' = S2 = '''DCC'''

(iii) A "computing machine", whether it is built directly into a table (as his first examples show), or as machine-code M on universal-machine U's tape, prints its number on blank tape (to the right of M-code, if there is one) as '''1'''s and '''0'''s forever proceeding to the right.

(iv) If a "computing machine" is U+"M-code", then "M-code" appears first on the tape; the tape has a left end and the "M-code" starts there and proceeds to the right on alternate squares. When the M-code comes to an end (and it must, because of the assumption that these M-codes are finite algorithms), the "figures" will begin as '''1'''s and '''0'''s on alternate squares, proceeding to the right forever. Turing uses the (blank) alternate squares (called "E"- "eraseable"- squares) to help U+"M-code" keep track of where the calculations are, both in the M-code and in the "figures" that the machine is printing.

(v) A "complete configuration" is a printing of all symbols on the tape, including M-code [?] and "figures" up to that point, together with the figure currently being scanned (with a pointer-character printed to the left of the scanned symbol ?). If we have interpreted Turing's meaning correctly, this will be a hugely long set of symbols. But whether the entire M-code must be repeated is unclear; only a printing of the current M-code instruction is necessary plus the printing of all figures with a figure-marker).

(vi) Turing reduced the vast possible number of instructions in "M-code" (again: the code of M to appear on the tape) to a small canonical set, one of three similar to this: {qi Sj Sk R ql} e.g. ''If machine is executing instruction #qi and symbol Sj is on the square being scanned, then Print symbol Sk and go Right and then go to instruction ql'': The other instructions are similar, encoding for "Left" L and "No motion" N. It is this set that is encoded by the string of symbols qi = DA...A, Sj = DC...C, Sk = DC...C, R, ql = DA....A. Each instruction is separated from another one by the semicolon. For example, {q5, S1 S0 L q3} means: Instruction #5: If scanned symbol is '''0''' then print '''blank''', go Left, then go to instruction #3. It is encoded as follows
: ; D A A A A A D C D L D A A A

Second clue: Turing is using ideas introduced in Gödel's paper, that is, the "Gödelization" of (at least part of) the formula for '''Un'''(M). This clue appears only as a footnote on page 138 (''Undecidable''): "A sequence of r primes is denoted by [[Exponentiation|^]](r)" (''ibid''.) [Here, r inside parentheses is "raised".] This "sequence of primes" appears in a formula called F^(n).

Third clue: This reinforces the second clue. Turing's original attempt at the proof uses the expression
:(Eu)N(u) &amp; (x)( ... etc. ...) (''Undecidable'', p. 146)
Earlier in the paper Turing had previously used this expression (p.&amp;nbsp;138) and defined N(u) to mean "u is a non-negative integer" (''ibid''.) (i.e. a Gödel number). But, with the Bernays corrections, Turing abandoned this approach (i.e. the use of N(u)) and the only place where "the Gödel number" appears explicitly is where he uses F^(n).

What does this mean for the proof? The first clue means that a simple examination of the M-code on the tape will not reveal if a symbol '''0''' is ever printed by U+"M-code". A testing-machine might look for the appearance of '''DC''' in one of the strings of symbols that represent an instruction. But will this instruction ever be "executed?" Something has to "run the code" to find out. This something can be a machine, or it can be lines in a formal proof, i.e. Lemma #1.

The second and third clues mean that, as its foundation is Gödel's paper,  the proof is difficult.

===Details of the third proof===
* In the example below we will actually construct a simple "theorem"—a little [[Post–Turing machine]] program "run it". We will see just how mechanical a properly designed theorem can be. A proof, we will see, is just that, a "test" of the theorem that we do by inserting a "proof example" into the beginning and see what pops out at the end.
* Both Lemmas #1 and #2 are required to form the necessary "IF AND ONLY IF" (i.e. logical equivalence) required by the proof:

:"A set E is computably decidable if and only if both E and its complement are computably enumerable" (Frankél, p. 67)

* To quote Frankel:
:"A sentence A is said to be decidable in a [[formal system]] S if either A or its negation is provable in S" (Frankél, p. 65)

Frankel has defined "provable" earlier in his book:
:"A formal system is a system of ''axioms'' (expressed in some formally defined language) and ''rules of reasoning'' (also called inference rules), used to derive the ''theorems'' of the system. A ''theorem'' is any statement in the language of the system obtainable by a series of applications of the rules of reasoning, starting from the axioms. A ''proof'' is a finite sequence of such applications, leading to a theorem as its conclusion" (ibid p. 17).

Thus a "sentence" is a string of symbols, and a theorem is a string of strings of symbols.

Turing is confronted with the following tasks:
* to convert a [[Universal Turing machine]] "program", and the numerical symbols on the tape (Turing's "figures", symbols "1" and "0"), into a "theorem"—that is, a (monstrously long) ''string of sentences'' that define the successive actions of the machine, (all) the figures of the tape, and the location of the "tape head".

Thus the "string of sentences" will be strings of strings of symbols. The only allowed individual symbols will come from Godel's symbols defined in his paper.(In the following example we use the "&lt;" and "&gt;" around a "figure" to indicate that the "figure" is the symbol being scanned by the machine).

===An example of what "complete configuration" means===
In the following, we have to remind ourselves that every one of Turing's “computing machines” is a binary-number generator/creator that begins work on “blank tape”. Properly constructed, it always cranks away ad infinitum, but its instructions are always finite. In Turing's proofs, Turing's tape had a “left end” but extended right ad infinitum. For sake of example below we will assume that the “machine” is not a Universal machine, but rather the simpler “dedicated machine” with the instructions in the Table.

Our example is based on a ''modified'' [[Post–Turing machine]] model of a Turing Machine. This model prints only the symbols 0 and 1. The blank tape is considered to be all b's. Our modified model requires us to add two more instructions to the 7 Post–Turing instructions. The abbreviations that we will use are:
: R, RIGHT: look to the right and move tape to left, or move tape head right
: L, LEFT : look to the left and to move tape right, or move tape head left
: E, ERASE scanned square (e.g. make square blank)
: P0,: PRINT 0 in scanned square
: P1,: PRINT 1 in scanned square
: Jb_n, JUMP-IF-blank-to-instruction_#n,
: J0_n, JUMP-IF-0-to-instruction_#n,
: J1_n, JUMP-IF-1-to-instrucntion_#n,
: HALT.
In the cases of R, L, E, P0, and P1 after doing its task the machine continues on to the next instruction in numerical sequence; ditto for the jumps if their tests fail.

But, for brevity, our examples will only use three squares. And these will always start as there blanks with the scanned square on the left: i.e. bbb. With two symbols 1, 0 and blank we can have 27 distinct configurations:

: bbb, bb0, bb1, b0b, b00, b01, b1b, b10, b11, 0bb, 0b0, 0b1, 00b, 000, 001, 01b, 010, 011, 1bb, 1b0, 1b1, 10b, 100, 101, 11b, 110, 111

We must be careful here, because it is quite possible that an algorithm will (temporarily) leave blanks in between figures, then come back and fill something in. More likely, an algorithm may do this intentionally. In fact, Turing's machine does this—it prints on alternate squares, leaving blanks between figures so it can print locator symbols.

Turing always left alternate squares blank so his machine could place a symbol to the left of a figure (or a letter if the machine is the universal machine and the scanned square is actually in the “program”). In our little example we will forego this and just put symbols ( ) around the scanned symbol, as follows:

: b(b)0 this means, “Tape is blanks-to-the-left of left blank but left blank is “in play”, the scanned-square-is-blank, “0”, blanks-to-right”
: 1(0)1 this means, “Tape is blanks-to-the-left, then 1, scanned square is “0”

Let us write a simple program:
: start: P1, R, P1, R, P1, H

Remember that we always start with blank tape. The complete configuration prints the symbols on the tape followed by the next instruction:
: start config: (b) P1,
: config #1: (1) R,
: config #2: 1(b) P1,
: config #3: 1(1) R,
: config #4: 11(b) P1,
: config #5: 11(1) H

Let us add “jump” into the formula. When we do this we discover why the complete configuration must include the tape symbols. (Actually, we see this better, below.) This little program prints three “1”s to the right, reverses direction and moves left printing 0’s until it hits a blank. We will print all the symbols that our machine uses:
: start: P1, R, P1, R, P1, P0, L, J1_7, H
: (b)bb P1,
: (1)bb R,
: 1(b)b P1,
: 1(1)b R,
: 11(b) P1,
: 11(1) P0,
: 11(0) L,
: 1(1)0 J1_7
: 1(1)0 L
: (1)10 J0_7
: (1)10 L
: (b)110 J0_7
: (b)110 H
Here at the end we find that a blank on the left has “come into play” so we leave it as part of the total configuration.

Given that we have done our job correctly, we add the starting conditions and see “where the theorem goes”. The resulting configuration—the number 110—is the PROOF.

* Turing's first task had to write a generalized expression using logic symbols to express exactly what his Un(M) would do.
* Turing's second task is to "Godelize" this hugely long string-of-string-of-symbols using Godel's technique of assigning primes to the symbols and raising the primes to prime-powers, per Godel's method.

2 '''M''' — a machine with a finite instruction table and a scanning/printing head. M moves an infinite tape divided into squares each “capable of bearing a symbol”. The machine-instructions are only the following: move one square left, move one square right, on the scanned square print symbol p, erase the scanned square, if the symbol is p then do instruction aaa, if the scanned symbol is not p then do instruction aaa, if the scanned symbol is none then do instruction aaa, if the scanned symbol is any do instruction aaa [where “aaa” is an instruction-identifier].

12 '''D.N''' — Description Number: an S.D converted to a number: 1=A, 2=C, 3 =D, 4=L, 5=R, 6=N, 7=;

13 '''M(n)''' — a machine whose D.N is number “n”

14 '''satisfactory''' — a S.D or D.N that represents a circle-free machine

15 '''U''' — a machine equipped with a “universal” table of instructions. If U is “supplied with a tape on the beginning of which is written the S.D of some computing machine M, U will compute the same sequence as M.”

16 '''β’'''—“beta-primed”: A so-called “diagonal number” made up of the n-th figure (i.e. 0 or 1) of the n-th computable sequence [also: the computable number of H, see below]

17 '''u''' — an unsatisfactory, i.e. circular, S.D

18 '''s''' — satisfactory, i.e. circle-free S.D

19 '''D''' — a machine contained in H (see below). When supplied with the S.D of any computing machine M, D will test M's S.D and if circular mark it with “u” and if circle-free mark it with “s”

20 '''H''' — a computing machine. H computes B’, maintains R and N. H contains D and U and an unspecified machine (or process) that maintains N and R and provides D with the equivalent S.D of N. E also computes the figures of B’ and assembles the figures of B’.

21 '''R''' — a record, or tally, of the quantity of successful (circle-free) S.D tested by D

22 '''N''' — a number, starting with 1, to be converted into an S.D by machine E. E maintains N.

23 '''K''' — a number. The D.N of H.

;Required for Proof #3

5 '''m-configuration''' — the instruction-identifier, either a symbol in the instruction table, or a string of symbols representing the instruction's number on the tape of the universal machine (e.g. "DAAAAA = instruction #5"). In Turing's S.D the m-configuration appears twice in each instruction, the left-most string is the "current instruction"; the right-most string is the next instruction.

24 '''complete configuration''' — the number (figure '''1''' or '''0''') of the scanned square, the complete sequence of all symbols on the tape, and the m-configuration (the instruction-identifier, either a symbol or a string of symbols representing a number, e.g. "instruction DAAAA = #5")

25 '''RSi(x, y)''' — "in the complete configuration x of M the symbol on square y is Si. "complete configuration" is definition #5,

26 '''I(x, y)''' — "in the complete configuration x of M the square y is scanned"

27 '''Kqm(x)''' — "in the complete configuration x of M the machine-configuration (instruction number) is qm"

28 '''F(x,y)''' — "y is the ''immediate'' successor of x" (follows Gödel's use of "f" as the successor-function).

29 '''G(x,y)''' — "x precedes y", not necessarily immediately

30 '''Inst{qi, Sj Sk L ql}''' is an abbreviation, as are Inst{qi, Sj Sk R ql}, and Inst{qi, Sj Sk N ql}. See below.

Turing reduces his instruction set to three “canonical forms” – one for Left, Right, and No-movement. Si and Sk are symbols on the tape.
: 		tape				Final
: m-config	Symbol	Operations	m-config
:  qi		Si		PSk, L		qm
:  qi		Si		PSk, R		qm
:  qi		Si		PSk, N		qm
For example, the operations in the first line are PSk = PRINT symbol Sk from the collection '''A, C, D, 0, 1, u, v, w, x, y, z, :''', then move tape LEFT.

These he further abbreviated as:
(N1)	qi Sj Sk L qm
(N2)	qi Sj Sk R qm
(N3)	qi Sj Sk N qm

In Proof #3 he calls the first of these “Inst{qi Sj Sk L ql}”, and he shows how to write the entire machine S.D  as the logical conjunction (logical OR): this string is called “Des(M)”, as in “Description-of-M”.
i.e. if the machine prints 0 then 1's and 0's on alternate squares to the right ad infinitum it might have the table (a similar example appears on page 119):
: q1, blank, P0, R, q2
: q2, blank, P-blank, R, q3
: q3, blank, P1, R, q4
: q4, blank, P-blank, R, q1
(This has been reduced to canonical form with the “p-blank” instructions so it differs a bit from Turing's example.)
If put them into the “ Inst( ) form” the instructions will be the following (remembering: S0 is blank, S1 = 0, S2 = 1):
: Inst {q1 S0 S1 R q2}
: Inst {q2 S0 S0 R q3}
: Inst {q3 S0 S2 R q4}
: Inst {q4 S0 S0 R q1}
The reduction to the Standard Description (S.D) will be:
: ; D A D D C R D A A ; D A A D D R D A A A ; D A A A D D C C R D A A A A ; D A A A A D D R D A ;
This agrees with his example in the book (there will be a blank between each letter and number). Universal machine U uses the alternate blank squares as places to put "pointers".

There have been several attempts in history to reach a '''unified theory of mathematics'''. Some of the greatest [[mathematician]]s have expressed views that the whole subject should be fitted into one theory.

==Historical perspective==

The process of unification might be seen as helping to define what constitutes mathematics as a discipline.

For example, [[mechanics]] and [[mathematical analysis]] were commonly combined into one subject during the 18th century, united by the [[differential equation]] concept; while [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] were considered largely distinct. Now we consider analysis, algebra, and geometry, but not mechanics, as parts of mathematics because they are primarily deductive [[formal science]]s, while mechanics like [[physics]] must proceed from observation. There is no major loss of content, with [[analytical mechanics]] in the old sense now expressed in terms of [[symplectic topology]], based on the newer theory of [[manifold]]s.

==Mathematical theories==

The term ''theory'' is used informally within mathematics to mean a self-consistent body of [[definition]]s, [[axiom]]s, [[theorem]]s, examples, and so on. (Examples include [[group theory]], [[Galois theory]], [[control theory]], and [[K-theory]].) In particular there is no connotation of ''hypothetical''. Thus the term ''unifying theory'' is more like a [[sociological]] term used to study the actions of mathematicians. It may assume nothing conjectural that would be analogous to an undiscovered scientific link. There is really no cognate within mathematics to such concepts as ''[[Proto-World language|Proto-World]]'' in [[linguistics]] or the [[Gaia hypothesis]].

Nonetheless there have been several episodes within the history of mathematics in which sets of individual theorems were found to be special cases of a single unifying result, or in which a single perspective about how to proceed when developing an area of mathematics could be applied fruitfully to multiple branches of the subject.

==Geometrical theories==

A well-known example was the development of [[analytic geometry]], which in the hands of mathematicians such as [[Descartes]] and [[Fermat]] showed that many theorems about [[curve]]s and [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s of special types could be stated in algebraic language (then new), each of which could then be proved using the same techniques. That is, the theorems were very similar algebraically, even if the geometrical interpretations were distinct.

In 1859 [[Arthur Cayley]] initiated a unification of [[metric geometry|metric geometries]] through use of the [[Cayley-Klein metric]]s. Later [[Felix Klein]] used such metrics to provide a foundation for [[non-Euclidean geometry]].

In 1872, Felix Klein noted that the many branches of geometry which had been developed during the 19th century ([[affine geometry]], [[projective geometry]], [[hyperbolic geometry]], etc.) could all be treated in a uniform way. He did this by considering the [[group theory|group]]s under which the geometric objects were invariant. This unification of geometry goes by the name of the [[Erlangen programme]].

==Through-axiomatisation==

Early in the 20th century, many parts of mathematics began to be treated by delineating useful sets of axioms and then studying their consequences. Thus, for example, the studies of "[[hypercomplex number]]s", such as considered by the [[Quaternion Society]], were put onto an axiomatic footing as branches of [[ring theory]] (in this case, with the specific meaning of [[associative algebra]]s over the field of complex numbers.) In this context, the [[quotient ring]] concept is one of the most powerful unifiers.

This was a general change of methodology, since the needs of applications had up until then meant that much of mathematics was taught by means of [[algorithm]]s (or processes close to being algorithmic). [[Arithmetic]] is still taught that way. It was a parallel to the development of [[mathematical logic]] as a stand-alone branch of mathematics. By the 1930s [[symbolic logic]] itself was adequately included within mathematics.

In most cases, mathematical objects under study can be defined (albeit non-canonically) as sets or, more informally, as sets with additional structure such as an addition operation. [[Set theory]] now serves as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' for the development of mathematical themes.

==Bourbaki==

The cause of axiomatic development was taken up in earnest by the [[Bourbaki group]] of mathematicians. Taken to its extreme, this attitude was thought to demand mathematics developed in its greatest generality. One started from the most general axioms, and then specialized, for example, by introducing [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over [[commutative ring]]s, and limiting to [[vector space]]s over the [[real number]]s only when absolutely necessary. The story proceeded in this fashion, even when the specializations were the theorems of primary interest.

In particular, this perspective placed little value on fields of mathematics (such as [[combinatorics]]) whose objects of study are very often special, or found in situations which can only superficially be related to more axiomatic branches of the subject.

==Category theory as a rival==

[[Category theory]] is a unifying theory of mathematics that was initially developed in the second half of the 20th century. In this respect it is an alternative and complement to set theory. A key theme from the "categorical" point of view is that mathematics requires not only certain kinds of objects ([[Lie group]]s, [[Banach space]]s, etc.) but also mappings between them that preserve their structure.

In particular, this clarifies exactly what it means for mathematical objects to be considered to be ''the same''. (For example, are all equilateral triangles ''the same'', or does size matter?) [[Saunders Mac Lane]] proposed that any concept with enough 'ubiquity' (occurring in various branches of mathematics) deserved isolating and studying in its own right. Category theory is arguably better adapted to that end than any other current approach. The disadvantages of relying on so-called ''[[abstract nonsense]]'' are a certain blandness and abstraction in the sense of breaking away from the roots in concrete problems. Nevertheless, the methods of category theory have steadily advanced in acceptance, in numerous areas (from [[D-module]]s to [[categorical logic]]).

==Uniting theories==

On a less grandiose scale, there are frequent instances in which it appears that sets of results in two different branches of mathematics are similar, and one might ask whether there is a unifying framework which clarifies the connections. We have already noted the example of analytic geometry, and more generally the field of [[algebraic geometry]] thoroughly develops the connections between geometric objects ([[algebraic varieties]], or more generally [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]s) and algebraic ones ([[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s); the touchstone result here is [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]] which roughly speaking shows that there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the two types of objects.

One may view other theorems in the same light. For example, the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]] asserts that there is a one-to-one correspondence between extensions of a field and subgroups of the field's [[Galois group]]. The [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]] for elliptic curves (now proven) establishes a one-to-one correspondence between curves defined as [[modular forms]] and [[elliptic curve]]s defined over the [[rational number]]s. A research area sometimes nicknamed [[Monstrous Moonshine]] developed connections between modular forms and the finite simple group known as the [[Monster group|Monster]], starting solely with the surprise observation that in each of them  the rather unusual number 196884 would arise very naturally. Another field, known as the [[Langlands program]], likewise starts with apparently haphazard similarities (in this case, between number-theoretical results and representations of certain groups) and looks for constructions from which both sets of results would be corollaries.

==Reference list of major unifying concepts==

A short list of these theories might include:

}}

==Recent developments in relation with modular theory==

A well-known example is the [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]], now the [[modularity theorem]], which proposed that each [[elliptic curve]] over the rational numbers can be translated into a [[modular form]] (in such a way as to preserve the associated [[L-function]]). There are difficulties in identifying this with an isomorphism, in any strict sense of the word. Certain curves had been known to be both elliptic curves (of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] 1) and [[modular curve]]s, before the conjecture was formulated (about 1955). The surprising part of the conjecture was the extension to factors of [[Jacobian variety|Jacobian]]s of modular curves of genus &gt; 1. It had probably not seemed plausible that there would be 'enough' such rational factors, before the conjecture was enunciated; and in fact the numerical evidence was slight until around 1970, when tables began to confirm it. The case of elliptic curves with [[complex multiplication]] was proved by Shimura in 1964. This conjecture stood for decades before being proved in generality.

In fact the [[Langlands program]] (or philosophy) is much more like a web of unifying conjectures; it really does postulate that the general theory of [[automorphic form]]s is regulated by the [[Langlands dual group|L-group]]s introduced by [[Robert Langlands]]. His ''principle of functoriality'' with respect to the L-group has a very large explanatory value with respect to known types of ''lifting'' of automorphic forms (now more broadly studied as [[automorphic representation]]s). While this theory is in one sense closely linked with the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, it should be understood that the conjecture actually operates in the opposite direction. It requires the existence of an automorphic form, starting with an object that (very abstractly) lies in a category of [[motive (mathematics)|motives]].

Another significant related point is that the Langlands approach stands apart from the whole development triggered by [[monstrous moonshine]] (connections between [[elliptic modular function]]s as [[Fourier series]], and the [[group representation]]s of the [[Monster group]] and other [[sporadic group]]s). The Langlands philosophy neither foreshadowed nor was able to include this line of research.

==Isomorphism conjectures in K-theory==

Another case, which so far is less well-developed but covers a wide range of mathematics, is the conjectural basis of some parts of [[K-theory]]. The [[Baum–Connes conjecture]], now a long-standing problem, has been joined by others in a group known as the [[isomorphism conjectures in K-theory]]. These include the [[Farrell–Jones conjecture]] and [[Bost conjecture]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12625">In [[mathematics]], '''point-free geometry''' is a [[geometry]] whose primitive [[ontology|ontological]] notion is ''region'' rather than [[point (geometry)|point]]. Two [[axiomatic system]]s are set out below, one grounded in [[mereology]], the other in [[mereotopology]] and known as ''connection theory''. A point can mark a space or objects.

==Motivation==
Point-free geometry was first formulated in [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] (1919, 1920), not as a theory of [[geometry]] or of [[spacetime]], but of "events" and of an "extension relation" between events. Whitehead's purposes were as much philosophical as scientific and mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;See Kneebone (1963), chpt. 13.5, for a gentle introduction to Whitehead's theory. Also see Lucas (2000), chpt. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead did not set out his theories in a manner that would satisfy present-day canons of formality. The two formal [[first order theory|first order theories]] described in this entry were devised by others in order to clarify and refine Whitehead's theories. The [[domain of discourse|domain]] for both theories consists of "regions." All unquantified variables in this entry should be taken as tacitly [[Quantification (logic)|universally quantified]]; hence all axioms should be taken as universal closures. No axiom requires more than three quantified variables; hence a translation of first order theories into [[relation algebra]] is possible. Each set of axioms has but four [[existential quantifier]]s.

==Inclusion-based point-free geometry ([[mereology]])==
The axioms '''G1-G7''' are, but for numbering, those of Def. 2.1 in Gerla and Miranda (2008) (see also Gerla (1995)). The identifiers of the form '''WPn''', included in the verbal description of each axiom, refer to the corresponding axiom in Simons (1987: 83).

The fundamental primitive [[binary relation]] is ''Inclusion'', denoted by [[infix]] "&amp;le;". (''Inclusion'' corresponds to the binary ''Parthood'' relation that is a standard feature of all mereological theories.) The intuitive meaning of ''x''&amp;le;''y'' is "''x'' is part of ''y''." Assuming that [[identity function|identity]], denoted by infix "=", is part of the background logic, the [[binary relation]] ''Proper Part'', denoted by infix "&lt;", is defined as:

&lt;math&gt; x&lt;y \leftrightarrow (x\le y \and x \not = y).&lt;/math&gt;

The axioms are:
*Inclusion [[partial order|partially orders]] the [[domain of discourse|domain]].
:'''G1.'''  &lt;math&gt;x\le x.&lt;/math&gt;      ([[reflexive relation|reflexive]])
:'''G2.''' &lt;math&gt;(x\le z \and z\le y) \rightarrow x\le y.&lt;/math&gt;   ([[transitive relation|transitive]]) '''WP4'''.
:'''G3.''' &lt;math&gt;(x\le y \and  y\le x) \rightarrow x = y.&lt;/math&gt;   ([[antisymmetric relation|anti-symmetric]])

*Given any two regions, there exists a region that includes both of them. '''WP6'''.
:'''G4.''' &lt;math&gt;\exists z[x\le z\and y\le z].&lt;/math&gt;

*Proper Part [[dense order|densely orders]] the [[domain of discourse|domain]]. '''WP5'''.
:'''G5.''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;y\rightarrow\exists z [x&lt;z&lt;y].&lt;/math&gt;

*Both [[atomic (order theory)|atomic regions]] and a [[mereology|universal region]] do not exist. Hence the [[domain of discourse|domain]] has neither an upper nor a lower bound. '''WP2'''.
:'''G6.''' &lt;math&gt;\exists yz[y&lt;x \and x&lt;z].&lt;/math&gt;

* Proper Parts Principle. If all the proper parts of ''x'' are proper parts of ''y'', then ''x'' is included in ''y''. '''WP3'''. 
:'''G7.''' &lt;math&gt;\forall z[z&lt;x \rightarrow z&lt;y] \rightarrow x\le y.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[model theory|model]] of '''G1–G7''' is an ''inclusion space''.

'''Definition''' (Gerla and Miranda 2008: Def. 4.1). Given some inclusion space, an '''abstractive class''' is a class ''G'' of regions such that ''G'' is [[total order|totally ordered]] by Inclusion. Moreover, there does not exist a region included in all of the regions included in ''G''.

Intuitively, an abstractive class defines a geometrical entity whose dimensionality is less than that of the inclusion space. For example, if the inclusion space is the [[Euclidean plane]], then the corresponding abstractive classes are [[point (geometry)|point]]s and [[line (geometry)|line]]s.

Inclusion-based point-free geometry (henceforth "point-free geometry") is essentially an axiomatization of Simons's (1987: 83) system '''W.''' In turn, '''W''' formalizes a theory in Whitehead (1919) whose axioms are not made explicit. Point-free geometry is '''W''' with this defect repaired. Simons (1987) did not repair this defect, instead proposing in a footnote that the reader do so as an exercise. The primitive relation of '''W''' is Proper Part, a [[strict partial order]]. The theory&lt;ref&gt;Kneebone (1963), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; of Whitehead (1919) has a single primitive binary relation ''K'' defined as ''xKy'' &amp;harr; ''y''&lt;''x''. Hence ''K'' is the [[converse relation|converse]] of Proper Part. Simons's '''WP1''' asserts that Proper Part is [[irreflexive]] and so corresponds to '''G1'''. '''G3''' establishes that inclusion, unlike Proper Part, is [[Antisymmetric relation|anti-symmetric]].

Point-free geometry is closely related to a [[List of first-order theories|dense linear order]] '''D''', whose axioms are '''G1-3''', '''G5''', and the totality axiom &lt;math&gt; x \le y \or y \le x.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Stoll, R. R., 1963. ''Set Theory and Logic''. Dover reprint, 1979. P. 423.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence inclusion-based point-free geometry would be a proper extension of '''D''' (namely '''D'''&amp;cup;{'''G4''', '''G6''', '''G7'''}), were it not that the '''D''' relation "&amp;le;" is a [[total order]].

==Connection theory==
In his 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]]'', [[A. N. Whitehead]] proposed a different approach, one inspired by De Laguna (1922). Whitehead took as primitive the [[topological]] notion of "contact" between two regions, resulting in a primitive "connection relation" between events. Connection theory '''C''' is a [[first order theory]] that distills the first 12 of the 31 assumptions in chpt. 2 of ''[[Process and Reality]]'' into 6 axioms, '''C1-C6'''. '''C''' is a proper fragment of the theories proposed in Clarke (1981), who noted their [[mereology|mereological]] character. Theories that, like '''C''', feature both inclusion and [[topology|topological]] primitives, are called [[mereotopology|mereotopologies]].

'''C''' has one primitive [[relation (mathematics)|relation]], binary "connection," denoted by the [[prefix]]ed [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate letter]] ''C''. That ''x'' is included in ''y'' can now be defined as ''x''&amp;le;''y'' &amp;harr; &amp;forall;z[''Czx''&amp;rarr;''Czy'']. Unlike the case with inclusion spaces, connection theory enables defining "non-tangential" inclusion,&lt;ref&gt;Presumably this is Casati and Varzi's (1999) "Internal Part" predicate, IP''xy'' &amp;harr; (x&amp;le;y)&amp;and;(C''zx''&amp;rarr;&amp;exist;''v''[''v''&amp;le;''z'' &amp;and; ''v''&amp;le;''y'']. This definition combines their (4.8) and (3.1).&lt;/ref&gt; a total order that enables the construction of abstractive classes. Gerla and Miranda (2008) argue that only thus can mereotopology unambiguously define a [[Point (geometry)|point]].

The axioms '''C1-C6''' below are, but for numbering, those of Def. 3.1 in Gerla and Miranda (2008).

*''C'' is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]. '''C.1.'''
:'''C1. '''&lt;math&gt; \ Cxx.&lt;/math&gt;

*''C'' is [[symmetric]]. '''C.2.'''
:'''C2.'''  &lt;math&gt;Cxy\rightarrow Cyx.&lt;/math&gt;

*''C'' is [[extensionality|extensional]]. '''C.11.'''
:'''C3.'''   &lt;math&gt;\forall z[Czx \leftrightarrow Czy] \rightarrow x = y.&lt;/math&gt;

* All regions have proper parts, so that '''C''' is an [[atomic (order theory)|atomless]] theory. '''P.9.'''
:'''C4.'''    &lt;math&gt;\exists y[y&lt;x].&lt;/math&gt;

*Given any two regions, there is a region connected to both of them.
:'''C5.'''   &lt;math&gt;\exists z[Czx\and Czy].&lt;/math&gt;

*All regions have at least two unconnected parts. '''C.14.'''
:'''C6.'''   &lt;math&gt;\exists yz[(y\le x)\and (z\le x)\and\neg Cyz].&lt;/math&gt;

A model of '''C''' is a ''connection space''.

Following the verbal description of each axiom is the identifier of the corresponding axiom in Casati and Varzi (1999). Their system '''SMT''' (''strong mereotopology'') consists of '''C1-C3''', and is essentially due to Clarke (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Grzegorczyk (1960) proposed a similar theory, whose motivation was primarily [[topology|topological]].&lt;/ref&gt; Any [[mereotopology]] can be made [[atomic (order theory)|atomless]] by invoking '''C4''', without risking paradox or triviality. Hence '''C''' extends the atomless variant of '''SMT''' by means of the axioms '''C5''' and '''C6''', suggested by chpt. 2 of ''[[Process and Reality]]''. For an advanced and detailed discussion of systems related to '''C''', see Roeper (1997).

Biacino and Gerla (1991) showed that every [[model theory|model]] of Clarke's theory is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], and models of such algebras cannot distinguish connection from overlap. It is doubtful whether either fact is faithful to Whitehead's intent.

'''Wilhelm Winkler''' (June 29, 1884 – September 3, 1984) had successful careers as both an academic [[statistician]] (despite receiving no formal academic training in the field), and a program director in the Austrian government.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Wilhelm was the fifth&lt;ref name="Pinw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinwinkler|first1=Alexander|editor1-last=Heyde|editor1-first=C.

J.|last2=Robertson|first2=E. F.|title=Winkler biography|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Winkler.html|publisher=MacTutor Biographies|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended law school at Karl Friedrich University (now [[Charles University]]) in Prague, practiced law briefly in 1908, did a stint in the Austrian army, then settled into a position at the Statistical Bureau of Bohemia&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt; as the sole German-speaking statistician.&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; While working there, he attended many university classes and reached the conclusion that "the German statistical literature did not offer too many ideas. New life came into statistics from England and Russia where the importance of mathematical tools was recognized."&lt;ref name="100bday"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmetterer|first1=L.|title=Tribute to Wilhelm Winkler at His 100th Anniversary|journal=International Statistical Review / Revue Internationale de Statistique|date=1984|volume=52|issue=3|pages=227–228|jstor=1403044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War years===
Winkler re-enlisted in the Austrian army at the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, and was decorated twice for bravery before being wounded in November 1915.&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt; During a lengthy recovery, he worked for the War Economy committee; his talents were recognized and he was appointed Secretary of State for Military Affairs at the end of the war in 1918 and he was a delegate to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Versailles Peace Conference]]. That year, he also married a Jewish woman named Clara Deutch. He joined the Austrian Central Statistics Office in 1920, and was promoted to director of its department of population statistics in 1925.&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; Concurrently, he became a ''Privat-Dozent'' (assistant professor) at the University of Vienna in 1921 and an ''Ausserordentlicher Professor'' in 1929. He founded an institute for the study of minority populations,&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; which published a constant stream of progressive and influential papers that made him unpopular with colleagues in his government job.&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt; Despite his lack of formal education, he was elected a member of the International Statistical Institute in 1926 where he actively promoted applied and precise mathematical formulations in contrast to the wordy generalizations that he had criticized 20 years earlier.&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; As both the husband of a Jew and an outspoken critic of the unfair treatment of European minorities, Winkler was promptly fired from both his government and academic positions following the 1938 [[Anschluss|Nazi annexation of Austria]].&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; Despite severe persecution from the Nazi party, he wrote the textbook ''Basic Course in Demography'' during the occupation.&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt;

===Later years===
At the end of the war, he was rehired by the University of Vienna as the first full professor of statistics since 1883, and became Dean of the School of Law and Statecraft from 1950 to 1955. He was also restored as Austria's lead government statistician from 1945 to 1955.&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; Despite these influential positions and growing international recognition, Winkler spent many years defending the statistical department from opposition within the university.&lt;ref name="Pinw"/&gt; The regressive attitude of Austrian and German academics towards statistics as a truly independent discipline meant that his contributions to international developments became more difficult.&lt;ref name="Pinw2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heyde|first1=C. C.|last2=Seneta|first2=E.|title=Statisticians of the Centuries|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9781461301790 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nAPrBwAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not retire until age 71, and continued to publish and vigorously promote statistics thereafter. He died just after his 100th birthday, having published 20 textbooks and over 200 papers, founded two statistical societies, edited two statistical journals, been awarded two honorary degrees, and reshaped the development of German-speaking statistics through his progressive education initiatives.&lt;ref name="100bday"/&gt;

[[File:Yupana.jpg|thumb|Sketch of a ''[[Quipucamayoc]]'' from ''[[El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno]]''. Shown on the lower left side is a yupana.]]

A ''yupana'' (from Quechua yupay: count)&lt;ref name="TOM"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lexiconovocabula00domi Santo Tomas, "Lexicon o Vocabulario de la lengua general del Peru", 1560]&lt;/ref&gt; is  an [[abacus]] used to perform [[arithmetic operations]] dating back to the time of the [[Incas]].

==Types==

The term ''yupana'' refers to two distinct classes of objects:

* '''table-yupana''' (or archaeological yupana): a system of trays of different sizes and materials, carved at the top of the device into geometric boxes, into which seeds or pebbles were placed, presumably for performing complex arithmetic calculations. The first of these tables was found in 1869 in the province of [[Cuenca Canton|Cuenca]] ([[Ecuador]]) and marked the beginning of systematic studies on these objects. All [[archaeological]] finds are very different from each other.&lt;ref name="RDP"&gt;Radicati di Primeglio, [http://sisbib.unmsm.edu.pe/bibvirtualdata/libros/2008/estud_quipu/cap03.pdf "Il sistema contabile degli Inca: Yupana e Quipu"], 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''yupana of Poma de Ayala''': a picture on page 360 of [[El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno]] written by the [[chronicler]] of the Indies [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]], representing a 5x4 [[chessboard]].&lt;ref name="GPA"&gt;Guaman Poma de Ayala, [http://www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/poma/info/en/frontpage.htm "Primer Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno", 1615]&lt;/ref&gt; The picture, although having some similarities with the majority of table-yupana, presents several differences from these, first of all, the shape of the boxes ([[rectangles]]), when those of table-yupanas are [[polygons]] of varying shape.

Although very different from each other, most of the scholars who have dealt with table-yupana, have then extended its reasoning and theories to the yupana of Poma de Ayala and vice versa, perhaps in an attempt to find a unifying thread or a common method. It should also be noted that the Nueva Coronica was discovered only in 1916 in the [[library]] of [[Copenhagen]] and that part of the studies on it were based on previous studies and theories regarding table-yupanas.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

==History==

Several chroniclers of the Indies described, unfortunately approximately, the Incan abacus and its operation.

===Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala===

The first was Guaman Poma de Ayala that in 1615 approximately, wrote:

{{quote|... They count through tables, numbering from one hundred thousand to one hundred and from ten thousand and ten, until the unit. They keep records of everything that happens in this realm: holidays, Sundays, months and years. These accountants and treasurers of the kingdom are found in every city, town, or indigenous village ...|&lt;ref name="GPA" /&gt;}}

In addition to providing this brief description, Poma de Ayala draws a picture of the yupana: a board of five rows and four columns in which are designed a series of white and black circles.

===José de Acosta===

The father [[Jesuit]] ''José de Acosta'' wrote:

{{quote|... they take the corn and put one here, three there, eight from another part; they move from a box and exchanged three other grains from one to another to finally get the result without error|&lt;ref name="ACO"&gt;José de Acosta - Historia Natural y Moral de las Indias - Libro VI cap XVIII (De los memoriales y cuentas que usaron los Indios del Perú)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Juan de Velasco===

Father ''Juan de Velasco'' wrote:

{{quote|... these teachers were using something like a series of tables, made of wood, stone, or clay, with different separations, in which they put stones of different shapes, colors and angular shapes|&lt;ref name="VEL"&gt;Juan Velasco - “Historia del Reino de Quito” - 1841 44, Tomo II, 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Table-yupana==

===Chordeleg===

The first table-yupana which we know was found in 1869 in [[Chordeleg]] in the department of [[Cuenca Canton|Cuenca]] ([[Ecuador]]). It is a [[rectangular]] table (33x27 cm) of [[wood]] which contains 17 compartments, of which 14 [[square]], 2 [[rectangular]] and one [[octagonal]]. On two edges of the table there are other square compartments (12x12 cm) raised and symmetrically arranged one another, to which two square platforms (7x7 cm), are overlapped. These structures are called towers. The table presents a symmetry of the compartments with respect to the [[diagonal]] of the [[rectangle]]. The four sides of the board are also engraved with figures of human heads and a [[crocodile]].&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt; As a result of this discovery, [[Charles Wiener]] began in 1877 a systematic study of these objects. Wiener came to the conclusion that the table-yupanas served to calculate the [[taxes]] that farmers paid to the Incan empire.

===Caraz===

Found at [[Caraz]] in 1878 - 1879, this table-yupana is different from that of Chordeleg as the material of construction is the [[stone]] and the central compartment of octagonal shape is replaced with a rectangular one; towers also have three shelves instead of two.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Callejón de Huaylas===

A series of table-yupanas much different from the first, was described by [[Erland Nordenskiöld]] in 1931. These yupana, made of stone, present a series of rectangular and square compartments. The tower is composed of two rectangular compartments. The compartments are arranged symmetrically with respect to the axis of the smaller side of the table.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Triangular yupana===

These yupana, made of stone, have 18 compartments of triangular shape, arranged around the table. On one side there is a rectangular tower with only one floor and three triangular compartments. In the central part there are four square compartments, coupled between them.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Chan Chan===

Identical to the yupana of Chordeleg, both for the material and the arrangement of the compartments, this table-yupana was found in the archaeological complex of [[Chan Chan]] in [[Peru]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Cárhua de la Bahía===

Discovered in the province of [[Pisco]] ([[Peru]]), these table-yupanas are two tables in [[clay]] and [[bone]]. The first is rectangular (47x32 cm), has 22 square (5x5 cm) and three rectangular (16x18 cm) compartments, and has no towers. The second is rectangular (32x23 cm) containing 22 square compartments, two L-shaped and three rectangular in the center. The compartments are arranged symmetrically with respect to the axis of the longer side.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Huancarcuchu===

Discovered in the upper [[Ecuador]] by [[Max Uhle]] in 1922, this yupana is made of stone and its bins are drawn. It has the shape of a scale consisting of 10 overlapping rectangles: four on the first floor, three on the second, two in the third and one in the fourth. This yupana is the one that is closest to the picture by Poma de Ayala in Nueva Coronica, while having a line less and being half drawn.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Florio===

C. Florio presents a study &lt;ref name="FLO2"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/12063847/Recovering_memory_the_INCA_KEY_as_YANANTIN C. Florio, "Recovering memory - The Inca Key as Yanantin"]&lt;/ref&gt;
which does not identify a yupana in these archaeological findings, but an object whose name is unknown and which has been forgotten. Instead, this object is to connect to the tocapu (an ideogram already used by pre-Incas civilizations) called “llave inca” (i.e. Inca key) and to the [[Yanantin|yanantin-masintin]] philosophy. The scholar reaches this conclusion starting from the lack of objective evidences which recognize a yupana in this object, a belief that consolidated over years only for the repeat of this hypothesis never demonstrated, and by crossing data from the Miccinelli Documents and the tocapu(s) catalogued by Victoria de la Jara. 
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Teoria Florio su yupana a casetta - F.png|Fig. E - Tocapu called “llave inca”, Inca key
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Supposing to colour the different compartments of the table-yupana (fig. A), C. Florio identifies a drawing (fig. B) very similar to a really existing tocapu (fig. C) and catalogued by Victoria de la Jara. In addition, in the tocapu reported in figure D, also catalogued by V. de la Jara, Florio identifies a stylization of the tocapu C and the departure point for creating the tocapu “llave inca” (Inca key). She finds the relation between the table-yupana and the Inca key also in their connection with the concept of duality: the table-yupana structure is clearly dual and Blas Valera in “Exul Immeritus Blas Valera populo suo” (one of the two Miccinelli Documents) describes the tocapu we call Inca key as representing the concept of the “opposite forces” and the “number 2”, both strictly linked to the concept of duality.

According to C. Florio, the real yupana used by the Incas is that of Guáman Poma, but with more columns and rows. Guáman Poma would have represented just the part of the yupana useful for carrying out a specific calculation, which Florio identifies to be a multiplication (see below).

==Theories of Yupana Poma de Ayala==

===Henry Wassen===

In 1931, [[Henry Wassen]] studied the yupana of Poma de Ayala, proposing for the first time a possible representation of the numbers on the board and the operations of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]. He interpreted the white circles as gaps, carved into yupana in which to insert the seeds described by chroniclers: so the white circles correspond to empty gaps, while the blacks circles correspond to the same gaps filled with a black seed.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

The numbering system at the base of the abacus was positional notation in base 10 (in line with the writings of the chroniclers of the Indies).

The representation of the numbers, then followed a vertical progression such that the units were positioned in the first row from the bottom, in the second the tens, hundreds in the third, and so on.

Wassen proposed a progression of values of the seeds that depends on their position in the table: 1, 5, 15, 30, respectively, depending on who occupy a gap in the first, second, third and fourth columns (see the table below). Only a maximum of five seeds could be included in a box belonging to the first column, so that the maximum value of said box was 5, multiplied by the power of the corresponding line. These seeds could be replaced with one seed of the next column, useful during arithmetic operations. According to the theory of Wassen, therefore, the operations of sum and product were carried out horizontally.

This theory received a lot of criticism due to the high complexity of the calculations and was therefore considered inadequate and soon abandoned.

By way of example, the following table shows the number 13457.

||&lt;small&gt;oo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;

This first interpretation of the yupana of Poma de Ayala was the starting point for the theories developed by subsequent authors, up to the present day. In particular, no one ever moved away from the positional numbering system until 2008.

===Emilio Mendizabal===

[[Emilio Mendizabal]] was the first to propose in 1976 that the [[Inca]] were using, as well as the decimal representation, also a representation based on the progression 1,2,3,5. Mendizabal in the same publication pointed out that the series of numbers 1,2,3 and 5, in the drawing of Poma de Ayala, are part of the [[Fibonacci sequence]], and stressed the importance of "magic" that had the number 5 for civilization the [[north]] of [[Peru]], and the number 8 for the civilizations of the [[south]] of [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Radicati di Primeglio===

In 1979, [[Carlos Radicati di Primeglio]] emphasized the difference of table-yupana from that of Poma de Ayala, describing the state of the art of the research and theories advanced so far. He also proposed the [[algorithms]] for calculating the four basic [[arithmetic operations]] for yupana of Poma de Ayala, according to a new interpretation for which it was possible to have up to nine seeds in each box with vertical progression for powers of ten.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt; The choice of Radicati was to associate to each gap a value of 1.

In the following table is represented the number 13457

===William Burns Glynn===

In 1981, the English textile [[engineer]] [[William Burns Glynn]] proposed a positional base 10 solution for the yupana of Poma de Ayala.&lt;ref name="WBG"&gt;William Burns Glynn, [http://www.boletindelima.com/1981-11.htm "Calculation table of the Incas"], ''Bol. Lima No. 11'', 1981, 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glynn, as Radicati, adopted the same Wassen's idea of full and empty gaps, as well as a vertical progression of the powers of ten, but proposed an architecture that allowed to greatly simplify the arithmetic operations.

The horizontal progression of the values of the seeds in its representation is 1, 1, 1 for the first three columns, so that in each row is possible to deposit a maximum of ten seeds (5 + 3 + 2 seeds). Ten seeds of any row is correspond to a single seed of the upper line.

The last column is dedicated to the ''memory'', which is a place where you can drop momentarily ten seeds, waiting to move them to the upper line. According to the author, this is very useful during arithmetic operations in order to reduce the possibility of error.

The solution of Glynn has been adopted in various teaching projects all over the world, and even today some of its variants are used in some [[schools]] of [[South America]].&lt;ref name="MRV"&gt;[http://cursa.ihmc.us/rid=1J2NH8QTM-2912G6-PZ5/yupana_como_herramienta_pedagogica.pdf Mora &amp; Valero "La Yupana come strumento pedagogico alle elementari"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIO"&gt;[http://www.seminariodidama.unito.it/fiorentino.pdf Fiorentino, "La yupana elettronica: uno strumento per la didattica interculturale della matematica"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nicolino de Pasquale===

The [[Italy|Italian]] [[engineer]] [[Nicolino de Pasquale]] in 2001 proposed a positional solution in base 40 of the yupana of Poma de Ayala, taking the representation theory of [[Fibonacci]] already proposed by [[Emilio Mendizabal]] and developing it for the four operations.

De Pasquale also adopts a vertical progression to represent numbers by powers of 40. The representation of the numbers is based on the fact that the sum of the values of the circles in each row gives as total 39, if each circle takes the value 5 in the first column, 3 in the second column, 2 in the third and 1 in the fourth one; it is thus possible to represent 39 numbers, united to [[neutral element]] ( [[zero]] or no seeds in the table); this forms the basis of 40 symbols necessary for the numbering system.&lt;ref name="DP1"&gt;N. De Pasquale [http://www.quipus.it/DePasquale_Volo%20_del_Condor.pdf "Il volo del condor", ''Pescara Informa'', 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the possible representations of the number 13457 in the yupana by De Pasquale is shown in the following table:

The theory of De Pasquale opened, in the years after his birth, great controversy among researchers who divided mainly into two groups: one supporting the base 10 theory and another supporting the base 40 one. It should be noted in this regard that the Spanish chronicles of the time of the [[conquest of the Americas]] indicated that the Incas used a decimal system and that since 2003 the base 10 has been proposed as the basis for calculating both with the abacus and the [[quipu]]&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2004/02/02/1036168.htm?site=science/memory Lorenzi, Incan counting system as easy as 1,2,3,5 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

De Pasquale has recently proposed the use of yupana as astronomical [[calendar]] running in mixed base 36/40&lt;ref name="DP2"&gt;[http://www.quipus.it/english/THE%20SAVED%20KINGDOM.pdf N. De Pasquale, "The Saved Kingdom"]&lt;/ref&gt; and provided its own interpretation of the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] word ''huno'', translating it as 0.1.&lt;ref name="DP3"&gt;[http://www.quipus.it/DECIMAL%20POMA.pdf N. De Pasquale, "Decimal Guaman Poma"]&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation diverges from all the chroniclers of the Indies, starting from [[Domingo de Santo Tomas]]&lt;ref name="TOM" /&gt; which in 1560 translated ''huno'' with ''chunga guaranga'' (ten thousand).

===Cinzia Florio===

In 2008 [[Cinzia Florio]] proposes an alternative and revolutionary approach in respect to all the theories proposed so far. For the first time we deviate from the positional numbering system and we adopt the additive, or [[sign-value notation]].&lt;ref name="FLO"&gt;[http://issuu.com/casaeditriceoedipus/docs/cinziaflorio C. Florio, "Incontri e disincontri nella individuazione di una relazione matematica nella yupana in Guaman Poma de Ayala", Salerno, 14-15 maggio e 10-12 Dicembre 2008 - Oédipus Editore, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relying exclusively on the design of Poma de Ayala, the author explains the arrangement of white and black circles and interprets the use of the abacus as a board for making [[multiplications]], in which the [[multiplicand]] is represented in the right column, the multiplier in the two central columns and the result ([[product (mathematics)|product]]) is shown in the left column. See the following table.

||&lt;small&gt;oo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;
|-
||&lt;small&gt;ooooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;ooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;oo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;
|-
||&lt;small&gt;ooooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;ooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;oo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;
|-
||&lt;small&gt;ooooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;ooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;oo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;
|-
||&lt;small&gt;ooooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;ooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;oo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;
|}
|}

The theory differs from all the previous by several aspects: first, the white and black circles would not be any gaps that may be filled with a seed, but different colors of the seeds, representatives respectively tens and units (this according to the chronicler Juan de Velasco ).&lt;ref name="VEL" /&gt;

Secondly, the multiplicand is entered in the first column respecting the sign-value notation: so, the seeds can be entered in any order and the number is given by the sum of the values of these seeds.

The multiplier is represented as the sum of two factors, since the procedure for obtaining the product is based on the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

The table multiplier drawn by Poma de Ayala with that provision of the seeds, represent according to the author, the calculation: 32 x 5, where the multiplier 5 is decomposed into 3 + 2. The sequence of numbers 1,2,3,5 would be casual, contingent to the calculation done and not related to the Fibonacci series.

|}

Key: o = 10; • = 1; The operation represented is: 32 x 5 = 32 x (2 + 3) = (32 x 2) + (32 x 3) = 64 + 96 = 160

The numbers represented in the columns are, from left to right: 32 (the multiplicand), 64 = 32 x 2 and 32 x 3 = 96 (which together constitute the multiplicand, multiplied by the two factors in which the multiplier has been broken down) and finally 151. In this issue (error) are based all possible criticisms of this interpretation, since 151 is obviously not the sum of 96 and 64. Florio, however, notes that a mistake of Poma de Ayala, in designing a black circle instead of a white one, would have been possible. In this case, changing just a black circle with a white one in the last column, we obtain the number 160, which is exactly the product sought as the sum of the quantities present in the central columns.

With a yupana as the one designed by Poma de Ayala can not be represented every multiplicands, but it is necessary to extend the yupana vertically (adding rows) to represent numbers whose sum of digits exceeds 5. The same thing goes for the multipliers: to represent all the numbers is necessary to extend the number of columns. It should be emphasized that this interpretation, apart the supposed error calculation  (or representation by the designer), is the only one that identifies in the yupana of Poma de Ayala a mathematical and consistent message (multiplication) and not a series of random numbers as in other interpretations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6312">'''Zenzizenzizenzic''' is an obsolete form of [[mathematical notation]] representing the eighth [[exponentiation|power]] of a number (that is, the zenzizenzizenzic of ''x'' is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;), dating from a time when powers were written out in words rather than as superscript numbers. This term was suggested by [[Robert Recorde]], a 16th-century [[Welsh people|Welsh]] writer of popular [[mathematics]] textbooks, in his 1557 work ''[[The Whetstone of Witte]]'' (although his spelling was ''zenzizenzizenzike''); he wrote that it "''doeth represent the square of squares squaredly''".

[[File:Whetstone-of-Witte-pp-150-151.jpg|thumb|Page from ''The Whetstone of Witte'', 1557. ''Zenzizenzizenzike'' occurs at the top of the right hand page.]]

At the time Recorde proposed this notation, there was no easy way of denoting the powers of numbers other than squares and cubes.  The root word for Recorde's notation is '''zenzic''', which is a [[German language|German]] spelling of the [[medieval Italian]] word ''censo'', meaning "squared".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-zen1.htm|contribution=Zenzizenzizenzic - the eighth power of a number|title=World Wide Words|first=Michael|last=Quinion|accessdate=2010-03-19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the square of a square of a number is its fourth power, Recorde used the word '''zenzizenzic''' (spelled by him as ''zenzizenzike'') to express it.  Some of the terms had prior use in Latin "zenzicubicus", "zensizensicus" and "zensizenzum".&lt;ref name="Stifel"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arithmetica Integra|language=Latin|page=61|author=Michael Stifel|location=Nuremberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, as the sixth power of a number is equal to the square of its cube, Recorde used the word ''zenzicubike''  to express it; a more modern spelling, '''zenzicube''', is found in [[Samuel Jeake]]'s ''[[Logisticelogia]]''.  Finally, the word ''zenzizenzizenzic'' denotes the square of the square of a number's square, which is its eighth power: in modern notation,
:&lt;math&gt;x^8=\left(\left(x^2\right)^2\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Recorde proposed three mathematical terms by which any power (that is, index or [[exponent]]) greater than 1 could be expressed: ''zenzic'', i.e. squared; ''cubic''; and ''sursolid'', i.e. raised to a prime number greater than three, the smallest of which is five.  Sursolids were as follows: 5 was the first; 7, the second; 11, the third; 13, the fourth; etc.
[[File:Cossical characters.png|thumb|right|Table of powers, symbols and names or descriptions form 0 to 24 by [[Samuel Jeake]], written in 1671]]
Therefore, a number raised to the power of six would be ''zenzicubic'', a number raised to the power of seven would be the second sursolid, hence ''bissursolid'' (not a multiple of two and three), a number raised to the twelfth power would be the "zenzizenzicubic" and a number raised to the power of ten would be ''the square of the (first) sursolid''.  The fourteenth power was the square of the second sursolid, and the twenty-second was the square of the third sursolid.

Curiously, Jeake's text appears to designate a written exponent of 0 as being equal to an "absolute number, as if it had no Mark", thus using the notation x&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to refer to x alone, while a written exponent of 1, in his text, denotes "the Root of any number", thus using the notation x&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to refer to what is now known to be x&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt;.

The word, as well as the system, is obsolete except as a curiosity; the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has only one citation for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Knight|1868}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Reilly|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
As well as being a mathematical oddity, it survives as a linguistic oddity: ''zenzizenzizenzic'' has more [[Z]]s than any other word in the OED.&lt;ref&gt;"Recorde also coined ''zenzizenzizenzic'', the word in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (OED) with more Zs than any other" {{harv|Reilly|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phrontistery"&gt;Uniquely contains six ''Z'' 's. Thus, it's the only ''hexazetic'' word in the English language. {{cite web|url=http://phrontistery.info/numbers.html|title=Numerical Adjectives, Greek and Latin Number Prefixes|publisher=phrontistery.info|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[probability theory]], a '''zero–one law''' is a result that states that an event must have probability 0 or 1 and no intermediate value. Sometimes, the statement is that the limit of certain probabilities must be 0 or 1.

It may refer to: 
* [[Borel–Cantelli lemma]]
* [[Blumenthal's zero–one law]] for [[Markov process]]es,
* [[Engelbert–Schmidt zero–one law]] for continuous, nondecreasing additive functionals of Brownian motion,
* [[Hewitt–Savage zero–one law]] for exchangeable sequences,
* [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]] for the tail σ-algebra,
* [[Lévy's zero–one law]], related to martingale convergence.
* [[topological zero–one law]] related to [[meager set]]s
