'''''A Long Way Home''''' is a non-fiction book by Indian-Australian businessman [[Saroo Brierley]] written together with [[Larry Buttrose]]. The text was initially released in Australia on 24 June 2013 via [[Penguin Books|Viking]], then re-released internationally in 2014, and adapted into a major film in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Long Way Home |url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Long-Way-Home-Saroo-Brierley/9780670077045 |publisher=[[Book Depository]] |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carroll |first1=Rory |title=Saroo Brierley, the inspiration for the film Lion: 'My mother saw my face after 25 years' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/24/saroo-brierley-lion-oscars-interview |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that Brierley currently writes a prequel to ''A Long Way Home'', “the story of both my mothers – biological and adoptive – before I was in the picture.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Iyer |first1=Archana |title=Lion: Saroo Brierley’s next book to be a prequel to A Long Way Home |url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/lion-saroo-brierleys-next-book-to-be-a-prequel-to-a-long-way-home/articleshow/56937194.cms |website=[[Mumbai Mirror]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
In this authobiographical book, Brierley covers three decades of his life, describing his ordeals and adventures as a lost five-year-old in rural India, his adoption by a wealthy Australian family, and his search for his Indian native family some 25 years later.

In an interview to [[ABC Radio Sydney]], Larry Buttrose explained that "From the very first time I came in contact with the story, I knew it was a fantastic story,... It was a film crying to be made". Buttrose recorded hours of interviews with both Saroo and his adoptive mother and completed a 70,000-word manuscript in a hotel room in Kolkata to meet a tough three-month deadline set by the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoh |first1=Amanda |title=A Long Way Home: Ghostwriter Larry Buttrose on telling Saroo Brierley's story behind the film Lion |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-16/a-long-way-home-ghostwriter-larry-buttrose-on-story-behind-lion/8276278 |website=[[ABC Radio Sydney]]
|accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Karina Wetherbee of ''[[Vail Daily]]'' stated "There is a real feeling of catharsis when reading Brierley's astounding narrative, in the classic sense of a happy ending, for the journey of the author as a boy — and then again as a young man — evokes the audacity of a fable, but it is set in the real world, a place where wonderment and miraculous occurrences can often seem wanting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wetherbee |first1=Karina |title=Book review: ‘A Long Way Home,’ by Saroo Brierley |url=https://www.vaildaily.com/entertainment/book-review-a-long-way-home-by-saroo-brierley/ |website=[[Vail Daily]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dianne Dempsey of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' commented "Brierley writes in a straightforward manner without trying to do anything fancy except tell a remarkable story. As well as the tale of his quest, he provides an informative and fascinating insight into how Third World families live with, and somehow survive, their poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dempsey |first1=Dianne |title=A Long Way Home |url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/a-long-way-home-20130829-2ssgs.html |website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor Dibbert of ''[[International Policy Digest]]'' added "It’s not hard to understand why this work has received such high praise. This is an honest story of pain, struggle, hope and love. He concludes the book on a reflective note... Brierley’s journey is inspirational and deeply moving; it’s another reminder of how potent passion and the human spirit actually are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dibbert |first1=Taylor |title=Book Review: ‘A Long Way Home’27 Jun 2015  Taylor Dibbert  Book Review: ‘A Long Way Home’ |url=https://intpolicydigest.org/2015/06/27/book-review-a-long-way-home/ |website=[[International Policy Digest]] |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In 2016, the book was adapted into major international feature film ''[[Lion (2016 film)|Lion]]'', directed by [[Garth Davis]] and starring [[Dev Patel]], [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Rooney Mara]]. The film premiered at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/entertainment/saroo-brierley-on-set-to-see-his-life-story-take-shape/story-fnj3tycr-1227202828052|title=Saroo Brierley on set to see his life story take shape|work=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]|date=31 January 2015|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/dev-patel-lion-trailer|title=Dev Patel’s Lion May Be the Inspirational Awards-Season Tale You’re Looking For|last=Busis|first=Hillary|access-date=28 June 2018|work=Vanity Fair|date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2016/tiff-2016-garth-davis-lion-with-dev-patel-is-an-emotional-journey/|title=TIFF 2016: Garth Davis' 'Lion' with Dev Patel is an Emotional Journey|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://film.list.co.uk/article/84586-lion/|title=Lion|date=13 September 2016|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-toronto-international-film-festival-live-updates-2016-htmlstory.html|title='Arrival,' 'La La Land,' 'Moonlight' and more: How the Toronto Film Festival movies will play with Oscar voters|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dev Patel]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].

[[File:Odo bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|upright=1.3|A scene from the Bayeux Tapestry depicting [[Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]], rallying Duke [[William the Conqueror|William's]] troops during the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066]]

The '''Bayeux Tapestry''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|b|aɪ|ˈ|j|ɜː|,_|b|eɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|b|eɪ|j|uː|,_|ˈ|b|aɪ|-}}; {{lang-fr|Tapisserie de Bayeux}} {{IPA-fr|tapisʁi də bajø|}} or {{lang|fr|La telle du conquest}}; {{lang-la|Tapete Baiocense}}) is an [[embroidery|embroidered]] cloth nearly {{convert|70|m|ft}} long and {{convert|50|cm|in}} tall,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reframing Medieval Art: Difference, Margins, Boundaries|last=Caviness|first=Madeline H.|publisher=Tufts University|year=2001|isbn=|location=Medford, MA|pages=|quote=|via=http://dca.lib.tufts.edu/caviness/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koslin|first=Desirée|year=1990|title=Turning Time in the Bayeux Embroidery|url=|journal=Textile &amp; Text|volume=13|pages=28–29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La tapisserie de Bayeux|last=Bertrand|first=Simone|publisher=Zodiaque|year=1966|isbn=|location=La Pierre-qui-Vire|page=23|quote=et combien pauvre alors ce nom de broderie nous apparaît-il!|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts the events leading up to the [[Norman conquest of England]] concerning [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]], and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England]], and culminating in the [[Battle of Hastings]]. It is thought to date to the 11th century, within a few years after the battle. It tells the story from the point of view of the conquering Normans, but is now agreed to have been made in England.

According to Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry, in her 2005 book ''La Tapisserie de Bayeux'':

{{quote|The Bayeux tapestry is one of the supreme achievements of the Norman [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]&amp;nbsp;.... Its survival almost intact over nine centuries is little short of miraculous&amp;nbsp;... Its exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit combine to make it endlessly fascinating.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvette Lemagnen, Preface, p. 9; {{cite book |last1=Musset  |first1=Lucien |last2=Rex |first2=Richard  (translator); |title=La Tapisserie de Bayeux: œuvre d'art et document historique |trans-title=The Bayeux Tapestry |type=annotated edition |edition=First |date=1 November 2005 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd |location=Woodbridge, United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-84383-163-1 |page=272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The cloth consists of some fifty scenes with Latin ''[[tituli]]'', embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns. It is likely that it was commissioned by [[Odo, Earl of Kent|Bishop Odo]], William's half-brother, and made in England—not Bayeux—in the 1070s. In 1729 the hanging was rediscovered by scholars at a time when it was being displayed annually in [[Bayeux Cathedral]]. The tapestry is now exhibited at the Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux in [[Bayeux]], [[Normandy]], France {{nowrap|({{coord|49.2744|N|0.7003|W|type:landmark_region:FR_source:wikidata|display=inline}}).}}

The designs on the Bayeux Tapestry are embroidered rather than woven, so that it is not technically a [[tapestry]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul, Nigel. "Bayeux Tapestry". ''A Companion to Medieval England''. Stroud, UK: Tempus.  pp. 32–33. {{ISBN|0-7524-2969-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it has always been referred to as a tapestry until recent years when the name "Bayeux Embroidery" has gained ground among certain art historians.  It can be seen as a rare example of secular [[Romanesque art]].  Tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in Medieval Western Europe, though at 0.5 by 68.38 metres (1.6 by 224.3&amp;nbsp;ft, and apparently incomplete) the Bayeux Tapestry is exceptionally large.  Only the figures and decoration are embroidered, on a background left plain, which shows the subject very clearly and was necessary to cover large areas.

On 18 January 2018, [[President of France|French President]] [[Emmanuel Macron]] announced that the Bayeux Tapestry would be loaned to Britain for public display. It is expected to be exhibited at the [[British Museum]] in London from 2022. It will be the first time that it has left France in 950 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/britain-to-get-bayeux-tapestry-as-macron-agrees-loan-n5brflnjx|title=Bayeux Tapestry to be displayed in Britain|website=The Times|date=17 January 2018|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known written reference to the tapestry is a 1476 inventory of [[Bayeux Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;Fowke, Frank Rede. ''The Bayeux Tapestry&amp;nbsp;– A History and Description'', London: G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; but its origins have been the subject of much speculation and controversy.

French legend maintained the tapestry was commissioned and created by [[Matilda of Flanders|Queen Matilda]], [[William I of England|William the Conqueror's]] wife, and her [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]]. Indeed, in France, it is occasionally known as "La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde" (Tapestry of Queen Matilda). However, scholarly analysis&lt;ref&gt;Sir Frank Stenton (ed) et al, ''The Bayeux Tapestry. A comprehensive survey'' London: Phaidon, 1957 revised 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 20th century concluded it was probably commissioned by William's half-brother, [[Odo of Bayeux|Bishop Odo]], who, after the Conquest, became [[Earl of Kent]] and, when William was absent in Normandy, [[regent]] of England.

The reasons for the Odo commission theory include: 1) three of the bishop's followers mentioned in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' appear on the tapestry; 2) it was found in Bayeux Cathedral, built by Odo; and 3) it may have been commissioned at the same time as the cathedral's construction in the 1070s, possibly completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral's dedication.

Assuming Odo commissioned the tapestry, it was probably designed and constructed in England by [[Anglo-Saxon art]]ists (Odo's main power base being by then in [[Kent]]); the Latin text contains hints of Anglo-Saxon; other embroideries originate from England at this time; and the vegetable dyes can be found in cloth traditionally woven there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120712134414/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22472&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO World Heritage nomination form], in English and French.

Clarke has proposed that the designer of the tapestry was [[Scolland]], the abbot of [[St Augustine's Abbey]] in [[Canterbury]], because of his previous position as head of the scriptorium at [[Mont Saint-Michel]] (famed for its illumination), his travels to [[Trajan's Column]], and his connections to [[Wadard]] and Vital, two individuals identified in the tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Howard B.|title=The Identity of the Designer of the Bayeux Tapestry|journal=Anglo-Norman Studies|year=2013|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designer of the Bayeux Tapestry identified|url=http://www.medievalists.net/2013/10/29/designer-of-the-bayeux-tapestry-identified/|publisher=Medievalists.net|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual physical work of stitching was most likely undertaken by female needleworkers. [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] needlework of the more detailed type known as [[Opus Anglicanum]] was famous across Europe.  It was perhaps commissioned for display in the hall of his palace and then bequeathed to the cathedral he built, following the pattern of the documented but lost hanging of [[Byrhtnoth]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), pp. 134–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative theories exist. [[Carola Hicks]] has suggested it could possibly have been commissioned by [[Edith of Wessex]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/04/2006_21_mon.shtml "New Contender for The Bayeux Tapestry?"], from the BBC, 22 May 2006.

== Construction, design and technique ==
[[File:Bayeux tapestry laid work detail..jpg|thumb|Detail of [[Backstitch|stem stitching]] and laid work.]]

In common with other embroidered hangings of the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval period]], this piece is conventionally referred to as a "tapestry", although it is not a true [[tapestry]] in which the design is [[weaving|woven]] into the cloth; it is in fact an [[embroidery]].

The Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in [[crewel]] ([[wool]] [[yarn]]) on a [[plain weave|tabby-woven]] [[linen]] ground 68.38 metres long and 0.5 metres wide ({{convert|68.38|x|0.5|m|ft|disp=output only}}) and using two methods of stitching: [[backstitch|outline or stem stitch]] for lettering and the outlines of figures, and [[couching (embroidery)|couching or laid work]] for filling in figures.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coatsworth" /&gt; Nine linen panels, between fourteen and three metres in length, were sewn together after each was embroidered and the joins were disguised with subsequent embroidery.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; At the first join (start of [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#14|scene 14]]) the borders do not line up properly but the technique was improved so that the later joins are practically invisible.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; The design involved a broad central zone with narrow decorative borders top and bottom.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; By inspecting the woollen threads behind the linen it is apparent all these aspects were embroidered together at a session and the awkward placing of the ''tituli'' is not due to them being added later.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; Later generations have patched the hanging in numerous places and some of the embroidery (especially in the [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#58|final scene]]) has been reworked.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; The tapestry may well have maintained much of its original appearance—it now compares closely with a careful drawing made in 1730.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

The main yarn colours are terracotta or russet, blue-green, dull gold, olive green, and blue, with small amounts of dark blue or black and sage green. Later repairs are worked in light yellow, orange, and light greens.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; Laid yarns are couched in place with yarn of the same or contrasting colour.

The tapestry's central zone contains most of the action, which sometimes overflows into the borders either for dramatic effect or because depictions would otherwise be very cramped (for example at Edward's [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#27|death scene]]). Events take place in a long series of scenes which are generally separated by highly stylised trees. However, the trees are not placed consistently and the greatest scene shift, between Harold's audience with Edward after his return to England and Edward's [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#26|burial scene]], is not marked in any way at all.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

The ''tituli'' are normally in the central zone but occasionally use the top border. The borders are otherwise mostly purely decorative and only sometimes does the decoration complement the action in the central zone. The decoration consists of birds, beasts, fish and scenes from fables, agriculture, and hunting. There are frequent oblique bands separating the vignettes. There are nude figures, some of corpses from battle, others of a ribald nature.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; A [[Harrow (tool)|harrow]], a newly invented implement, is depicted ([[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#10|scene 10]]) and this is the earliest known depiction. The picture of [[Halley's Comet]], which appears in the upper border ([[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#32|scene 32]]), is the first known picture of this comet.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

The [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#58|end of the tapestry]] has been missing from time immemorial and the final ''titulus'' "Et fuga verterunt Angli" ("and the English left fleeing") is said to be "entirely spurious", added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; [[Lucien Musset|Musset]]  speculates the hanging was originally about 1.5 metres longer.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; At the last section still remaining the embroidery has been almost completely restored but this seems to have been done with at least some regard to the original stitching.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; The stylised tree is quite unlike any other tree in the tapestry.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; The [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#1|start of the tapestry]] has also been restored but to a much lesser extent.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

In 1724 a linen backing cloth was sewn on comparatively crudely and, in around the year 1800, large ink numerals were written on the backing which broadly enumerate each scene and which are still commonly used for reference.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

== Background to the events depicted ==
In a series of pictures supported by a written commentary the tapestry tells the story of the events of 1064–1066 culminating in the [[Battle of Hastings]]. The two main protagonists are [[Harold Godwinson]], recently crowned King of England, leading the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] English, and [[William I of England|William, Duke of Normandy]], leading a mainly [[Normans|Norman]] army, sometimes called the [[companions of William the Conqueror]].&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;
[[File:Tapisserie agriculture.JPG|thumb|The [[courier|messengers]] with [[Guy I, Count of Ponthieu|Guy]], with a portrayal of medieval agriculture in the border]]
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene1 Edward.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward the Confessor]] sends Harold to Normandy]]

William was the [[illegitimate]] son of [[Robert the Magnificent]], [[Duke of Normandy]], and [[Herleva]] (or Arlette), a [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]]'s daughter. William became Duke of Normandy at the age of seven and was in control of Normandy by the age of nineteen. His half-brother was Bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]].

King [[Edward the Confessor]], king of England and about sixty years old at the time the tapestry starts its narration, had no children or any clear successor. Edward's mother, [[Emma of Normandy]], was William's great aunt. At that time [[Succession to the British throne#England|succession to the English throne]] was not by [[primogeniture]] but was decided jointly by the king and by an assembly of nobility, the [[Witenagemot]].

[[Harold Godwinson]], [[Earl of Wessex]] and the most powerful noble in England, was Edward's brother-in-law. The Norman chronicler [[William of Poitiers]]&lt;ref&gt;William of Poitiers: ''Gesta Willelmi ducis Normannorum et regis Anglorum'', c.1071.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that Edward had previously determined that William would succeed him on the throne, and Harold had sworn to honour this, and yet later that Harold had claimed Edward, on his deathbed, had made him heir over William. However, other sources, such as [[Eadmer]] dispute this claim.

== Events depicted in the tapestry ==
The tapestry begins with a panel of Edward the Confessor sending Harold to Normandy.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#1|(scene 1)]]&lt;/sup&gt; Later Norman sources say that the mission was for Harold to pledge loyalty to William but the tapestry does not suggest any specific purpose.&lt;ref name=hicks&gt;{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Carola|author-link=Carola Hicks|title=The Bayeux Tapestry. The Life Story of a Masterpiece|year=2006|publisher=Chatto and Windus|isbn=0-7011-7463-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mischance, Harold arrives at the wrong location in France and is taken prisoner by [[Guy I, Count of Ponthieu|Guy, Count of Ponthieu]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#7|(scene 7)]]&lt;/sup&gt; After exchanges of messages borne by mounted messengers, Harold is released to William who then invites Harold to accompany him on a campaign against [[Conan II, Duke of Brittany]]. On the way, just outside the monastery of [[Mont Saint-Michel]], the army become mired in quicksand and Harold saves two Norman soldiers.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#17|(scene 17)]]&lt;/sup&gt; William's army chases Conan from [[Dol de Bretagne]] to [[Rennes]], and Conan finally surrenders at [[Battle of Dinan|Dinan]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#20|(scene 20)]]&lt;/sup&gt; William gives Harold arms and armour (possibly [[knight]]ing him) and Harold takes an oath on [[saint]]ly [[relic]]s.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#23|(scene 23)]]&lt;/sup&gt; Although the writing on the tapestry explicitly states an oath is taken there is no clue as to what is being promised.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

Harold leaves for home and meets again with the old king Edward, who appears to be remonstrating with him.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#25|(scene 25)]]&lt;/sup&gt; Harold is in a somewhat submissive posture and seems to be in disgrace.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt; However, possibly deliberately, the king's intentions are not made clear.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt; The scene then shifts by about one year to when Edward has become mortally ill and the tapestry strongly suggests that, on his deathbed, he bequeaths the crown to Harold.&lt;ref group=note&gt;5 January 1066.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=musset/&gt; What is probably the [[coronation]] ceremony&lt;ref group=note&gt;6 January 1066.&lt;/ref&gt; is attended by [[Stigand]], whose position as Archbishop of Canterbury was controversial.&lt;ref name=musset/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#31|(scene 31)]]&lt;/sup&gt; Stigand is performing a liturgical function, possibly not the crowning itself.&lt;ref name=musset/&gt; The tapestry labels the celebrant as "Stigant Archieps" (Stigand the archbishop) although by that time he had been [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the [[papacy]] who considered his appointment unlawful.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

[[File:Comete Tapisserie Bayeux.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of [[Comet Halley|comet]]]]
A star with a streaming tail, probably [[Halley's Comet]], then appears.&lt;ref group=note&gt; A comet was believed to be a bad omen at this time and Halley's comet would have first appeared in 1066 around 24 April, nearly four months after Harold's coronation.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the lower border of the tapestry shows a fleet of ghost-like ships thus hinting at a future invasion.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#33|(scene 33)]]&lt;/sup&gt; The news of Harold's coronation is taken to Normandy, whereupon we are told that William is ordering a fleet of ships to be built although it is Bishop Odo shown issuing the instructions.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#35|(scene 35)]]&lt;/sup&gt; The invaders reach England, and land unopposed. William orders his men to find food, and a meal is cooked.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#43|(scene 43)]]&lt;/sup&gt; A house is burnt by two soldiers, which may indicate some ravaging of the local countryside on the part of the invaders, and underneath, on a smaller scale than the arsonists, a woman holds her boy's hand as she asks for humanity.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#47|(scene 47)]]&lt;/sup&gt; News is brought to William.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Possibly about Harold's victory in the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], although the Tapestry does not specify this.&lt;/ref&gt; The Normans build a [[motte and bailey]] at Hastings to defend their position. Messengers are sent between the two armies, and William makes a speech to prepare his army for battle.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#51|(scene 51)]]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[File:Normans Bayeux.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Hastings]]]]
The [[Battle of Hastings]] was fought on 14 October 1066 less than three weeks after the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] but the tapestry does not provide this context. The English fight on foot behind a [[shield wall]], whilst the Normans are on horses.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This reflected the military reality.&lt;/ref&gt; Two fallen knights are named as [[Leofwine Godwinson|Leofwine]] and [[Gyrth Godwinson|Gyrth]], Harold's brothers, but both armies are shown fighting bravely.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt; Bishop Odo brandishes his baton or mace and rallies the Norman troops in battle.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#54|(scene 54)]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Clerics were not supposed to shed blood, hence Odo has no sword. Rather than just praying for the Norman knights, however, which ought to have been his role, Odo seems militarily active.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt; To reassure his knights that he is still alive and well, William raises his helmet to show his face.&lt;ref name=musset/&gt; The battle becomes very bloody with troops being slaughtered and dismembered corpses littering the ground. King Harold is killed.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#57|(scene 57)]]&lt;/sup&gt; This scene can be interpreted in different ways, as the name "Harold" appears above a number of knights, making it difficult to identify which character is Harold, since one character appears with an arrow shot in his head under the name "Harold" while another character is slain by a sword underneath the words "he is slain". The final remaining scene shows unarmoured English troops fleeing the battlefield. The last part of the tapestry is missing but it is thought that the story contained only one additional scene.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

== Latin text ==
{{Main article|Bayeux Tapestry tituli}}

''[[Tituli]]'' are included in many scenes to point out names of people and places or to explain briefly the event being depicted.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; The text is in Latin but at times the style of words and spelling shows an English influence.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; A dark blue wool, almost black, is mostly used but towards the end of the tapestry other colours are used, sometimes for each word and other times for each letter.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; The complete text and English translation are displayed beside images of each scene at [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli]].

== Recorded history ==
The first reference to the tapestry is from 1476 when it was listed in an inventory of the treasures of Bayeux Cathedral. It survived the sack of Bayeux by the [[Huguenots]] in 1562; and the next certain reference is from 1724.&lt;ref name=musset&gt;{{cite book|last=Musset|first=Lucien|title=The Bayeux Tapestry|year=2005|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=1-84383-163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine Lancelot sent a report to the ''Académie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres'' concerning a sketch he had received about a work concerning William the Conqueror. He had no idea where or what the original was, although he suggested it could have been a tapestry.&lt;ref name=stenton&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertrand|first=Simone|title=The Bayeux Tapestry|year=1965|publisher=Phaedon Press|chapter=The History of the Tapestry|editor=Frank Stenton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite further enquiries he discovered no more.

[[File:MontfauconHaroldEye.jpg|thumb|[[Bernard de Montfaucon|Montfaucon]] / Benoît drawing showing Harold's death]]

The Benedictine scholar [[Bernard de Montfaucon]] made more successful investigations and found that the sketch was of a small portion of a tapestry preserved at Bayeux Cathedral. In 1729 and 1730 he published drawings and a detailed description of the complete work in the first two volumes of his ''Les Monuments de la Monarchie française''. The drawings were by [[Antoine Benoît]], one of the ablest draughtsmen of that time.&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt;

The tapestry was first briefly noted in English in 1743 by [[William Stukeley]], in his ''Palaeographia Britannica''.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1988, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The first detailed account in English was written by [[Smart Lethieullier]], who was living in Paris in 1732–3, and was acquainted with Lancelot and de Montfaucon: it was not published, however, until 1767, as an appendix to [[Andrew Ducarel]]'s ''Anglo-Norman Antiquities''.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1988, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], in 1792, the tapestry was confiscated as public property to be used for covering military wagons.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; It was rescued from a wagon by a local lawyer who stored it in his house until the troubles were over, whereupon he sent it to the city administrators for safekeeping.&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt; After [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]] the Fine Arts Commission, set up to safeguard national treasures in 1803, required it to be removed to Paris for display at the [[Musée Napoléon]].&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt; When [[Napoleon]] abandoned his planned invasion of Britain the tapestry's propaganda value was lost and it was returned to Bayeux where the council displayed it on a winding apparatus of two cylinders.&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt; Despite scholars' concern that the tapestry was becoming damaged the council refused to return it to the Cathedral.&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt;

In 1816 the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] commissioned its historical draughtsman, [[Charles Alfred Stothard|Charles Stothard]], to visit Bayeux to make an accurate hand-coloured [[facsimile]] of the tapestry. His drawings were subsequently engraved by [[James Basire]] jr. and published by the Society in 1819–23.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1988, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Stothard's images are still of value as a record of the tapestry as it was before 19th-century restoration.

By 1842 the tapestry was displayed in a special-purpose room in the Bibliothèque Publique. It required special storage in 1870 with the threatened invasion of Normandy in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and again in 1939–1944 by the [[Ahnenerbe]] during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German Occupation of France]] and the [[Normandy landings]]. On 27 June 1944 the [[Gestapo]] took the tapestry to the [[Louvre]] and on 18 August, three days before the [[Wehrmacht]] withdrew from Paris, [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] sent a message (intercepted by [[Government Code and Cypher School|Bletchley Park]]) ordering it to be taken to "a place of safety", thought to be Berlin.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; It was only on 22 August that the [[SS]] attempted to take possession of the tapestry by which time the Louvre was again in French hands.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; After the [[liberation of Paris]], on 25 August, the tapestry was again put on public display in the Louvre, and in 1945 it was returned to Bayeux&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt; where it is exhibited at the Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux.

== Later reputation ==
The inventory listing of 1476 shows that the tapestry was being hung annually in Bayeux Cathedral for the week of the [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist|Feast of St. John the Baptist]]; and this was still the case in 1728, although by that time the purpose was merely to air the hanging, which was otherwise stored in a chest.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; Clearly, the work was being well cared for. In the eighteenth century, the artistry was regarded as crude or even barbarous—red and yellow multi-coloured horses upset some critics. It was thought to be unfinished because the linen was not covered with embroidery.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; However, its exhibition in the Louvre in 1797 caused a sensation, with ''[[Le Moniteur Universel|Le Moniteur]]'', which normally dealt with foreign affairs, reporting on it on its first two pages.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; It inspired a popular musical, ''La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde''. It was because the tapestry was regarded as an antiquity rather than a work of art that in 1804 it was returned to Bayeux, wherein 1823 one commentator, A. L. Léchaudé d'Anisy, reported that "there is a sort of purity in its primitive forms, especially considering the state of the arts in the eleventh century".&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt;

The tapestry was becoming a tourist attraction, with [[Robert Southey]] complaining of the need to queue to see the work. In the 1843 ''Hand-book for Travellers in France'' by [[John Murray III]], a visit was included on "Recommended Route 26 (Caen to Cherbourg via Bayeux)", and this guidebook led [[John Ruskin]] to go there; he would describe the tapestry as "the most interesting thing in its way conceivable". [[Charles Dickens]], however, was not impressed: "It is certainly the work of amateurs; very feeble amateurs at the beginning and very heedless some of them too."&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt;

During the Second World War [[Heinrich Himmler]] coveted the work, regarding it as "important for our glorious and cultured Germanic history".&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt;

== Mysteries ==
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene57 Harold death.jpg|thumb|Harold's death. Legend above: ''Harold rex interfectus est'', "King Harold is killed"]]
[[File:Harold arrow, Bayeux tapestry detail.jpeg|thumb|right|Detail of arrow]]
[[File:Aelfgyva.jpg|thumb|''Ubi unus clericus et Ælfgyva'']]

The depiction of events on the tapestry raises several mysteries:
* The identification of [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II of England]] in the vignette depicting his death is disputed. Some recent historians disagree with the traditional view that Harold is the figure struck in the eye with an arrow. The view that it is Harold is supported by the fact that the words ''Harold Rex'' (King Harold) appear right above the figure's head. However, the arrow is a later addition following a period of repair,&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; as can be seen by comparison with [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s engravings of the tapestry as it was in 1729, in which the arrow is absent (see illustration above). However, needle holes in the linen do suggest that something had originally been in the place of the arrow, though it may have been a lance rather than an arrow.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; A figure is slain with a sword in the subsequent plate, and the phrase above the figure refers to Harold's death (''interfectus est'', "he is slain"). This would appear to be more consistent with the labeling used elsewhere in the work. It was common medieval [[iconography]] that a [[perjurer]] was to die with a weapon through the eye. Therefore, the tapestry might be said to emphasize William's rightful claim to the throne by depicting Harold as an oath breaker. Whether he actually died in this way remains a mystery and is much debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foys|first=Martin|title=Pulling the Arrow Out: The Legend of Harold's Death and the Bayeux Tapestry|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Woodbridge, UK|year=2009|pages=158–75|isbn=978-1-84383-470-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reliability ==
The Bayeux Tapestry was probably commissioned by the [[House of Normandy]] and essentially depicts a Norman viewpoint. However, Harold is shown as brave, and his soldiers are not belittled. Throughout, William is described as ''dux'' ("duke"), whereas Harold, also called ''dux'' up to his coronation, is subsequently called ''rex'' ("king").&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; The fact that the narrative extensively covers Harold's activities in Normandy (in 1064) indicates that the intention was to show a strong relationship between that expedition and the Norman Conquest starting two years later. It is for this reason that the tapestry is generally seen by modern scholars as an [[apologia]] for the Norman Conquest.

The tapestry's narration seems to place stress on Harold's oath to William, although its rationale is not made clear.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; Norman sources claim that the English succession was being pledged to William, but English sources give varied accounts.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; Today it is thought that the Norman sources are to be preferred.&lt;ref name=bates&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Bates, David | publisher = Oxford University Press | encyclopedia= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | title= William I  | year = 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29448?docPos=2 |doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/29448 }} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the tapestry and Norman sources&lt;ref name=poitiers&gt;William of Poitiers: ''Gesta Willelmi ducis Normannorum et regis Anglorum'', c.1071.

Although political propaganda or personal emphasis may have somewhat distorted the historical accuracy of the story, the Bayeux Tapestry constitutes a visual record of medieval arms, apparel, and other objects unlike any other artifact surviving from this period. There is no attempt at continuity between scenes, either in individuals' appearance or clothing. The knights carry shields, but show no system of hereditary [[coats of arms]]—the beginnings of modern heraldic structure were in place, but would not become standard until the middle of the 12th century.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; It has been noted that the warriors are depicted fighting with bare hands, while other sources indicate the general use of gloves in battle and hunt.

== Artistic context ==
Tapestry fragments have been found in Scandinavia dating from the ninth century and it is thought that Norman and Anglo-Saxon embroidery developed from this sort of work. Examples are to be found in the [[Oseberg ship#Grave goods|grave goods of the Oseberg ship]] and the [[Överhogdal tapestries]].&lt;ref name=musset/&gt;

A monastic text from [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], the ''[[Liber Eliensis]]'', mentions a woven narrative wall-hanging commemorating the deeds of [[Byrhtnoth]], killed in 991. Wall-hangings were common by the tenth century with English and Norman texts particularly commending the skill of Anglo-Saxon seamstresses. Mural paintings imitating draperies still exist in France and Italy and there are twelfth-century mentions of other wall-hangings in Normandy and France. A poem by [[Baldric of Dol]] might even describe the Bayeux Tapestry itself.&lt;ref name=musset/&gt; The Bayeux Tapestry was therefore not unique at the time it was created: rather it is remarkable for being the sole surviving example of medieval narrative needlework.&lt;ref name=digby&gt;{{cite book |last=Wingfield Digby|first=George |title=The Bayeux Tapestry |year=1965 |edition=2nd |publisher=Phaidon Press|chapter=Technique and Production|editor-first=Frank |editor-last=Stenton |editor-link=Frank Stenton |pages=37–55 (37, 45–48) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replicas and continuations ==
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry replica in Reading Museum.jpg|thumb|Start of the Bayeux Tapestry replica in [[Reading Museum]]]]
A number of replicas of the Bayeux Tapestry have been created. Through the collaboration of [[William Morris]] with textile manufacturer [[Thomas Wardle (industrialist)|Thomas Wardle]], Wardle's wife [[Elizabeth Wardle|Elizabeth]], who was an accomplished seamstress, embarked on creating a reproduction in 1885.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; She organised some 37 women in her ''Leek School of Art Embroidery''&lt;ref group=note&gt;See [[Leek, Staffordshire]] and [[Art needlework]].&lt;/ref&gt; to collaborate working from a full-scale water-colour facsimile drawing provided by the [[South Kensington Museum]]. The full-size replica was finished in 1886 and is now exhibited in [[Reading Museum]] in [[Reading, Berkshire]], England.&lt;ref name=reading&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's Bayeux Tapestry at the Museum of Reading|url=http://www.bayeuxtapestry.org.uk/|accessdate=17 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719042215/http://www.bayeuxtapestry.org.uk/|archivedate=19 July 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naked figure in the original tapestry (in the border below the Ælfgyva figure) is depicted wearing a brief garment because the drawing which was worked from was similarly [[bowdlerised]].&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt;

Ray Dugan of [[University of Waterloo]], [[Ontario]], Canada, completed a stitched replica in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dugansbayeuxtapestry.com/ |title=Ray Dugan's Bayeux Tapestry |publisher=Dugansbayeuxtapestry.com |date= |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its completion, it has been displayed in various museums and galleries in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=2346 |title=Bayeux Tapestry, topic of seminar |publisher=Newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca |date=15 March 2001 |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Danish-based Bayeux Group, part of the Viking Group [[Lindholm Høje]], began making an accurate replica of the Bayeux Tapestry, using the original sewing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/55906:Historie--Vikingerne-kommer?all=1 |title=Vikingerne kommer!|trans-title=The Vikings Are Coming!|date=30 November 2005|publisher=Kristeligt Dagblad|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replica was completed in June 2014 and went on permanent exhibition at [[Børglum Abbey]] in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://politiken.dk/rejser/nyheder/ferieidanmark/art5635000/Nu-h%C3%A6nger-Bayeux-tapetet-i-en-hestestald-i-Vendsyssel |title=Nu hænger Bayeux-tapetet i en hestestald i Vendsyssel |trans-title=The "Bayeux tapestry" displayed in a horse stable in North Jutland|publisher=[[Politiken]] |date=8 September 2016 |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. E. D. Wheeler, former judge and former dean at [[Oglethorpe University]], commissioned a hand-painted, full-size replica of the Bayeux Tapestry and donated it to the [[University of West Georgia]] in [[Carrollton, Georgia|Carrollton]] in 1994. In 2014, the replica was acquired by the [[University of North Georgia]] in [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]].

[[File:1066 Medieval Mosaic (Bayeux Tapestry) sections.jpg|thumb|Sections of the 1066 Medieval Mosaic re-creation in New Zealand]]

The work was in 32 sections, and included a hypothetical reconstruction of the missing final section leading up to William the Conqueror's coronation at [[Westminster Abbey]] on Christmas Day, 1066.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1066.co.nz/mosaic/mosaic.htm |title=A Medieval Mosaic (Medieval Mosaic) |publisher=1066 |date= |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason Welch, a woodcarver from [[North Creake]], Norfolk, England, created a replica of the Tapestry between 2011 and 2014 in carved and painted wooden relief on 25 five-foot planks. He undertook the project to help cope with the grief of losing his 16-year-old son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Hall |title=Grandfather hand-carved 230 FOOT wooden scale model of Bayeux Tapestry to help get over the death of his teenage son (despite missing three fingers on his left hand) |newspaper=Mail Online |date=12 January 2014 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2538110/Grandfather-hand-carved-230FOOT-wooden-scale-model-Bayeux-Tapestry-help-death-teenage-son-despite-missing-three-fingers-left-hand.html |accessdate=11 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern artists have attempted to complete the work by creating panels depicting subsequent events up to William's coronation, though the actual content of the missing panels is unknown.

== In popular culture ==
[[Image:Street art in Bayeux about tapestry.jpg|upright|thumb|Street art in Bayeux referring to the Tapestry]]
Because it resembles a modern [[comic strip]] or movie [[storyboard]], is widely recognised, and is so distinctive in its artistic style, the Bayeux Tapestry has frequently been used or reimagined in a variety of different popular culture contexts. George Wingfield Digby wrote in 1957:
{{quote|It was designed to tell a story to a largely illiterate public; it is like a strip cartoon, racy, emphatic, colourful, with a good deal of blood and thunder and some ribaldry.&lt;ref&gt;Wingfield Digby, "Technique and Production", p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been cited by [[Scott McCloud]] in ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' as an example of early [[Sequential art|sequential-narrative art]];&lt;ref&gt;McCloud 1993. ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' pp. 11–14&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bryan Talbot]], a British comic book artist, has called it "the first known [[History of the British comic|British comic strip]]".&lt;ref&gt;The History of the British Comic, [[Bryan Talbot]], ''[[The Guardian]] Guide'', 8 September 2007, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has inspired many modern [[Editorial cartoon|political]] and other [[cartoon]]s, including:
* [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]]'s satirical pastiche ''Ye Berlyn Tapestrie'', published in 1915, which tells the story of the German invasion of Belgium in August 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Hassall |authorlink=John Hassall (illustrator) |title=Ye Berlyn Tapestrie |origyear=1915 |year=2014 |place=Oxford |publisher=Bodleian Library |isbn=978-1-85124-416-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rea Irvin]]'s cover for the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine of 15 July 1944 marking [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1944-07-15#folio=CV1 |title=The New Yorker |publisher=Condé Nast |date=15 July 1944 | accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Gale (cartoonist)|George Gale]]'s pastiche chronicling the saga leading up to Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]], published across six pages in ''[[The Times]]'''s "Europa" supplement on 1 January 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/george_gale_1_665795 |first=Alasdair |last=Steven |title=George Gale: Obituary |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=24 September 2003 |accessdate=3 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tapestry has also inspired modern embroideries, notably:
* The [[Overlord embroidery]] commemorating the [[D-Day|Normandy landings]] invasion, now at [[Portsmouth]]
* The [[Prestonpans Tapestry]], which chronicles the events surrounding the [[Battle of Prestonpans]] in 1745

A number of films have used sections of the tapestry in their opening credits or closing titles, including [[Disney]]'s ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', Anthony Mann's ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'', Franco Zeffirelli's ''[[Hamlet]]'', Frank Cassenti's ''[[La Chanson de Roland]]'', Kevin Reynolds' ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'', and Richard Fleischer's ''[[The Vikings (film)|The Vikings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Re-embroidering the Bayeux Tapestry in Film and Media: The Flip Side of History in Opening and End Title Sequences | publisher = Richard Burt, University of Florida | date = 18 August 2007 | url = http://www.clas.ufl.edu/~rburt/middleagesonfilm/bayeux1.html | accessdate = 31 August 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908114843/http://www.english.ufl.edu/exemplaria/movie/RBBT.pdf | archivedate=8 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design and embroidery of the tapestry form one of the narrative strands of [[Marta Morazzoni]]'s 1988 novella ''The Invention of Truth''.

The tapestry is referred to in [[Tony Kushner]]'s play ''[[Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes|Angels in America]]''. The apocryphal account of Queen Matilda's creation of the tapestry is used, perhaps in order to demonstrate that Louis, one of the main characters, holds himself to mythological standards.&lt;ref name="sparknote_angels"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/angels/section3.rhtml | title=SparkNote on Angels in America | publisher=SparkNotes LLC | work=SparkNotes.com | accessdate=30 October 2014 | author=SparkNotes Editors | quote=Louis's problem is exacerbated by his tendency towards abstraction and his unreasonably high standards for himself. In Scene Three, he tells Emily about La Reine Mathilde, who supposedly created the Bayeux Tapestry. Louis describes La Reine's unceasing devotion to William the Conqueror and laments his own comparative lack of devotion. But as critic Allen J. Frantzen has pointed out, this popular story about Mathilde and the tapestry is wrong—it was actually created in England decades after the conquest. Louis, then, is holding himself to a mythological standard of loyalty, and he curses himself based on a positively unreal example. This is part of a larger pattern of excessive guilt and harshness toward himself, which, paradoxically, prevents him from judging his own weaknesses accurately and trying to correct them. Because no one could possibly live up to Mathilde's example, Louis initially justifies his moral failure. Later, in Perestroika, he will arrive at a more genuine remorse and an honest understanding of what he has done.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ulster Museum]] in [[Northern Ireland]] currently hosts a ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' tapestry inspired by the Bayeux tapestry, depicting the events of the television show.

A '''bondage cover''', as opposed to a [[bondage magazine]], was a general-interest magazine that featured [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] imagery on its cover, usually an image of a bound and [[Gag (BDSM)|gagged]] woman.

== Painted covers ==
These were the earliest examples of bondage cover art images, and ran from about 1910 (when the [[pulp magazine|pulps]] became more common) until roughly 1975 (when the "[[Men's adventure]]" type of magazines started to disappear).

The peak era for these seems to be the 1930s with [[weird menace]] and [[detective fiction|detective]] pulps and the 1960s heyday of men's adventure magazines.

== Photo covers ==
Perhaps the earliest detective magazine to employ photographic covers was "Actual Detective Magazine," whose first issue appeared in November, 1937. The earliest use of a color photo on a cover is the February 1939 issue of ''True'' magazine, with the February 1940 edition apparently the first to feature a [[gag]] worn by a [[damsel in distress]].
The peak era for these was the era from roughly 1959 until 1986, when, due to the [[Meese Commission]] (a contribution by [[Park Dietz]]), and the end of a few of the publishers of Detective (or "True Crime") magazines, the main era of the bondage cover ended, though there were a few issues of ''Detective Dragnet'' in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and a brief revival from about 1994 until 2000, though even then they were few and far between (unlike the late 1960s, when at least 2 such covers could be seen monthly).
Also, the use of over-the-mouth gags was common enough that the slang term "detective gag" is used for it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40562">The '''Budapest Museum Quarter''' is a proposed new cultural and [[Tourist attraction|tourist site]] to be located on [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], and has at its core the merger of the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] with the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Budapest Museum of Fine Arts]] into one institution. The concept has been around since at least 2008 when the Director of the Museum of Fine Arts proposed combining the two collections. In 2010, the Fidesz political party included the idea in its election campaign. Several other Budapest museums would be affected by the plan, which faces not only economic and legal hurdles, but also criticism from both members of the public and art professionals alike.

==Background==

===Hungarian national museum system===
National museums in Hungary are those institutions that are state–owned and centrally financed. Many of them were created in the late 19th century under the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] as specialized complementary institutions to the original [[Hungarian National Museum]]. Although they received state sponsorship, the museums within this system — including the [[Hungarian Natural History Museum|Museum of Natural History]], [[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Museum of Ethnography]], [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Hungarian National Gallery|National Gallery]] and pre–World War II, the [[National Library of Hungary|National Library and Archives]] — operated autonomously with their own board and endowment.  However, with the introduction of [[Communism in Hungary|Communism into Hungary]] in 1949, they lost their autonomy and were governed by the state under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apor|first=Péter|title=The National Museum in Hungary: Approaches to Its Analysis|journal=Conference on Building National Museums: 1750–2010|date=March 30 – April 1, 2011|url=http://www.eunamus.eu/bologna-reports/hungary.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hungarian National Museum]] is an important symbol of [[national identity]] because it played a major role in the anti-Habsburg [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]] when the revolutionaries read their list of twelve demands, as well as a nationalistic poem on its front steps. The site is still used annually by the government to commemorate those events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Gov't, civil organizations reach deal on sharing Budapest streets on March 15|url=http://www.politics.hu/20120217/govt-civil-organizations-reach-deal-on-sharing-the-streets-on-march-15/|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Politics.hu|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fidesz government (2010)===

====Cultural policy====
After winning a two–thirds parliamentary majority in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 elections]], [[Fidesz]] or the Hungarian Civic Union party began what was called a "hands–on cultural policy" that included appointing a media watchdog "that has the power to fine media outlets deemed to violate public interest, order and morals". It was suggested by members of the Hungarian art community that the center–right government was also influencing the appointment of a new director for the [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (Műcsarnok) when the prior, Socialist–appointed incumbent's term ran out at the end of 2010. [[Francesca von Habsburg|Francesca Von Habsburg]] was considered a favorite of the new, conservative government and a front–runner in the selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=After censorship row, what next in Hungary?|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles//23070|accessdate=1 February 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, instead of choosing a candidate from this transparent process launched in November 2010, the Secretary of State for Culture [[Géza Szőcs]] (a recent Fidesz appointee) personally approved the decision to hire Gábor Gulyás, former director of the Centre for Modern and Contemporary Arts (MODEM) in Debrecen, Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surprise appointment at Budapest's Mucsarnok|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/comings-and-goings/2011/3|accessdate=1 February 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, László Harsanyi, the director of the [http://old.hdke.hu/index.php?changelang=eng Holocaust Memorial Center] and his chief historical adviser, Judit Molnár, were both relieved of their posts after the State Secretary for the Ministry of Public Administration and Justice, András Levente Gál, objected to the museum's display of an image of Hungary’s interwar leader [[Miklós Horthy]]. Saying that "this kind of historical inaccuracy [unjustifiably linking Hungary to the deportation of Jews to Nazi concentration camps] creates unnecessary tension," Gál drew the wrath of dozens of local historians and social scientists. But according to Molnár, "we could not change the permanent exhibition to align with the new political expectations since we regard that as a falsification of history." A Fidesz party MP and former chairman of the parliamentary cultural and press committee László Simon was also appointed to lead the National Cultural Fund of Hungary, which until then had been independent of the government. Other early 2012 replacements included that of Győrgy Szabó, director of [http://www.trafo.hu/en-US Trafó] — a leading contemporary art center — by choreographer Yvette Bozsik, and the director of Budapest’s Új Szinház theater, István Márta by György Dörner, an actor with extreme right–wing political affiliations. According to art historian Éva Forgács, “the government wants to disrupt the fabric of Hungarian culture, by having leading cultural figures disappear and replacing them with their own.” However, Simon dismissed any controversies over his and similar appointments as being politically motivated by the opposition.&lt;ref name=Michalska&gt;{{cite news|last=Michalska|first=Julia|title=Hungary's government tightens grip on arts|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hungary%E2%80%99s-government-tightens-grip-on-arts/25561|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=The Arts Newspaper|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the government decreed that the network of over two hundred county museums that had been in operation for more than a century would fall under the auspices of local city governments. However, the deputy leader of the parliamentary cultural committee Gergely Karácsony criticized the decision, arguing that it went against professional standards and that a much better choice would have been unifying the galleries and museums under the [[Hungarian National Museum]] system. This would have allowed them to be state-funded, instead of relying on already underfunded local budgets that may lead to the closing of these institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=LMP: múzeumok fognak bezárni|url=http://hvg.hu/kultura/20120411_lmp_muzeumok_bezaras|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=hvg.hu|date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitutional changes====
On January 1, 2012, [[Constitution of Hungary#2011 Constitution|amendments created in the spring of 2011]] by Fidesz to the [[Constitution of Hungary|Hungarian Constitution]] took effect and were not only criticized by many citizens within the country, but also by forces within the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. Some of these changes included "a [[preamble]] committed to defending the intellectual and spiritual unity of the nation", references to previously excluded social issues like the definition of marriage and modifications to the [[electoral process]]. Within days, tens of thousands of people marched in protest in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungarians protest against new Fidesz constitution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16387117|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the government defended replacing the old Constitution stating that it was "high time" for the changes to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungarian government defends controversial Constitution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16395791|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support his May 2010 remarks that “Hungarian culture must be refreshed with works of art, prizes, celebrations”, as well as publicize the legislative changes, [[Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Orbán]] opened a special government–organized exhibit at the National Gallery highlighting the sovereign statehood and Christianity within the 1,000 years of Hungarian history. Included in the show, which runs through August 2012, are 15 large, state–commissioned works depicting important events from the country's past 150 years, including a canvas of Orbán himself.&lt;ref name="Michalska"/&gt;

Facing increasing pressure from the EU, by mid–January 2012 the Fidesz government had agreed to change parts of the new legislation regarding constitutional changes to the independence of the central bank, the judiciary and data protection. However, they did not agree to change language regarding the cultural components of the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Casert|first=Raf|title=Hungary plans changes to controversial legislation|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2012/01/18/international/i065206S24.DTL|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=SFGate|date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The project==

===Initial proposals===
The concept of a separate museum district within [[Budapest]] was a Fidesz campaign platform during the 2010 elections. It included plans for the area from the [[Western Railway Station (Budapest)|Western Railway Station]] to the current [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], located on [[Hősök tere|Heroes' Square]], to house a newly built Museum of Hungarian Modern Art, as well as a House of Europe for all the countries represented on the continent. The [[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Museum of Ethnography]] would also be moved to this newly planned district. The project was intended by the party to "serve as a cultural–touristic–gastronomic centre with an exhibition and music hall and information centre" and be realized over a period of 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fidesz announces plans for budapest museum quarter|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20100303/fidesz-announces-plans-for-budapest-museum-quarter/|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=MTI|date=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposal was unveiled by [[István Tarlós]], who at the time was chairman of the Fidesz party and who became [[mayor of Budapest]] later that same year. Consequently, a consensus developed during a series of professional debates that a museum master plan was essential because there was a real need for: a modern 21st century institution; an emphasis to collect and exhibit 20th century Hungarian art in an international context; and the expansion of media to include architecture, design, photography and media arts. Speculation by the press as to why none of these proposals seemed to get beyond the discussion and debate stage included the observation that "the prevailing cultural policy since the political transformation has been to continue with the old model — that is, the use of direct control instead of a structural transformation based on dialogue".&lt;ref name=Melyi&gt;{{cite news|last=Mélyi|first=József|title=Notes for a Budapest Museum Master Plan|url=http://www.artmargins.com/index.php/2-articles/606-notes-for-a-budapest-museum-master-plan-|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=Art Margins Online|date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the director of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], László Baán, proposed the merging of his museum with that of the [[Hungarian National Gallery|National Gallery]], due to the similar exhibition and collection profile of the two. Both (along with the Ludwig Museum of Contemporary Art) specialize in 20th century and [[Contemporary art|contemporary fine art]], much of which was created by Hungarian artists living overseas.&lt;ref name="Melyi"/&gt; After his request to add an €18million underground extension to the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] — which would have united collections spread across the city — was denied in February 2011, Baán presented an alternative plan to the government to build two new buildings at the cost of €150m. He envisioned the new buildings — one housing contemporary European art and the other Hungarian photography — as a "special museum island" that would complement the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (Műcsarnok) by permanently joining the two collections by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Budapest director's double vision for national museum|journal=The Art Newspaper|date=3 August 2011|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Budapest-directors-double-vision-for-national-museum/24249|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current plans===
In September 2011, Secretary of State for Culture [[Géza Szőcs]] officially announced plans to build a new structure along [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]] close to [[Városliget|City Park]] and near the existing [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Budapest Museum of Fine Arts]] and [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (Műcsarnok).  This building would house the collections of the current [[Hungarian National Gallery]].&lt;ref name=MTI&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Government commissioner appointed for planned "museum quarter" in Budapest|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20111003/museum-of-fine-arts-director-appointed-as-museums-quarter-government-commissioner/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Realdeal.hu|date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded plan, which would utilize the entire boulevard, is also referred to as the Andrássy Quarter.&lt;ref name=Foldes&gt;{{cite news|last=Földes|first=András|title=Houdini-cirkusz es fiákerek az Andrássyn|url=http://index.hu/belfold/budapest/2011/09/15/houdini_cirkusz_es_egyeb_megaberuhazasok_a_fovarosban/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=index.hu|date=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project would also involve the addition of a tunnel to redirect existing vehicular traffic, thereby creating a pedestrian–only zone that hasn't existed on [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]] since the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=DAmato&gt;{{cite news|last=D'Amato|first=Erik|title=The mad plan to kill off Budapest's best walking street|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20110926/the-mad-plan-to-kill-off-budapests-best-walking-street/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Realdeal.hu|date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to other new venues for eating and entertainment on [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]], there would also be changes made to [[Városliget|City Park]]. One of these would be to rename the Hungarian State Circus after [[Harry Houdini]], whose background as a Hungarian was relatively unknown even though he was world famous. This version of the project would take eight years and cost 20 billion [[Hungarian forint|HUF]].&lt;ref name="Foldes"/&gt; After submission of a detailed proposal to the cabinet (expected in summer 2012), construction could begin by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hungary around the clock|title=Planned Budapest "museum quarter" could be completed by 2017, official says|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20111028/planned-budapest-museum-quarter-could-be-completed-by-2017-official-says/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Realdeal.hu|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural design for this "New Gallery" will be chosen based on an international competition.&lt;ref name=Unwin&gt;{{cite news|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Budapest 'mega–project' to defy the downturn|url=http://www.aica.hu/doc/baan_interview_tan_november.pdf|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appointments and resignations===
According to the Hungarian News Agency ([[Magyar Távirati Iroda|MTI]]), on October 1, 2011 László Baán was appointed to a two–year term as the government commissioner in charge of developing the new museum quarter, in addition to his existing position as director of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]].  In his new post, Baán will report directly to the Prime Minister, but will not get additional pay.  He will be responsible for “preparing the concept, execution and architectural design–tender for a building complex to house the national public collection in Budapest’s 56–ers Square, with a special focus on merging the collections of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Hungarian National Gallery]]".&lt;ref name="MTI"/&gt;

Baán has faced criticism before from both other institutions and interest groups, having radically transformed his museum from 2004 onward from one of relative obscurity to being an extensive contributor of loans to major international exhibits. While his process of fast modernization and innovation was supported by the government, it went against the typical standard of slow (or even non-existent) change in non–contemporary, eastern European museums.&lt;ref name="Unwin"/&gt;

In early December 2011, Ferenc Csák — director of the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] since 2010 and critical of the proposed merger of the gallery with the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]]— called the merge process “[v]ery unprofessional, anti–democratic and short–sighted” and announced that he would resign at the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Hungarian national gallery director resigns in protest|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hungarian+national+gallery+director+resigns+in+protest/25182|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 5, 2012, a new director had not been named and the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] was being led by Deputy General Director György Szűcs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact|url=http://www.mng.hu/en/contact|work=Hungarian National Gallery|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests and opposition==

===Political===
This is not the first time that a recent Hungarian government has proposed the integration of multiple public institutions into one location.  The plan is similar to that of the Government District which was to be built in generally the same area of Budapest behind the Western Railway Station in 2009 under the direction of then Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]]. However, that proposal — which was touted by the government as a green initiative to save on resources — was scrapped in early 2008 due to the enormous projected costs of rebuilding the infrastructure around the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jámbor|first=Gyula|title=Kormány negyed nélkül|url=http://mno.hu/migr_1834/kormany_negyed_nelkul-365046|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Index.hu|date=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peace March for Hungary 2012.01.21 (10).JPG|thumb | left | 2012 Pro Government demonstration]]
There was speculation by historian András Gerő that [[Fidesz]]'s recent policy changes stem from its staunch anti–communist stance, which "is not blindly ideological but driven by cold political calculation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunai|first=Márton|title=Hungary's Orban seeks to wipe out Communist past|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/01/uk-hungary-communism-idUSLNE81001C20120201|work=Reuters|accessdate=1 February 2012|date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resignation of former National Gallery director Ferenc Csák was partly motivated by the Fidesz government's exhibition [http://www.mng.hu/en/exhibitions/hosok_nyito_en ''Heroes, Kings, Saints. Images and Documents from the History of Hungary''] which he criticized by saying, “The government shouldn’t have the power to order exhibitions with such a high political agenda. Museums shouldn’t be getting involved in politics.”&lt;ref name=Michalska/&gt;

Moving the collections of the National Gallery to a new location would leave the [[Buda Castle]] empty and available for other use. Although the government has made it clear that they will move out of the Parliament building by 2014, officials have not stated whether it is their intention to move government offices — including that of the Prime Minister — into the Castle once it is vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Földes|first=András|title=Mozgólépcső vinne a Várba a Duna–partról|url=http://index.hu/belfold/budapest/2011/09/14/mozgolepcso_vinne_a_varba_a_duna_partrol/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=index.hu|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buda Castle Day.JPG|thumb|Buda Castle — current home of the National Gallery]]

===Economic===

In November 2011, Hungary was downgraded to [[junk status]] by one of the big international rating agencies. In spite of this, several major projects are planned for Budapest within the next few years, including that of the Museum Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fischer|first=Patricia|title=The five projects we are watching|url=http://www.bbj.hu/business/the-five-projects-we-are-watching_61671|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Budapest Business Journal|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing criticism regarding the timing of such an expensive project with a weak economic situation, László Baán defended the Hungarian government's plans by saying that they are "making use of various instruments for dealing with the critical economic situation, many of which are surprising, unusual and, for that very reason, ferociously debated." However, he also added that "it fits perfectly with the logic of this government to launch a cultural mega–project of such emblematic significance right in the middle of general budget cuts: one which, besides its intrinsic value, also expresses an extremely important symbolic message".&lt;ref name="Unwin"/&gt;

===Legal===
There is also a legal hurdle to the various construction plans because of the existing zoning restrictions in the proposed location for the new buildings. The developed area within the [[Városliget|City Park]] is already five percent over the allowable two percent limit, and this includes the site chosen by the government for the new museum. The [[zoning laws]] are reviewed every five or ten years; thereby any current plans would be considered illegal.&lt;ref name=Foldes/&gt;

===Social===
In addition to opposition to the merging of the museums, the establishment of the museum quarter by forcing cars off [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]] also received criticism. Arguments included the fact that the scale of the massive boulevard is much too large to be restricted to only pedestrians and the wide, tree–lined sidewalks that exist are already adequate. Many of the shops along the route are also empty — a sign of the current status of the Hungarian economy — and would not make for a welcome sight to targeted tourists.&lt;ref name="DAmato"/&gt;

[[File:Andrassy-ut-budapest.jpg|thumb | left|Andrássy út in Budapest]]

Art professionals have criticized László Baán's capacity to lead an endeavor to unite two such massive museums because he is not an art historian nor a museologist, but rather an economist by training. They fear that a merge would potentially damage Hungarian cultural heritage, both literally and figuratively. Additionally, leading Hungarian art historians worry that the physical move of such a large and valuable collection as that of the National Gallery is unprofessional and irresponsible. Between December 17, 2011 and the deadline for the merge on February 29, 2012 an online petition entitled "Protest Against the Merger of the Hungarian National Gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts" that was created by these individuals had received 2,945 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sármány-Parsons|first=Ilona|title=Information on the Proposed Dissolution of the Hungarian National Gallery as an Independent Institution|url=http://www.thearttribune.com/Information-on-the-Proposed.html|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=The Art Tribune|date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, 2011 the Hungarian Section of the [[International Association of Art Critics]] (AICA) published their similar standpoint regarding the issue and also supported the on–line petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Hungarian Section of the International Association of Art Critics (AICA)|title=Standpoint|url=http://aica.hu/mng_allasfoglalas.html|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baán dismissed these criticisms by reminding the Hungarian members of AICA that he was hired to conduct the necessary impact studies and hold discussions with key stakeholders in the next two years in order to address their concerns. He also stressed that the National Gallery would not cease to exist, but only that its collections would be relocated to return it to its pre–1957 state and give it more prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Múzeumi negyed: a kormánybiztos visszautasítja a félremagyarázást|url=http://www.stop.hu/kultura/muzeumi-negyed-a-kormanybiztos-visszautasitja-a-felremagyarazast/953219/|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Stop.hu|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar places worldwide==

Despite all of the challenges and the opposition to the planned Budapest Museum Quarter, creating unified spaces is not unheard of, as there are other major cities worldwide which have successfully created cultural and tourist centers by clustering museums and other similar attractions in one location.

===Europe===
The [[Museumplein]] of Amsterdam — a spacious square with a pond and park frequently used for outdoor festivals and events — lies in the heart of the museum quarter in [[Amsterdam]] surrounded by the [[Rijksmuseum]], the [[Van Gogh Museum]], the [[Stedelijk]] and the [[Concertgebouw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museumplein|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/locations/museumplein/1ef2bca0-e72c-5602-e1f75b6471e3f3b0|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five institutions that are all part of the [[Berlin State Museums]] are located on the northern half of an island in the [[Spree River]] in [[Berlin]], Germany and make up what is referred to as [[Museum Island]].

More than a dozen museums in [[Frankfurt]], Germany are clustered along the banks of the Main River in an area known as the [[Museumsufer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museumsufer Frankfurt|url=http://www.kultur-frankfurt.de/portal/en/Museums/MuseumEmbankmentFrankfurt/1503/0/0/0/1441.aspx|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opened in 2001, the [[Museumsquartier|Museum Quarter in Vienna]] is one of the world's largest complexes for modern art and culture, encompassing nine permanent museums, exhibition halls, and creativity space for the dozens of culture initiatives based in the area.

[[Museum Campus Chicago|Chicago's Museum Campus]], which houses the [[Shedd Aquarium]], [[Field Museum]], [[Adler Planetarium]], and [[Soldier Field]], came to be in 1998 when the area next to [[Lake Michigan]] was replanned and landscaped with the intention of tying the institutions together with the use of green space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago's Museum Campus|url=http://gochicago.about.com/od/chicagomuseums/ss/museum_campus.htm|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dallas arts district|Dallas Arts District]] was proposed in 1978 and the first major museum to be located in the northeast corner of downtown was the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], opened in 1984. Since then, the Morton H. [[Meyerson Symphony Center]], the [[Crow Collection of Asian Art]], the [[Nasher Sculpture Center]], the [[Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]], and the [[AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center]] have all been moved or newly built in the area. In 2012, the [[City Performance Hall]] will complete the planned additions to the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dallas Arts District - History|url=http://www.thedallasartsdistrict.org/district/history|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]] contains another cluster of cultural sites at the Fort Worth Cultural District. It is not only home to five museums such as the [[Kimbell Art Museum]], [[Cowgirl Museum|National Cowgirl Museum]] and the [[Fort Worth Museum of Science and History]], but the overall park-like setting also contains the local performing arts centers like symphony, ballet and theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fort Worth Museums &amp; Galleries|url=http://www.fortworth.com/things-to-do/museums-galleries/|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pedestrian–friendly [[Houston Museum District|Museum District in Houston]], Texas links 18 cultural institutions and attracts 8.7 million visitors each year. It is home to such facilities as the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum, the [[Children's Museum of Houston]], the Museum of Fine Arts and the [[Contemporary Arts Museum Houston|Contemporary Arts Museum of Houston]], along with restaurants, shops and offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Official Visitor Site for Houston|url=http://www.visithoustontexas.com/travel-tools/houston-neighborhoods/museum-district/|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]] in Los Angeles contains several sporting venues, museums and recreational facilities within its 60 acres. Visitors will find the [[LA Coliseum]] and [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena|Memorial Sports Arena]], as well as the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Natural History Museum]], [[California Science Center]] and [[California African American Museum|African American Museum]] alongside the Expo Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.expositionpark.org/about-us|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Mall]] is a central green space in [[Washington, DC]] that is defined by the structures of the [[US Capitol]] on one end and the [[Jefferson Memorial]] on the other. Between these two points, visitors will find numerous memorials and monuments, as well as many museums belonging to the world-renowned [[Smithsonian Institution]] including the Quadrangle Museums Project, designed in 1987. It opens south from the Smithsonian Castle building and contains two small buildings which are staging areas for two underground museums, the Sackler Gallery of Asian Art, and the National Museum of African Art, and another smaller kiosk–like building which provides the entrance for the S. Dillon Ripley Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Mall|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/dc70.htm|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related issues==
In addition to criticism surrounding the proposed Museum Quarter and the recent changes in leadership for key Hungarian cultural institutions, there are several other significant issues that affect the country's [[cultural heritage management]].

===Kossuth Square===
A new controversy has erupted over the plans to restore the [[Kossuth Square]] in front of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Parliament building]]. The changes would include the removal of all monuments added since 1945 and replacing them with pre–1944 sculptures. In this plan, a 1980 sculpture of one of the greatest Hungarian poets, [[Attila József]] would be replaced by a monument of one–time prime minister [[Gyula Andrássy]]. Not everyone is overly worried about the government's actions, though. For example, artist Miklós Szűts believes that "the government might make symbolic gestures, like the paintings they commissioned, but they don’t have a major effect in reality.”&lt;ref name="Michalska"/&gt; However, the Socialist opposition planted a tree on Earth Day 2012 at the end of the square in protest of the government's undemocratic actions of modifying the space "without asking the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Socialists plant tree to protest reconstruction of area around parliament|url=http://www.politics.hu/20120423/socialists-plant-tree-to-protest-reconstruction-of-area-around-parliament/|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=Politics.hu|date=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the statues of [[Kossuth Square]] being in danger, the fate of the [[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Ethnographic Museum]] that is across from the Parliament building is also uncertain because the newly reinstated Hungarian Supreme Court (Kúria) has recently expressed interest in getting its former building back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grabow|first=Elisabeth K.|title=Taking a stand on Kossuth square|url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2012/03/02/taking-a-stand-on-kossuth-square/|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Budapest Times|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the local newspaper Népszava, just moving the museum, as well as the [[Institute of Political History]] that also occupies the same building, would cost at least 5 billion [[Hungarian forint|HUF]], but constructing new premises for both would take at least 15 billion HUF, if not double the amount".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Tízmilliárdokat emésztene fel a Kúria áthelyezése (in Hungarian)
|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120421_kuria_uj_helye|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=Politics.hu|date=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural History Museum===
In mid–2011, the [[Hungarian Natural History Museum]] was threatened with eviction from its building (known as the Ludovika Campus), which it received after the fall of communism in 1989. The government wanted to turn the premises into a university for the military or police, similar to its function prior to 1945, and thereby relocate the 70 staff and 10 million artifacts into a yet undecided space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turner|first=Marian|title=Hungarian natural history under threat|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110607/full/474139a.html|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Nature|date=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after this news, the government's Office of Public Affairs issued a joint press release with the museum that addressed the issue. They explained that in spite of two decades of effort, the museum still operates in three separate locations. Additionally, the move of the proposed National Civil Servant University into unutilized space in the Ludovika Campus would make it possible for the museum to receive additional space elsewhere, thereby improving its current situation by reducing the number of sites where it operates. The museum would keep the current space in the Ludovika's former stables and the underground rooms that it uses. The museum's leadership would also take part in the preparatory work regarding the renovations of the Ludovika Campus. Long–term plans involve moving the [[Hungarian Natural History Museum]] to the completed Museum Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sajtoiroda|title=A Közigazgatási és Igazságügyi Minisztérium és a Magyar Természettudományi Múzeum sajtóközleménye a Magyar Természettudományi Múzeum elhelyezéséröl|url=http://www.mttm.hu/modules/Kozmuvelodes/sajtokozlemeny.jpg|work=Press Release|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hopp Southeast Asia Museum===
A private collection exhibiting almost 1,000 artifacts opened on [[Andrássy út]] in September 2011 as part of the new [[Zelnik István Southeast Asian Gold Museum|Southeast Asian Gold Museum]].  One source of contention among its critics is that the Ministry of Culture approved the title of "museum" without the usual requirements for records of the origin of the exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rózsa|first=Mihály|title=L'ouverture du Musée Zelnik|url=http://www.lepetitjournal.com/culture-budapest/85596-culture-louverture-du-musee-zelnik.html|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Le Petit Journal (in French)|date=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection is both complimentary to and competition of the existing Ferenc Hopp Southeast Asian Museum in Budapest, which the owner and curator of the new Gold Museum István Zelnik had been interested in acquiring since 2008. However, the leadership of the latter (which belongs under the umbrella of the Budapest [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]]) blocked his advances. Currently, the future of both the Hopp Museum and its sister institution the György Ráth Museum is uncertain. Due to financial constraints, they are both only open for half–days on Friday through Sunday. There are also rumors within the Hungarian press that both museums are due to close on March 31, 2012 and that their collections are to be permanently transferred to the Museum of Applied Arts as a response to the Hopp Museum's previous bids for independent status under the auspices of the National Trust for Monuments [http://www.nemzetimuemlek.hu/ (MNG)].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamvay|first=Péter|title=A Hoppnak annyi?|url=http://www.nepszava.hu/articles/article.php?id=520094&amp;referer_id=friss#null|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Népszava Online|date=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Krásna Hôrka Castle===
While [[Krásna Hôrka Castle]] is a National Cultural Monument of the [[Slovak Republic]], it was built and inhabited by ethnic Hungarian families and was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] until 1918. However, a massive blaze on March 10, 2012 destroyed much of the building and up to 10% of its historical collections.&lt;ref "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/evropa/261533-slovensky-hrad-krasna-horka-shorel-kvuli-dvema-detem-s-cigaretou.html?ref=zpravy-dne|title=Slovenský hrad Krásná Hôrka shořel kvůli dvěma dětem s cigaretou|last=Šubrt|first=Pavel |date=11 March 2012|publisher=Novinky.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fidesz's commitment to the preservation of Hungary's cultural heritage may be tested based on their response to the request for aid from the Hungarian Coalition Party of Slovakia to rebuild the thirteenth-century fortress, but the initial statement of the Hungarian Prime Minister was that the nation is prepared to assist with saving this priceless cultural asset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tizenévesek okozhatták a krasznahorkai tüzet|url=http://index.hu/kulfold/2012/03/11/tizenevesek_okozhattak_a_krasznahorkai_tuzet/|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Index.hu|date=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cerro de los Santos standing women.png|thumb|upright|Statues of women bearing offerings]]
'''Cerro de los Santos''' is an [[Iberian culture|Iberian]] religious [[sanctuary]] built in the 4th century BCE, during the Iberian period, with evidence of continued use into the Roman period.  The site lies in southeastern Spain near an ancient road. Little remains of the original structures at the site. Nineteenth century excavations documented some features of a temple but only an outline now remains. The site is known for its many votive sculptures, numbering about 300. Most of the sculptures depict women including the most notable find, the [[Dama del Cerro de los Santos]]. In addition to the women, statues of men, possibly dating from a later period, and a few statues of animals have also been found.

== Location ==
The site is located outside of the municipality of [[Montealegre del Castillo]] in the province of [[Albacete]], Spain. The site, marked by a commemorative obelisk erected in 1929, is near the highway to [[Yecla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.contestania.com/cerrosantos.html|title=Cerro de los Santos|website=www.contestania.com|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/37001.html|title=Cerro de los Santos, Montealegre del Castillo – Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire|website=dare.ht.lu.se|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site would have been along the [[Via Heraclea]], in the territory of the [[Bastetani]] near the [[Contestani]]. The site is a few kilometres from another Iberian site, [[Llano de la Consolación]]. Few visible remains survive. The outline of the temple, visible in the eighteenth century, has disappeared completely.

== Temple ==
The temple was {{convert|15.6|by|9.9|m|abbr=on}} and had a {{convert|2.6|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} wide doorway with access by two flights of steps. Based on the 19th century excavations, the walls were formed by a double course of square blocks secured by lead clamps. The roof was tiled and the floor may have been paved with rhomboidal terracotta tiles. The site does not have the usual characteristics of an Iberian sanctuary.{{sfn|Balil|1976}}

== Sculptures ==
Excavations uncovered about 300 stone sculptures. Most of the sculptures are [[votives]] of human figures, although a few animal sculptures have been found. Sculptures of women dominate.{{sfn|Balil|1976}} The sculptures are individual pieces with only one example of a group sculpture being found. The sculptures accumulated over time with the earliest being dated to the 4th century BCE while later examples have Latin letter inscriptions or appear more Roman in style. A lack of artifacts from the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman period]] suggests that the site stopped being used.{{sfn|Balil|1976}} The sculptures are generally similar in hair and dress, but the eyes differ in size and position. Jaeggi believes this may be an attempt to differentiate otherwise similar statues to better represent unique donors.{{sfn|Jaeggi|2008|p=30}}  According to Jaeggi, the votive statues represent their donors who receive protection from the a deity when their avatars are permanently placed in the sanctuary.{{sfn|Jaeggi|2008|p=28}}The sculptures are now primarily housed at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]] in [[Madrid]].{{sfn|Balil|1976}}
[[File:Dama oferente del Cerro de los Santos (16119971754).jpg|thumb|upright|Dama of Cerro de los Santos]]
The female statues have cloaks or tiara-like headdresses. Most of these figures are standing, but some depict the figure seated on a chair or throne. Folds in cloth tend to be depicted with stylized zig-zag lines.{{sfn|Balil|1976}} The best known of the statues is the Dama del Cerro de los Santos. The statue stands 1&amp;nbsp;m and 40&amp;nbsp;cm tall, holding an offering cup. She is dated to the 3rd or 2nd century BCE, but has a very stylized form reminiscent of earlier [[Iberian sculpture]]. According to Jaeggi, the sculpture does not show Italic or Greek influence.{{sfn|Jaeggi|2008|p=29}} The male statues tend to be similar with all wearing the same dress, a [[pallium]] held in the right hand. A few have earrings or pendant [[Bulla (amulet)|bullae]]. There is only one sculpture, holding a short sword, identified as a warrior.{{sfn|Balil|1976}}  There are no complete male statues preserved.{{sfn|Jaeggi|2008|p=29}} Hair on the male figures is depicted as a compact mass with curls depicted with notched lines.{{sfn|Jaeggi|2008|p=29}}

Truszkowski argues that the female sculptures date primarily to the period prior to the [[Punic Wars]] and that the shift to male statues, with more Hellenistic styling, occurred during the conflicts.{{sfn|Truszkowski|2006}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5904">[[File:Columbarium-500.jpg|thumb|The [[Columbarium of San Francisco]]]]
A '''columbarium''' (pl. '''columbaria''') is a place for the respectful and usually public storage of [[Cremation|cinerary]] [[urn]]s (i.e., urns holding a deceased's [[Cremation|cremated]] remains), but can also mean the nesting boxes of [[pigeons]]. The term comes from the [[Latin]] "''columba''" (dove) and, originally, solely referred to compartmentalized housing for doves and pigeons called a [[dovecote]].

==Background==
Roman columbaria were often built partly or completely underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Toynbee |first=J M C |title=Death and Burial in the Roman World |date=1971 |publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press |pages= 113–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Columbarium of Pomponius Hylas]] is an ancient Roman example, rich in frescoes, decorations and precious mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Roman underground columbariums included: Columbarium of Statilii, Columbarium of Volusii, Columbarium of Livia, Columbarium of Pomponius Hylas, Columbarium of Lucius Arruntius, Columbarium of Iunius Silanus, Columbarium of Nero Claudius Druscus, Columbarium of Marcella, Columbarium of Carvilii, Columbarium of C. Annius Pollio, Columbarium of Caecilii, Columbarium of Passienii, Columbarium of Bruttii, Columbarium of L. Caninius Gallus, Columbarium of L. Abucii, Columbarium of Q. Sallustii. Further reading in Pavia, Carlo.  ''Guide to Underground Rome: From the Cloaca Maxima to the Domus Aurea: the Most Fascinating Underground Sites of the Capital.''  English translation by Darragh Henegan.  Rome: Gangemi, 2000.  {{ISBN|88-7448-994-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's columbaria can be either free standing units, or part of a [[mausoleum]] or another building. Some manufacturers produce columbaria that are built entirely off-site and brought to the cemetery by a large truck. Many modern [[crematory |crematoria]] have columbaria. Examples of these are the columbaria in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris and [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in London.

In other cases, columbaria are built into church structures. One example is the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]] (Los Angeles, California), which houses a number of columbarium niches in the mausoleum built into the lower levels of the Cathedral. The construction of columbaria within churches is particularly widespread in the [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]]. An example can be seen at the Church of St Nicolas in [[Old Town Square (Prague)]]. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], although traditional burial is still preferred, [[cremation]] is permitted provided that the cremated remains are buried or entombed. As a result, columbaria can be found within some Catholic cemeteries.

Columbaria are often closely similar in form to traditional Buddhist temples, which from ancient times have housed cremated ashes. In [[Buddhism]], ashes of the deceased may be placed in a columbarium (in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], a ''naguta'' ("bone-receiving pagoda"); in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], a ''nokotsudo'' ("bone-receiving hall"), which can be either attached to or a part of a Buddhist temple or cemetery.  This practice allows for the family of the deceased to visit the temple for the conduct of traditional memorials and ancestor rites.

==Columbarium caves in Israel==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 12061 Colombarium cave in Hirbat Midras.jpg|thumb|Columbarium cave in Hirbat Midras, Archaeological sites of Israel]]
In the [[Beit Guvrin National Park|Bet Guvrin]] area several series of large caves dug into soft rock were found. There were several theories about their original use, for ritual burial, for growing pigeons to be used for ritual sacrifice, or for raising pigeons for fertilizer production. One such cave had been covered by an earthquake close to the time of its original usage and had no signs of secondary usage; neither ashes nor pigeon droppings were found in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.parks.org.il/sites/English/ParksAndReserves/BeitGuvrin/Pages/default.aspx |title= Bet Guvrin National Park |website= Israel National Parks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.israel21c.org/the-land-of-a-1000-caves/ |title= The Land of 1000 Caves |website= israel21c.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the archaeologic finds on [[Masada]], a columbarium tower foundation remains.

[[File:AngolaLAPrison.jpg|thumb|[[Louisiana State Penitentiary]], the setting of the work]]
'''''Dead Man Walking''''' (1993) is a work of non-fiction by Sister [[Helen Prejean]], a [[Roman Catholic nun]] and one of the [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille]] based in New Orleans. Arising from her work as a spiritual adviser to two convicted murderers on [[Death Row]], the book is set largely at the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] (Angola) in [[West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana]]. It examines moral issues related to the men's acknowledgement of their crimes and to the state's use of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, Linda. "[https://www.pbs.org/kqed/onenight/about/producer.html The Producer's Journey]." [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. Retrieved on September 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Prejean has become a leading American advocate for the abolition of the death penalty. Her campaign was initiated following her correspondence and visits that she maintained with two convicted murderers. She started this ministry in 1982. The first man was [[Elmo Patrick Sonnier]], who was sentenced to death by electric chair. She visited Sonnier in prison and agreed to be his spiritual adviser in the months leading up to his death. The second was [[Robert Lee Willie]], for whom she also served as spiritual adviser.

Prejean gained insight into the minds of these convicted murderers and the process involved in executions, including its effects on the prison guards and other personnel. She became convinced that the state's use of the death penalty was morally wrong and began speaking out against [[capital punishment]]. At the same time, she founded ''Survive'', an organization devoted to providing counseling to the families of victims of violence.

==Name==
The title of the book comes from a phrase once traditional in American prisons, to designate a man condemned to death. They were held on what was known as Death Row, deprived of most social contact and unable to work or participate in prison programs. Prior to the 1960s, when guards would lead a condemned man down the prison hallway, they would call out, "Dead man walking! Dead man walking here!" The origin of the phrase is debated. It may have been to warn other staff or prisoners, to let them know they should be on their guard since a [[death row]] prisoner has nothing to lose and could be violent. It may also have been a kind of [[honorific]] declamation, to let other prisoners know that they should move out of the way - death row prisoners being seen as an [[elite]] within the prison system. Alternatively, the call may have been a [[Social stigma|stigma]] attached to the condemned man, to remind others within earshot not to touch him in order not to catch his bad luck. In any case, its symbolism is clear: the condemned prisoner, in the eyes of the law, was dead already.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
{{Main article|Dead Man Walking (film)}}
In 1995, a film based on the book was made, starring [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Sean Penn]].

===Opera===
{{Main article|Dead Man Walking (opera)}}
The book was adapted as an [[Dead Man Walking (opera)|opera]] of the same name, composed by [[Jake Heggie]] with a libretto by playwright [[Terrence McNally]]. It premiered at the [[San Francisco Opera]] in October 2000. The international premiere of the opera was in August 2003, in Adelaide. It has been produced in several other cities, including by the [[Union Avenue Opera]] in St. Louis, Missouri.

A '''digital camera''' or '''digicam''' is a [[camera]] that captures [[photograph]]s in [[digital memory]]. Most cameras produced today are digital,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/11/AR2006011102323.html |title=Nikon Says It's Leaving Film-Camera Business| accessdate=2007-02-23 | date=2006-01-12 | publisher=Washington Post | first=Mike | last=Musgrove}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while there are still dedicated digital cameras, many more are now incorporated into devices ranging from [[mobile device]]s to vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;https://fstoppers.com/news/nikon-closes-china-camera-factory-cites-smartphones-cause-201773 Nikon Closes China Camera Factory, Cites Smartphones as Cause&lt;/ref&gt; However, high-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals.

Digital and [[movie camera]]s share an optical system, typically using a lens with a variable [[Diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]] to focus light onto an image pickup device.&lt;ref&gt;MakeUseOf: [http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/technology-explained-how-does-a-digital-camera-work/ How does a Digital Camera Work]; retrieved 2013-09-07&lt;/ref&gt; The diaphragm and [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] admit the correct amount of light to the imager, just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from [[Flash memory|memory]]. Many digital cameras can also record moving videos with [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound]]. Some digital cameras can [[Cropping (image)|crop]] and [[Image stitching|stitch]] pictures and perform other elementary [[image editing]].

==History==
{{See|History of the camera#Digital cameras|Digital single-lens reflex camera|Camera phone}}

The history of the digital camera began with [[Eugene F. Lally]] of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], who was thinking about how to use a mosaic photosensor to capture digital images. His 1961 idea was to take pictures of the planets and stars while travelling through space to give information about the astronauts' position. As with [[Texas Instruments]] employee Willis Adcock's filmless camera (US patent 4,057,830) in 1972, the technology had yet to catch up with the concept.

The [[Cromemco Cyclops]] was an all-digital camera introduced as a commercial product in 1975. Its design was published as a hobbyist construction project in the February 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' magazine, and it used a 32&amp;times;32 [[Metal Oxide Semiconductor]] sensor.

[[Steven Sasson]], an engineer at [[Eastman Kodak]], invented and built the first self-contained electronic camera that used a [[charge-coupled device]] image sensor in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Prakel|title=The Visual Dictionary of Photography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7X5vYbUd0sC&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=24 July 2013|date=10 December 2009|publisher=AVA Publishing|isbn=978-2-940411-04-7|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dobbin&gt;Dobbin, Ben. (September 8, 2005) "[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Kodak-engineer-had-revolutionary-idea-the-first-1182624.php Kodak engineer had revolutionary idea: the first digital camera]." ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''. Retrieved on 2018-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Estrin |first=James |date=August 12, 2015 |title=Kodak's First Digital Moment |url=http://nyti.ms/1IK1u5a |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early uses were mainly military and scientific; followed by medical and news applications.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 1986, Japanese company [[Nikon]] introduced the first [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|digital single-lens reflex]] (DSLR) camera, the Nikon SVC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apphotnum.free.fr/N2BE2.html Nikon SLR-type digital cameras], Pierre Jarleton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="busch"&gt;David D. Busch (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jOVSzasqzQ4C&amp;pg=PT11 ''Nikon D70 Digital Field Guide'', page 11], [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-to-late 1990s, DSLR cameras became common among consumers. By the mid-2000s, DSLR cameras had largely replaced film cameras.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2000, [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the world's first digital [[camera phone]], the [[J-SH04]] [[J-Phone]], in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoista.net/post/18437919296/evolution-of-the-cameraphone-from-sharp-j-sh04-to |title=Evolution of the Camera phone: From Sharp J-SH04 to Nokia 808 Pureview |publisher=Hoista.net |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-2000s, higher-end [[cell phones]] had an integrated digital camera. By the beginning of the 2010s, almost all [[smartphone]]s had an integrated digital camera.

== Image sensors ==
{{Further|Image sensor}}
The two major types of digital image sensor are [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] and [[CMOS]]. A CCD sensor has one amplifier for all the pixels, while each pixel in a CMOS [[active-pixel sensor]] has its own amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebay.de/gds/What-Is-the-Difference-Between-a-CCD-and-CMOS-Video-Camera-/10000000177630865/g.html |title=What Is the Difference Between a CCD and CMOS Video Camera |accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to CCDs, CMOS sensors use less power.&lt;ref name="blog" /&gt; Cameras with a small sensor use a [[back-illuminated sensor|back-side-illuminated]] CMOS (BSI-CMOS) sensor. Overall final image quality is more dependent on the [[image processing]] capability of the camera, than on sensor type.&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avocebehindthelens.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/technology-bsi-cmos-cmos-ccd-whats-the-deal/ |title=Technology: BSI-CMOS, CMOS, CCD… What’s the deal |date=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/why-the-iphone-4-takes-good-low-light-photos-bsi-cmos-sensors-explained/ |title=Why the iPhone 4 takes good low-light photos: BSI CMOS sensors explained! |author=Joshua Goldman |accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensor resolution ===

The [[Image resolution|resolution]] of a digital camera is often limited by the image sensor&lt;ref&gt;QuinStreet Inc: [http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/digital_camera.html What is digital camera?]; retrieved 2013-09-07&lt;/ref&gt; that turns light into discrete signals. The brighter the image at a given point on the sensor, the larger the value that is read for that [[pixel]].
Depending on the physical structure of the sensor, a [[color filter array]] may be used, which requires [[demosaicing]] to recreate a full-color image.
The number of pixels in the sensor determines the camera's "[[pixel count]]".
In a typical sensor, the pixel count is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns. For example, a 1,000 by 1,000 pixel sensor would have 1,000,000 pixels, or 1 [[megapixel]].

===Image sharpness===
Final quality of an image depends on all optical transformations in the chain of producing the image. Carl Zeiss points out that the weakest link in an optical chain determines the final image quality. In case of a digital camera, a simplistic way of expressing it is that the lens determines the maximum sharpness of the image while the image sensor determines the maximum resolution. The illustration on the right can be said to compare a lens with very poor sharpness on a camera with high resolution, to a lens with good sharpness on a camera with lower resolution.

===Methods of image capture===

[[Image:Ccd-sensor.jpg|At the heart of a digital camera is a CCD or a [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS]] image sensor.|thumb|upright]]
[[Image:Partly disassembled Lumix digital camera.jpg|thumb|Digital camera, partly disassembled. The lens assembly (bottom right) is partially removed, but the sensor (top right) still captures an image, as seen on the LCD screen (bottom left).]]

Since the first digital backs were introduced, there have been three main methods of capturing the image, each based on the hardware configuration of the sensor and color filters.

''Single-shot'' capture systems use either one sensor chip with a [[Bayer filter]] mosaic, or three separate image sensors (one each for the [[primary additive colors]] red, green, and blue) which are exposed to the same image via a beam splitter (see [[Three-CCD camera]]).

''Multi-shot'' exposes the sensor to the image in a sequence of three or more openings of the lens [[aperture]]. There are several methods of application of the multi-shot technique. The most common originally was to use a single image sensor with three filters passed in front of the sensor in sequence to obtain the additive color information. Another multiple shot method is called [[Microscanning]]. This method uses a single sensor chip with a Bayer filter and physically moved the sensor on the focus plane of the lens to construct a higher resolution image than the native resolution of the chip. A third version combined the two methods without a Bayer filter on the chip.

The third method is called ''scanning'' because the sensor moves across the focal plane much like the sensor of an [[image scanner]]. The ''linear'' or ''tri-linear'' sensors in scanning cameras utilize only a single line of photosensors, or three lines for the three colors. Scanning may be accomplished by moving the sensor (for example, when using [[color co-site sampling]]) or by rotating the whole camera. A digital [[rotating line camera]] offers images of very high total resolution.

The choice of method for a given capture is determined largely by the subject matter. It is usually inappropriate to attempt to capture a subject that moves with anything but a single-shot system. However, the higher color fidelity and larger file sizes and resolutions available with multi-shot and scanning backs make them attractive for commercial photographers working with stationary subjects and large-format photographs.{{original research inline|date=August 2013}}

Improvements in single-shot cameras and image file processing at the beginning of the 21st century made single shot cameras almost completely dominant, even in high-end commercial photography.

=== Filter mosaics, interpolation, and aliasing ===

[[Image:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|left|The Bayer arrangement of color filters on the pixel array of an image sensor.]]
Most current consumer digital cameras use a [[Bayer filter|Bayer filter mosaic]] in combination with an optical [[anti-aliasing filter]] to reduce the aliasing due to the reduced sampling of the different primary-color images.
A demosaicing algorithm is used to [[interpolation|interpolate]] color information to create a full array of RGB image data.

Cameras that use a beam-splitter single-shot [[3CCD]] approach, three-filter multi-shot approach, color co-site sampling or [[Foveon X3 sensor]] do not use anti-aliasing filters, nor demosaicing.

[[Firmware]] in the camera, or a software in a raw converter program such as [[Adobe DNG Converter|Adobe Camera Raw]], interprets the raw data from the sensor to obtain a full color image, because the [[RGB color model]] requires three intensity values for each pixel: one each for the red, green, and blue (other color models, when used, also require three or more values per pixel).
A single sensor element cannot simultaneously record these three intensities, and so a [[color filter array]] (CFA) must be used to selectively filter a particular color for each pixel.

The Bayer filter pattern is a repeating 2x2 mosaic pattern of light filters, with green ones at opposite corners and red and blue in the other two positions. The high proportion of green takes advantage of properties of the human visual system, which determines brightness mostly from green and is far more sensitive to brightness than to hue or saturation. Sometimes a 4-color filter pattern is used, often involving two different hues of green. This provides potentially more accurate color, but requires a slightly more complicated interpolation process.

The color intensity values not captured for each pixel can be [[interpolate]]d from the values of adjacent pixels which represent the color being calculated.

=== Sensor size and angle of view ===

Cameras with digital image sensors that are smaller than the typical 35mm film size have a smaller field or [[angle of view]] when used with a lens of the same [[focal length]]. This is because angle of view is a function of both focal length and the sensor or film size used.

[[Image:kids 50mm 100mm.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;!-- comment welcome --&gt;]]

The [[crop factor]] is relative to the [[135 film|35mm film format]]. If a smaller sensor is used, as in most digicams, the field of view is cropped by the sensor to smaller than the 35mm full-frame format's field of view. This narrowing of the field of view may be described as [[crop factor]], a factor by which a longer focal length lens would be needed to get the same field of view on a 35mm film camera. [[Full-frame digital SLR]]s utilize a sensor of the same size as a frame of 35mm film.

Common values for field of view crop in DSLRs using [[active pixel sensor]]s include 1.3x for some [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] (APS-H) sensors, 1.5x for [[Sony]] APS-C sensors used by [[Nikon]], [[Pentax]] and [[Konica Minolta]] and for [[Fujifilm]] sensors, 1.6 (APS-C) for most Canon sensors, ~1.7x for [[Sigma Corporation|Sigma]]'s [[Foveon]] sensors and 2x for [[Kodak]] and [[Panasonic]] 4/3-inch sensors currently used by [[Olympus company|Olympus]] and Panasonic. Crop factors for non-SLR consumer compact and [[bridge digital camera|bridge]] cameras are larger, frequently 4x or more.

==Types of digital cameras==
Digital cameras come in a wide range of sizes, prices and capabilities. In addition to general purpose digital cameras, specialized cameras including [[multispectral imaging]] equipment and [[astrograph]]s are used for scientific, military, medical and other special purposes.

===Compacts===
[[File:Sony DSC-W170.jpg|thumb|left|Subcompact with lens assembly retracted]]
[[File:Disassembled digital camera.jpg|thumb|left|Disassembled compact digital camera]]
Compact cameras are intended to be portable (pocketable) and are particularly suitable for casual "[[snapshot (photography)|snapshots]]".

Many incorporate a retractable lens assembly that provides optical zoom. In most models, an auto actuating lens cover protects the lens from elements. Most ruggedized or [[Waterproof digital camera|water-resistant]] models do not retract, and most with [[superzoom]] capability do not retract fully.

Compact cameras are usually designed to be [[Usability|easy to use]].  Almost all include an automatic mode, or "auto mode", which automatically makes all camera settings for the user.  Some also have manual controls. Compact digital cameras typically contain a small sensor which trades-off picture quality for compactness and simplicity; images can usually only be stored using [[lossy compression]] ([[JPEG]]). Most have a built-in [[flash (photography)|flash]] usually of low power, sufficient for nearby subjects.  A few high end compact digital cameras have a [[hotshoe]] for connecting to an external flash. [[Live preview]] is almost always used to frame the photo on an integrated LCD. In addition to being able to take still photographs almost all compact cameras have the ability to record [[motion picture|video]].

Compacts often have [[Macro photography|macro]] capability and [[zoom lens]]es, but the zoom range (up to 30x) is generally enough for [[candid photography]] but less than is available on [[bridge camera]]s (more than 60x), or the interchangeable lenses of DSLR cameras available at a much higher cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/18-300mm.htm |title=Nikon 18-300mm VR DX AF-S G ED NIKKOR, $1,000 |author=Ken Rockwell |accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autofocus]] systems in compact digital cameras generally are based on a contrast-detection methodology using the image data from the live preview feed of the main imager. Some compact digital cameras use a hybrid autofocus system similar to what is commonly available on DSLRs. 

Typically, compact digital cameras incorporate a nearly silent [[leaf shutter]] into the lens but play a simulated camera sound &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steves-digicams.com/knowledge-center/how-tos/digital-camera-operation/digital-cameras-turn-shutter-sound-on-or-off.html#b Turn shutter sound on or off] Steve's Digicams&lt;/ref&gt; for [[skeuomorph]]ic purposes.

For low cost and small size, these cameras typically use [[Image sensor format#Table of sensor formats and sizes|image sensor format]]s with a diagonal between 6 and 11&amp;nbsp;mm, corresponding to a crop factor between 7 and 4. This gives them weaker low-light performance, greater [[depth of field]], generally closer focusing ability, and smaller components than cameras using larger sensors. Some cameras use a larger sensor including, at the high end, a pricey full-frame sensor compact camera, such as [[Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX1]], but have capability near that of a DSLR.

A variety of additional features are available depending on the model of the camera. Such features include [[Geotagging|GPS]], compass, [[barometer]]s and [[altimeter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cameras.co.uk/specs/panasonic-dmc-ft3.cfm Panasonic DMC FT3 Specification]. Cameras.co.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Starting in 2011, some compact digital cameras can take 3D still photos. These 3D compact [[stereo camera]]s can capture 3D panoramic photos with dual lens or even single lens for play back on a [[3D TV]].

In 2013, Sony released two add-on camera models without display, to be used with a smartphone or tablet, controlled by a [[mobile application]] via WiFi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/09/04/sony-qx100-qx10-lens-cameras/ |title=Sony DSC-QX100 and QX10 lens cameras bring top-notch optics to any smartphone or tablet, we go hands-on (video) |date=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rugged compacts ===
Rugged compact cameras typically include protection against submersion, hot and cold conditions, shock and pressure. Terms used to describe such properties include waterproof, freezeproof, heatproof, shockproof and crushproof, respectively. Nearly all major camera manufacturers have at least one product in this category. Some are waterproof to a considerable depth up to 82 feet (27 m);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manmakesfire.com/3-best-waterproof-cameras-2014-rugged-compact-ready-action/ |title=3 Best Waterproof Cameras for 2015: Rugged, Compact, and Ready for Action |author=Chris Maxcer |accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; others only 10 feet (3m), but only a few will float. Ruggeds often lack some of the features of ordinary compact camera, but they have video capability and the majority can record sound. Most have image stabilization and built-in flash. Touchscreen LCD and GPS do not work under water.

=== Action cameras ===
{{details|Action camera}}
[[GoPro]] and other brands offer action cameras which are rugged, small and can be easily attached to [[helmet cam|helmet]], arm, bicycle, etc.  Most have wide angle and fixed focus, and can take still pictures and video, typically with sound.

The rising popularity of action cameras is in line with many people desiring to share photos or videos in [[social media]].  Many competitive manufacturers of action cameras results in many options and lowered, competitive prices, and nowadays, cameras are sold bundled with waterproof housings, accessories, and mountings compatible with the popular GoPro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/action-camera-market.html |title=Action Camera Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 - 2024 |author= |accessdate=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===360-degree cameras===
The 360-degree camera can take picture or video 360 degrees using two lenses back-to-back and shooting at the same time. Some of the cameras are Ricoh Theta S, Nikon Keymission 360 and Samsung Gear 360. Nico360 was launched in 2016 and claimed as the world's smallest 360-degree camera with size 46 x 46 x 28&amp;nbsp;mm (1.8 x 1.8 x 1.1 in) and price less than $200. With [[virtual reality]] mode built-in stitching, Wifi, and Bluetooth, live streaming can be done. Due to it also being water resistant, the Nico360 can be used as action camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/nico360-camera-smallest/44421/ |title=Big plans for "world’s smallest" 360-degree camera |author=Simon Crisp |date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridge cameras===
[[File:Sony DSC-H2 01.jpg|thumb|Sony DSC-H2]]
{{Main|Bridge camera}}

Bridge cameras physically resemble DSLRs, and are sometimes called DSLR-shape or DSLR-like. They provide some similar features but, like compacts, they use a fixed lens and a small sensor. Some compact cameras have also PSAM mode. Most use [[live preview]] to frame the image. Their usual autofocus is by the same contrast-detect mechanism as compacts, but many bridge cameras have a [[manual focus]] mode and some have a separate focus ring for greater control.

Big physical size and small sensor allow [[superzoom]] and wide [[aperture]]. Bridge cameras generally include an [[image stabilization]] system to enable longer handheld exposures, sometimes better than DSLR for low light condition.

As of 2014, bridge cameras come in two principal classes in terms of sensor size, firstly the more traditional 1/2.3" sensor (as measured by [[image sensor format]]) which gives more flexibility in lens design and allows for handholdable zoom from 20 to 24mm (35mm equivalent) wide angle all the way up to over 1000&amp;nbsp;mm supertele, and secondly a 1" sensor that allows better image quality particularly in low light (higher ISO) but puts greater constraints on lens design, resulting in zoom lenses that stop at 200mm (constant aperture, e.g. Sony RX10) or 400mm (variable aperture, e.g. Panasonic Lumix FZ1000) equivalent, corresponding to an optical zoom factor of roughly 10 to 15.

Some bridge cameras have a lens thread to attach accessories such as wide-angle or [[Teleconverter|telephoto converters]] as well as filters such as UV or [[Polarizing filter (photography)|Circular Polarizing]] filter and lens hoods. The scene is composed by viewing the display or the [[electronic viewfinder]] (EVF). Most have a slightly longer [[shutter lag]] than a DSLR. Many of these cameras can store images in a raw format in addition to supporting JPEG.&lt;ref&gt;JPEG is a lossy compression format with less colour depth than typical of raw formats; however, most raw formats require demosaicing ("raw converter") software to be viewed properly.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority have a built-in flash, but only a few have a [[hotshoe]].

In bright sun, the quality difference between a good compact camera and a digital SLR is minimal but bridge cameras are more portable, cost less and have a greater zoom ability. Thus a bridge camera may better suit outdoor daytime activities, except when seeking professional-quality photos.&lt;ref&gt;Digital SLR vs Compact SuperZoom Camera

{{Main|Mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera}}

In late 2008, a new type of camera emerged called mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera (MILC), which uses various sensors and offers lens interchangeability. These are simpler and more compact than DSLRs due to not having a lens reflex system. MILC camera models are available with various sensor sizes including: a small 1/2.3&amp;nbsp;inch sensor, as is commonly used in [[bridge camera]]s such as the original [[Pentax Q]] (more recent Pentax Q versions have a slightly larger 1/1.7&amp;nbsp;inch sensor); a 1-inch sensor; a [[Micro Four Thirds system|Micro Four Thirds]] sensor; an APS-C sensor such as the Sony NEX series, [[Fujifilm X series]], [[Pentax K-01]], and [[Canon EOS M]]; and some, such as the [[Sony α7]], use a full frame (35&amp;nbsp;mm) sensor and even [[Hasselblad]] X1D is the first medium format MILC. Some MILC cameras have a separate electronic viewfinder. In other cameras the back display is used as a viewfinder in same way as in compact cameras. A disadvantage of MILC compared to DSLR is battery life due to the energy consumption of the [[electronic viewfinder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/opinion/rise-mirrorless-compact-system-cameras-94896 |title=The rise of mirrorless compact system cameras |author=Andy Westlake |date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olympus and Panasonic released many Micro Four Thirds cameras with interchangeable lenses which are fully compatible each other without any adapter, while the others have proprietary mounts. In 2014, Kodak released its first Micro Four Third system camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpreview.com/previews/kodak-pixpro-s-1/ |title=Kodak Pixpro S-1 First Impressions Review |author=Andy Westlake |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2014|3}}, MILC cameras are available which appeal to both amateurs and professionals.&lt;ref name="Engadget-930976"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/03/13/nikon-1-v3/ |title=Nikon 1 V3 camera unveiled: $1,200, 120fps slow motion, 20fps continuous shooting |work=[[Engadget]] |date=March 13, 2014 |publisher=[[AOL]] |accessdate=March 19, 2014 |first=Richard |last=Lawler |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320035108/http://www.engadget.com/2014/03/13/nikon-1-v3/ |archivedate=March 20, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modular cameras{{anchor|SmartShot}} ===
While most digital cameras with interchangeable lenses feature a lens-mount of some kind, there are also a number of modular cameras, where the shutter and sensor are incorporated into the lens module.

The first such modular camera was the [[Minolta Dimâge V]] in 1996, followed by the [[Minolta Dimâge EX 1500]] in 1998 and the [[Minolta MetaFlash 3D 1500]] in 1999. In 2009, Ricoh released the [[Ricoh GXR]] modular camera.

At CES 2013, [[Sakar International]] announced the [[Polaroid iM1836]], an 18 MP camera with 1"-sensor with interchangeable sensor-lens. An adapter for [[Micro Four Thirds]], Nikon and K-mount lenses was planned to ship with the camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connect.dpreview.com/post/3952862814/polaroid-announces-android-camera-with-interchangeable-lenses |title=Polaroid offers first Android camera with interchangeable lenses |date=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of add-on camera modules for [[smartphone]]s called lens-style cameras (lens camera). They contain all components of a digital camera in a module, but lack a viewfinder, display and most of the controls.  Instead they can be mounted to a [[smartphone]] and use its display and controls. Lens-style cameras include:

=== Digital single-lens reflex cameras ===
[[File:E-30-Cutmodel.jpg|thumb|Cutaway of an [[Olympus E-30]] DSLR]]
{{Main|Digital single-lens reflex camera}}

Digital [[single-lens reflex camera]]s (DSLR) use a reflex mirror that can reflect the light and also can swivel from one position to another position and back to initial position.  By default, the reflex mirror is set 45 degree from horizontal, blocks the light to the sensor and reflects light from the lens to penta-mirror/prism at the DSLR camera and after some reflections arrives at the viewfinder. The reflex mirror is pulled out horizontally below the penta-mirror/prism when shutter release is fully pressed, so the viewfinder will be dark and the light/image can directly strike the sensor at the time of exposure (speed setting).

Autofocus is accomplished using sensors in the mirror box. Some DSLRs have a "[[Live preview|live view]]" mode that allows framing using the screen with image from the sensor.

These cameras have much larger sensors than the other types, typically 18&amp;nbsp;mm to 36&amp;nbsp;mm on the diagonal (crop factor 2, 1.6, or 1). The larger sensor permits more light to be received by each pixel; this, combined with the relatively large lenses provides superior low-light performance. For the same field of view and the same aperture, a larger sensor gives shallower focus.
They use [[interchangeable lens]]es for versatility. Usually some lenses are made for digital SLR use only, but recent trend the lenses can also be used in detachable lens video camera with or without adapter.

===Digital Single Lens Translucent (DSLT) cameras===
{{main|Sony SLT camera}}
A DSLT uses a '''fixed''' [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]] mirror instead of a '''moving''' reflex mirror as in DSLR. A translucent mirror or transmissive mirror or semi-transparent mirror is a mirror which reflects the light to two things at the same time. It reflects it along the path to a pentaprism/pentamirror which then goes to an optical view finder (OVF) as is done with a reflex mirror in DSLR cameras. The translucent mirror also sends light along a second path to the sensor. The total amount of light is not changed, just some of the light travels one path and some of it travels the other. The consequences are that DSLT cameras should shoot a half stop differently from DSL. One advantage of using a DSLT camera is the blind moments a DSLR user experiences while the reflecting mirror is moved to send the light to the sensor instead of the viewfinder do not exist for DSLT cameras. Because there is no time at which light is not traveling along both paths, DSLT cameras get the benefit of continuous auto-focus tracking. This is especially beneficial for burst mode shooting in low-light conditions and also for tracking when taking video.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Until early 2014, only Sony had released DSLT cameras. By March 2013, Sony had released more DSLTs than DSLRs with a relatively complete lenses line-up.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Digital rangefinders===

{{Main|Rangefinder camera#Digital rangefinder}}

A rangefinder is a device to measure subject distance, with the intent to adjust the focus of a camera's objective lens accordingly ([[open-loop controller]]). The rangefinder and lens focusing mechanism may or may not be coupled. In common parlance, the term "rangefinder camera" is interpreted very narrowly to denote manual-focus cameras with a visually-read out optical rangefinder based on [[parallax]]. Most digital cameras achieve focus through analysis of the image captured by the objective lens and distance estimation, if it is provided at all, is only a byproduct of the focusing process ([[closed-loop controller]]).

===Line-scan camera systems===
[[File:Strip_photo_of_San_Francisco_Cable_Car_10.jpg|thumb|A San Francisco cable car, imaged using an Alkeria Necta N4K2-7C line scan camera with a shutter speed of 250 microseconds, or 4000 frames per second.]]
A line-scan camera traditionally has a single row of pixel sensors, instead of a matrix of them. The lines are continuously fed to a computer that joins them to each other and makes an image. This is most commonly done by connecting the camera output to a [[frame grabber]] which resides in a [[PCI slot]] of an industrial computer. The frame grabber acts to buffer the image and sometimes provide some processing before delivering to the computer software for processing.

Multiple rows of sensors may be used to make colored images, or to increase sensitivity by TDI ([[Time delay and integration]]).
 
Many industrial applications require a wide field of view. Traditionally maintaining consistent light over large 2D areas is quite difficult. With a line scan camera all that is necessary is to provide even illumination across the “line” currently being viewed by the camera. This makes possible sharp pictures of objects that pass the camera at high speed.

Such cameras are also commonly used to make [[photo finish]]es, to determine the winner when multiple competitors cross the finishing line at nearly the same time. They can also be used as industrial instruments for analyzing fast processes.

Linescan cameras are also extensively used in imaging from satellites (see [[push broom scanner]]). In this case the row of sensors is perpendicular to the direction of satellite motion. Linescan cameras are widely used in [[Image scanner|scanner]]s. In this case, the camera moves horizontally.

=== Stand alone camera ===
Stand alone cameras can be used as [[remote camera]]. One kind weighs 2.31 ounces (65.5&amp;nbsp;g), with a periscope shape, IPx7 water-resistance and dust-resistance rating and can be enhanced to IPx8 by using a cap. They have no viewfinder or LCD. Lens is a 146 degree wide angle or standard lens, with fixed focus. It can have a microphone and speaker, And it can take photos and video. As a remote camera, a phone app using Android or iOS is needed to send live video, change settings, take photos, or use time lapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/08/htc-re-camera/ |title=HTC's RE camera is a GoPro for NoPros |author=Brad Molen |date=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration into other devices ==
Many devices have a built-in digital camera, including, for example, [[camera phone|smartphones]], mobile phones, PDAs and laptop computers. Built-in cameras generally store the images in the JPEG file format.

Mobile phones incorporating digital cameras were introduced in Japan in 2001 by J-Phone. In 2003 [[camera phone]]s outsold stand-alone digital cameras, and in 2006 they outsold film and digital stand-alone cameras. Five billion camera phones were sold in five years, and by 2007 more than half of the [[installed base]] of all mobile phones were camera phones. Sales of separate cameras peaked in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/technology/15iht-navigate.html Kevin J. O'Brien, New York Times, 2010 Nov 15] Smartphone Sales Taking Toll on G.P.S. Devices&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market trends ==
[[File:Sale of smartphones and cameras.png|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=Chart of sale of smartphones (with built-in cameras) compared to digital cameras 2009-2013 showing smartphone sale soaring while camera sale is stagnating|Sale of smartphones compared to digital cameras 2009-2013]]

Sales of traditional digital cameras have declined due to the increasing use of [[smartphone]]s for casual photography, which also enable easier manipulation and sharing of photos through the use of [[Mobile app|apps]] and web-based services. "Bridge cameras", in contrast, have held their ground with functionality that most smartphone cameras lack, such as optical zoom and other advanced features.&lt;ref name=nyt-androidcamera&gt;{{cite web|title=Smile, and Say ‘Android’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/technology/personaltech/androidcameras-from-nikon-and-samsung-go-beyond-cellphones-review.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/photography-video-capture/cameras/bridge-cameras-a-growing-market-says-canon-and-nikon-1064839 |title=Bridge cameras a growing market says Canon and Nikon |date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DSLRs have also lost ground to [[Mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera]] (MILC)s offering the same sensor size in a smaller camera. A few expensive ones use a full-frame sensor as DSLR professional cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photographylife.com/future-digital-cameras |title=The Future of Digital Cameras |accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the convenience and flexibility of smartphone cameras, some manufacturers produced "smart" digital cameras that combine features of traditional cameras with those of a smartphone. In 2012, Nikon and Samsung released the [[Nikon Coolpix S800c|Coolpix S800c]] and [[Samsung Galaxy Camera|Galaxy Camera]], the first two digital cameras to run the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. Since this [[software platform]] is used in many smartphones, they can integrate with services (such as [[e-mail attachment]]s, [[social networking service|social networks]] and [[photo sharing]] sites) as smartphones do, and use other Android-compatible software as well.&lt;ref name=nyt-androidcamera/&gt;

In an inversion, some phone makers have introduced smartphones with cameras designed to resemble traditional digital cameras. Nokia released the [[Nokia 808 PureView|808 PureView]] and [[Nokia Lumia 1020|Lumia 1020]] in 2012 and 2013; the two devices respectively run the [[Symbian]] and [[Windows Phone]] operating systems, and both include a 41-megapixel camera (along with a camera grip attachment for the latter).&lt;ref name=gsmarena-lumia1020&gt;{{cite web|title=Nokia Lumia 1020 preview: Take two|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_lumia_1020-review-952.php|work=GSMArena|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Samsung introduced the Galaxy S4 Zoom, having a 16-megapixel camera and 10x optical zoom, combining traits from the [[Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini|Galaxy S4 Mini]] with the Galaxy Camera.&lt;ref name=laptop-phonecameras&gt;{{cite web|title=Nokia Lumia 1020 vs. Galaxy S4 Zoom: The Best Camera Phone Is…|url=http://blog.laptopmag.com/nokia-lumia-1020-vs-galaxy-s4-zoom|work=Laptop|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panasonic Lumix DMC-CM1 is an Android KitKat 4.4 smartphone with 20MP, 1" sensor, the largest sensor for a smartphone ever, with Leica fixed lens equivalent of 28mm at F2.8, can take RAW image and 4K video, has 21mm thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connect.dpreview.com/post/7107523787/panasonic-announces-lumix-dmc-cm1-smartphone-with-1-inch-sensor |title=Panasonic announces Lumix DMC-CM1 smartphone with 1-inch sensor |author=Lars Rehm |date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2018 [[Huawei P20]] Pro is an android Oreo 8.1 has triple Leica lenses in the back of the smartphone with 40MP 1/1.7" [[RGB]] sensor as first lens, 20MP 1/2.7" [[monochrome]] sensor as second lens and 8MP 1/4" RGB sensor with 3x optical zoom as third lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_p20_pro-9106.php |title=Huawei P20 Pro |accessdate=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combination of first lens and second lens will produce [[bokeh]] image with larger [[high dynamic range]], whereas combination of [[mega pixel]] first lens and optical zoom will produce maximum 5x [[digital zoom]] without loss of quality by reducing the image size to 8MP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review/#/2/1 |title=Huawei P20 Pro review |author=Andy Boxall |date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Light-field camera]]s were introduced in 2013 with one consumer product and several professional ones.

After a big dip of sales in 2012, consumer digital camera sales declined again in 2013 by 36 percent. In 2011, compact digital cameras sold 10 million per month. In 2013, sales fell to about 4 million per month. DSLR and MILC sales also declined in 2013 by 10–15% after almost ten years of double digit growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eoshd.com/content/11409/consumer-dslrs-dead-5-years

|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Worldwide unit sales of digital cameras is continuously declining from 148 million in 2011 to 58 million in 2015 and tends to decrease more in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/269927/sales-of-analog-and-digital-cameras-worldwide-since-2002/ |title=Worldwide unit sales of digital cameras from 2011 to 2016 (in millions) |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film camera sold got the peak at 36.671 million units in 1997 and digital camera sold began in 1999. In 2008, film camera market was dead and digital camera sold got the peak by 121.463 million units in 2010. In 2002, cell phone with camera has been introduced and in 2003 the cell phone with camera sold 80 million units per year. In 2011 the cell phone with camera sold hundreds of millions per year, when digital camera sold initialized to decline. In 2015, digital camera sold is 35.395 million units or only less than a third of digital camera sold number in a peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number in a peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tomstirrphotography.com/digital-camera-sales-continued-decline |title=DIGITAL CAMERA SALES CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN 2015 |author=Thomas Stirr |date=April 2, 2016 |accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connectivity==

=== Transferring photos ===
Many digital cameras can connect directly to a computer to transfer data:-
* Early cameras used the [[Personal computer|PC]] [[serial port]]. [[USB]] is now the most widely used method (most cameras are viewable as [[USB mass-storage device class|USB mass storage]]), though some have a [[IEEE 1394 interface|FireWire]] port. Some cameras use [[Picture Transfer Protocol|USB PTP]] mode for connection instead of USB MSC; some offer both modes.
{{anchor|Wireless media transfer}}
* Other cameras use [[wireless connection]]s, via [[Bluetooth]] or [[IEEE 802.11]] [[Wi-Fi]], such as the [[Kodak EasyShare One]]. [[Secure Digital#Integrated Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi integrated Memory cards]] (SDHC, SDXC) can transmit stored images, video and other files to computers or [[smartphone]]s.  Mobile operating systems such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]] allow automatic upload and backup or sharing of images over Wi-Fi to [[photo sharing]] and [[cloud computing|cloud services]].
{{anchor|Tethering}}
* Cameras with integrated Wi-Fi or specific Wi-Fi adapters mostly allow camera control, especially [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] release, [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] control and more ([[tethering]]) from computer or smartphone apps additionally to the transfer of media data.
* Cameraphones and some high-end stand-alone digital cameras also use [[cellular network]]s to connect for sharing images. The most common standard on cellular networks is the MMS [[Multimedia Messaging Service]], commonly called "picture messaging". The second method with [[smartphone]]s is to send a picture as an [[email attachment]]. Many old cameraphones, however, do not support email.

A common alternative is the use of a [[card reader]] which may be capable of reading several types of storage media, as well as high speed transfer of data to the computer. Use of a card reader also avoids draining the camera battery during the download process. An external card reader allows convenient direct access to the images on a collection of storage media. But if only one storage card is in use, moving it back and forth between the camera and the reader can be inconvenient. Many computers have a card reader built in, at least for SD cards.

===Printing photos===

Many modern cameras support the [[PictBridge]] standard, which allows them to send data directly to a PictBridge-capable [[computer printer]] without the need for a computer.

Wireless connectivity can also provide for printing photos without a cable connection.

{{Anchor|Instant-print}}
An ''instant-print camera'', is a digital camera with a built-in [[printer (computing)|printer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpmag.com/how-to/tip-of-the-week/options-for-instant-print-cameras/|title=Options For Instant-Print Cameras|date=2016-03-28|author=William Sawalich|website=Digital Photo Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confers a similar functionality as an [[instant camera]] which uses [[instant film]] to quickly generate a physical photograph. Such non-digital cameras were popularized by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reinventing Instant Photography for the Digital Age |publisher=Polaroid |url=http://thenewinstant.com/news-updates/Polaroid%20Introduces%20the%20Polaroid%20PoGo%E2%84%A2%20Instant%20Digital%20Camera/ |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-15|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090121175859/http://thenewinstant.com/news-updates/Polaroid%20Introduces%20the%20Polaroid%20PoGo%E2%84%A2%20Instant%20Digital%20Camera/ |archivedate=2009-01-21|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displaying photos===

Many digital cameras include a video output port.  Usually [[sVideo]], it sends a standard-definition video signal to a television, allowing the user to show one picture at a time.  Buttons or menus on the camera allow the user to select the photo, advance from one to another, or automatically send a "slide show" to the TV.

[[HDMI]] has been adopted by many high-end digital camera makers, to show photos in their high-resolution quality on an [[HDTV]].

In January 2008, [[Silicon Image]] announced a new technology for sending video from mobile devices to a television in digital form. [[Mobile High-definition Link|MHL]] sends pictures as a video stream, up to 1080p resolution, and is compatible with HDMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mobile High-Definition Link Technology Gives Consumers the Ability to Link Mobile Devices to HDTVs with Support for Audio and Video |publisher=Silicon Image |url=http://www.siliconimage.com/news/releasedetails.aspx?id=480 |date=January 7, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[DVD recorder]]s and television sets can read memory cards used in cameras; alternatively several types of flash card readers have TV output capability.

==Weather-sealing and waterproofing==
Cameras can be equipped with a varying amount of environmental sealing to provide protection against splashing water, moisture (humidity and fog), dust and sand, or complete waterproofness to a certain depth and for a certain duration. The latter is one of the approaches to allow [[underwater photography]], the other approach being the use of waterproof housings. Many waterproof digital cameras are also shockproof and resistant to low temperatures.

Some waterproof cameras can be fitted with a waterproof housing to increase the operational depth range. The Olympus 'Tough' range of compact cameras is an example.

==Modes==

Many digital cameras have preset [[mode dial|modes]] for different applications. Within the constraints of correct exposure various parameters can be changed, including [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]], aperture, [[focus (optics)|focus]]ing, [[light meter]]ing, [[white balance]], and equivalent sensitivity. For example, a [[portrait]] might use a wider aperture to render the background out of focus, and would seek out and focus on a human face rather than other image content.

== Image data storage ==

[[Image:Cf-card.jpg|right|thumb|A [[CompactFlash]] (CF) card, one of many media types used to store digital photographs]]

Many camera phones and most stand alone digital cameras store image data in flash [[memory card]]s or other [[removable media]]. Most stand-alone cameras use [[Secure Digital card|SD]] format, while a few use [[CompactFlash]] or other types. In January 2012, a faster [[XQD card]] format was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/06/sony-xqd-memory-cards/ |title=Sony Announces World’s First XQD Memory Cards |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2014, some high end cameras have two hot-swapable memory slots. Photographers can swap one of the memory card with camera-on. Each memory slot can accept either Compact Flash or SD Card. All new Sony cameras also have two memory slots, one for its [[Memory Stick]] and one for SD Card, but not hot-swapable.

A few cameras used other removable storage such as [[Microdrive]]s (very small [[hard disk drive]]s), [[CD single]] (185&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]]), and [[3.5" floppy disk]]s.  Other unusual formats include:
* Onboard flash memory &amp;mdash; Cheap cameras and cameras secondary to the device's main use (such as a camera phone)
* [[PC Card]] hard drives &amp;mdash; early professional cameras (discontinued)
* [[Thermal printer]] &amp;mdash; known only in one model of camera that printed images immediately rather than storing
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Most manufacturers of digital cameras do not provide drivers and software to allow their cameras to work with [[Linux]] or other [[free software]]. Still, many cameras use the standard [[USB storage]] protocol, and are thus easily usable. Other cameras are supported by the [[gPhoto]] project.

===File formats===

{{Main|Image file formats}}

The Joint Photography Experts Group standard (JPEG) is the most common file format for storing image data.  Other file types include Tagged Image File Format ([[TIFF]]) and various [[Raw image format]]s.

Many cameras, especially high-end ones, support a [[raw image format]]. A raw image is the unprocessed set of pixel data directly from the camera's sensor, often saved in a [[proprietary format]]. [[Adobe Systems]] has released the [[Digital Negative|DNG]] format, a royalty-free raw image format used by at least 10 camera manufacturers.

Raw files initially had to be processed in specialized image editing programs, but over time many mainstream editing programs, such as Google's [[Picasa]], have added support for raw images. Rendering to standard images from raw sensor data allows more flexibility in making major adjustments without losing image quality or retaking the picture.

Formats for movies are [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]], [[DV]], [[MPEG]], [[QuickTime#File formats|MOV]] (often containing motion JPEG), [[WMV]], and ASF (basically the same as WMV). Recent formats include [[MP4]], which is based on the QuickTime format and uses newer compression algorithms to allow longer recording times in the same space.

Other formats that are used in cameras (but not for pictures) are the Design Rule for Camera Format ([[Design rule for Camera File system|DCF]]), an [[International Organization for Standardisation|ISO]] specification, used in almost all camera since 1998, which defines an internal file structure and naming. Also used is the Digital Print Order Format ([[DPOF]]), which dictates what order images are to be printed in and how many copies. The DCF 1998 defines a logical file system with [[8.3 filename]]s and makes the usage of either FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT mandatory for its physical layer in order to maximize platform interoperability.&lt;ref name="DC-009-2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipa.jp/english/hyoujunka/kikaku/pdf/DC-009-2010_E.pdf |title=Standard of the Camera &amp; Imaging Products Association, CIPA DC-009-Translation-2010, Design rule for Camera File system: DCF Version 2.0 (Edition 2010) |author=JEIDA/JEITA/CIPA |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930190707/http://www.cipa.jp/english/hyoujunka/kikaku/pdf/DC-009-2010_E.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cameras include [[Exchangeable image file format|Exif]] data that provides [[metadata]] about the picture. Exif data may include aperture, [[exposure time]], focal length, date and time taken, and [[Geotagged photograph|location]].

==Batteries==
Digital cameras have become smaller over time, resulting in an ongoing need to develop a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] small enough to fit in the camera and yet able to power it for a reasonable length of time.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Digital cameras utilize either proprietary or standard consumer batteries. {{as of|March 2014}}, most cameras use proprietary lithium-ion batteries while some use standard AA batteries or primarily use a proprietary Lithium-ion rechargeable battery pack but have an optional AA battery holder available.

===Proprietary=== 

The most common class of battery used in digital cameras is proprietary battery formats. These are built to a manufacturer's custom specifications. Almost all proprietary batteries are lithium-ion. In addition to being available from the [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]], aftermarket replacement batteries are commonly available for most camera models.

===Standard consumer batteries===
{{main|Commercial off-the-shelf}}

Digital cameras that utilize off-the-shelf batteries are typically designed to be able to use both single-use [[primary cell|disposable]] and [[rechargeable batteries]], but not with both types in use at the same time. The most common off-the-shelf battery size used is [[AA battery|AA]]. CR2, [[CR-V3]] batteries, and [[AAA battery|AAA batteries]] are also used in some cameras. The CR2 and CR-V3 batteries are [[lithium battery|lithium based]], intended for a single use. Rechargeable [[RCR-V3]] lithium-ion batteries are also available as an alternative to non-rechargeable CR-V3 batteries.

Some [[battery grip]]s for DSLRs come with a separate holder to accommodate AA cells as an external power source.

== Conversion of film cameras to digital ==

[[File:Reflex camera numeric.svg|thumb|[[Digital single-lens reflex camera]]]]

When digital cameras became common, many photographers asked whether their [[film camera]]s could be converted to digital.  The answer was yes and no.  For the majority of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film cameras the answer is no, the reworking and cost would be too great, especially as lenses have been evolving as well as cameras. For most a conversion to digital, to give enough space for the electronics and allow a liquid crystal display to preview, would require removing the back of the camera and replacing it with a custom built digital unit.

Many early professional SLR cameras, such as the [[Kodak DCS]] series, were developed from 35&amp;nbsp;mm film cameras. The technology of the time, however, meant that rather than being digital "backs" the bodies of these cameras were mounted on large, bulky digital units, often bigger than the camera portion itself. These were factory built cameras, however, not [[Aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] conversions.

A notable exception is the [[Nikon E2]] and [[Nikon E3]], using additional optics to convert the 35mm format to a 2/3 CCD-sensor.

A few 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras have had [[digital camera back]]s made by their manufacturer, Leica being a notable example. [[Medium format (film)|Medium format]] and [[large format]] cameras (those using film stock greater than 35&amp;nbsp;mm), have a low unit production, and typical digital backs for them cost over $10,000. These cameras also tend to be highly modular, with handgrips, film backs, winders, and lenses available separately to fit various needs.

The very large sensor these backs use leads to enormous image sizes. For example, Phase One's P45 39&amp;nbsp;MP image back creates a single TIFF image of size up to 224.6&amp;nbsp;MB, and even greater pixel counts are available. Medium format digitals such as this are geared more towards studio and [[portrait photography]] than their smaller DSLR counterparts; the [[ISO speed]] in particular tends to have a maximum of 400, versus 6400 for some DSLR cameras. (Canon EOS-1D Mark IV and [[Nikon D3S]] have ISO 12800 plus Hi-3 ISO 102400 with the Canon EOS-1Dx's ISO of 204800)

=== Digital camera backs ===
{{Main|digital camera back}}

In the industrial and high-end professional photography market, some camera systems use modular (removable) image sensors. For example, some medium format SLR cameras, such as the Mamiya 645D series, allow installation of either a digital camera back or a traditional photographic film back.

* Area array
** CCD
** CMOS
* Linear array
** CCD (monochrome)
** 3-strip CCD with color filters

Linear array cameras are also called scan backs.

* Single-shot
* Multi-shot (three-shot, usually)

Most earlier digital camera backs used linear array sensors, moving vertically to [[digitize]] the image.  Many of them only capture [[grayscale]] images. The relatively long exposure times, in the range of seconds or even minutes generally limit scan backs to studio applications, where all aspects of the photographic scene are under the photographer's control.

Some other camera backs use CCD arrays similar to typical cameras. These are called single-shot backs.

Since it is much easier to manufacture a high-quality linear CCD array with only thousands of pixels than a CCD matrix with millions, very high resolution linear CCD camera backs were available much earlier than their CCD matrix counterparts. For example, you could buy an (albeit expensive) camera back with over 7,000 pixel horizontal resolution in the mid-1990s. However, {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, it is still difficult to buy a comparable CCD matrix camera of the same resolution. Rotating line cameras, with about 10,000 color pixels in its sensor line, are able, {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, to capture about 120,000 lines during one full 360 degree rotation, thereby creating a single digital image of 1,200 Megapixels.

Most modern digital camera backs use CCD or CMOS matrix sensors. The matrix sensor captures the entire image frame at once, instead of incrementing scanning the frame area through the prolonged exposure. For example, [[Phase One (company)|Phase One]] produces a 39 million pixel digital camera back with a 49.1 x 36.8&amp;nbsp;mm CCD in 2008. This CCD array is a little smaller than a frame of [[120 film]] and much larger than a [[35 mm film|35 mm]] frame (36 x 24&amp;nbsp;mm). In comparison, consumer digital cameras use arrays ranging from 36 x 24&amp;nbsp;mm (full frame on high end consumer DSLRs) to 1.28 x 0.96&amp;nbsp;mm (on [[camera phone]]s) CMOS sensor.

[[File:fanny ronalds 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Fanny Ronalds]]
'''Mary Frances "Fanny" Ronalds''' (August 23, 1839 – July 28, 1916) was an American socialite and amateur singer who is best known for her long affair with the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] in London in the last decades of the nineteenth century and for her musical [[Salon (gathering)|salons]].

After separating from her husband, Ronalds moved with her children from New York to Paris in 1867, then to Tunis in 1869, and eventually to London in 1875. She was accepted into royal social circles and was a popular hostess. A noted beauty, she became romantically involved with Arthur Sullivan during the 1870s and continued as his companion until his death in 1900.  She was much admired as a singer and became famously associated with one of Sullivan's most popular songs, "[[The Lost Chord]]".

==Early life==
'''Mary Frances Carter''' was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], the daughter of Joseph Ballard Carter (1813–1889) and his wife,&lt;ref name=Ainger129&gt;Ainger, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 459&lt;/ref&gt; Mary ([[née]] Chamberlain) Carter (died 1898).&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, [url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0N5_DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72&amp;lpg=PT72 p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1898/03/14/102523924.pdf "Mrs. Joseph Ballard Carter Dead"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 March 1898, accessed 6 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859 at age twenty, already known as a beauty with a talent for singing, she married Pierre Lorillard Ronalds (grandson of [[Pierre Lorillard II]]), a New Yorker called by ''The New York Times'', "The Father of American Coaching".&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/07/31/104683629.pdf "Mrs. Ronalds Dies in Her London Home"], ''The New York Times'', July 31, 1916, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The young Mrs. Ronalds quickly became a noted socialite and hostess. At one magnificent ball that she gave in the early 1860s, Ronalds famously appeared dressed "as Music, in a white satin gown embroidered with bars from [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]''", wearing a harp-shaped, illuminated crown.&lt;ref name=Jacobs85&gt;Jacobs, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The Ronalds had four children.&lt;ref name=FrenchDivorce&gt;"French Divorce", ''[[New York Herald]]'', 29 April 1868, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary account described Ronalds as follows:  "Her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness, her features small and exquisitely regular. Her hair was a dark shade of brown &amp;ndash; ''châtain foncé'' [deep chestnut] &amp;ndash; and very abundant... a lovely woman, with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine, and the most beautiful teeth."&lt;ref name=Jacobs85&gt;Jacobs, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1867, she had separated from her husband, whom she never divorced. She developed a relationship with the wealthy [[Leonard Jerome]] ([[Winston Churchill]]'s grandfather), a notorious womanizer, but somehow maintained a friendship with his wife and daughters, including [[Jennie Churchill]], who remembered Ronalds singing them to sleep.&lt;ref name=Jacobs85/&gt; She often visited their home in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and when Mrs. Jerome moved to Paris with her daughters, Ronalds followed, taking her younger children.&lt;ref name=Ainger129/&gt; There, noted for her beauty and social talents, she joined the court circles of the pleasure-loving [[Empress Eugénie]] and [[Napoleon III]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacobs86&gt;Jacobs, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; During a party, Napoleon rescued her after she fell into one of his ponds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/06/04/104937419.pdf "Mrs. Pierre L. Ronalds Dead"], ''The New York Times'', June 4, 1910, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; She soon met [[Arthur Sullivan]] during one of his visits to Paris. According to ''The New York Times'', she became the leader of the American community in Paris.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; In 1868, in the French courts, Ronalds obtained a legal separation from her husband, giving her control over their children.&lt;ref name=FrenchDivorce/&gt;

Introduced by Napoleon and Eugénie to British society, she quickly became one of the many "friends" of the skirt-chasing [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] (later King Edward VII) and was soon known for hosting fashionable musical entertainments and elegant soirées for artists, musicians and high society.&lt;ref name=Ainger129/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Sir Ian. ''Fifty Years When Youth Was Gilded, War and the Larger Freedom The Times'', Mar 23, 1932, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; With the faltering of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] as unrest grew in France, her opportunities there collapsed, and Ronalds moved with her children to [[Tunis]] in 1869. There she became a partner in some farm property near [[Sidi Thabet]] with the French Count de Sancy.&lt;ref name=Tunis&gt;Schuman, Frederick L. [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.24960 ''War and Diplomacy in the French Republic''], McGraw-Hill (1931), Chapter IV, "The Taking of Tunis", pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Years as Sullivan's mistress==
[[File:Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arthur Sullivan]]
In early 1875, Ronalds left Tunis and moved to London.&lt;ref name=Ainger129/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tunis/&gt; She had continued to maintain her friendship with Jennie Jerome, who became [[Lady Randolph Churchill]] in 1874.&lt;ref name=Jacobs86/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, C. Brian and Ingrid Smyer. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ka0py52UcN4C&amp;pg=PA374 ''Best Little Stories from the Life and Times of Winston Churchill''], p. 374, Cumberland House, (2008) {{ISBN|1-58182-634-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later became friendly with [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Queen Alexandra]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Funeral&gt;''The Times'', August 3, 1916, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronalds' affair with Sullivan began not long after she moved to London. Though three years his senior, she was still in her mid-thirties and beautiful, with a strong personality.&lt;ref name=Madison&gt;Barker, John W. [http://www.madisonsavoyards.org/Public/reference/gsbio.php "Gilbert and Sullivan"], Madison Savoyards.org (2005), accessed 12 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Social conventions of the time compelled them to keep their relationship discreet. She was still married, but even had she been divorced, Sullivan would not have been willing to face the social stigma of marrying a divorcee.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship deepened after the deaths of his brother [[Fred Sullivan|Fred]] (1877) and his mother (1882).&lt;ref name=Madison/&gt; Sullivan became close with Ronalds' children and parents, especially after his brother Fred's family moved to America in 1883.  In his diaries, Sullivan referred to her as "Mrs. Ronalds" when he saw her in a public setting, but "L. W." (for "Little Woman") when they were alone together, often with a number in parentheses indicating the number of sexual acts completed.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 156–57, 161, 171, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that Ronalds was pregnant on at least two occasions,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 178 and 203-04&lt;/ref&gt; and she apparently procured an [[abortion]] in 1882 and again in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 210 and 237-38&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 [[biographical film]] ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]'' depicts Sullivan and Ronalds discussing an abortion at around the time of the production of ''[[The Mikado]]''.  [[Eleanor David]] portrays Ronalds in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc.

Sullivan had a roving eye, and his diary records the occasional quarrel when one of his many other liaisons was discovered, but he always returned to Ronalds.&lt;ref name=Madison/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;  She was his constant companion until his death in 1900, but by about 1889 or 1890, the sexual relationship seems to have ended.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 306 and 342&lt;/ref&gt;  He started to refer to her in the diary as "Auntie" (she also was called "auntie" by his nephew, [[Herbert Sullivan]]), and the tick marks indicating sexual activity were no longer there, although similar notation continued to be used for his relationships with other women who have not been identified and who were always referred to by their initials.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 289 and 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronalds was an excellent and much admired singer, using her voice for good causes since her days in New York, when she gave concerts in aid of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] troops; later "in Paris she was known as the "[[Adelina Patti|Patti]] des Salons".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Frederick Townsend. ''Things I Remember'', pp. 49–51 and 183, London: Eveleigh Nash (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;  Sullivan described her as "the best amateur singer in London".&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 167.  In the 1860s and 1870s, it was more respectable for "society" ladies to remain amateur (Jacobs, p. 86).&lt;/ref&gt;  She often performed Sullivan's songs at her famous Sunday soirees.&lt;ref name=Ainger129/&gt;&lt;ref name=Madison/&gt;  She became particularly associated with one of his most popular songs, "[[The Lost Chord]]", which he composed in 1877 as he watched over his dying brother.  Ronalds became its most famous interpreter, singing it both in private and in public, often with Sullivan himself accompanying her.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grossmith, George. [https://books.google.com/books?id=penNAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=jessie%20bond&amp;lr&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=1879&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=1943&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA256&amp;ci=175,210,291,653&amp;source=bookclip%22%3E%3Cimg#v=onepage&amp;q=jessie%20bond&amp;f=false "Sir Arthur Sullivan: A Personal Reminiscence"].

[[File:Fanny Ronalds - grave.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Ronalds's gravesite]]
In 1899 when the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] broke out, Ronalds was elected treasurer of an effort to finance an American hospital ship, the ''S.S. Maine'', to be sent to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pelteret.co.za/pdf/numismatics/s_s_maine_medallions.pdf S.S.

==Death and legacy==
When Ronalds died in 1916, at the age of 76, a copy of the manuscript of "The Lost Chord" was buried with her, at her request.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D'Oyly Carte conductor David Mackie notes in his book ''Arthur Sullivan and The Royal Society of Musicians'' (The Royal Society of Musicians of Great Britain, 2006, p.143 {{ISBN|0-9509481-3-6}}) that Mrs. Ronalds is buried with a copy and bequeathed the original manuscript to Dame [[Clara Butt]], who had recorded the song several times (see Buckley, Jack. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/sandh/2009/Jul-Dec09/sullivan_chord.htm "In Search of The Lost Chord"]. MusicWeb International, accessed 2 September 2010).  Butt's husband was the baritone [[Kennerley Rumford]].  In 1950, Rumford gave the manuscript [[Worshipful Company of Musicians]], which still owns it.&lt;/ref&gt;  She is buried in the [[Brompton Cemetery]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Court Circular, ''The Times'', August 1, 1916, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  In an inscription to a wreath that she sent to the funeral, [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] described Ronalds as "one of the kindest and most unselfish of women".&lt;ref name=Funeral/&gt;  She was survived by her children, Pierre Lorillard Ronalds, Jr., Reginald Ronalds (who became a [[Rough Riders|Rough Rider]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06EFDB1239E433A2575AC2A9619C946196D6CF "Mrs. Ronalds Begins Suit for Separation",] ''The New York Times'', July 29, 1910, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and Fannette ("Fannie") Ritchie.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref name="Funeral"/&gt;

==Origin and Meaning==
The reason that mainly the southern Ghana-based [[Ga people]] use such elaborate coffins for their funerals is explained by their religious beliefs regarding the afterlife. They believe that death is not the end and that life continues in the next world in the same way it did on earth. Ancestors are also thought to be much more powerful than the living and able to influence their relatives who are still alive. This is why families do everything they can to ensure that a dead person is sympathetic towards them as early as possible. The social status of the deceased depends primarily on the importance, success and usage of an exclusive coffin during a burial.

Fantasy coffins are only seen on the day of the burial when they are buried with the deceased. They often symbolise the dead people’s professions. Certain shapes, such as a sword or stool coffin, represent regal or priestly insignia with a magical and religious function. Only people with the appropriate status are allowed to be buried in these types of coffins. Various animals, such as lions, cockerels and crabs can represent clan totems. Similarly, only the heads of the families concerned are permitted to be buried in coffins such as these. Many coffin shapes also evoke proverbs, which are interpreted in different ways by the Ga. That is why these coffins are also called proverbial coffins (''abebuu adekai'') or in the Ga language "okadi adekai".

==History==

[[Image:Drawing by Ataa Oko, 2009.jpg|right|thumb|[[Figurative Palanquin in Ghana|Figurative palanquin]]; drawing by [[Ataa Oko]] from Ghana]] 
Among the Christians the use of custom coffins is relatively new and began in the [[Greater Accra Region]] around 1950. These coffins were formerly used only by the Ga chiefs and priests, but since around 1960 figurative coffins have become an integral part of the local funeral culture.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 52-66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians had taken over the figurative coffins from the traditional Ga who were using figurative palanquins and coffins already since the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Regula Tschumi: The Figurative Palanquins of the Ga. History and Significance'', in: African Arts, Vol. 46, Nr. 4, 2013, S. 60-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of these figurative coffins is usually attributed to Seth Kane Kwei, though the anthropologist Roberta Bonetti&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Bonetti, ''Alternate Histories of the Abebuu Adeka''i, African Arts, autumn 2010, p. 14-33: Roberta Bonetti reached the same conclusion as [[Regula Tschumi]] considers the well-known stories about the origin of the figure-coffins to have been invented: „[...] We have seen how the same criteria of authenticity that were fundamental in documenting the uniqueness and truthfulness of ancient works have been adopted for recent coffins. The proof is provided by the presumed origin of the work, which has become even more precious and exceptional ever since the death of its „invented“ inventor, Kane Kwei“.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially [[Regula Tschumi]] question this myth. The idea of making and using custom coffins was inspired by the figurative palanquins in which the Ga chiefs were carried, and in which they were sometimes buried.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 57, 221-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ataa Oko]] (b.1919), of La, according to a few sources, could have started making custom coffins and figurative palanquins around 1945. Along with Kane Kwei from Teshie and Ataa Oko from La, other carpenters may have started this innovative art form the early 1950s.

== Making the coffins ==
Figurative coffins are produced only to order. Every master craftsman employs one or more apprentices, who carry out a large part of the work. This allows the artist to make several coffins simultaneously. The coffins are generally made from the wood of the local wawa tree. In the interests of durability, items produced for museums are constructed from mahogany or some other high-grade hardwood so as to guard against cracking and attacks by insects when transferred from one climate to another. 
A coffin will take two to six weeks to produce, depending on the complexity of the construction and the carpenters’ level of experience. In urgent cases several carpenters will work on a single item. All woodworking is done using the simplest tools, without the aid of electrical appliances. 
The painting of the figural coffins can take up to two days to finish.Some models are painted by the head of the workshop, others by local sign writers, some of them are even well known on the western art market for their hand-painted movie posters. Coffin-makers and sign-painters usually decide together which patterns and colours to use for a coffin.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi.

===Ataa Oko===
[[Image:Ataa Oko, his third wife with a battleship coffin about 1960.jpg|thumb|[[Ataa Oko]] and his third wife with a battleship coffin, c.1960]]
[[Ataa Oko]] (1919-2012) was born in the coastal town of La, Ghana. From 1936 to 1939 he was trained as a carpenter in Accra. [[Ataa Oko]] was, until 2002, not in contact with foreigners, he only made coffins for Ghanaian customers and thus remained unknown in Western art circles.  In 2006, his work was for the first time exhibited at the art museum in [[Bern]].&lt;ref&gt;Six Feet Under, 2006. Art Museum Bern, and "Six Feet Under" 2007/2008 in the Deutsches Hygienemuseum, Dresden.&lt;/ref&gt;  Uninfluenced by Western customers, Ataa Oko had developed his own form of artistic language. His work is therefore different from those artists which come out of Kane Kwei's tradition. Therefore, it differs not only in terms of design, materials, but overall appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Ataa Oko, Ex. Cat., [[Collection de l'art brut]] (Hg), Infolio, 2010, p. 15-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2005 to his death in 2012, he became a painter under the supervision of anthropologist [[Regula Tschumi]]. 2010/11 he had his first one-man show in a western Art museum, in the [[Collection de l'Art Brut]] in Lausanne.

The '''Fountain in Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere''' is a fountain  located in the square in front of the church of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Rome]], Italy.  It is believed to be the oldest fountain in Rome, dating back, according to some sources, to the 8th century.  The present fountain is the work of [[Donato Bramante]], with later additions by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] and [[Carlo Fontana]]. &lt;ref&gt;Maurizia Tazartes, ''Fontaines de Rome'', pg. 48 &lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==
A fountain is believed to have stood in this square since the 8th century, but the exact date it was built is unknown.  The fountain is first mentioned in documents dating to the second half of the 15th century.   A drawing of the fountain appears on the map of Rome made by Pietro del Massaio in 1471,  along with a description of the legend of the fountain's origin. According to the legend,  which appears in the ''Chronicle'' of [[Eusebius]],  translated and finished by [[Saint Jerome]] in the fifth century, on the night of the birth of Christ a fountain of oil appeared miraculously in front of the church, which as a result was given the name "Santa Maria in fontibus."   The original fountain was supplied with water by a Roman aqueduct, the [[Aqua Traiana]].  When the aqueduct was ruined during the invasions of Rome,  water came from underground sources below the [[Janiculum]] hill.  The old fountain illustrated in the drawing of del Massaio had two vasques, one above the other, pouring water into the basin below.  &lt;ref&gt; Maurizia Tazartes, pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The fountain was reconstructed between 1499 and 1500 on the command of Giovanni Lopez, the bishop of Perouse and Bishop of the parish of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]],  who gave the commission to [[Donato Bramante]], the architect of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].  Bramante removed the upper vasque and added four carved stone wolf heads, the emblem of the Lopez family. 

The fountain was reconstructed again in 1604 by the architect Girolamo Rainaldi, the father of [[Carlo Rainaldi]],the architect of the two churches of [[Piazza del Popolo]].  At that time the fountain was connected to the newly restored [[Acqua Felice]] aqueduct.    In 1659 the fountain was connected to the [[Acqua Paola]] aqueduct and remodeled again by [[Bernini]].  Bernini replaced the octagonal basin,  moved the fountain from its original place in front of the church to a new location in the center of the square, and added sculpted seashells around the basin.   At the end of the 17th century, the architect [[Carlo Fontana]] replaced Bernini's seashells with his own sculpted seashells.  

The fountain was completely rebuilt in 1873, following the design of Bernini and Fontana, but using less expensive materials. In that occasion, the main pool was rebuilt with bardiglio marble and an imposing S.P.Q.R. sign has been placed on the external side of the shells.
It was rebuilt once again in 1930. The last maintenance has been made in 1984.

'''Free Painters and Sculptors (FPS)''' is an artist-led organisation based in [[London]], England, which regularly exhibits every year. It played a pivotal role in the establishment of [[abstract art]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

== History ==

=== Background ===

FPS was founded in 1952 by a number of members of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] who wanted to create their own painting group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fpshistory.blogspot.co.uk|title=The History of Free Painters and Sculptors|last=Rasmussen|first=Roy|date=1992|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known initially as 'Painters Group from the ICA', the idea of freedom was one of the group's core beliefs. In the aftermath of World War II it was vital for the group to be able to stand for principles of artistic freedom and each artist was free to express themselves however they chose. Artists with a 'modern approach' were welcomed, generally falling into abstract or figurative camps.

=== Formative Years ===

The first exhibition was held at the end of 1953 in the Three Arts Centre, Great Cumberland Place and was opened by art critic [[John Berger]]. Twenty six artists exhibited.

Soon after this the group was renamed the 'Free Painters Group' and annual exhibitions followed in Walker's Galleries on New Bond Street. There were also satellite exhibitions in the New Vision Centre Gallery on Seymour Place, Marble Arch and the Drian Gallery on Porchester Place, Bayswater.

These three galleries were early natural homes for the group: The Walker's Galleries had been the location of the first exhibition of the [[Seven and Five Society]] - a natural predecessor of the Free Painters Group; New Vision Centre Gallery was run by members [[Denis Bowen]], Halima Nalecz and [[Frank Avray Wilson]] and was a hub for the avant-garde and experimental.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Marlowe (31 March 2006). [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/31/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries "Denis Bowen: Painter, teacher and promoter of the avant-garde in Britain"]. ''The Guardian''. p. 36. Retrieved 18 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Halima Nalecz also ran the Drian Gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/galleries/drian-galleries|title=Drian Galleries|last=|first=|date=|website=Artist Biographies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many exhibitions were held there by members over the years.

=== Middle Years ===

In the early 1960s the group began to stage exhibitions at the FBA Galleries in Suffolk Street, Pall Mall. This larger venue was well suited to the growing number of members and also was able to house larger works that were created.

With this increasing membership and more sculptors in the group, in 1965 'Free Painters Group' was renamed to its current name of 'Free Painters and Sculptors'. Also at this time, FPS became a registered charity.

Exhibitions were gathering more interest and garnered reviews in local and national press. As well as an annual exhibition (now branded 'Trends'), many members staged exhibitions around the UK as well as overseas.

In the early 1970s a desire to find venues aside from the annual exhibition was facilitated by the then-secretary of the group Nina Hosali. Nina's mother Kate Hosali had founded the [[Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad|Society for Protection of Animals in North Africa]] (SPANA) in 1923 and the headquarters were at their home at 15 Buckingham Gate. The property was used by the free painters for meetings and storage space and in 1972 the [[loggia]] in its gardens was turned into a permanent gallery space - the Loggia Gallery and Sculpture Garden.

In 1973 'Trends' moved to the Mall Galleries, Pall Mall and exhibited there until the next decade.

Membership by the mid 1970s had grown rapidly and was at a peak of nearly 500.

=== Later Years ===

The 1980s saw the group achieve a milestone of 30 years but the period saw challenges. The group had healthy{{Clarify|reason=healthy in terms of what?|date=January 2018}} number of members but had to work hard to ensure that quality remained high. In addition, founding members were reaching old age and retirement and their loss was felt. Lastly, societal changes meant whereas the group had always been London focussed, it had to look outwards as artists left London.{{According to whom|date=January 2018}}

However, these challenges created interesting opportunities whereby exhibitions outside of London were staged and new blood was found. A new generation of artists joined the ranks and thus kept the group relevant and vital. Exhibitions continued to be held at the London venue of the Loggia Gallery although other suitable venues in London were harder and increasingly expensive to come by.{{According to whom|date=January 2018}}

=== Modern Era ===

FPS celebrated its 65th anniversary in 2017. It currently has over 50 members, both from the UK and overseas. Membership is granted by election of the Executive Committee on the submission of acceptable samples of work.

FPS exhibits at least twice year in London, most recently at the Menier Gallery and the gallery at the [[Oxo Tower]]. An annual Open exhibition celebrates the work of members alongside selected work chosen from artist submissions.

'''Gernot Böhme''' (born 3 January 1937 in [[Dessau]]) is a German [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and author, contributing to the philosophy of science, theory of time, aesthetics, ethics, and philosophical anthropology. He is the main pioneer of German ecocriticism, the study of the relationship between culture and the environment. He has been the director of the Institute for Practical Philosophy in [[Darmstadt]] since 2005.&lt;ref name="MindMatter"&gt;[http://www.mindmatter.de/resources/pdf/authors9_2www.pdf Mind &amp; Matter Vol. 9(2), "About Authors", 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being one of Germany's most acclaimed public intellectuals, very little of his work has so far been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=713&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
Böhme studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at Göttingen and Hamburg, and completed a PhD in 1965 at Hamburg University.
As a research scientist he worked at the [[Max-Planck-Institute]] with [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]. From 1977 to
2002 he was Professor of Philosophy at [[Technische Universität Darmstadt|Technical University of Darmstadt]].&lt;ref name="MindMatter"/&gt;

'''iPhone art''' is a form of [[Interactive art]] that takes place on the screen of the [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], or [[iPod Touch]]. It is distinct from pictorial works of art produced with an iPhone using paint apps such as [[Brushes]] or [[ArtRage]].

iPhone Art evolved from screen-based interactive art that formerly appeared on PC computer screens or on wall-mounted displays in galleries and museums. Due to the portability and ease of distribution with the [[iTunes App Store]], these forms of art are currently experiencing a renaissance as interactive works of art from the 1990s and 2000s are adapted to the iPhone and iPad, some even becoming bestsellers in the Entertainment and Music categories where these apps normally appear, since there is currently no Art category in the iTunes App Store.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/us/20bciart.html For Digital Artists, Apps Provide New Palette, Reyhan Harmanci, New York Times, August 20, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists such as [[David Hockney]], Corliss Blakely and Meri Aaron Walker (iPhoneArtGirl) have held art exhibits with art made exclusively on their iPads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Hockney's latest Paris art show, 'Fleurs fraiches,' shows off his iPhone 'Brushes' creations|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/10/david_hockneys_latest_paris_ar.html|publisher=www.cleveland.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musician [[Damon Albarn]] recorded the entirety of the new [[Gorillaz]] album, [[The Fall (Gorillaz album)|The Fall]], on his iPad with various apps while on his North American tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gorillaz - The Fall|url=http://thefall.gorillaz.com/|publisher=thefall.gorillaz.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

iPhone art may pose a threat to traditional gallery distribution of [[digital art]] because individual artist can distribute their apps directly to the general public without working through a gallery dealer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snibbe.com/blog/2010/05/19/art99 Art Wants to be Ninety-Nine Cents by Scott Snibbe, blog posting May 19, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]]'s ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' is a complex work whose iconography remains the subject of debate.]]

'''Iconography''', as a branch of [[art history]], studies the identification, description, and the interpretation of the content of images: the subjects depicted, the particular compositions and details used to do so, and other elements that are distinct from [[artistic style]]. The word ''iconography'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|εἰκών}} ("image") and {{lang|grc|γράφειν}} ("to write").

A secondary meaning (based on a non-standard translation of the Greek and Russian equivalent terms) is the production of religious images, called "icons", in the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Churches|Orthodox Christian]] tradition (see [[Icon]]).

In [[art history]], "an iconography" may also mean a particular depiction of a subject in terms of the content of the image, such as the number of figures used, their placing and gestures.  The term is also used in many academic fields other than art history, for example [[semiotics]] and [[media studies]], and in general usage, for the content of images, the typical depiction in images of a subject, and related senses.  Sometimes distinctions have been made between ''[[iconology]]'' and ''iconography'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0161.xml Oxford Bibliographies: Paul Taylor, "Iconology and Iconography"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; although the definitions, and so the distinction made, varies. 
When referring to movies, genres are immediately recognizable through their iconography, motifs that become associated with a specific genre through repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Giannetti|first= Louis|title= Understanding Movies|year= 2008|publisher= Person Prentice Hall|location= Toronto|page= 52}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=February 2015}}

==Iconography as a field of study==

=== Foundations of iconography ===
Early Western writers who took special note of the content of images include [[Giorgio Vasari]], whose ''Ragionamenti'', interpreting the paintings in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]], reassuringly demonstrates that such works were difficult to understand even for well-informed contemporaries.  [[Gian Pietro Bellori]], a 17th-century biographer of artists of his own time, describes and analyses, not always correctly, many works. [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]'s study (1796) of the classical figure [[Cupid|Amor]] with an inverted torch was an early attempt to use a study of a type of image to explain the culture it originated in, rather than the other way round.&lt;ref name="Białostocki:535"&gt;Białostocki:535&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Hans Memling 056.jpg|thumb|A painting with complex iconography: [[Hans Memling]]'s so-called [[Seven Joys of the Virgin]] – in fact this is a later title for a ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' cycle on a single panel.  Altogether 25 scenes, not all involving the Virgin, are depicted. 1480, [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Alte Pinakotek, Munich; (Summary Catalogue – various authors), pp. 348-51, 1986, Edition Lipp, {{ISBN|3-87490-701-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Iconography as an academic art historical discipline developed in the nineteenth-century in the works of scholars such as [[Adolphe Napoleon Didron]] (1806–1867), [[Anton Heinrich Springer]] (1825–1891), and [[Émile Mâle]] (1862–1954)&lt;ref name="kleinbauer"&gt;W. Eugene Kleinbauer and Thomas P. Slavens, ''Research Guide to the History of Western Art'', Sources of information in the humanities, no. 2. Chicago: [[American Library Association]] (1982): 60-72.&lt;/ref&gt; all specialists in Christian religious art, which was the main focus of study in this period, in which French scholars were especially prominent.&lt;ref name="Białostocki:535"/&gt;  They looked back to earlier attempts to classify and organise subjects encyclopedically like [[Cesare Ripa]]'s ''Iconologia overo Descrittione Dell’imagini Universali cavate dall’Antichità et da altri luoghi '' and [[Anne Claude Philippe de Tubieres de Grimoard de Pestels de Levis, Comte de Caylus|Anne Claude Philippe de Caylus]]'s ''Recueil d'antiquités égyptiennes, étrusques, grècques, romaines et gauloises'' as guides to understanding works of art, both religious and profane, in a more scientific manner than the popular [[aesthetic]] approach of the time.&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt; These early contributions paved the way for [[encyclopedia]]s, manuals, and other publications useful in identifying the content of art.  Mâle's  ''l'Art religieux du XIIIe siècle en France'' (originally 1899, with revised editions) translated into English as ''The Gothic Image, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century'' has remained continuously in print.

=== Twentieth-century iconography ===
In the early-twentieth century [[Germany]], [[Aby Warburg]] (1866–1929) and his followers [[Fritz Saxl]] (1890–1948) and [[Erwin Panofsky]] (1892–1968) elaborated the practice of identification and classification of motifs in images to using iconography as a means to understanding meaning.&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt; Panofsky codified an influential approach to iconography in his 1939 ''Studies in Iconology'', where he defined it as "the branch of the history of art which concerns itself with the subject matter or meaning of works of art, as opposed to form,"&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt; although the distinction he and other scholars drew between particular definitions of "iconography" (put simply, the identification of visual content) and "iconology" (the analysis of the meaning of that content), has not been generally accepted, though it is still used by some writers.&lt;ref&gt;For example by [[Anne D'Alleva]] in her ''Methods and Theories of Art History'', pp. 20-28, 2005, Laurence King Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85669-417-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], to which Panofsky immigrated in 1931, students such as [[Frederick Hartt]], and [[Meyer Schapiro]] continued under his influence in the discipline.&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt;  In an influential article of 1942, ''Introduction to an "Iconography of Mediaeval Architecture"'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Krautheimer,Introduction to an "Iconography of Mediaeval Architecture", Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 5. (1942), pp. 1-33.[http://aar.iec.cat/institucio/societats/AmicsArtRomanic/activitats/textosesp/espanol04.pdf Online text] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408194332/http://aar.iec.cat/institucio/societats/AmicsArtRomanic/activitats/textosesp/espanol04.pdf |date=April 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Krautheimer]], a specialist on early medieval churches and another German émigré, extended iconographical analysis to [[architecture|architectural forms]].

The period from 1940 can be seen as one where iconography was especially prominent in art history.&lt;ref&gt;Białostocki:537&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas most icongraphical scholarship remains highly dense and specialized, some analyses began to attract a much wider audience, for example [[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky]]'s theory (now generally out of favour with specialists) that the writing on the rear wall in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]] turned the painting into the record of a marriage contract.  [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]]'s ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' has been the subject of books for a general market with new theories as to its iconography,&lt;ref&gt;Most recently: North, John (September, 2004). The Ambassador's Secret: Holbein and the World of the Renaissance. Orion Books&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[best-seller]]s of [[Dan Brown]] include theories, disowned by most art historians, on the iconography of works by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

Technological advances allowed the building-up of huge collections of photographs, with an iconographic arrangement or index, which include those of the [[Warburg Institute]] and the ''Index of Christian Art'' at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (which has made a specialism of iconography since its early days in America).&lt;ref&gt;Białostocki:538-39&lt;/ref&gt; These are now being digitised and made available online, usually on a restricted basis.
 
With the arrival of computing, the [[Iconclass]] system, a highly complex way of classifying the content of images, with 28,000 classification types, and 14,000 keywords, was developed in the Netherlands as a standard classification for recording collections, with the idea of assembling huge databases that will allow the retrieval of images featuring particular details, subjects or other common factors.  For example, the Iconclass code "71H7131" is for the subject of "[[Bathsheba]] (alone) with David's letter", whereas "71" is the whole "[[Old Testament]]" and "71H" the "story of [[David]]".   A number of collections of different types have been classified using Iconclass, notably many types of [[old master print]], the collections of the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]] and the German [[Marburger Index]].

=== Iconography in religious art ===
[[Religious images]] are used to some extent by all major religions, including both [[Indian religions|Indian]] and [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] faiths, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition.

=== Iconography in Indian religious art ===
Central to the iconography and [[hagiography]] of [[Indian religions]] are [[mudra]] or gestures with specific meanings.  Other features include the [[aureola]] and [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], also found in Christian and Islamic art, and divine qualities and attributes represented by [[asana]] and ritual tools such as the [[dharmachakra]], [[vajra]], [[dadar]], [[chhatra]], [[sauwastika]], [[phurba]] and [[danda]].  The symbolic use of colour to denote the [[Classical Elements]] or [[Mahabhuta]] and letters and [[Bīja|bija]] syllables from sacred alphabetic scripts are other features.  Under the influence of [[tantra]] art developed esoteric meanings, accessible only to initiates; this is an especially strong feature of [[Tibetan art]]. The art of Indian Religions esp. Hindus in its numerous sectoral divisions is governed by sacred texts called the [[Aagama]] which describes the ratio and proportion of the icon, called ''taalmaana'' as well as mood of the central figure in a context. For example, [[Narasimha]] an incarnation of [[Vishnu]] though considered a wrathful deity but in few contexts is depicted in pacified mood.

Although iconic depictions of, or concentrating on, a single figure are the dominant type of [[Buddhist]] image, large stone [[bas-relief|relief]] or [[fresco]] narrative cycles of the ''Life of the Buddha'', or tales of his previous lives, are found at major sites like [[Sarnath]], [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], and [[Borobudor]], especially in earlier periods.  Conversely, in [[Hindu]] art, narrative scenes have become rather more common in recent centuries, especially in [[Indian miniature painting|miniature paintings]] of the lives of [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]].

=== Christian iconography ===
{{further|Christian art| Eastern Orthodox iconography|Marian art in the Catholic Church}}
After an early period when [[Aniconism in Christianity|aniconism was strong]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Kitzinger|Kitzinger, Ernst]], "The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', Vol. 8, (1954), pp.&amp;nbsp;83–150, Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291064 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; surviving [[Early Christian art]] began, about two centuries after Christ, with small images in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] that show [[orans]] figures, portraits of Christ and some saints, and a limited number of "abbreviated representations" of biblical episodes emphasizing deliverance.  From the Constantinian period monumental art borrowed motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art – the motif of [[Christ in Majesty]] owes something to both Imperial portraits and depictions of [[Zeus]].  In the [[Late Antique]] period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to [[Biblical]] texts, although many gaps in the [[canonical Gospel]] narratives were plugged with matter from the [[apocrypha|apocryphal gospels]].  Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]].
[[File:Tikhvinskaya.jpg|thumb|The Theotokos of [[Tikhvin]] of ca. 1300, an example of the [[Hodegetria]] type of [[Madonna and Child]].]]
After the [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|period of Byzantine iconoclasm]] iconographical innovation was regarded as unhealthy, if not heretical, in the Eastern Church, though it still continued at a glacial pace.  More than in the West, traditional depictions were often considered to have authentic or [[Acheiropoieta|miraculous origins]], and the job of the artist was to copy them with as little deviation as possible. The Eastern church also never accepted the use of monumental [[high relief]] or free-standing sculpture, which it found too reminiscent of paganism.  Most modern [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s are very close to their predecessors of a thousand years ago, though development, and some shifts in meaning, have occurred – for example the old man wearing a fleece in conversation with [[Saint Joseph]] usually seen in Orthodox Nativities seems to have begun as one of the shepherds, or the prophet [[Isaiah]], but is now usually understood as the "Tempter" ([[Satan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:66&lt;/ref&gt;

In both East and West, numerous iconic types of [[Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas [[Christ Pantocrator]] was much the commonest image of Christ.  Especially important depictions of Mary include the [[Hodegetria]] and  [[Panagia]] types.  Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the [[Life of the Virgin]], parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular [[saint]]s.  Especially in the West, a system of [[emblem|attributes]] developed for [[Saint symbology|identifying individual]] figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.

From the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period sculpture on churches became increasingly important in Western art, and probably partly because of the lack of Byzantine models, became the location of much iconographic innovation, along with the [[illuminated manuscript]], which had already taken a decisively different direction from Byzantine equivalents, under the influence of [[Insular art]] and other factors.  Developments in theology and devotional practice produced innovations like the subject of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] and the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], both associated with the [[Franciscan]]s, as were many other developments. Most painters remained content to copy and slightly modify the works of others, and it is clear that the clergy, by whom or for whose churches most art was commissioned, often specified what they wanted shown in great detail.

The theory of [[Typology (theology)|typology]], by which the meaning of most events of the [[Old Testament]] was understood as a "type" or pre-figuring of an event in the life of, or aspect of, Christ or Mary was often reflected in art, and in the later [[Middle Ages]] came to dominate the choice of Old Testament scenes in Western Christian art.
[[File:Robert Campin - L' Annonciation - 1425.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Campin]]'s [[Mérode Altarpiece]] of 1425-28 has a highly complex iconography that is still debated.  Is [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] making a mousetrap, reflecting a remark of Saint [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] that Christ's Incarnation was a trap to catch men's souls?]] 
Whereas in the Romanesque and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] periods the great majority of religious art was intended to convey often complex religious messages as clearly as possible, with the arrival of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] iconography became highly sophisticated, and in many cases appears to be deliberately enigmatic, even for a well-educated contemporary. The subtle layers of meaning uncovered by modern iconographical research in works of [[Robert Campin]] such as the [[Mérode Altarpiece]], and of Jan van Eyck such as the [[Madonna of Chancellor Rolin]] and the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Washington Annunciation]] lie in small details of what are on first viewing very conventional representations.  When Italian painting developed a taste for enigma, considerably later, it most often showed in secular compositions influenced by [[Platonism in the Renaissance|Renaissance Neo-Platonism]].

From the 15th century religious painting gradually freed itself from the habit of following earlier compositional models, and by the 16th century ambitious artists were expected to find novel compositions for each subject, and direct borrowings from earlier artists are more often of the poses of individual figures than of whole compositions.  The [[The Reformation and art|Reformation]] soon restricted most [[Protestant]] religious painting to Biblical scenes conceived along the lines of [[history painting]], and after some decades the Catholic [[Council of Trent]] reined in somewhat the freedom of Catholic artists.

=== Secular Western painting ===
Secular painting became far more common from the Renaissance, and developed its own traditions and conventions of iconography, in [[history painting]], which includes [[mythology|mythologies]], [[portrait painting|portraits]], [[genre painting|genre scenes]], and even [[landscape painting|landscapes]], not to mention modern media and genres like [[photography]], [[Film|cinema]], [[political cartoon]]s, [[comic book]]s and [[anime]].

Renaissance mythological painting was in theory reviving the iconography of the ancient world, but in practice themes like [[Leda and the Swan]] developed on largely original lines, and for different purposes.  Personal iconographies, where works appear to have significant meanings individual to, and perhaps only accessible by, the artist, go back at least as far as [[Hieronymous Bosch]], but have become increasingly significant with artists like [[Goya]], [[William Blake]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]], [[Picasso]], [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Joseph Beuys]].

== Iconography in disciplines other than art history{{anchor|iconography and popular culture}} ==
Iconography, often of aspects of [[popular culture]], is a concern of other [[academic disciplines]] including [[Semiotics]], [[Anthropology]], [[Sociology]], [[Media Studies]] and [[Cultural Studies]].  These analyses in turn have affected conventional art history, especially concepts such as [[sign (semiotics)|signs in semiotics]].  Discussing imagery as iconography in this way implies a critical "reading" of imagery that often attempts to explore social and cultural values. Iconography is also used within [[Film theory|film studies]] to describe the [[visual language]] of cinema, particularly within the field of [[Film genre|genre criticism]].&lt;ref name="film"&gt;Cook and Bernink (1999, 138-140).&lt;/ref&gt; In the age of Internet, the new global history of the visual production of Humanity (Histiconologia &lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, {{ISBN|978-2-84736-185-8}}. (with 275 specialists from all continents, all specialities, all periods from Prehistory to nowadays) ; Laurent Gervereau, "Images, une histoire mondiale", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2008, 272p., {{ISBN|978-2-84736-362-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) includes History of Art and history of all kind of images or medias.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1589">'''Illyrian fibulae''' or brooches were widely used by [[Illyrians]] and were very common in [[Illyria]]. Some types of [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]] are one of the few objects that all of the Illyrians used and some are even used to declare the distribution of Illyrian people. Illyrians loved ornaments, and on festive occasions their womenfolk would appear heavily draped with all manner of jewelley. Several varieties of fibulae have a distinctive evolution in Ilyria, notable the [[Spectacle brooch]] of two concentrically wound spirals attached to the pin. The Glasinac fibula was a variant of the simple bow-fibula which is common among many Illyrians. Other forms which appear in the early [[Iron Age]] include those and with bosses on the arch, animal-shaped brooches, serpent-shaped  and plate-brooches, the last being distinctively [[Liburnian]].

A significant later import was the heavy brooch with a large arch and long arm named from the site of [[Certosa di Bologna|Certosa]] near [[Bologna]]. Another distinctive brooch, often made in silver and with a wide arch in the form of open petals, is named from the fine examples found at Strpci on the [[Drina]] river near Gorazde. This type seems to have been popular among the southern Illyrians and is believed to be modeled on Greek forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkes|first=John J.|title=The Illyrians|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1995|isbn=0-631-19807-5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jasad''''' ("body" in Arabic) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic-language]] cultural magazine based in [[Beirut]], specializing in the literature, art and science of the body. It was founded by [[Joumana Haddad]].

==History and profile==
Founded in 2008, the first issue of ''Jasad'' appeared in December of that same year,&lt;ref name=zab/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanese magazine champions sex and the city|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/03/30/69535.html|accessdate=13 October 2013|work=Al Arabiya|date=2 November 2010|agency=AFP|location=Beirut}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has raised a great deal of controversy ever since, because it tackles subjects that are taboo in the Arabic language and societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/13/lebanon-middleeast-magazine-taboo|accessdate=22 December 2008|title=From Voyeur's Corner to My First Time: new magazine attempts to lift veil on Arab taboos|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Ian|last=Black|date=13 December 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the March 2009 issue the magazine included articles about sexuality in the Arab world.&lt;ref name=zab&gt;{{cite news|title=Jasad magazine casts an unprecedented spotlight on sexuality in the Arab world|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Arts/Mar/31/Jasad-magazine-casts-an-unprecedented-spotlight-on-sexuality-in-the-Arab-world.ashx#axzz2g1cYANxV|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=31 March 2009|author=Jocelyne Zablit|agency=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jasad'' is published by "Al Joumana".

''Jasad'' is distributed to readers worldwide through bookshops and/or by rapid courier via a yearly subscription system. It is a glossy magazine, 200 pages, sized 22 x 28&amp;nbsp;cm, and consists of different sections and columns, ranging from reportages, testimonies and articles, to essays, translations and creative writings, all covering the fields of cinema, literature, arts, theater, philosophy, science, revolving around the axis of the body.&lt;ref name=llc&gt;{{cite news|title=In Lebanon, 'Jasad' Magazine Defies Taboos|url=http://researchandmedia.ning.com/profiles/blogs/in-lebanon-jasad-magazine|accessdate=13 October 2013|work=Research and Media Network|date=16 March 2009|author=Lynette Lee Corporal|location=Bangkok}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saseen Kawzally regarded the magazine on 2 February 2009 as "very confusing" and as covering varied material that is not "entirely coherent".&lt;ref name=llc/&gt;

'''Keith Rocco''' is a military and historical painter working in the United States.

==Biography==
His interest in military subjects developed at an early age. One of his first books, received as a Christmas present when he was ten, was ''The Golden Book of the Civil War'', and he began collecting Civil War and Napoleonic artifacts when he was 14. Today, his collection includes original uniforms and artifacts as well as modern replicas which he uses as props for his paintings. His home and studio are in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia.

==Works==
Keith Rocco is known for his illustrative paintings of the American Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ww2PQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Keith+Rocco+is%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pNg0TISKAcL78AauqeDICw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA The Soldier's View: The Civil War Art of Keith Rocco, Robert I.

The fact that the Christ Candle in the centre of the [[Advent wreath]] is lit also indicates that [[Christmas]] has arrived.]]
'''Liturgical colours''' are those specific colours used for [[vestment]]s and [[Antependium|hangings]] within the context of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[liturgy]]. The symbolism of [[violet (color)|violet]], white, green, red, gold, black, [[Rose (color)|rose]] and other colours may serve to underline moods appropriate to a season of the [[liturgical year]] or may highlight a special occasion.

There is a distinction between the colour of the vestments worn by the clergy and their [[choir dress]], which with a few exceptions does not change with the liturgical seasons.

==Roman Catholic Church==

===Current rubrics===
In the [[Roman Rite]], as reformed by [[Pope Paul VI]], the following colours are used.&lt;ref name=IGMR&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/cdwlgrm.htm ''Institutio Generalis Missalis Romani''], no. 346; cf. [http://www.acbc.catholic.org.au/documents/200707031933.pdf text for Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720091216/http://www.acbc.catholic.org.au/documents/200707031933.pdf |date=2008-07-20 }}, [http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf England and Wales], [http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/roman-missal/general-instruction-of-the-roman-missal/girm-chapter-6.cfm United States]&lt;/ref&gt;

On more solemn days, i.e. festive, more precious, sacred vestments may be used, even if not of the colour of the day. Such vestments may, for instance, be made from [[cloth of gold]] or [[cloth of silver]]. Moreover, the Conference of Bishops may determine and propose to the Apostolic See adaptations suited to the needs and culture of peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 346.g&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual Masses are celebrated in their proper colour, in white, or in a festive colour. Masses for Various Needs, on the other hand, are celebrated in the colour proper to the day or the season or in violet if they bear a penitential character. Votive Masses are celebrated in the colour suited to the Mass itself or even in the colour proper to the day or the season.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 347&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regional and situational exceptions ====
Some particular variations:
*{{Color sample|#6495ed}} '''[[Marian blue|Blue]]''', a colour associated with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], is permitted for the feast of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in [[Spain]] and in some dioceses in [[Portugal]], [[Mexico]], and [[South America]]. In the [[Philippines]], it is authorised for all feasts of the Virgin Mary, a practice followed in some other places without official warrant. There have also been uses of blue in place of violet for the season of Advent despite the fact that this practice is not authorized under liturgical law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canticanova.com/articles/xmas/art1c1.htm Cantica Nova Publications], ''Advent Blues'', editorial by Gary D. Penkala, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Color sample|white}} '''White''' or {{Color sample|#d4af37}} '''[[cloth of gold]]''' was traditionally used for [[Misa de Gallo|the Novena]] from 16 to 24 December according to a Spanish custom abolished in that country in the 1950s, but still widely observed in the [[Philippines]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}. White is also used for East Asian Masses for the dead, as white is the traditional colour of mourning in many of the region's cultures. Furthermore, if not enough vestments of the proper colour are available (particularly in [[concelebration]]s), white may be used for all concelebrants.
*{{Color sample|#7f00ff}} '''Violet''' or {{Color sample|black}} '''black''' are often permitted on national holidays honoring military dead. For example in Canada, they are used on [[Remembrance Day]].
*{{Color sample|gold}} '''Gold''' or {{Color sample|silver}} '''silver''' may be worn on more solemn occasions in the dioceses of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 346.h in publications for use in the U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-1969 rubrics===
The [[Roman Missal]], as revised by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1962, was authorised for use as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] by the 2007 ''[[motu proprio]]'' entitled ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''. Pope John XXIII's revision of the Missal incorporated changes that he had made with his ''motu proprio'' ''Rubricarum instructum'' of 29 July 1960;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962-pdf.html ''Missale Romanum'' 1962 in PDF Format]&lt;/ref&gt; these changes went into effect on January 1, 1961. The following are the differences between its rules for liturgical colours and the later rules:

[[Pope Pius X]] raised the rank of Sundays of ordinary time, so that on those that fell within octaves '''green''' was used instead of the colour of the octave, as had previously been the rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Rubricae generales Missalis: XVIII – De Coloribus Paramentorum'' in the [http://www.sanctamissa.org/EN/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html 1920 typical edition] of the Roman Missal omitted the phrase "exceptis Dominicis infra octavas occurrentibus, in quibus color octavarum servatur" found in earlier editions beginning with Pope Pius V's edition of 1570 (page 21 of the facsimile published by Libreria Editrice Vaticana in 1998 – {{ISBN|88-209-2547-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules on liturgical colours before the time of Pope Pius X were essentially those indicated in the edition of the Roman Missal that [[Pope Pius V]] promulgated in 1570, except for the addition of feasts not included in his Missal. The scheme of colours in his Missal reflected usage that had become fixed in Rome by the twelfth century.

==Byzantine Rite==
The [[Byzantine Rite]], which is used by all the member churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Byzantine Rite Lutheranism|Byzantine Lutheran Churches]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] of Byzantine Rite, does not have a universal system of colours, with the service-books of the Byzantine tradition only specifying "light" or "dark" vestments in the service books. In the Greek tradition, [[Maroon (colour)|maroon]] or [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]] are common for solemn feast days, and a wide variety of colours are used at other times, the most common of which are gold and white.

Slavic-use churches and others influenced by Western traditions have adopted a cycle of liturgical colours.  The particulars may change from place to place, but generally:

*Feasts of the Holy Archangels
||
*Churches dedicated to the Theotokos may use light blue for the default, instead of gold.
*In some places, blue is also used for [[Baptism of Jesus|Holy Theophany]].
*In many places, blue is used for the Dormition Fast (except from the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] to its afterfeast (August 6–13), when either gold or white is used).
|-

||
*In many places, purple or dark red are only worn on the weekdays of the Great Fast, while bright colors (gold, gold/white) are used on Saturdays and Sundays.

|-

*Pascha
*[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]

||
*Funerals (Throughout the year, even during Holy Week.)
|}

The colours would be changed before [[Vespers]] on the eve of the day being commemorated.  During Great Feasts, the colour is changed before the vespers service that begins the first day of a [[forefeast]], and remains until the apodosis (final day of the [[afterfeast]]).

Under Western influence, black is often used in the Slavic churches for funerals, weekdays of Great Lent, and Holy Week as a sign of [[penance]] and mourning, but in the second half of the 20th century, the ancient white became more common, as a sign of the hope of the Resurrection.

==Russian liturgical colours==

According to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]'s ''Nastol'naya Kniga Sviashchenno-sluzhitelia'',&lt;ref&gt;Nastol'naya Kniga Sviashchenno-sluzhitelia, Volume 4, Moscow,1983, Translated in "The Messenger" of St. Andrew's Russian Orthodox Cathedral,Philadelphia, June, July–August, September, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; up to eight different liturgical colours may be used throughout the year.  Exact usage of these colours varies, but the following are the most common uses.

==Coptic Rite==
The [[Copts|Coptic]] tradition, followed by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] and the [[Coptic Catholic Church]], only uses white vestments, with gold and silver being considered variations of white. The only exception is during [[Passion Week]] when black is used. Nonetheless, trimmings of red, gold or blue may be found on some vestments.

==Ethiopian Rite==
The liturgical tradition of Ethiopia, followed by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Ethiopian Catholic Church]], embraces a wide variety of liturgical colours. In [[Eritrea]], similar traditions are followed.

==Lutheran churches==
The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA), uses the same colour scheme as that of the Anglicans and their Scandinavian Lutheran counterparts, but with the use of gold only for the Easter Vigil and Easter Sunday services, with Holy Week using scarlet in place of crimson.

Both the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) use a similar system, but with purple being the primary colour for both Advent and Lent (with blue being the alternate colour for Advent only), and the use of gold in place of white for both Christmas and Easter (in similar practice to the Catholic Church).  In the WELS, the use of red is also done during the ''Period of End Times'', a period of the Church regarding the teachings of the Book of Revelation, culminating in the creation of the New Jerusalem (corresponding to Christ the King in the ELCA). In all three churches, including the ELCA, red is also worn on the last Sunday of October, in celebration of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] on October 31, when [[Martin Luther]] nailed the [[95 Theses]] onto the door of Wittenberg Castle Church.

==Anglicanism==
[[Image:Lenten Array Edgbaston.jpg|thumb|right|Lenten Array altar frontal by [[George Pace]] at [[St Augustine's Church, Edgbaston|St Augustine's, Edgbaston]]]]
Most [[Anglican]] churches use the colours appointed in the Roman Rite, usually in its post-1969 form, with the exception of Sarum Blue replacing violet for Advent, but some use the earlier form, with, for instance, black in place of red on [[Good Friday]]. Some churches use black at Masses for the dead, but more commonly white or purple is used. For historical reasons much of the worldwide Anglican Communion takes a noticeable lead from the practice of the [[Church of England]]. Since the 1980 [[Alternative Service Book]], liturgical colours have been recommended for seasons, with more detailed advice offered as part of the [[Common Worship]] series of liturgies, including colours for all Sundays and festivals printed in the 'core volume' next to collects.

The Church's published Lectionary now makes detailed suggestions for liturgical colour throughout the year, which corresponds almost exactly with the above table of Roman Rite (post-1969 usage) usage with five minor exceptions, and one more significant one:

:* there is no reference in Anglican usage to Masses of deceased popes and cardinals;
:* no liturgical colour at all is suggested for [[Holy Saturday]] (the words "hangings removed" are printed);
:* the recommendation of red for confirmation rites is extended also to ordination rites;
:* Lenten Array (unbleached linen) continues to be listed as an alternative option to purple during Lent;
:* the option exists for using red instead of green during the "Kingdom Season", the four last Sundays of the liturgical year, culminating in [[Christ the King]], as is common is some Lutheran traditions (see below);
:* finally, and more significantly, the Church of England provision suggests white throughout the Sundays after [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] as a distinct "Epiphany season", with ordinary time commencing the day after [[Candlemas]].

The colour scheme suggested by the [[Church of England]] also indicates where gold vestments should be used in those churches that possess gold and white as distinct colours. The use of rose-pink vestments, as in the Roman Rite table above, was mentioned as an option in early editions of Common Worship,&lt;ref&gt;The use of rose-pink vestments is suggested in the liturgical colour sequence notes of [[Common Worship]] of which an [http://www.cofe.anglican.org/worship/liturgy/commonworship/texts/rules/rulesyear.html on-line version may be found here].&lt;/ref&gt; and is a listed option in the annual published lectionary; however, later Common Worship publications have begun to refer to this practice as "traditional" reflecting its resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see "Common Worship - Times &amp; Seasons", added to the Common Worship series in 2006, page 50, paragraph 1: "rose-pink vestments are traditionally worn".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarum Rite===
The [[Sarum Rite]] was a medieval liturgical rite used in [[England]] before the [[Reformation]] which had a distinct set of liturgical colours. After the [[Anglo-Catholic]] Revival of the 19th century, certain [[Church of England]] churches began adopting Sarum liturgical colours as an attempt to produce something that was an English expression of [[Catholicism]] rather than a Roman expression. One of the chief advocates behind this was [[Percy Dearmer]]. The exact colours used by the mediaeval Sarum rite are a matter of dispute, but colours adopted by contemporary churches claiming to use the Sarum scheme include in particular deep blue for [[Advent]], which may be popularly referred to as "Sarum blue", and unbleached linen for [[Lent]]. The Sarum rite has never received official approval in the [[Church of England]] or in [[The Episcopal Church]], but has influenced a number of cathedrals and parish churches.

==Methodist churches==
[[Methodism|Methodists]] use a colour scheme similar to those used by Lutherans and Catholics, although the practice is not universally followed. [[The United Methodist Church]], prior to the early-1990s, used red solely for Pentecost, even including the Sundays after Pentecost Sunday, with the use of green being reserved for the season of [[Kingdomtide]], which usually lasted from late August/early September until Christ the King (the last Sunday in Kingdomtide). Since the publication of the [[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)|1992 Book of Worship]], the UMC has followed the ELCA practice of wearing red only for Pentecost and [[Reformation Sunday]] and green for the rest of the Pentecost season.

==Reformed churches==
The [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] has sanctioned the use of liturgical colours and promoted their use in the 1993 Book of Common Worship (although their use was also promoted in the church's annual Planning Calendars beginning in the 1980s). Advent and Lent are periods of preparation and repentance and are represented by the colour purple. The feasts of Christmas Day and Christmastide, Epiphany Sunday, Baptism of the Lord Sunday, Transfiguration Sunday, Easter Season, Trinity Sunday, and Christ the King Sunday are represented by white. Green is the colour for periods of Ordinary Time. Red is for Pentecost Sunday, but may also be used for ordinations, church anniversaries, and memorial services for ordained clergy. Red or purple are appropriate for Palm Sunday. During Holy Week, the church may use purple or remain bare (although a few churches will use black for Good Friday).

Similarly, the [[United Church of Christ]] includes indications of which liturgical colour to use for each Sunday in its annual calendar. The general Western pattern is followed, with either purple or blue recommended for Advent.&lt;ref&gt;''United Church of Christ Desk Calendar and Plan Book 2016,'' http://www.uccresources.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Medieval]] fortification''' refers to [[medieval technology|medieval]] military methods that cover the development of [[fortification]] construction and use in [[Europe]], roughly from the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] to the [[Renaissance]]. During this millennium, fortifications changed [[Medieval warfare|warfare]], and in turn were modified to suit new [[military tactics|tactics]], [[weapon]]s and [[siege]] techniques.

==Fortification types==

===Archer towers===
[[Image:TurnulChindiei.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chindia Tower]], [[Târgovişte]], [[Romania]]]]
{{See also|Watchtower}}
[[Tower]]s of medieval [[castle]]s were usually made of stone or sometimes (but rarely) wood. Often toward the later part of the era they included battlements and arrow loops. Arrow loops were vertical slits in the wall through which archers inside shot arrows at the attackers, but made it extremely difficult for attackers to get many arrows back through at the defenders.

===City walls===
{{Main|Defensive wall}}


[[File:Remains of Kommendemauer Burgsteinfurt.jpg|thumb|200px|Remains of a commandry (Order of Knights of St. John of Jerusalem) wall in [[Steinfurt]], Germany. The downward slope on the outer side is hidden behind a fence and shrubbery]]
An exact nature of the walls of a medieval town or city would depend on the resources available for building them, the nature of the terrain, and the perceived threat. In northern [[Europe]], early in the period, walls were likely to have been constructed of wood and proofed against small forces. Especially where stone was readily available for building, the wood will have been replaced by stone to a higher or lower standard of security. This would have been the pattern of events in the [[Five Burghs|Five Boroughs]] of the [[Danelaw]] in [[England]].

In many cases, the wall would have had an internal and an external ''[[pomoerium]]''. This was a strip of clear ground immediately adjacent the wall. The word is from the late [[medieval]], derived from the classical [[Latin]] ''post murum'' ("behind the wall").

An external pomoerium, stripped of bushes and building, gave defenders a clear view of what was happening outside and an unobstructed field of shot. An internal pomoerium gave ready access to the rear of the [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] to facilitate movement of the [[garrison]] to a point of need. By the end of the sixteenth century, the word had developed further in common use, into ''pomery''.

[[File:Forteresse de Dubrovnik.jpg|left|thumb|235px|[[Walls of Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]]]
Also by that time, the medieval walls were no longer secure against a serious threat from an army, as they were not designed to be strong enough to resist cannon fire. They were sometimes rebuilt, as at [[Berwick on Tweed]], or retained for use against thieves and other threats of a lower order. Very elaborate and complex schemes for town defences were developed in the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]], but these belong mainly to the post-medieval periods. By 1600, the medieval wall is likely to have been seen more as a platform for displaying hangings and the pomery as a gathering ground for spectators, or as a source of building stone and a site for its use, respectively. However, a few, such as those of [[Carcassonne]] and [[Dubrovnik]], survived fairly well and have been restored to a nearly complete state.

Medieval walls that were no longer adequate for defending were succeeded by the [[star fort]]. After the invention of the [[explosive shell]], star forts became obsolete as well.

===Harbours===
[[Image:Fn braun-varadinum.jpg|thumb|right|Fortifications of Várad (now [[Oradea]]/Nagyvárad, [[Romania]]) in a 1617 print]]
[[Harbour]]s or some sort of water access was often essential to the construction of medieval fortification. It was a direct route for trading and fortification. Having direct access to a body of water provided a route for resupply in times of war, an additional method of transportation in times of peace, and potential drinking water for a [[besiege]]d castle or fortification. The concept of rivers or harbours coming directly up to the walls of fortifications was especially used by the English as they constructed castles throughout [[Wales]].
There is evidence that harbours were fortified, with wooden structures in the water creating a semi-circle around the harbour, or jetties, as seen in an artists reconstruction of Hedeby, in Denmark, with an opening for ships to access the land. Usually, these wooden structures would have small bases at either end, creating a 'watch' and defense platform.

===Churches and monasteries===
{{main|Castle chapel}}
[[Religion]] was a central part of the lives of medieval soldiers, and [[Church (building)|churches]], [[chapel]]s, [[monastery|monasteries]], and other buildings of religious function were often included within the walls of any fortification, be it temporary or permanent. A place to conduct religious services was usually essential to the morale of the soldiers.

===Mottes and baileys===
{{Main|Motte-and-bailey}}
Motte-and-bailey was the prevalent form of castle during 11th and 12th centuries. A courtyard (called a bailey) was protected by a ditch and a palisade (strong timber fence). Often the entrance was protected by a lifting bridge, a [[drawbridge]] or a timber gate tower. Inside the bailey were stables, workshops, and a chapel.

The motte was the final refuge in this type of castle. It was a raised earth mound, and varied considerably, with these mounds being 3 metres to 30 metres in height (10 feet to 100 feet), and from {{convert|30|to|90|m|ft}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Toy, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a tower on top of the motte. In most cases, the tower was made of timber, though some were also made of stones. Stone towers were found in natural mounds, as artificial ones were not strong enough to support stone towers. Larger mottes had towers with many rooms, including the great hall. Smaller ones had only a watch tower.

==Construction==
[[File:Mehrangarh Fort, Jodhpur. 1981.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Mehrangarh Fort]], Jodhpur, which was built between the 15th and 17th centuries]]
Construction could sometimes take decades. The string of Welsh castles [[Edward I of England]] had built were an exception in that he focused much of the resources of his kingdom on their speedy construction. In addition to paid workers, forced levies of labourers put thousands of men on each site and shortened construction to a few years.

===Location===
[[image:El Castillo de Predjama.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Predjama Castle was built next to the cave]]
Nature could provide very effective natural defense for the castle. For this reason many castles were built on larger hills, cliffs, close to rivers, lakes or even caves.

===Materials===
Materials that were used in the building of castles varied through history. Wood was used for most castles until 1066. They were cheap and were quick to construct. The reason wood fell into disuse as a material is that it is quite flammable. Soon stone became more popular.

Stone castles took years to construct depending on the overall size of the castle. Stone was stronger and of course much more expensive than wood. Most stone had to be quarried miles away, and then brought to the building site. But with the invention of the cannon and gunpowder, castles soon lost their power.

===Costs===
[[File:Battlement (PSF).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Drawing of battlements on a tower]]
Costs for the walls depended on the material used. Wood would cost very little and was quick to build, but was weak. Stone was strong but very expensive and time-consuming to construct.

===Manpower===
Manpower in the medieval era in Europe consisted mainly of serfs.

===Walls===


[[Image:GradSneznik2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Snežnik Castle protected by defensive wall in southern Slovenia]]

The height of walls varied widely by castle, but were often {{convert|2.5|–|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick. They were usually topped with [[crenellation]] or [[parapet]]s that offered protection to defenders. Some also featured [[machicolation]]s (from the French ''machicoulis'', approximately "neck-crusher") which consisted of openings between a wall and a parapet, formed by [[corbel]]ling out the latter, allowing defenders to throw stones, boiling water, and so forth, upon assailants below. Some castles featured additional inner walls, as additional [[fortification]]s from which to mount a defense if outer walls were breached.

===Gates===
{{See also|City gate|Barbican}}
[[Image:105 0508ConventoDeCristo2.jpg|thumb|Gate of [[Tomar]] Castle, [[Portugal]]]]
Any entrance through a wall, being an opening, forms an obvious weak point. To be practical, the entryway would have to accommodate supplies being brought through, yet difficult for attackers to breach. For example, passage over ditches or moats would have to be withdrawn to deny attackers. The use of multiple walls or ditches around an entrance would also make it difficult for defenders to use the entrance practically, necessitating better methods of control. Gates came in many forms, from the simple stone buttress and timber blocks,&lt;ref name="Stoning and Fire at hill fort entrances of southern Britain"&gt;{{cite book|author=Avery, Michael|title=World Archeology|volume=Vol. 18, No. 2|date=October 1986|pages=216–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the massive and imposing stone archways and thick wooden doors most associated with medieval citadels.

===Killing fields===
A killing field was an area between the main wall and a secondary wall, so when the first wall was breached the attackers would run into the killing field to be confronted by another wall from which soldiers bombarded them. Soldiers would be positioned atop the second wall and armed with any variety of weapons, ranging from bows to crossbows to simple rocks.

===Moats===
{{Main|Moat}}
A moat was a common addition to medieval fortifications, and the principal purpose was to simply increase the effective height of the walls and to prevent digging under the walls. In many instances, natural water paths were used as moats, and often extended through ditches to surround as much of the fortification as possible. Provided this was not so unnaturally contrived as to allow an attacker to drain the system, it served two defensive purposes. It made approaching the curtain wall of the castle more difficult and the undermining of the wall virtually impossible. To position a castle on a small island was very favorable from a defensive point of view, although it made deliveries of supplies and building materials more cumbersome and expensive.

===Keeps===
{{Main|Keep}}
A keep is a strong central tower which normally forms the heart of a castle. Often the keep is the most defended area of a castle, and as such may form the main habitation area for a noble or lord, or contain important stores such as the armoury or the main well.

===Stairs===
[[File:Stumble steps.jpg|alt=Stumble steps at Maynooth Castle|thumb|Stumble steps at [[Maynooth Castle]], Ireland. Note the canting, and the varied tread depth and riser height.]]
Stairs were also constructed to contain trick or stumble steps. These were steps that had different rise height or tread depth from the rest and would cause anyone running up the stairs to stumble or fall, so slowing down the attackers' progress.

===Doors===
[[Image:Horezu oak Reinforced door.JPG|thumb|right|Reinforced wood door]]
A typical exterior wooden [[door]] might be made out of two layers of [[oak]] planks. The grain of the wood would run vertically on the front layer and horizontally on the back, like a simple form of [[plywood]]. The two layers would be held together by iron studs, and the structure might be strengthened and stiffened with iron bands.

The studs themselves were pointed on the front so that attackers would damage their weapons ([[sword]]s, [[axe]]s, etc.) while trying to break through.

==Transition to modern fortification==
From the mid-15th century onwards, the power of cannons grew and medieval walls became obsolete as they were too thin to offer any realistic protection against prolonged [[bomb]]ardment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pañeda Ruiz|first1=José Manuel|title=Evolution of siege techniques: From the Catholic Monarchs to Vauban|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/images/stories/docs/evolution_of_siege_techniques.pdf|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=22 October 2015|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this, medieval walls were often upgraded with the addition of artillery platforms or bastions, and battlements were replaced by thick parapets with [[embrasure]]s. In many cases, the medieval walls were dismantled and their stonework, which was still valuable as construction material, was reused in the construction of the new fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=A ''Cubete Artillero'' at Mdina? – Gunpowder fortifications in Late Medieval Malta|journal=Proceedings of History Week|date=2009|pages=150–159|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Proceedings%20of%20History%20Week/PHW2009/10s.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414181507/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Proceedings%20of%20History%20Week/PHW2009/10s.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting space is often seen in old city centers of Europe even to this day, as broader streets often outline where the old wall once stood (evident for example in [[Prague]] and [[Florence, Italy]]).

The transition between medieval and early modern fortification can be seen in the [[fortifications of Rhodes]] in Greece and the [[fortifications of Famagusta]] in Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Walsh|editor1-first=Michael J.

==Defensive obstacles==
Just as modern military [[combat engineer|engineers]] enhance field fortifications with obstacles such as [[wire obstacle|barbed wire]], medieval engineers used a number of obstacle types including [[abatis]], [[caltrop]]s, [[cheval de frise]], and [[trou de loup]].

{{Refimprove|date=February 2008}}
A '''mooncalf''' (or '''moon-calf''', '''calvaluna''') is a [[monstrous birth]], the [[miscarriage|abortive]] [[fetus]] of a [[Cattle|cow]] or other [[livestock|farm animal]]. The term was occasionally applied to an abortive [[human]] fetus.

The term derives from the once widespread [[superstition]], present in many [[Europe]]an [[folk medicine|folk]] traditions, that such malformed creatures were the product of the sinister influence of the [[Moon]] on fetal development.

==Modern usage==
The term came to also refer to any monstrous or grotesque thing. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], for instance, used the term to describe [[Caliban]], the deformed servant of [[Prospero]], in ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]''.

In [[H. G. Wells]]' 1901 novel ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'', large creatures domesticated by the Selenites are referred to as "mooncalves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The First Men in the Moon]] |last=Wells |first=H. G. |authorlink=H. G. Wells |year=1901 |chapter=Chapter 11: The Mooncalf Pastures }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mooncalf is used as a derogatory term indicating someone is a dullard, fool or otherwise not particularly bright or sharp. For example, [[W. C. Fields]] in ''[[The Bank Dick]]'' (1940) advises his prospective son-in-law to avoid being a "mooncalf" by buying shares he has been conned into believing are worth much more than the proffered price.

Mooncalf is also the name of a species of magical creatures in the world of the [[Harry Potter]] series. It is described in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' as a shy, nocturnal creature with a smooth, pale grey body, bulging eyes and four spindly legs with large flat feet. Mooncalves perform dances in the moonlight, and are apparently responsible for [[crop circle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]] |last=Rowling |first=J. K. |authorlink=J. K. Rowling |year=2001 |chapter=An A–Z of Fantastic Beasts }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|film of the same name]], Newt Scamander's collection of creatures in his suitcase includes a herd of Mooncalves.

Wilfred Maxwell, narrator and protagonist of [[occult]]ist [[Dion Fortune]]’s 1938 novel, ''[[The Sea Priestess]]'', refers several times to a mentally handicapped character who falls into the sea and disappears as a "mooncalf".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Sea Priestess]] |last=Fortune|first=Dion|authorlink=Dion Fortune|origyear=1938|year=1978 |at=Chapter X, p. 86, ''et infra''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ninnion Tablet''', dated to approximately 370 BC, is a red [[clay tablet]] depicting the ancient [[Greece|Greek]] [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] (religious rites connected to [[Greek mythology]]). It was rediscovered in [[Eleusis]], [[Attica]] in 1895, and is kept in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]].

==Content==
The tablet depicts [[Iacchus]] leading a procession of initiates into the Mysteries. Receiving this group are the deities [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]]. Above the artifact's main scene are multiple representations of the moon. The Ninnion Tablet is the only known original representation of the Mysteries' initiation rites.

[[File:North French Hebrew Miscellany folio 117b118a.l.jpg|thumb|Left, scenes with [[Abraham]] from Genesis, ch 18; right, David]]
The '''North French Hebrew Miscellany''' or "French Miscellany" or "London Miscellany" ([[British Library]] Add. MS 11639) is an important [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[illuminated manuscript]] from 13th-century [[Capetian France|France]], created c. 1278-98.&lt;ref&gt;Tahan's c. 1278-98 is here preferred to BM's 1277-1286, see below.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[miscellany]] is a manuscript containing texts of different types and by different authors, and this volume contains a wide range of [[Hebrew language]] texts, mostly religious but many secular.  The manuscript is exceptional among medieval Hebrew manuscripts both for its size and the diversity of the texts and the quality and lavishness of its illuminations, which as was often the case were added by Christian specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Tahan, 10-11; BM&lt;/ref&gt;

This manuscript was digitized by the British Library's Hebrew Manuscripts Digitisation Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/projects/hebrew-manuscripts-digitisation-project|title=Hebrew Manuscripts Digitisation Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_MS_11639|title=Digitised Manuscripts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The manuscript (excluding paper flyleaves) has 746 folios (so 1,492 pages), which include a [[Units of paper quantity#Quire|quire]] of six illuminated pages added at the end; the page dimensions are 16 x 12&amp;nbsp;cm. The manuscript includes "eighty-four different groups of texts, including hundreds of poems".  The Biblical and liturgical texts include the [[Pentateuch]], the  ''[[Haftarot]]'' prophetical readings, ''[[Tiqqun soferim]]'', [[Five Scrolls]], and the full annual cycle of the [[liturgy]], as well as the [[Haggadah]] ([[Passover]] ritual) and the earliest complete Hebrew text of the [[Book of Tobit]], which is not included in the [[Tanakh]] or canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Tahan, 121; BM&lt;/ref&gt;  Other texts include the ''[[Pirkei Avot]]'', prayers, [[gematria]], legal texts and calendars.  The poetry includes a large group of poems by [[Moses ibn Ezra]], the great Spanish [[Sephardic]] poet of the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;Facsimile has the fullest list; BM&lt;/ref&gt; The single scribe of the texts is named (in four places) as "Benjamin", who may have compiled the book for his own use; there is no "proper [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]" as might be expected in a commissioned manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Tahan, 121&lt;/ref&gt;   Another suggestion is that the unusual number of illustrations including the biblical figure of [[Aaron]] indicate a patron with this name.&lt;ref&gt;Facsimile&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:North French Hebrew Miscellany 260b.l Esther before Ahasuerus.jpg|thumb|[[Esther]] before [[Ahasuerus]].]]
The manuscript is illustrated with a total of 49 full-page miniatures, mostly of Biblical subjects, "which were executed by Christian illuminators attached to three major contemporary Parisian workshops", and probably also worked on at [[Amiens]] or another north French city,&lt;ref&gt;Still a matter of some discussion, see Tahan, 119 (quoted); Facsimile, which is more open to the possibility of some of the artists being Jewish;BM&lt;/ref&gt; and reflect the latest Gothic styles, though the execution of the various artists is uneven, and one scholar complains that "broad, flat expanses of crudely painted, often runny pigment; angular, etiolated figures, and unusual colours place it well outside the orbit of the Parisian de luxe book, although its painters were undoubtedly influenced by the Parisian style".&lt;ref&gt;Wolinski, 280-281&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjects include Jewish mythical beasts whose depiction draws on Christian [[bestiaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Tahan, 119-122&lt;/ref&gt; These are mostly illustrated in [[roundel]]s with a text caption beneath, while the narrative scenes from the Pentateuch are in rectangular miniatures (the scene with [[Noah's Ark]] illustrated here is an exception).  There are 2 full-page diagrams in ink of the stars and planets and the [[signs of the zodiac]] (ff. 542, 542v) and "numerous inhabited initial-word panels, and inhabited and decorated panels in colours and gold attached to initial words and numerous decorated initial-word panels with gold letters".&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;BM&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The relatively precise dating comes from aspects of the text including the inclusion of [[Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil]]'s legal compendium the ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Katan]]'', a text known to have been finished in 1277, mentions of [[Yehiel of Paris]], who died in 1286, as still alive, and "a table of [[molad]]ot (lunation-commencements) for the period 1279/80 - 1295/95 (f. 444)".&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;  The style of the miniatures accords with this date range.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Provenance==
Inscriptions record various points in the manuscript's history, though many gaps remain.  It perhaps left France for Germany in the persecutions of 1306. A loan of the book is noted in 1426, and in 1431 it was sold to an Abraham ben Moses of [[Coburg]].  By 1479 it was in Italy at [[Mestre]] on the coast opposite [[Venice]], where it went next, followed by [[Padua]] in 1480 and [[Iesi]] near [[Ancona]] in 1481.  The 16th century [[bookbinding]] has the arms of the Jewish [[Abraham Rovigo|Rovigo]] family, but in the 17th century the manuscript passed into Christian hands, including the [[Barberini]] family. It was examined by the [[Christian Hebraist]] [[Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi]] and published in his work ''Variae lectionis veteris testamenti'' ([[Parma]], 1784).  It was bought by a Paris bookseller from a [[Milan]] collection for the [[British Museum]] in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Facsimile; BM&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4032">{{about|the concept of free information|the organization|Open Knowledge}}

'''Open knowledge''' is knowledge that one is free to use, reuse, and redistribute without legal, social or technological restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Definition - Defining Open in Open Data, Open Content and Open Knowledge|url=https://opendefinition.org/od/|website=opendefinition.org|publisher=Open Knowledge Open Definition Group|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open knowledge is a set of principles and methodologies related to the production and distribution of how knowledge works in an ''open'' manner. Knowledge is interpreted broadly to include data, content and general information.

The concept is related to [[Open-source model|open source]] and the ''Open Knowledge Definition'' is directly derived from the [[Open Source Definition]]. Open knowledge can be seen as being a superset of [[open data]], [[open content]] and [[Gratis versus libre|libre]] [[open access]] with the aim of highlighting the commonalities between these different groups.

==History==
===Early history===
Similarly to other 'open' concepts such as open data and open content, though the term is rather new, the concept is old. For example, one of the earliest printed texts of which we have record is a copy of the Buddhist Diamond sutra produced in China around 868 AD, and in it can be found the dedication: "for universal free distribution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollock|first1=Rufus|title=The Value of the Public Domain|url=https://rufuspollock.com/papers/value_of_the_public_domain.html|website=rufuspollock.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
In the early twentieth century a debate about [[intellectual property rights]] developed within the [[German Social Democratic Party]]. A key contributor was [[Karl Kautsky]] who in 1902 devoted a section of a pamphlet to "Intellectual Production" which he distinguished from [[material production]]:
:"Communism in material production, anarchy in the intellectual that is the type of a Socialist mode of production, as it will develop from the rule of the proletariat—in other words, from the Social Revolution through the logic of economic facts, whatever might be: the wishes, intentions, and theories of the proletariat."&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kautsky|first1=Karl|title=The Social Revolution and, On the Morrow of the Social Revolution|date=1903|publisher=Twentieth Century Press|location=London|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40}}

This view was based on an analysis according to which [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Law of value]] only affected material production, not [[intellectual production]].

With the development of the public Internet from the early 1990s, it became far easier to copy and share information across the world. The phrase '[[information wants to be free]]' became a rallying cry for people who wanted to create an internet without the commercial barriers that they felt inhibited creative expression in traditional material production.

Wikipedia was founded in 2001 with the ethos of providing information which could be edited and modified to improve its quality. The success of Wikipedia became instrumental in making open knowledge something that millions of people interacted with and contributed to.

'''Overlay architecture''', or '''Overlay''', is "event [[architecture]]", such as the temporary elements that are added to more permanent buildings to enable the operation of major [[sporting event]]s or [[festival]]s. These elements provide additional facilities for the duration of an event and are generally of a lightweight construction, as they are often removed afterwards.

==Use==
The role of overlay is extensive and can cover all aspects of a major event, starting with the "back of house" user groups, including staff, operations, officials, [[broadcast]], [[Mass media|media]], hospitality, [[VIP]]s and the athletes themselves. These groups all require physical facilities to provide [[accreditation]], accommodation, segregation and [[wayfinding]], which need to be separated from, but connected to, the spectators at the "front of house", to preserve the magic and mystery of the event experience.
It is important that the overlay design is integrated into the masterplan of major events at an early stage, in order that the flow of people through the site can be effectively managed and sufficient space provided for the various overlay facilities.  
The overlay design also has a significant role in helping to define the overall environment of a major event. By taking a design-inclusive approach and considering the cultural and design aspects alongside the commercial and functional requirements, memorable places and spaces can be created out of simple components and hired commodities.

==Overlay categories==
Overlay can be categorised in three main ways: 

* '''Existing facilities''': the overlay consists of temporary elements being added to an existing space to accommodate the specific needs of an event (e.g. the [[Excel Centre]], or the [[Archery]] range at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]]) 
* '''New facilities''': the overlay consists of temporary elements that are integrated with permanent elements in a new facility or venue for an event (e.g. the [[Olympic Stadium]])
* '''Temporary facilities''': the overlay creates a completely temporary facility or venue for an event (e.g. the [[Beach Volleyball]] court at [[Horse Guards Parade]], or the [[Equestrianism|Equestrian]] Centre at [[Greenwich Park]])

The '''Paseo Arts District''', originally referred to as the Spanish Village,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK/1980/05/22&amp;id=Ar01000&amp;sk=1BFB1BEE|title=Weekend Paseo Festival|last=|first=|date=5/22/1980|website=The Daily Oklahoman|archive-url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK%2F1980%2F05%2F22&amp;id=Ar01000&amp;sk=1BFB1BEE|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built in 1929 as the first commercial shopping district north of [[Downtown Oklahoma City]] by Oklahoman G.A.

The Spanish Village era is said to have ended in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK/1983/05/27&amp;id=Ar14500&amp;sk=65DC8D13|title=Paseo wiping out its hippy-era|last=|first=|date=5/27/1983|website=|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paseo has undergone transformations; currently, the Paseo is enjoying a renaissance since the 1980s. Today, a vibrant group of artists and other interested people are transforming this community through creative thinking and arts activities.

Located along Paseo Drive at roughly N. Walker Ave and NW 28th Street, the faux Spanish village with its stucco buildings and clay tile roofs is the home to many of [[Oklahoma City]]'s Artists.

The Paseo Arts district is home to a number of chic bars, restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, art galleries, and avant-garde businesses. Since 1975, Paseo hosts the annual Paseo Arts Festival each [[Memorial Day]] weekend, which showcases original works of visual and performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK/1984/05/23&amp;id=Ar06900&amp;sk=C9D602AC|title=Paseo Festival's Foothold Solid After Nine Years|last=|first=|date=5/23/1984|website=The Daily Oklahoman|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other events within the Paseo Arts district include its annual Fairy Ball, as well as the First Friday Gallery Walk. The First Friday Gallery Walk  is an event in which Paseo art galleries and restaurants host Art Opening Receptions on the first Friday of every month in order to displaying new artist's work and invite people to visit the Paseo district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Friday|work=thepaseo.com/calendar/firstfriday.html|accessdate=9/11/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district is also home to the oldest church in Oklahoma, Old Trinity of Paseo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldtrinityofpaseo.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The former Anglican church was built in [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]] in 1842 and was closed in 1990. Oklahoma City photographer Tom Lee purchased the church in 2000 and had it dismantled and moved to Oklahoma City to serve as his studio. Lee sold the church in 2007 to be rented as a venue for weddings and other events.&lt;ref&gt;http://okc.net/2011/01/31/keeping-okc-weird-a-rough-guide-to-the-paseo/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paseo district is listed as a neighborhood ‘worthy of preservation’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places|work=nps.gov/nr/}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|National Register of Historic Places]] and in 2010, was named as one of the ’10 Great Neighborhoods for 2010’ by the American Planning Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NewsOK Article|work=newsok.com |url=http://newsok.com/okcs-paseo-named-as-one-of-americas-10-great-neighborhoods-for-2010/article/3504008|accessdate=9/11/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gerhard von Kügelgen 001.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Friedrich Schiller]] by [[Gerhard von Kügelgen]]]]

[[Friedrich Schiller]] developed the concept of the '''play drive''', a conjoining through contradiction of [[human being|man]]'s experience of the infinite and finite, freedom and time, sense and reason, life and form.  The object of the play drive is the living form, and in contemplation of the beautiful it allows man to become most human. To understand how he comes to this conclusion, it is important to trace the origins of life and form, as a function of the two drives that the play drive mediates: the form drive and the sense drive. These two drives are themselves functions of man's person and condition, which Schiller initially describes in terms of the absolute and time.

==Schiller's view of the human condition==

===Person===
In [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s thought, the sense and the form drive arise out of man's existence as a "person", which endures, and man's "condition", the determining attributes that change. The person is described as unchangeable and eternal, and endures change. "We pass from rest to activity, from passion to indifference, from agreement to contradiction; but we remain, and what proceeds directly from us remains too".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; This personhood is grounded in itself, and not in the contradictory state of condition. Schiller argues that because man is finite, condition and person have to be separate, and cannot be grounded in each other. If they were, either change would persist or the person would change. "And so we would, in the first place, have the idea of absolute being grounded upon itself, that is to say freedom".&lt;ref name=Schiller116&gt;Schiller, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, person is grounded in itself, and this grounding is responsible for man's idea of freedom. Freedom, defined as an absolute being grounded in itself.

===Condition===
Unlike the person, condition, according to Schiller, cannot be grounded in itself. It is already established that condition cannot be grounded in person, and must therefore proceed from something else. This "proceeding" grounds the condition in contingency, which is man's experience of time. "For man is not just a person situated in a particular condition. Every condition, however, every determinate existence, has its origins in time; and so man, as a phenomenal being, must also have a beginning, although the pure intelligence within him is eternal".&lt;ref name=Schiller116/&gt; Man receives reality that is outside of him, as something changing within time. This changing perception is accompanied by the eternal "I" – the person – which organizes the change and variety into a unity. "The reality which the supreme intelligence creates out of itself, man has first to receive, and he does in fact receive it, by way of perception, as something existing outside of him in space, and as something changing within him in time".&lt;ref name="Schiller, p.117"&gt;Schiller, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; The perfect man, according to Schiller, would be a constant unity amongst constant change. These seemingly contradictory forces of freedom through person and time through condition, manifest themselves in man as the form and the sense drive. These drives, and consequently man's experience of freedom and time, are mediated by the play drive.

===Sense and Form Drives===

====Sense Drive====
The sense drive, in Schiller's thought, is a function of man's condition. It comes from man's physical existence, and the whole of man's phenomenal existence stems from it. In his sensuous existence man is set within the limits of time, within his condition, and becomes matter. "By matter in this context we understand nothing more than change, or reality that occupies time. Consequently this drive demands that there shall be change, that time shall have content".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p.118&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, sensation of the sensuous drive is time occupied by content.

====Form Drive====
The form drive, in Schiller's view, is a function of the person grounded in itself. This drive is man's rational nature, his "absolute existence", and its goal is to give man freedom, so he could bring harmony to the variety of things in the world. Because the form drive insists on the absolute, "It wants the real to be necessary and eternal, and the eternal and necessary to be real. In other words, it insist on truth and on the right".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; The sense drive and the form drive are in competition, and overpower one another in the person.

====In competition====
If the sense drive overcomes the form drive, according to Schiller, it reduces man into matter, but leaves him without the ability to bring this matter into unity. "As long as he merely feels, merely desires and acts upon desire, he is as yet nothing but world, if by this term we understand nothing but the formless content of time" (117). In order to not be just "world", man must exercise his form drive upon matter, and "give reality the predisposition he carries within him".&lt;ref name="Schiller, p.117"/&gt; When the form drive overpowers, Schiller says we experience "the greatest enlargement of being",&lt;ref name=Schiller121&gt;Schiller, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that because it is a drive toward the absolute, all limitations disappear, and instead of seeing the world finitely, as he does through the sensuous drive, "man has raised himself to a unity of ideas embracing the whole realm of phenomena".&lt;ref name=Schiller121/&gt; Since the sense drive places us in time, indulging in the formal drive removes us out of time, and in doing so "We are no longer individuals; we are species".&lt;ref name=Schiller121/&gt; While this seems like a perfected state, it is only a point on the path to man reaching his maximum potential.

====In equilibrium====
To maximize potential of the two drives, Schiller argues, one cannot suffocate or limit the other. The perfection of the sense drive would consist in maximizing changeability and maximizing extensity. This is the development of receptivity, through which man presents more "surface" to phenomena of the world. "The more facets his receptivity develops, the more labile it is, and the more surface it presents to phenomena, so much more world does man apprehend, and all the more potentialities does he develop in himself".&lt;ref name=Schiller122&gt;Schiller, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; To suppress this faculty would not achieve the perfection of the form drive, rather the opposite. The perfection of the form drive is accomplished in its ability to oppose the sense drive through its endurance to change. "The more power and depth the personality achieves, and the more freedom reason attains, so much more world does man comprehend, and all the more form does he create outside of himself".&lt;ref name=Schiller122/&gt; Therefore, the Form drive's autonomy and intensity are maximized as a response to the maximization of the sense drive. "Where both these aptitudes are conjoined, man will combine the greatest fullness of existence with the highest autonomy and freedom and instead of losing himself to the world, will rather draw the latter into himself in all its infinitude of phenomena, and subject it to the unity of his reason"&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;  This "conjoining" of the two faculties, are actually a mediation by the third fundamental drive, the play drive.

===Play Drive===
The play drive mediates the demands of the sense and the form drive. "The sense drive demands that there shall be change and that time shall have a content; the form drive demands that time shall be annulled and that there shall be no change. That drive, therefore, in which both others work in concert is the play drive, reconciling becoming with absolute being and change with identity".&lt;ref name=Schiller126&gt;Schiller, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; For the play drive to successfully mediate the two drives, man must be educated of two things. He must learn passivity, to exercise his sense drive and become receptive of the world. He must learn activity, to free his reason, as much as possible from the receptive. Accomplishing both, man is able to have a twofold experience simultaneously, "in which he were to be at once conscious of his freedom and sensible of his existence, were at one and the same time, to feel himself matter and come to know himself as mind".&lt;ref name=Schiller126&gt;Schiller, p.126&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, by maximizing the constraint of the absolute and the contingency of the material, the play drive negates the demands of both drives and sets man free both physically and morally. To exist in this paradoxical state, would mean to have a  "complete intuition of his human nature".&lt;ref name=Schiller126/&gt; Furthermore, "the object that afforded him this vision would become for him the symbol of his accomplished destiny"&lt;ref name=Schiller126/&gt; and this would serve him as a finite embodiment of the infinite. Schiller names this object of the play drive 'living form'.

===Living Form===
The living form comes from a mediation of the "objects" of the sense and the form drives. The object of the sense drive, Schiller calls life. This concept designates all material being and all that is immediately present to the senses. It is a function of man's condition. The object of the form drive, he simply calls form. This concept includes all the formal qualities of things and their relationship to our reason. Schiller argues for the necessity of the interplay of the two objects in creation of a [[sculpture]] from a block of [[marble]]. "As long as we merely think about his form, it is lifeless, a mere abstraction; as long as we merely feel his life, it is formless, a mere expression. Only when his form lives in our feeling and his life takes on form in our understanding, does he become a living form".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; This experience of the living form, as a mediation of life and form by the play drive, is what Schiller calls the experience of beauty. "Beauty results from the reciprocal action of two opposed drives and from the uniting of two opposed principles. The highest ideal of beauty, therefore, to be sought in the most perfect possible union and equilibrium of reality and form".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in contemplation of the beautiful, man is exercising the play drive, and is fully human.

'''Pop art''' is an [[art movement]] that emerged in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] during the mid- to late-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/pop-art ''Pop Art: A Brief History'', MoMA Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;Livingstone, M., ''Pop Art: A Continuing History'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The movement presented a challenge to traditions of [[fine art]] by including imagery from [[popular culture|popular]] and [[mass culture]], such as [[advertising]], [[comic books]] and mundane cultural objects. One of its aims is to use images of ''popular'' (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or [[kitsch]]y elements of any culture, most often through the use of [[irony]].&lt;ref name="ages" /&gt; It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ages"&gt;de la Croix, H.; Tansey, R., ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in [[UK|Britain]], and [[Larry Rivers]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] among others in the [[United States]]. Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then-dominant ideas of [[abstract expressionism]], as well as an expansion of those ideas.&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt; Due to its utilization of [[found objects]] and images, it is similar to [[Dada]]. Pop art and [[minimalism]] are considered to be art movements that precede [[postmodern art]], or are some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Harrison| first=Sylvia |title=Pop Art and the Origins of Post-Modernism| publisher=Cambridge University Press| date=2001-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising. Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'', by [[Andy Warhol]]. Even the labeling on the outside of a shipping box containing food items for retail has been used as subject matter in pop art, as demonstrated by [[Andy Warhol|Warhol's]] ''Campbell's Tomato Juice Box,'' 1964 (pictured).

==Origins==
The origins of pop art in North America developed differently from Great Britain.&lt;ref name="ages" /&gt; In the United States, pop art was a response by artists; it marked a return to [[Hard-edge painting|hard-edged]] composition and [[Representation (arts)|representational art]]. They used impersonal, mundane reality, [[irony]], and [[parody]] to "defuse" the personal symbolism and "[[painterly]] looseness" of [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt;&lt;ref name="high"&gt;Gopnik, A.; Varnedoe, K., ''High &amp; Low: Modern Art &amp; Popular Culture'', New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., some artwork by [[Larry Rivers]], [[Alex Katz]] and [[Man Ray]] anticipated pop art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/alex-katz-is-cooler-than-ever-34462293/ |title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places &amp;#124; Smithsonian |website=Smithsonianmag.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the origins of pop art in [[Post-war|post-War]] Britain, while employing irony and parody, were more academic. Britain focused on the dynamic and paradoxical imagery of American [[popular culture|pop culture]] as powerful, manipulative symbolic devices that were affecting whole patterns of life, while simultaneously improving the prosperity of a society.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt; Early pop art in Britain was a matter of ideas fueled by [[American popular culture]] ''when viewed from afar''.&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt;  Similarly, pop art was both an extension and a repudiation of [[Dadaism]].&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt; While pop art and Dadaism explored some of the same subjects, pop art replaced the destructive, satirical, and anarchic impulses of the Dada movement with a detached affirmation of the artifacts of mass culture.&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt; Among those artists in Europe seen as producing work leading up to pop art are: [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Kurt Schwitters]].

===Proto-pop===
[[File:NY Met demuth figure 5 gold.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Charles Demuth]], ''[[I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold]]'' 1928,  collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]] ]]
Although both British and American pop art began during the 1950s, [[Marcel Duchamp]] and others in Europe like [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Man Ray]] predate the movement; in addition there were some earlier American ''proto-pop'' origins which utilized "as found" cultural objects.&lt;ref name="iha"&gt;Piper, David. ''The Illustrated History of Art'', {{ISBN|0-7537-0179-0}}, p486-487.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, American artists [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Charles Demuth]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] created paintings that contained pop culture imagery (mundane objects culled from American commercial products and advertising design), almost "prefiguring" the pop art movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2007/08/06/070806craw_artworld_schjeldahl |title=Modern Love |publisher=The New Yorker |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''American Art: History and .'' p.464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom: the Independent Group==
[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]]'s collage ''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' (1956) is one of the earliest works to be considered "pop art".|alt=A collage of many different styles shows a mostly naked man and woman in a house.]]

The [[Independent Group]] (IG), founded in London in 1952, is regarded as the precursor to the pop art movement.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mod"&gt;Arnason, H., ''History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; They were a gathering of young painters, sculptors, architects, writers and critics who were challenging prevailing modernist approaches to culture as well as traditional views of fine art. Their group discussions centered on pop culture implications from elements such as mass advertising, movies, product design, comic strips, science fiction and technology. At the first Independent Group meeting in 1952, co-founding member, artist and sculptor [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] presented a lecture using a series of [[collage]]s titled ''Bunk!'' that he had assembled during his time in Paris between 1947 and 1949.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; This material of "found objects" such as advertising, comic book characters, magazine covers and various mass-produced graphics mostly represented ''American'' popular culture. One of the collages in that presentation was Paolozzi's ''I was a Rich Man's Plaything'' (1947), which includes the first use of the word "pop", appearing in a cloud of smoke emerging from a revolver.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/paolozzi-i-was-a-rich-mans-plaything-t01462 |title='I was a Rich Man's Plaything', Sir Eduardo Paolozzi |publisher=Tate |date=2015-12-10 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Paolozzi's seminal presentation in 1952, the IG focused primarily on the imagery of American popular culture, particularly mass advertising.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt;

According to the son of [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], the term "pop art" was first coined by his father in 1954 in conversation with [[Frank Cordell]],&lt;ref name="Warholstars.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/articles/johnmchale/johnmchale.html |title=John McHale |website=Warholstars.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources credit its origin to British critic [[Lawrence Alloway]].&lt;ref&gt;"Pop art", ''A Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Art'', Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pop art", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms'', Michael Clarke, Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (Both versions agree that the term was used in [[Independent Group]] discussions by mid-1955.)

"Pop art" as a moniker was then used in discussions by IG members in the Second Session of the IG in 1955, and the specific term "pop art" first appeared in published print in the article "But Today We Collect Ads" by IG members [[Alison and Peter Smithson]] in Ark magazine in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Alison and Peter Smithson, "But Today We Collect Ads", reprinted on page 54 in ''Modern Dreams The Rise and Fall of Pop'', published by ICA and MIT, {{ISBN|0-262-73081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is often credited to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[art critic]]/[[curator]] [[Lawrence Alloway]] for his 1958 essay titled ''The Arts and the Mass Media'', even though the precise language he uses is "popular mass culture".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Alloway, "The Arts and the Mass Media," Architectural Design &amp; Construction, February 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; "Furthermore, what I meant by it then is not what it means now. I used the term, and also 'Pop Culture' to refer to the products of the mass media, not to works of art that draw upon popular culture. In any case, sometime between the winter of 1954-55 and 1957 the phrase acquired currency in conversation..."&lt;ref name="Honnef"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=KRtCl1nFSV8C&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=%22term+pop+art%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi44ePWpubWAhVEYlAKHe-2AtEQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22term%20pop%20art%22&amp;f=false Klaus Honnef, ''Pop Art'', Taschen, 2004], p. 6, {{ISBN|3822822183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Alloway was one of the leading critics to defend the inclusion of the imagery of mass culture in the fine arts. Alloway clarified these terms in 1966, at which time Pop Art had already transited from art schools and small galleries to a major force in the artworld. But its success had not been in England. Practically simultaneously, and independently, New York City had become the hotbed for Pop Art.&lt;ref name="Honnef" /&gt;

In London, the annual [[Royal Society of British Artists|Royal Society of British Artists (RBA)]] exhibition of young talent in 1960 first showed American pop influences. In January 1961, the most famous RBA-''Young Contemporaries'' of all put [[David Hockney]], the American [[R B Kitaj]], New Zealander [[Billy Apple]], [[Allen Jones (sculptor)|Allen Jones]], [[Derek Boshier]], [[Joe Tilson]], [[Patrick Caulfield]], [[Peter Phillips (artist)|Peter Phillips]] and [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] on the map; Apple designed the posters and invitations for both the 1961 and 1962 Young Contemporaries exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Barton 2010 11–21"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barton|first=Christina|title=Billy Apple: British and American Works 1960-69|year=2010|publisher=The Mayor Gallery|location=London|isbn=978-0-9558367-3-2|pages=11–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockney, Kitaj and Blake went on to win prizes at the John-Moores-Exhibition in Liverpool in the same year. Apple and Hockney traveled together to New York during the Royal College's 1961 summer break, which is when Apple first made contact with Andy Warhol – both later moved to the United States and Apple became involved with the New York pop art scene.&lt;ref name="Barton 2010 11–21" /&gt;

==United States==
Although pop art began in the early 1950s, in America it was given its greatest impetus during the 1960s. The term "pop art" was officially introduced in December 1962; the occasion was a "Symposium on Pop Art" organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="SchermanTony"&gt;Scherman, Tony. "When Pop Turned the Art World Upside Down." ''American Heritage'' 52.1 (February 2001), 68.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, American advertising had adopted many elements and inflections of modern art and functioned at a very sophisticated level. Consequently, American artists had to search deeper for dramatic styles that would distance art from the well-designed and clever commercial materials.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt; As the British viewed American popular culture imagery from a somewhat removed perspective, their views were often instilled with romantic, sentimental and humorous overtones. By contrast, American artists, bombarded every day with the diversity of mass-produced imagery, produced work that was generally more bold and aggressive.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt;
[[File:Roy Lichtenstein Drowning Girl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roy Lichtenstein]], ''[[Drowning Girl]]'', 1963, on display at the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]].|alt=A woman's crying face is overwhelmed by waves as she thinks, "I don't care! I'd rather sink than call Brad for help!"]]
Two important painters in the establishment of America's pop art vocabulary were [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]].&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; While the paintings of Rauschenberg have relationships to the earlier work of [[Kurt Schwitters]] and other [[Dada]] artists, his concern was for the social issues of the moment. His approach was to create art out of ephemeral materials. By using topical events in the life of everyday America, he gave his work a unique quality.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Sandler|Sandler, Irving H.]] ''The New York School: The Painters and Sculptors of the Fifties,'' New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1978. {{ISBN|0-06-438505-1}} pp. 174–195, ''Rauschenberg and Johns''; pp. 103–111, ''Rivers and the gestural realists''.&lt;/ref&gt; Johns' and Rauschenberg's work of the 1950s is classified as [[Neo-Dada]], and is visually distinct from the prototypical American pop art which exploded in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Jasper Johns" ''Art International'' (September 1960): 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hapgood,  Susan, ''Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958-62''. New York: Universe Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cheddar Cheese crop from Campbells Soup Cans MOMA.jpg|thumb|The ''Cheddar Cheese'' canvas from [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''Campbell's Soup Cans'', 1962.]]
[[Roy Lichtenstein]] is of equal importance to American pop art. His work, and its use of [[parody]], probably defines the basic premise of pop art better than any other.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; Selecting the old-fashioned comic strip as subject matter, Lichtenstein produces a hard-edged, precise composition that documents while also parodying in a soft manner. Lichtenstein used [[Oil paint|oil]] and [[Magna paint]] in his best known works, such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963), which was [[Appropriation (art)|appropriated]] from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83. (''Drowning Girl'' is part of the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].)&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendrickson|first=Janis|title=Roy Lichtenstein|year=1988|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|location=Cologne, Germany|isbn=3-8228-0281-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work features thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein said, "[abstract expressionists] put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery/content into the mix.

The paintings of Lichtenstein, like those of Andy Warhol, [[Tom Wesselmann]] and others, share a direct attachment to the commonplace image of American popular culture, but also treat the subject in an impersonal manner clearly illustrating the idealization of mass production.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; 

Andy Warhol is probably the most famous figure in pop art. In fact, art critic Arthur Danto once called Warhol "the nearest thing to a philosophical genius the history of art has produced".&lt;ref name="SchermanTony" /&gt;  Warhol attempted to take pop beyond an artistic style to a life style, and his work often displays a lack of human affectation that dispenses with the irony and parody of many of his peers.&lt;ref&gt;Michelson, Annette, Buchloh, B. H. D. (eds) ''Andy Warhol'' (October Files), MIT Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warhol, Andy. ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol, from A to B and back again''.

===Early U.S. exhibitions===
[[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]] had their first shows in the [[Judson Memorial Church#Sponsorship of the arts|Judson Gallery]] in 1959 and 1960 and later in 1960 through 1964 along with [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]] and others at the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street in Manhattan. In 1960, Martha Jackson showed [[Installation art|installations]] and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]], ''New Media - New Forms'' featured [[Hans Arp]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Jasper Johns]], Claes Oldenburg, [[Robert Rauschenberg]], Jim Dine and [[May Wilson]]. 1961 was the year of Martha Jackson's spring show, ''Environments, Situations, Spaces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O:AD:E:4397&amp;page_number=12&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 |title=The Collection |website=MoMA.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfaoi.com/newsm1/n1m651.htm |title=The Great American Pop Art Store: Multiples of the Sixties |website=Tfaoi.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Warhol held his first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in July 1962 at [[Ferus Gallery|Irving Blum's Ferus Gallery]], where he showed 32 paintings of Campell's soup cans, one for every flavor. Warhol sold the set of paintings to Blum for $1,000; in 1996, when the Museum of Modern Art acquired it, the set was valued at $15 million.&lt;ref name="SchermanTony" /&gt;

Donald Factor, the son of [[Max Factor Jr.]], and an art collector and co-editor of [[avant-garde]] [[literary magazine]] [[Nomad (magazine)|''Nomad'']], wrote an essay in the magazine's last issue, ''Nomad/New York''. The essay was one of the first on what would become known as pop art, though Factor did not use the term. The essay, "Four Artists", focused on Roy Lichtenstein, [[James Rosenquist]], Jim Dine, and Claes Oldenburg.&lt;ref name="Diggory"&gt;Diggory (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Oldenburg, who became associated with the pop art movement, created many ''[[happening]]s'', which were [[performance art]]-related productions of that time. The name he gave to his own productions was "Ray Gun Theater". The cast of colleagues in his performances included: artists [[Lucas Samaras]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Öyvind Fahlström]] and [[Richard Artschwager]]; dealer Annina Nosei; [[art critic]] [[Barbara Rose]]; and screenwriter [[Rudy Wurlitzer]].&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;Kristine McKenna (July 2, 1995), [http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-02/entertainment/ca-19310_1_claes-oldenburg When Bigger Is Better: Claes Oldenburg has spent the past 35 years blowing up and redefining everyday objects, all in the name of getting art off its pedestal] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; His first wife, Patty Mucha, who sewed many of his early soft sculptures, was a constant performer in his happenings. This brash, often humorous, approach to art was at great odds with the prevailing sensibility that, by its nature, art dealt with "profound" expressions or ideas. In December 1961, he rented a store on Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]] to house ''The Store'', a month-long installation he had first presented at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, stocked with sculptures roughly in the form of consumer goods.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com" /&gt;

Opening in 1962, [[Willem de Kooning]]'s New York art dealer, the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery, organized the groundbreaking ''International Exhibition of the New Realists'', a survey of new-to-the-scene American, French, Swiss, Italian ''[[New Realism]]'', and British pop art. The fifty-four artists shown included [[Richard Lindner (painter)|Richard Lindner]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], Roy Lichtenstein (and his painting [[Blam (Roy Lichtenstein)|Blam]]), Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, [[James Rosenquist]], Jim Dine, [[Robert Indiana]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], Peter Phillips, Peter Blake (''The Love Wall'' from 1961), [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Christo]] and [[Mimmo Rotella]]. The show was seen by Europeans [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Jean Tinguely]] in New York, who were stunned by the size and look of the American artwork. Also shown were [[Marisol Escobar|Marisol]], [[Mario Schifano]], [[Enrico Baj]] and [[Öyvind Fahlström]]. Janis lost some of his abstract expressionist artists when [[Mark Rothko]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Philip Guston]] quit the gallery, but gained Dine, Oldenburg, Segal and Wesselmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLgyznMrORsC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=New+Realism+at+Sidney+Janis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2CQXoBBdiS&amp;sig=HBQNsOqvkZvHEEFnWhnhTls-EH4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=07IbS67CA4TBlAeTt63vCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20Realism%20at%20Sidney%20Janis&amp;f=false |title=Andy Warhol, Poetry, and Gossip in the 1960s |author=Reva Wolf |page=83 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an opening-night soiree thrown by collector Burton Tremaine, Willem de Kooning appeared and was turned away by Tremaine, who ironically owned a number of de Kooning's works. Rosenquist recalled: "at that moment I thought, something in the art world has definitely changed".&lt;ref name="SchermanTony" /&gt; Turning away a respected abstract artist proved that, as early as 1962, the pop art movement had begun to dominate art culture in New York.

A bit earlier, on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], Roy Lichtenstein, Jim Dine and Andy Warhol from New York City; [[Phillip Hefferton]] and [[Robert Dowd (artist)|Robert Dowd]] from Detroit; [[Edward Ruscha]] and [[Joe Goode]] from Oklahoma City; and Wayne Thiebaud from California were included in the ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' show. This first pop art museum exhibition in America was curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nortonsimon.org/about/history.aspx |title=Museum History » Norton Simon Museum |website=Nortonsimon.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pop art was ready to change the art world. New York followed Pasadena in 1963, when the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] exhibited ''Six Painters and the Object'', curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]]. The artists were Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/360205683 |title=Six painters and the object. Lawrence Alloway [curator, conceived and prepared this exhibition and the catalogue] (Computer file) |website=WorldCat.org |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another pivotal early exhibition was ''The American Supermarket'' organised by the Bianchini Gallery in 1964. The show was presented as a typical small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by prominent pop artists of the time, including Apple, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Wesselmann, Oldenburg, and Johns. This project was recreated in 2002 as part of the [[Tate Gallery]]'s ''Shopping: A Century of Art and Consumer Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gayford|first=Martin|title=Still life at the check-out|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3587307/Still-life-at-the-check-out.html|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Ltd|accessdate=28 November 2012|date=2002-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1962, pop artists started exhibiting in commercial galleries in New York and Los Angeles; for some, it was their first commercial one-man show. The [[Ferus Gallery]] presented Andy Warhol in Los Angeles (and [[Ed Ruscha]] in 1963). In New York, the [[Green Gallery]] showed Rosenquist, Segal, Oldenburg, and Wesselmann. The [[Stable Gallery]] showed R. Indiana and Warhol (in his first New York show). The [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] presented Rauschenberg, Johns, and Lichtenstein. Martha Jackson showed Jim Dine and Allen Stone showed Wayne Thiebaud. By 1966, after the Green Gallery and the Ferus Gallery closed, the Leo Castelli Gallery represented Rosenquist, Warhol, Rauschenberg, Johns, Lichtenstein and Ruscha. The Sidney Janis Gallery represented Oldenburg, Segal, Dine, Wesselmann and Marisol, while Allen Stone continued to represent Thiebaud, and Martha Jackson continued representing Robert Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;''Pop Artists: Andy Warhol, Pop Art, Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Peter Max, Erró, David Hockney, Wally Hedrick, Michael Leavitt'' (May 20, 2010) Reprinted: 2010, General Books, Memphis, Tennessee, USA, {{ISBN|978-1-155-48349-8}}, {{ISBN|1-155-48349-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the ''[[São Paulo Art Biennial|São Paulo 9 Exhibition – Environment U.S.A.: 1957–1967]]'' featured the "Who's Who" of pop art. Considered as a summation of the ''classical phase'' of the American pop art period, the exhibit was curated by William Seitz. The artists were [[Edward Hopper]], [[James Gill (artist)|James Gill]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Edwards, William Emboden, David McCarthy: ''Uncommonplaces: The Art of James Francis Gill'', 2005, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
''[[Nouveau réalisme]]'' refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic [[Pierre Restany]]&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ruhrberg, Ingo F. Walther, ''Art of the 20th Century'', Taschen, 2000, p. 518. {{ISBN|3-8228-5907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the artist [[Yves Klein]] during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in Milan. Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the "Constitutive Declaration of New Realism," in April 1960, proclaiming, "Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real."&lt;ref name=Stremmel13&gt;Kerstin Stremmel, ''Realism'', Taschen, 2004, p. 13. {{ISBN|3-8228-2942-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein's workshop, by nine people: [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Pierre Restany]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Jean Tinguely]] and the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s, [[Francois Dufrêne]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Jacques de la Villeglé]]; in 1961 these were joined by [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], then [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Gérard Deschamps]]. The artist [[Christo]] showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970.&lt;ref name=Stremmel13/&gt;

Contemporary of American Pop Art—often conceived as its transposition in France—new realism was along with [[Fluxus]] and other groups one of the numerous tendencies of the avant-garde in the 1960s. The group initially chose [[Nice (France)|Nice]], on the French Riviera, as its home base since Klein and Arman both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the {{Ill|École de Nice|fr}} movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary M. O'Neill, ''Art and Visual Culture on the French Riviera, 1956–1971: The Ecole de Nice'', Ashgate, 2012, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]] of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Restany; to a "poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality".&lt;ref&gt;60/90. ''Trente ans de Nouveau Réalisme, La Différence'', 1990, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
In Spain, the study of pop art is associated with the "new figurative", which arose from the roots of the crisis of [[informalism]]. [[Eduardo Arroyo]] could be said to fit within the pop art trend, on account of his interest in the environment, his critique of our media culture which incorporates icons of both [[mass media]] communication and the history of painting, and his scorn for nearly all established artistic styles. However, the Spanish artist who could be considered most authentically part of "pop" art is Alfredo Alcaín, because of the use he makes of popular images and empty spaces in his compositions.

Also in the category of Spanish pop art is the "Chronicle Team" (''El Equipo Crónica''), which existed in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] between 1964 and 1981, formed by the artists [[Manolo Valdés]] and Rafael Solbes. Their movement can be characterized as "pop" because of its use of comics and publicity images and its simplification of images and photographic compositions. [[Film]]maker [[Pedro Almodóvar]] emerged from Madrid's "La Movida" subculture of the 1970s making low budget [[Super 8 mm film|super 8]] pop art movies, and he was subsequently called the Andy Warhol of Spain by the media at the time. In the book ''Almodovar on Almodovar'', he is quoted as saying that the 1950s film "Funny Face" was a central inspiration for his work. One pop trademark in Almodovar's films is that he always produces a fake commercial to be inserted into a scene.

==Japan==
In Japan, pop art evolved from the nation's prominent [[avant-garde]] scene. The use of images of the modern world, copied from magazines in the photomontage-style paintings produced by [[Harue Koga]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, foreshadowed elements of pop art.&lt;ref name="eskolahk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eskola|first=Jack|title=Harue Koga: David Bowie of the Early 20th Century Japanese Art Avant-garde|year=2015|publisher=Kindle, e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Yayoi Kusama]] contributed to the development of pop art and influenced many other artists, including Andy Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2175/interview-yayoi-kusama |title=Yayoi Kusama interview – Yayoi Kusama exhibition |website=Timeout.com |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.sy/artist/yayoi-kusama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101110936/http://art.sy/artist/yayoi-kusama|date=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, graphic designer [[Tadanori Yokoo]] became one of the most successful pop artists and an international symbol for Japanese pop art. He is well known for his advertisements and creating artwork for pop culture icons such as commissions from [[The Beatles]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adcglobal.org/archive/hof/2000/?id=205 |title=Tadanori Yokoo : ADC • Global Awards &amp; Club |website=Adcglobal.org |date=1936-06-27 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another leading pop artist at that time was [[Keiichi Tanaami]]. Iconic characters from Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]] have also become symbols for pop art, such as [[Speed Racer]] and [[Astro Boy]]. Japanese manga and anime also influenced later pop artists such as [[Takashi Murakami]] and his [[superflat]] movement.

==Italy==
In Italy, by 1964, pop art was known and took different forms, such as the "Scuola di Piazza del Popolo" in Rome, with pop artists such as [[Mario Schifano]], [[Franco Angeli]], [[Giosetta Fioroni]], [[Tano Festa]], [[Claudio Cintoli]], and some artworks by [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Lucio Del Pezzo]], [[Mimmo Rotella]] and [[Valerio Adami]].

Italian pop art originated in 1950s culture – the works of the artists [[Enrico Baj]] and [[Mimmo Rotella]] to be precise, rightly considered the forerunners of this scene. In fact, it was around 1958–1959 that Baj and Rotella abandoned their previous careers (which might be generically defined as belonging to a ''non-representational genre'', despite being thoroughly post-Dadaist), to catapult themselves into a new world of images, and the reflections on them, which was springing up all around them. Rotella's torn posters showed an ever more figurative taste, often explicitly and deliberately referring to the great icons of the times. Baj's compositions were steeped in contemporary ''kitsch'', which turned out to be a "gold mine" of images and the stimulus for an entire generation of artists.

The novelty came from the new visual panorama, both inside "domestic walls" and out-of-doors. Cars, road signs, television, all the "new world", everything can belong to the world of art, which itself is new. In this respect, Italian pop art takes the same ideological path as that of the international scene. The only thing that changes is the iconography and, in some cases, the presence of a more critical attitude toward it. Even in this case, the prototypes can be traced back to the works of Rotella and Baj, both far from neutral in their relationship with society. Yet this is not an exclusive element; there is a long line of artists, including [[Gianni Ruffi]], [[Roberto Barni]], [[Silvio Pasotti]], [[Umberto Bignardi]], and [[Claudio Cintoli]], who take on reality as a toy, as a great pool of imagery from which to draw material with disenchantment and frivolity, questioning the traditional linguistic role models with a renewed spirit of "let me have fun" à la [[Aldo Palazzeschi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.modena.it/galleria/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/2005/pop-art-italia-1958-1968-1 |title=Pop Art Italia 1958-1968 — Galleria Civica |website=Comune.modena.it |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
In [[Belgium]], pop art was represented by [[Paul Van Hoeydonck]], whose sculpture ''[[Fallen Astronaut]]'' was left on the moon during one of the moon missions. Internationally recognized artists such as [[Marcel Broodthaers]] ('' 'vous êtes doll? "'') and [[Panamarenko]] are indebted to the pop art movement; Broodthaers's great influence was [[George Segal]].  Another well-known artist, [[Roger Raveel]], mounted a birdcage with a real live pigeon in one of his paintings. By the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, pop art references disappeared from the work of these artists when they started to adopt a more critical attitude towards America because of the [[Vietnam War]]'s increasingly gruesome character. Panamarenko, however, has retained the irony inherent in the pop art movement up to the present day.

==Netherlands==
While there was no formal pop art movement in the [[Netherlands]], there were a group of artists that spent time in New York during the early years of pop art, and drew inspiration from the international pop art movement. Representatives of Dutch pop art include [[Daan van Golden]], [[Gustave Asselbergs]], [[Jacques Frenken]], [[Jan Cremer]], [[Wim T. Schippers]], and [[Woody van Amen]]. They opposed the Dutch [[petit bourgeois]] mentality by creating humorous works with a serious undertone. Examples of this nature include ''Sex O'Clock,'' by Woody van Amen, and ''Crucifix / Target'', by Jacques Frenken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.8weekly.nl/artikel/2701/ |title=Dutch Pop Art &amp; The Sixties - Weg met de vertrutting! |website=8weekly.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian Federation==
[[Russia]] was a little late to become part of the pop art movement, and some of the artwork that resembles pop art only surfaced around the early 1970s. Russia was a communist country at that point and bold artistic statements were closely monitored. Russia's own version of pop art was [[Soviet]]-themed and was referred to as ''[[Sots Art]]''. After 1991, the Communist Party lost its power and the Russian revolution was beginning, and with it came a freedom to express. That is when pop art in Russia took on another form, epitomised by [[Dmitri Vrubel]] with his painting titled ''[[My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love]]'' in 1990. One might argue that the Soviet posters made in the 1950s to promote the wealth of the nation were in itself a form of pop art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canofart.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607022802/http://www.canofart.com/|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It offered a functionality that allowed users to scan book and journal [[barcode]]s with a [[mobile device]] and generate citations automatically.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Click{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06bbm1g/click-05092015|title=BBC Click 5th September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was compatible with other citation management tools such as [[Mendeley]], [[Zotero]], [[RefWorks]], and [[EndNote]] and enables exporting in over 7000 citation styles.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2015/04/12/uk-edtech-company-to-simplify-academic-referencing/|title=GUK EdTech Company To Simplify Academic Referencing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the company released a Chrome plug-in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Aaron|title=Exam Revision, Dissertations and Deadlines – FIVE of the BEST apps for students|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/576634/Productivity-Apps-iPhone-Mac-App-Store-Windows-5-Students-Revision|date=May 12, 2015|publisher=Sunday Express|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow for direct clipping of web sources, which was followed in August 2015 by a similar iOS extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClellan|first1=Craig|title=RefMe Adds iOS Share Extension|url=http://www.theclassnerd.com/blog/2015/8/25/refme-adds-ios-share-extension|website=The Class Nerd|accessdate=7 February 2016|date=August 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; RefME was shut down on March 7, 2017, after being acquired by the education company [[Chegg, Inc.]].

==History==
RefME was founded 2014 by Tom Hatton,&lt;ref&gt;Startups.co.uk{{cite web|url=http://startups.co.uk/the-highs-and-lows-of-life-as-a-young-entrepreneur/|title=The Highs and Lows of Life as a Young Entrepreneur}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Forshew, and Tom Gardiner&lt;ref&gt;The Huffington Post{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/18/young-entrepreneur-week-meet-creators-referencing-tool-refme_n_6346784.html|title=Young Entrepreneur Of The Week: Meet The Creators Of The Student Referencing Tool RefME}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based in London and had over a million registered users. In April 2015, it was announced that [[GEMS Education]] had invested $5 million (£2.7) in the company’s seed investment round.&lt;ref&gt;TechCrunch{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/refme-seed/|title=Edtech Tool RefME Bags $5M To Take The Tedium Out Of Referencing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Independent{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/refme-citation-app-given-27-million-backing-from-gems-education-10173303.html |title=RefME citation app given £2.7 million backing from GEMs Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, RefMe was acquired by [[Chegg, Inc.]] and RefMe user accounts were transferred over to CiteThisForMe, Chegg's own citation service.

==Features==
RefME was a free service that required registration to use. Registration could be performed by [[email]], [[Facebook]] single sign on, or via [[Edmodo]]. It was available on Desktop ([[Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]]) via the RefME.com web platform, [[iOS]] (for [[iPhones]] and [[iPads]]), [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Google Chrome]] via the RefME WebClipper browser extension. &lt;ref&gt;The Next Web{{cite web|url= https://thenextweb.com/events/2015/09/10/10-boost-startups-from-the-uk-that-you-should-know-about/

'''S.M.S''' (Shit Must Stop) is a collection of artist's portfolios that are conceived by [[William Copley (artist)|William Copley]] and [[Dimitri Petrov]] as they speak about the long relationships with the artists. The collection has been published biweekly from February to December 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.M.S Homepage|url=http://sms.sensatejournal.com/|website=S.M.S|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each issue is composed of diverse art pieces, created by individual artist that were important at that period. The portfolios has a wide range of different aspects such as [[dada]], [[surrealism]], and [[pop art]] that includes photography, sound, drawings and writings.

This project has been inspired by the [[Fluxus|Fluxus movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boivent|first1=Marie|title=La revue d’artiste – Enjeux et spécificités d’une pratique artistique|date=2015|edition=Incertain Sens|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which encouraged diverse artists to come together as a form of a protest against galleries, not agreeing to them having the authority to determine the value of art. So by bringing artist together without any establishments, which by means, without being judged and determined, played equally in their specific art areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SMS|url=http://www.colophon.com/SMS|website=Colophon|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each portfolio within the issue, is a dossier about the subject of personal impressions, and the way to establish their relationship between artist’s impulse and impersonal meanings of practical reproduction. After merging them with the daily life, "Shit must Stop" shows the artist how to come to terms with forces that often drive them into the seclusion of the studio.

== Publication ==

=== Shit Must Stop N°1 ===

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.M.S Artist's Book|url=http://cdm.reed.edu/cdm4/artbooks/sms.php|website=Reed Digital Collection|accessdate=5 May 2016}}{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First edition of Shit Must Stop contains 11 different portfolios from important artists, ([[Irving Petlin]], [[Su Braden]], [[James Lee Byars]], [[Christo]], [[Walter De Maria|Walter de Maria]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Kaspar Koening]], [[Julien Levy]], [[Sol Mednick]], [[Nancy Reitkopf]], [[La Monte Young]] &amp; [[Marian Zazeela]]). The artists scaled their project into similar format, in this edition, into a small size packet. In this case, Christo who works with large environmental collaborations, scaled down his works in order to create a small sized two dimensinal diorama. Julian Levy also contributed a list of prescriptions for faux medications, capsules for artists he determined in need of treatment. Both of these allow for the artist's voice to shine through, while still maintaining the integrity of William Copley's project. This issue reads more like a journal than the following issue that seems more interactive.

=== Shit Must Stop N°2 ===
This Second issue is more experimental with [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Nicolas Calas]], [[Bruce Conner]], Marcia Herscovitz, [[Alain Jacquet]], [[Ray Johnson]], [[Lee Lozano]], [[Meret Oppenheim]], Bernard Pfreim, [[George Reavey|George Reavevy]], [[Clovis Trouille]].

The cover, designed by Marcel Duchamp, is a white folder with a playable record album attached to the front. Printed on the record itself is ESQUIVONS LES ECCHYMOSES DES ESQUIMAUX AUX MOTS EXQUIS, which roughly translates to “dodge the Eskimo bruises with exquisite words,” but functions as a sort of French tongue twister. Duchamp seems to be playfully addressing the restrictions inherent in more traditional portfolio design in order to redefine this practice. The record has aesthetic appeal, but it similarly has far greater use value than the first issue’s front cover, which was a reproduction of a painting. Another particularly provocative work in Shit Must Stop N°2 is Bruce Connor’s Legal Tender. Connor mimics the design of American currency with his stack of eighteen “dollar bills,” which seem more reminiscent of Monopoly money than American legal tender. This element allows for the whole issue to feel like a game, as if you could trade Connor’s money for something more valuable.

=== Shit Must Stop N°3 ===
Third publication is conceived by 12 artists ([[John Battan]], [[Aftograf]], [[Enrico Baj]], [[Billy Copley]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Roland Penrose]], [[Man Ray]], [[H C Westermann|H.C Westermann]], [[Hannah Weiner]], [[Terry Riley]].

It contains the widest variety of objects. It features two Terry Riley cassettes, four pieces of mail from H.C. Westermann seemingly addressed to the reader, and even an original Man Ray readymade. Terry Riley, who is famously known for his innovative avant-garde musical compositions, contributed two beautifully packaged cassettes, which feel like gifts in their own right. H.C. Westermann, who is known for his playful line drawings, mailed four drawings to William Copley, who reproduced them to an exact degree in this issue. In the sealed envelopes are four proposals, with Westermann’s own notes included. Opening these letters feels as though we are receiving mail from Westermann ourselves, which seems to have been Copley’s intention by including in the issue exactly what he received from Westermann.

=== Shit Must Stop N°4 ===
Artist ([[Robert C. Stanley|Robert Stanley]], [[Arman]], Paul Bergtold, [[John Cage]], [[Hollis Frampton]], [[On Kawara]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Lil Picard]], Domenico Rotella, [[Robert Watts]], Princess Winifred, [[La Monte Young]], [[Marian Zazeela]])

Each piece is laden with a conceptual mythology that can be thoroughly investigated or just taken at face value, which seems a great leap from the playful nature of the first few issues. A particularly interesting work from Shit Must Stop N°4 is Lil Picard’s burned bowtie. Each bowtie was hand burned, thus each number in the edition is slightly varied. The maroon and white polka dotted tie first appears as a joyful addition, but the burned edges seem a quite poignant dissenting argument. Other interesting works are Rotella’s prison poems, which were clandestinely written on scraps of paper during a five-month prison sentence in Rome, Italy. The tactile nature of the poems as works of art in their own right seems important for the overall impact of the piece, which elegantly replicates a minute part of Rotella’s prison experience.

=== Shit Must Stop N°5 ===
Participated artists are, Congo, [[William Anthony (artist)|William Anthony]], Wall Batterton, [[William Copley (artist)|William Copley]], [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]], [[Neil Jenney|Neil Jenny]], [[Angus MacLise]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Mel Ramos]], Robert Rohm, [[William Schwendler|William Schwedler]], [[Diane Wakoski]], [[Lawrence Weiner]]

Unlike the previous issues, this one doesn’t appear to be projecting a specific sensibility upon the reader, thus making it seem more disparate than the others. This seems to be best exemplified by Yoko Ono’s contribution, entitled Mend Piece for John, which instructs, “Take your favourite cup. Break it in many pieces with a hammer. Repair it with this glue and this poem.” Included is a cardboard box containing a ribbon, plastic bag, instructions, a poem, and a tube of glue. Although Ono created this piece years before the Beatles disbanded, it seems almost precognitive of the years to come. Another similarly disparate piece from this issue is the front cover, which was painted by Congo, the chimpanzee, for a study of the creative potential of apes. It has been noted that Congo was the only chimpanzee who appeared to make aesthetic decisions about his painting, and thus could be featured alongside these other artists for the issue. Like Ono’s piece, Congo’s painting seems eerily foreboding with its large red and black smears of paint.

=== Shit Must Stop N°6 ===
The last issue produced makes a valorous attempt at preserving the initial integrity of the project that includes, [[Richard Artschwager]], [[Ed Bereal]], [[Diter Rot]], [[Betty Dodson]], Ronoldo Ferri, [[John Giorno]], Toby Mussman, Adrian Nutbeem, [[Claes Oldenburg]], Mischa Petrov, Jean Reavey, [[Bernar Venet]].

[[Richard Artschwager]]’s cover design is a simple image of a black shape reproduced on each surface of the cover, both inside and out, with reproductions of the exact coffee stains he accidentally made when producing the original. By approving of this accident, and reproducing it for the cover, Artschwager, and [[William Copley (artist)|Copley]] seem to be making an argument about the place of beauty and mistake in the contemporary art world. The rest of the pieces in this final issue seem to be playful and mischievous manifestations of this same idea, with Adrian Nutbeem’s unsolvable crossword as well as Claes Oldenburg’s Unattended Lunches. The issue also comes with an apology, which reads, “The publishers of the Letter Edged in Black Press, Inc. regretfully announce that this is the last issue of Shit Must Stop that will appear. We have appreciated your support and hope you will remember our effort with appreciation.” The vague nature of the card supports the mischievous nature of this issue’s contents, while still maintaining the sincerity of the project.

The '''''Seven Sorrows [[Polyptych]]''''' is an [[oil painting|oil on panel]] painting by [[Albrecht Dürer]]. The painting includes a central picture (108 x 43&amp;nbsp;cm), currently at the [[Alte Pinakothek]] in [[Munich]], and seven surrounding panels (measuring some 60 x 46&amp;nbsp;cm) which are exhibited at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] of [[Dresden]].

==Description==
The work was commissioned by [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], not a long time after his meeting with Dürer at [[Nuremberg]] in April 1496. Stylistic considerations suggest that the artist started to work on the painting only from around 1500.

Modern scholars tend to attribute to  Dürer only the central panel, the others having been executed by his pupils based on his drawings. The central panel, portraying the ''Sorrowing Mother'', arrived in the Bavarian museum from the  '' Benediktbeuren'' convent of [[Munich]] in the early 19th century. It was restored in the 1930s: once the overpaintings and additions were removed, the shell-shaped niche (a motif typical of Italian art), the halo and the sword (a symbol of Mary of the Seven Sorrows) on the right were rediscovered, clarifying the subject of the work.

The other panels were at [[Wittenberg]], seat of Frederick's castle. In 1640 they were moved to the  Kunstkammer of the Prince of Saxony. In the mid-20th century they were restored: their conditions improved, but the attribution was not cleared.

[[File:Gravure door Reinier van Persijn.jpg|thumb|right|"''The singing swan''" (1655) by [[Reinier van Persijn]].]]
The '''swan song''' ([[ancient Greek]]: κύκνειον ᾆσμα; [[Latin]]: ''carmen cygni'') is a metaphorical phrase for a final gesture, effort, or performance given just before [[death]] or [[retirement]]. The phrase refers to an ancient belief that [[swan]]s (''Cygnus'' spp.) sing a beautiful song just before their death, having been silent (or alternatively, not so musical) during most of their lifetime. This belief, whose basis in actuality is long-debated, had become proverbial in [[ancient Greece]] by the 3rd century BC, and was reiterated many times in later Western poetry and art.

==Origin and description==
In [[Greek mythology]], the swan was a bird consecrated to [[Apollo]], and it was therefore considered a symbol of harmony and beauty and its limited capabilities as a singer were sublimated to those of [[songbird]]s.

[[Aesop]]'s fable of "[[The Swan and the Goose]]" incorporates the swan song legend as saving its life when it was caught by mistake instead of the goose but was recognized by its song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Fables|last=Aesop|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=1998|isbn=0-14-044649-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0140446494&amp;id=ZB-rVxPvtPEC&amp;pg=PA127 p.127]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a subsequent reference in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'' (verses 1444–5) from 458 BC. In that play, [[Clytemnestra]] compares the dead [[Cassandra]] to a swan who has "sung her last final lament". [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' (84d) records [[Socrates]] saying that, although swans sing in early life, they do not do so as beautifully as before they die. Furthermore, [[Aristotle]] noted in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' (615b) that swans "are musical, and sing chiefly at the approach of death". By the third century BC the belief had become a proverb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arnott |first=W.

[[Ovid]] mentions it in "The Story of Picus and Canens" (''[[Metamorphoses]]'', book XIV:320–396): "There, she poured out her words of grief, tearfully, in faint tones, in harmony with sadness, just as the swan sings once, in dying, its own funeral song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ovid|publisher=University of Virginia|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/latin/ovid/trans/Metamorph14.htm#_Toc487618609|title=Metamorphoses (Kline) 14, the Ovid Collection, Univ. of Virginia E-Text Center; Bk XIV:320–396: The transformation of Picus}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The swan was also described as a singer in the works of the poets [[Virgil]] and [[Martial]].&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix

==Controversy==
The most familiar European swan, the [[mute swan]] (''Cygnus olor''), although not actually mute, is known neither for musicality nor to vocalize as it dies. This has led some to criticize swan song beliefs since antiquity, one of the earliest&lt;ref name="Arnott, W. Geoffrey 2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=Birds in the Ancient World from A to Z|author=Arnott, W. Geoffrey|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=0-203-94662-6}} pp. 182–184. ([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4pN4OApWw4C&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=arnott+whooper+swan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pwU1WdFdhd&amp;sig=JIw_h0GKRwwwxsM794hJVmiyfkc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nq38UO3EMa-W0QWG0IDoDA&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=arnott%20whooper%20swan&amp;f=false Online version])&lt;/ref&gt; being [[Pliny the Elder]]: in AD 77, ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' (book 10, chapter xxxii: ''olorum morte narratur flebilis cantus, falso, ut arbitror, aliquot experimentis''), states: "observation shows that the story that the dying swan sings is false." Peterson et al. note that ''Cygnus olor'' is "not mute but lacks bugling call, merely honking, grunting, and hissing on occasion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe|author=Peterson, Roger Tory|author2=Guy Mountfort|author3=P. A. D. Hollum|author4=P. A. D. Hollom|year=2001|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Field Guides|isbn=0-618-16675-0}}, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[whooper swan]] (''Cygnus cygnus''), a winter visitor to parts of the eastern Mediterranean, does possess a 'bugling' call, and has been noted for issuing a drawn-out series of notes as its lungs collapse upon expiry, both being a consequence of an additional tracheal loop within its sternum. This was proposed by naturalist [[Peter Pallas]] as the basis for the legend. Both mute and whooper swans appear to be represented in ancient Greek and Egyptian art.&lt;ref name="Brazil, Mark 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnott, W. Geoffrey 2007"/&gt;

The whooper swan's nearest relatives, the [[trumpeter swan|trumpeter]] and [[tundra swan]]s, share its musical tracheal loop. Zoologist [[Daniel Giraud Elliot|D.G. Elliot]] reported in 1898 that a tundra swan he had shot and wounded in flight began a long glide down whilst issuing a series of "plaintive and musical" notes that "sounded at times like the soft running of the notes of an octave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=21 January 2013|url=http://www.prairiefirenewspaper.com/2013/01/the-swans-of-nebraska|title=The Swans of Nebraska|work=Prairie Fire|location=USA|date=January 2013|author=Johnsgard, Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', Portia exclaims "Let music sound while he doth make his choice; Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end, / Fading in music."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=merchantvenice#1405 ''The Merchant of Venice'', Act 3 Scene 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''[[Othello]]'', the dying Emilia exclaims, "I will play the swan, / And die in music."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=othello#3598 ''Othello'', Act 5 Scene 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known [[Orlando Gibbons]] [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]] "[[The Silver Swan (song)|The Silver Swan]]" states the legend thus:
{{cquote|
:The silver Swan, who living had no Note,
:when Death approached, unlocked her silent throat.
:Leaning her breast against the reedy shore,
:thus sang her first and last, and sang no more:
:"Farewell, all joys! O Death, come close mine eyes!
:"More Geese than Swans now live, more Fools than Wise."}}

"The Swan Song" (''"Schwanengesang"'') is the nickname of the 1733 [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[Concerto]] written by [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]: Concerto in D minor for oboe, strings and continuo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/georg-philipp-telemann-funeral-music-for-garlieb-sillem-mw0001799230|title=Georg Philipp Telemann: Funeral Music for Garlieb Sillem|author=James Manheim|work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The concerto of Telemann begins with a sad part ([[Tempo|adagio]]) later a glad part ([[Tempo|allegro]]), the singing of the swan itself, another sad part (death), and finally a hopeful end.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the English phrase "swan song" or "swan-song" borrows from the [[German language|German]] ''schwanen(ge)sang'' or ''schwanenlied''.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=June 2011 |title= swan, n.|journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |issue= |pages=  |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/195413 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scottish cleric [[John Willison]], in one of his Scripture Sermons, 1747, proposes a verse from Psalm 48 as a "swan-song" for the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.the-highway.com/Five_Sacramental_Sermons2.html |title = www.the-highway.com |accessdate =3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] made comic use of the legend when he quipped ironically:
{{cquote|Swans sing before they die— 't were no bad thing
Should certain persons die before they sing.}}

[[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s poem "[[The Dying Swan]]"&lt;ref name=tennyson&gt;[[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], "The Dying Swan," [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/8eptn10.txt The Early poems of Alfred Lord Tennyson] (Project Gutenberg text), search on "shawm." This and other sources assert not merely that the swan sings, but that the song is beautiful.&lt;/ref&gt; is a poetic evocation of the beauty of the supposed song and so full of detail as to imply that he had actually heard it:
{{cquote|
:The wild swan's death-hymn took the soul
:Of that waste place with joy
:Hidden in sorrow: at first to the ear
:The warble was low, and full and clear; ...
:But anon her awful jubilant voice,
:With a music strange and manifold,
:Flow’d forth on a carol free and bold;
:As when a mighty people rejoice
:With [[shawm]]s, and with cymbals, and harps of gold...}}

Tennyson's poem was an inspiration for the ballet ''[[The Dying Swan]]'' created for [[Anna Pavlova]] in 1905 and danced to the music of ''[[Le cygne]]'' by the French composer [[Camille Saint-Saëns]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Naughtin, ''Ballet Music: A Handbook'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1YcNBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;ots=11GLgVzmW-&amp;dq=%22the%20dying%20swan%22%20%20ballet%20inspired%20by%20Tennyson&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20dying%20swan%22%20%20ballet%20inspired%20by%20Tennyson&amp;f=false p.210]&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[Led Zeppelin]]'s record label for the second half of their career was [[Swan Song Records]]. Their first five releases were on Atlantic records, the next five were on Swan Song Records.

In the television show [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]], the twenty second episode of the fifth season is given the title Swan Song. 

Swan Song is one of the last tracks on singer [[Lana Del Rey]]'s album [[Honeymoon (Lana Del Rey album)|Honeymoon]].

The first track of Canadian band Islands' album, Return to the Sea, is entitled Swans (Life After Death). &lt;ref&gt;islandsmusic.bandcamp.com/track/swans-life-after-death-remaster&lt;/ref&gt;

==Idiom==
By extension, "swan song" has become an [[idiom]] referring to a final theatrical or dramatic appearance, or any final work or accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/swansong?q=swansong|title=swansong – definition of swansong in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an athlete that wins a championship or breaks records in their final season are sometimes said to have had a "swan song season."

'''''The Aryan''''' (1916) is an American [[silent film|silent era]] [[western (genre)|western]] [[film|motion picture]] starring [[William S. Hart]], [[Gertrude Claire]], [[Charles K. French]], [[Louise Glaum]], and [[Bessie Love]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/A/Aryan1916.html ''The Aryan'' at silentera.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[film director|Directed]] by [[William S. Hart]] and [[film producer|produced]] by [[Thomas H. Ince]], the [[screenplay]] was written by [[C. Gardner Sullivan]].

Although Hart was assisted by [[Reginald Barker]] and Clifford Smith, he mostly directed the movie by himself. Hart's salary as both actor and director was $150 per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hal|last=Erickson|website=AllMovie Guide|title=''The Aryan'' (1916)|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-aryan-v84007|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prints of the film survive in the [[Library of Congress]] and at the [[Museo del Cine]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/movies/05metropolis.html|title=Footage Restored to Fritz Lang's ''Metropolis''|last=Rohter|first=Larry|date=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Hart-william-the-aryan-1916.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from the film.]]
A hard working miner, Steve Denton (played by Hart), has become rich from years of [[prospecting]]. He takes his fortune and leaves to visit his ill mother, Mrs. Denton (played by Claire). 

In the town of Yellow Ridge, however, he is detained by a seductive dance hall girl named Trixie (played by Glaum). Also known as "the firefly," Trixie not only cheats him out of his gold, but also conceals a message that was [[telegraphy|wired]] to him by his dying mother.

Learning the next day that his mother is dead, Denton is infuriated about being cheated and betrayed by Trixie, who pretended to be good, and other false friends. In his rage, he kills Trixie's lover, Chip Emmett (played by Mayall), and kidnaps her. Dragging her by the hair of her head, he takes her into the desert. Enslaving Trixie in his desert hideaway, Denton turns his back on "[[White people|white]] civilization." He hates all white men and women and assumes the leadership of a band of [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] bandits.

Two years later, a wagon-train of [[Mississippi]] farmers who are lost and dying in the desert appeal to Denton for help. He refuses to assist them. He is secretly visited that night by Mary Jane Garth (played by Love), an innocent and virtuous young woman among the migrants who bravely confronts the Indians and Mexicans.

She pleads their cause and expresses her belief that no white man would refuse to protect a woman in distress. Deeply moved, Denton is redeemed. He guides the wagon-train out of the desert and then resumes his wanderings.

==Cast==
*[[William S. Hart]] as Steve Denton
*[[Gertrude Claire]] as Mrs. Denton
*[[Charles K. French]] as "Ivory" Wells
*[[Bessie Love]] as Mary Jane Garth
*[[Louise Glaum]] as Trixie, "the firefly"
*[[Herschel Mayall]] as Chip Emmett
*[[Ernest Swallow]] as Mexican Pete
*[[Enid Bennett]] in an undetermined role
*[[Jean Hersholt]]
*[[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] as an extra (uncredited)

==Production==
Hart was given a [[screenplay]] by the [[screenwriter]] [[C. Gardner Sullivan]] in which the hero had, according to Hart, "no motive for his hardness." He argued that the audience needed an explanation. Sullivan preferred the idea that his ruthless personality was simply a given, but eventually accepted Hart's wishes. 

Hart wanted [[Mae Marsh]] for the role as Mary Jane, but Marsh was working on a [[D. W. Griffith]] movie at the time. Griffith recommended a new actress, [[Bessie Love]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Hart|title=My Life – East and West|year=1929|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie was made at the height of Hart's career, but was unusual because he played a ruthless individual described as "hard as flint." As the title suggests, the movie draws on racial ideologies of the era. Hart stated that the central character, Steve Denton, was "a white man, who, foreswearing his race, makes outlaw Mexicans his comrades and allows white women to be attacked by them."&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald L.|last=Davis|title=William S. Hart: Projecting the American West|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2003|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart believed this movie to be "one of the best westerns ever made."&lt;ref name = "ron"/&gt;

'''Trondhjems Kunstforening''' ({{lang-en|Trondhjem Art Society}}) is an art society in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]].

It was founded in 1845 on the initiative of Lars Hansen and [[I. C. Dahl]], to promote and display art in [[Trondheim|Trondhjem]]. The first exhibition was held in [[Stiftsgården]] in 1846. In 1930 the organisation erected its own localities in ''Bispegata'', designed by [[Peter Daniel Hofflund]]. In 1996 it was behind the founding of the museum [[Trondheim Kunstmuseum]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Trondhjems Kunstforening|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=|publisher=|location=|url=http://www.snl.no/Trondhjems_Kunstforening|language=Norwegian|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urban Sketchers''' (USk) is a global community of artists that practice drawing on location in cities, towns and villages they live in or travel to. 
The Urban Sketchers movement was started on [[Flickr]] in 2007 by journalist Gabriel Campanario. In 2009 Campanario established Urban Sketchers as a nonprofit organization (501 (c) (3) tax-exempt). The Urban Sketchers Manifesto has been translated into several languages.

The USk motto is “We show the world, one drawing at a time!”

== History ==

Urban Sketchers started as a group on image sharing site, [Flickr], in 2007.&lt;ref name="Drawn to the art"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stetson|first=Nancy|title=Drawn to The Art of Urban Sketching|url=http://naples.floridaweekly.com/news/2012-07-12/Arts_%28and%29_Entertainment_News/Drawn_to_The_Art_of_Urban_Sketching.html|newspaper=Naples Florida Weekly|accessdate=March 17, 2012|date=July 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429073441/http://naples.floridaweekly.com/news/2012-07-12/Arts_(and)_Entertainment_News/Drawn_to_The_Art_of_Urban_Sketching.html|archive-date=April 29, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Urban Sketchers founder Gabriel (Gabi) Campanario is a Spanish journalist and illustrator living in Seattle.&lt;ref name="Drawn together"&gt;{{cite news|title=Drawn Together|url=http://issuu.com/urbansketchers/docs/mymidwest_usk_article|accessdate=March 17, 2013|newspaper=MyMidwest Magazine|date=November–December 2009|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a journalist for [[The Seattle Times]] where he contributes as an artist and a writer to both the printed edition as well as blogs. As more and more artists began to submit and share their drawings online, Campanario started a group to support and promote journalistic drawing depicting real life as it happens in front of the artist.

A year later in 2008 Campanario created the [http://www.urbansketchers.org Urban Sketchers blog]. Participation in the Urban Sketchers blog is by invitation and is limited to a hundred artists. The term Urban Sketchers Correspondent was created. Correspondents are invited by Campanario and commit to contribute journalistic sketches on a regular basis. The sketches are accompanied by stories providing a background for the sketch: when and where the sketch was created and some details about content – words and narrative that go with pictures. The Urban Sketchers blog gained popularity between 2008 and the present, attracting hundreds and soon thousands of visitors daily.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In December 2009, Campanario established Urban Sketchers as a nonprofit organization (501 (c) (3) tax-exempt). A board of directors was elected. The organization’s task is to raise the artistic, storytelling and educational value of location drawing, promoting its practice and connecting people around the world who draw on location where they live and travel.

== Activities ==
Urban Sketchers has a manifesto&lt;ref name="Drawn together" /&gt; which reads:
# We draw on location, indoors or out, capturing what we see from direct observation.	 
# Our drawings tell the story of our surroundings, the places we live and where we travel.	
# Our drawings are a record of time and place.	
# We are truthful to the scenes we witness.	
# We use any kind of media and cherish our individual styles.	
# We support each other and draw together. 	
# We share our drawings online.	
# We show the world, one drawing at a time.

===Sketching===
Urban Sketchers is a diverse group of people united by a passion for sketching. Discussions, for example about supplies and materials, take place when sketchers meet in real life or virtually.

Sketching in public creates opportunities for interaction. The majority of these interactions are positive and good-natured. In some instances, sketching in a café has produced a free coffee from a proprietor, and on a rare occasion sketching produced an invitation to sketch a cultural event that otherwise would be closed to an outsider. For example, a group of aspiring musicians, Flon Flon en Musette,  were performing a street concert that was documented by an Urban Sketcher who happened to be on site. The sketch then made it onto the face of the group’s compilation CD and the sketcher was invited to a private concert.

In 2011 Campanario published a book, ''The Art of Urban Sketching'', highlighting hundreds of the best Urban Sketchers members' work.&lt;ref name="Drawn to the art" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ten great places"&gt;{{cite news|title=10 great places to sketch your vacation|url=http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/10great/story/2012-04-26/10-great-places-to-sketch-your-vacation/54557700/1|accessdate=March 17, 2013|newspaper=USA Today: Travel|date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workshops ===

Artists who contribute to Urban Sketchers can host workshops for sketching enthusiasts around the world. The workshops aim to teach skills useful to the practice of urban sketching. Workshops can cover a variety of topics, such as perspective, panoramas, and people, and take place in the urban environment appropriate for the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workshops.urbansketchers.org/p/about.html|website=Urban Sketchers Workshops|publisher=Blogger.com|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communities ==

Urban Sketchers created many regional communities. Correspondents of the original Urban Sketchers blog and Flickr group organized local sketchers and number of local sketching groups were started. Other grass roots leaders started groups and brought them under Urban Sketchers umbrella.

Regional Urban Sketchers groups function similar to the main global group. All embrace the vision of the Urban Sketchers Manifesto as leading guidelines, while each group maintains its local and cultural individuality. Many groups have their own blogs where correspondents are invited based on local criteria, Facebook and Flickr groups where all are welcome.

Urban Sketchers communities are active in many countries of Europe, in North and South America and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Sketchers Regional Chapters|url=http://www.urbansketchers.org/p/chapters.html|website=Urban Sketchers|publisher=Blogger.com|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|utsushi}}

The Japanese term, {{nihongo|'''Utsushi'''|写}} can be translated as, [[appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[Imitation|emulation]], inspiration, [[:wikt:attribution|attribution]], etc. However, the word Utsushi encompasses the meanings found in all the terms mentioned. An Utsushi can be a work where an artist is inspired by a traditional motif and incorporates the design in a work of art or the artist is emulating a masterpiece of the past to surpass the original subtly.

In Japan today, the meaning found in the term Utsushi is slowly fading and being misinterpreted or wrongly associated with the term, {{nihongo|'''mozo'''|模造}} which means to copy or reproduce. Utsushi is simply not copying or reproducing a masterpiece or motif from the past. Instead, Utsushi promotes a dialogue between the artist and the masters of the past, connecting past, present, and future.

== History and Culture ==
The tradition of Utsushi has been part of the history of traditional Japanese art extending across numerous artistic fields, especially in calligraphy, painting, sculpture, architecture, lacquer, ceramics, textiles, metalwork, basketry, etc. Emulating or making an Utsushi of an existing work might be done for a variety of purposes. Appropriating the work of predecessors is one of the developmental methods in training artists across all ranges of Japanese artistic genres. Through the process of replicating the techniques and style of a noted or established master, the artist experiences firsthand the technology, material requirements, and aesthetic understanding necessary in producing an artwork of the utmost quality.

For nearly a millennium prior to the invention of printing or photographic reproduction, the process of multiple recension was the primary method of preserving literary, religious, and artistic tradition. Thus, copying was the purview not of artists in training but of seasoned veterans.

Additionally, the process of Utsushi can be seen in Japanese poetry. {{nihongo|'''Honka Dori'''|本歌取り}}, or allusive variation, is a classical poetic technique that dates back to the [[Heian Period]]. Poets construct their skills through the study of works by past masters. Once the knowledge has been absorbed so deeply that it is part of the poets' psyche, then they may quote another poet's work into their own verse without losing individuality or creativity. Also the poet expects the reader to be well versed, and to understand both quotation and originality, where “a poetic work the added weight of tradition while preventing it from being a smug expression of personal conceit.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koga |first=Kenzo|title=Utsushi: The Aesthetics of Imitation |journal=Chanoyu Quarterly |volume=67 |year=1991|page=13| asin=B004S3JOIE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chanoyu and Utsushi ==
Within the way of tea, a new perspective is cast upon Utsushi especially when objects that display an acute sensibility of the original and its reinterpretation are displayed and used in the tea room. The aesthetic quality is highly valued where it brings both the newly conceived version and the reinterpreted into a sharper perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koga |first=Kenzo|trans-title= The Aesthetic of Utsushi |title=Utsushi no Bigaku |language=Japanese |journal=Nagomi |date=September 1990 |publisher=Tankosha }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, objects favored by succeeding masters of the various schools in the way of tea have a close connection with the notion of Utsushi. Over the history of the way of tea, certain designs and objects preferred by specific masters have been emulated where individuals can enjoy and be familiar with the object in a different manner.
