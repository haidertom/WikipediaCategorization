In [[behavioral ecology]], a '''behavioral syndrome''' is a correlated suite of behavioral traits, often (but not always) measured across multiple contexts. The suite of traits that are correlated at the population or [[species]] level is considered the behavioral syndrome, while the [[phenotype]] of the behavioral syndrome an individual shows is their behavioral type.&lt;ref name=Sih2004&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sih|first= Andrew|last2= Bell|first2= Alison M.|last3= Johnson|first3= J. Chadwick|last4= Ziemba|first4= Robert E.|date= September 2004|title= Behavioral syndromes: An integrative overview|url= |journal= [[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]|volume= 79|issue= 3|pages= 241–277|doi= 10.1086/422893|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a population may show a behavioral syndrome that includes a positive correlation between [[foraging]] behavior and [[mating]] behavior. An individual may be more or less aggressive than another individual within this behavioral syndrome, and this aggressive or passive phenotype is that individual's behavioral type.

For example, the lizards ''Eulamprus heatwolei'' show a behavioral syndrome with two behavioral types. There is a correlated relationship between how [[territory (animal)|territorial]] an individual is, how likely they are to explore their environment, and what strategy they use to avoid [[predation]]. This behavioral syndrome has also been shown to influence the [[mating system]] of this species; territorial males are more likely to sire offspring with territorial females, and larger territorial males compete less with other males for mates. However, less territorial, or "floater", males and females produce consistently larger offspring than territorial parents or hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stapley|first= Jessica|last2= Keogh|first2= J. Scott|date= 2005|title= Behavioral syndromes influence mating systems: floater pairs of a lizard have heavier offspring|url= |journal= [[Behavioral Ecology (journal)|Behavioral Ecology]]|volume= 16|issue= 3|pages= 514–520|doi= 10.1093/beheco/ari019|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

''Behavioral syndrome'' is a term that originated in the [[psychology]] literature. It was originally used to describe human [[behavioral disorder]]s, including nervous and [[stereotypical behavior]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sloviter et al. 1967&lt;/ref&gt; These often included pacing, involuntary muscle twitches, and repetitive self-mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;Bigeol et al 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs et al. 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

The term became less popular in the late 1970s and 80s. Through the 90s, it was infrequently used analogously for "[[personality]]" in some behavioral ecology literature, but it was still primarily used in psychology literature to describe inter-individual differences in behavior to model systems like [[rodent]]s and [[primate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pervin &amp; John 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koolhaas1999&gt;{{cite journal |last= Koolhaas|first= J. M.|last2= Korte|first2= S. M.|last3= De Boer|first3= S. F.|last4= Van Der Vegt|first4= B. J.|last5= Van Reenen|first5= C. G.|last6= Hopster|first6= H.|last7= De Jong|first7= I. C.|last8= Ruis|first8= M. A. W.|last9= Blokhuis|first9= H. J.|date= November 1999|title= Coping styles in animals: current status in behavior and stress-physiology|url= |journal= [[Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews]]|volume= 23|issue= 7|pages= 925–935|doi= 10.1016/S0149-7634(99)00026-3|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a behavioral syndrome is a concept still used in multiple disciplines, the term was adopted by behavioral ecologists and re-defined in 2004.&lt;ref name=Sih2004 /&gt; It has become a popular field of study, both empirically and theoretically.

==Evolutionary implications==

Often, behavior is considered infinitely [[phenotypic plasticity|plastic]] and can easily be adapted to changing environmental conditions. However, the nature of behavioral syndromes implies that there can be constraints on the behavior of an individual. This can (though it is not required to) lead to the non-optimal behavior that has long been puzzling to behavioral ecologists (e.g., attacking a predator when fleeing is a better option).&lt;ref name=Sih2004 /&gt;

Given that behavioral syndromes come with perceived costs, it would be expected for [[evolution]] to have selected against them. As such, there are four primary reasons for the persistence of behavioral syndromes: (1) [[pleiotropy]], linkage disequilibrium, or other mechanistic restrictions; (2) the benefit of consistency to mitigate against errors; (3) the benefits of specialization; and (4) the benefits of predictability in social interactions.&lt;ref name=Sihbell2008&gt;{{Cite book |last= Sih|first= Andrew|last2= Bell|first2= Alison M.|date= 2008|title= Insights for Behavioral Ecology from Behavioral Syndromes|publisher= |volume= 38|issue= |pages= 227–281|doi= 10.1016/S0065-3454(08)00005-3|pmid= 24991063|pmc= 4075144|series= Advances in the Study of Behavior|isbn= 9780120045389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to emphasize that while these may mitigate the costs associated with limited behavioral plasticity, behavioral syndromes themselves do not necessarily imply they create sub-optimal behavior. See ''Misconceptions''.

==Mechanisms==

The field of behavioral syndromes often focuses on describing behavioral types. However, the phenotypic correlations that form behavioral types do not necessarily signify that they have a [[heredity|genetic basis]]. While behavioral syndromes are theoretically not required to be the byproduct of genetics, understanding if a specific syndrome is genetically based may be important, as this determines heritability. Without a genetic basis, behavioral syndromes must be the result of environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=Dochtermannroff2010&gt;{{cite journal |last= Dochtermann|first= Ned A.|last2= Roff|first2= Derek A.|date= December 2010|title= Applying a quantitative genetics framework to behavioural syndrome research|url= |journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]]|volume= 365|issue= 1560|pages= 4013–4020|doi= 10.1098/rstb.2010.0129|pmid= 21078653|accessdate=|pmc= 2992739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have shown that some behavioral syndromes have a genetic basis.&lt;ref name=Bell2008&gt;{{Cite book |last= Bell|first= Alison M.|date= 2009|title= Approaching the Genomics of Risk-Taking Behavior|publisher= |volume= 68|issue= |pages= 83–104|doi= 10.1016/S0065-2660(09)68004-4|pmid= 20109660|pmc= 3961474|series= Advances in Genetics|isbn= 9780123748966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some of these genetic correlations that shape behavioral syndromes can evolve. For example, researchers were able to separate the genetically determined traits of body size, nest size, and foraging behavior in laboratory mice.&lt;ref&gt;Bult &amp; Lynch 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest way for a behavioral syndrome to form is through a [[genetic polymorphism]], meaning two or more [[allele]]s at the same [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. In one of the best documented examples of this, a single gene (''for'') controls the foraging distance and a suit of related traits in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''. "Rover" individuals forage father distances as larvae, have an increased activity rates in adulthood and an increased likelihood of encapsulating parasitic wasp eggs. "Sitter" individuals show a relatively decreased response in all of these same categories.&lt;ref name=Osborne1997&gt;{{cite journal |last= Osborne|first= K. A.|last2= Robichon|first2= A.|last3= Burgess|first3= E.|last4= Butland|first4= S.|last5= Shaw|first5= R. A.|last6= Coulthard|first6= A.|last7= Pereira|first7= H. S.|last8= Greenspan|first8= R.

Pleiotropic interactions (where one gene may influence multiple traits) is another likely mechanism.&lt;ref name=Bellaubin2010&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bell|first= Alison M.|last2= Aubin-Horth|first2= Nadia|date= December 2010|title= What can whole genome expression data tell us about the ecology and evolution of personality?|url= |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|volume= 365|issue= 1560|pages= 4001–4012|doi= 10.1098/rstb.2010.0185|pmid= 21078652|accessdate=|pmc= 2992745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the proteins transcribed across the whole [[genome]] (the [[transcriptome]]) of [[stickleback]] fish were compared in two different tests: exposed or not exposed to predators. They found that fish exposed to predators showed up- and down-regulation of different genes, compared to those not exposed. Those exposed to predation also developed a behavioral syndrome, while those not exposed to predation did not, suggesting that this change in gene expression may be related to the development of behavioral syndromes.&lt;ref name=Sanogo2011&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sanogo|first= Y. O.|last2= Hankison|first2= S.|last3= Band|first3= M.|last4= Obregon|first4= A.|last5= Bell|first5= A. M.|date= August 2011|title= Brain Transcriptomic Response of Threespine Sticklebacks to Cues of a Predator|url= |journal= Brain, Behaviour and Evolution|volume= 77|issue= 4|pages= 270–285|doi= 10.1159/000328221|pmid= 21677424|accessdate=|pmc= 3182040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-genetic behavioral syndromes have received almost no focus in recent years, although studies of associated traits that appear to be environmentally determined are not uncommon under other names.

==Misconceptions==
Though behavioral syndromes were simply intended to be defined as a correlated suite of behavioral traits, some misconceptions are frequent in the literature. Misconceptions include the ideas that behavioral syndromes:
*must be the same from birth to death,
*must be genetically based,
*must always include more than one behavior or more than one context,
*must not be based on physical traits like size or dominance rank, such as being an "alpha" individual,
*must show multiple or discrete behavioral types (rather than a continuum), and
*cause individuals to show sub-optimal behavior.

While all of these things may be associated with behavioral syndromes and may be interesting avenues to study when they are noted, the definition of behavioral syndromes was not meant to imply any of these things to be necessary. The stability, persistence or a minimum requirement of traits are not in part of the definition. At its core, a behavioral syndrome is simply a statistical measure of correlated behavioral traits.&lt;ref name=Sihbell2008 /&gt;

Hastings (editors) (1984) ''CRC metal and ceramic biomaterials'' vol 1 {{ISBN|0-8493-6261-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioceramics are an important subset of [[biomaterials]].&lt;ref name=Shackelford&gt;J. F. Shackelford (editor)(1999) ''MSF bioceramics applications of ceramic and glass materials in medicine'' {{ISBN|0-87849-822-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Oonishi, H. Aoki, K. Sawai (editors) (1988) ''Bioceramics'' vol. 1 {{ISBN|0-912791-82-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioceramics range in biocompatibility from the ceramic [[oxides]], which are inert in the body, to the other extreme of resorbable materials, which are eventually replaced by the body after they have assisted repair. Bioceramics are used in many types of medical procedures. Bioceramics are typically used as rigid materials in [[Implant (medicine)|surgical implants]], though some bioceramics are flexible. The ceramic materials used are not the same as [[porcelain]] type ceramic materials. Rather, bioceramics are closely related to either the body's own materials or are extremely durable [[Mixed metal oxide|metal oxides]].

==History==
Prior to 1925, the materials used in implant surgery were primarily relatively pure metals. The success of these materials was surprising considering the relatively primitive surgical techniques. The 1930s marked the beginning of the era of better surgical techniques as well as the first use of alloys such as [[vitallium]].

In 1969, L. L. Hench and others discovered that various kinds of glasses and ceramics could bond to living bone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~hanifi/Bioceramics%20-%20Hench.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1991.tb07132.x|title=Bioceramics: From Concept to Clinic|year=1991|last1=Hench|first1=Larry L.|journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society|volume=74|issue=7|pages=1487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Yamamuro, L. L. Hench, J. Wilson (editors) (1990) ''CRC Handbook of bioactive ceramics'' vol II {{ISBN|0-8493-3242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hench was inspired by the idea on his way to a conference on materials. He was seated next to a colonel who had just returned from the Vietnam War. The colonel shared that after an injury the bodies of soldiers would often reject the implant. Hench was intrigued and began to investigate materials that would be biocompatible. The final product was a new material which he called [[bioglass]]. This work inspired a new field called bioceramics.&lt;ref name=Kassinger&gt;Kassinger, Ruth. ''Ceramics: From Magic Pots to Man-Made Bones''. Brookfield, CT: Twenty-First Century Books, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0761325857}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the discovery of bioglass, interest in bioceramics grew rapidly.

On April 26, 1988, the first international symposium on bioceramics was held in Kyoto, Japan.&lt;ref name="OonishiBio89"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Bioceramics.html?id=mivfMQEACAAJ |title=Bioceramics: Proceedings of 1st International Bioceramic Symposium |author1=Oonishi, H. |author2=Aoki, H. |editor=Sawai, K. |publisher=Ishiyaku Euroamerica |pages=443 |year=1989 |isbn=978-0912791821 |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramics are now commonly used in the medical fields as [[Dental implant|dental]] and [[bone]] [[Implant (medicine)|implants]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Muster (editor) (1992) ''Biomaterials hard tissue repair and replacement'' {{ISBN|0-444-88350-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jbm.a.31943|title=Bacterial adherence to SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based multifunctional bioceramics|year=2008|last1=Kinnari|first1=Teemu J.|last2=Esteban|first2=Jaime|last3=Gomez-Barrena|first3=Enrique|last4=Zamora|first4=Nieves|last5=Fernandez-Roblas|first5=Ricardo|last6=Nieto|first6=Alejandra|last7=Doadrio|first7=Juan C.|last8=López-Noriega|first8=Adolfo|last9=Ruiz-Hernández|first9=Eduardo|last10=Arcos|first10=Daniel|last11=Vallet-Regí|first11=María|journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgical [[Cermet#Bioceramics|cermets]] are used regularly. Joint replacements are commonly coated with bioceramic materials to reduce wear and inflammatory response. Other examples of medical uses for bioceramics are in [[pacemaker]]s, kidney dialysis machines, and respirators.&lt;ref name=Kassinger/&gt; The global demand on medical ceramics and ceramic components was about U.S. $9.8 billion in 2010. It was forecast to have an annual growth of 6 to 7 percent in the following years, with world market value predicted to increase to U.S. $15.3 billion by 2015 and reach U.S. $18.5 billion by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2011 | title = Market Report: World Medical Ceramics Market | publisher = Acmite Market Intelligence | url = http://www.acmite.com/market-reports/materials/world-medical-ceramics-market.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical properties and composition===
Bioceramics are meant to be used in extracorporeal circulation systems ([[dialysis]] for example) or engineered bioreactors; however, they're most common as [[Implant (medicine)|implants]].&lt;ref name=" Boch "&gt;Boch, Philippe, Niepce, Jean-Claude. (2010) Ceramic Materials: Processes, Properties and Applications. {{doi| 10.1002/9780470612415.ch12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramics show numerous applications as biomaterials due to their physico-chemical properties. They have the advantage of being inert in the human body, and their hardness and resistance to abrasion makes them useful for bones and teeth replacement. Some ceramics also have excellent resistance to friction, making them useful as replacement materials for malfunctioning [[joints]]. Properties such as appearance and electrical insulation are also a concern for specific biomedical applications.

Some bioceramics incorporate [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as their lifespan is longer than that of the patient's. The material can be used in inner [[ear ossicles]], ocular prostheses, electrical insulation for pacemakers, catheter orifices and in numerous prototypes of implantable systems such as cardiac pumps.&lt;ref name="Thamaraiselvi"&gt;Thamaraiselvi, T. V., and S. Rajeswari. “Biological evaluation of bioceramic materials-a review.” Carbon 24.31 (2004): 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aluminosilicate]]s are commonly used in dental prostheses, pure or in ceramic-polymer [[dental composite|composite]]s. The ceramic-polymer composites are a potential way to filling of cavities replacing amalgams suspected to have toxic effects. The aluminosilicates also have a glassy structure. Contrary to artificial teeth in resin, the colour of tooth ceramic remains stable&lt;ref name=" Boch " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" Hench " &gt;Hench LL. Bioceramics: From concept to clinic. J Amer CeramSoc 1991;74(7):1487–510.&lt;/ref&gt; Zirconia doped with yttrium oxide has been proposed as a substitute for alumina for osteoarticular prostheses. The main advantages are a greater failure strength, and a good resistance to fatigue.

[[Vitreous carbon]] is also used as it is light, resistant to wear, and compatible with blood. It is mostly used in cardiac valve replacement. Diamond can be used for the same application, but in coating form.&lt;ref name="Thamaraiselvi" /&gt;

[[Calcium phosphate]]-based ceramics constitute, at present, the preferred bone substitute in orthopaedic and maxillofacial surgery.&lt;ref name="Boch" /&gt; They are similar to the mineral phase of the bone in structure and/or chemical composition. The material is typically porous, which provide a good bone-implant interface due to the increase of surface area that encourages cell colonisation and revascularisation. Additionally, it has lower mechanical strength compared to bone, making highly porous implants very delicate. Since [[Young's modulus]] of ceramics is generally much higher than that of the bone tissue, the implant can cause mechanical stresses at the bone interface.&lt;ref name="Boch" /&gt; Calcium phosphates usually found in bioceramics include hydroxyapatite (HAP) Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; tricalcium phosphate β (β TCP): Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; and mixtures of HAP and β TCP.

=== Multipurpose ===
A number of implanted ceramics have not actually been designed for specific biomedical applications. However, they manage to find their way into different implantable systems because of their properties and their good biocompatibility. Among these ceramics, we can cite [[silicon carbide]], [[titanium nitrides]] and [[carbides]], and [[boron nitride]]. TiN has been suggested as the friction surface in hip prostheses. While cell culture tests show a good biocompatibility, the analysis of implants shows significant [[wear]], related to a delaminating of the TiN layer. Silicon carbide is another modern-day ceramic which seems to provide good biocompatibility and can be used in bone implants.&lt;ref name=" Boch " /&gt;

===Specific use===
In addition to being used for their traditional properties, bioactive ceramics have seen specific use for due to their biological activity. Calcium phosphates, [[oxides]], and [[hydroxides]] are common examples. Other natural materials — generally of animal origin — such as bioglass and other composites feature a combination of mineral-organic composite materials such as HAP, alumina, or titanium dioxide with the biocompatible polymers (polymethylmethacrylate): PMMA, poly(L-lactic) acid: PLLA, poly(ethylene). Composites can be differentiated as bioresorbable or non-bioresorbable, with the latter being the result of the combination of a non-bioresorbable calcium phosphate (HAP) with a non-bioresorbable [[polymer]] (PMMA, PE). These materials may become more widespread in the future, on account of the many combination possibilities and their aptitude at combining a biological activity with mechanical properties similar to those of the bone.&lt;ref name="Thamaraiselvi" /&gt;

==Biocompatibility==
Bioceramics' properties of being anticorrosive, biocompatible, and aesthetic make them quite suitable for medical usage. [[Zirconia]] ceramic has bioinertness and noncytotoxicity. Carbon is another alternative with similar mechanical properties to bone, and it also features blood compatibility, no tissue reaction, and non-toxicity to cells. None of the three bioinert ceramics exhibit bonding with the bone. However, bioactivity of bioinert ceramics can be achieved by forming composites with bioactive ceramics. Bioglass and glass ceramics are nontoxic and chemically bond to bone. Glass ceramics elicit osteoinductive properties, while calcium phosphate ceramics also exhibit non-toxicity to tissues and bioresorption. The ceramic particulate reinforcement has led to the choice of more materials for implant applications that include ceramic/ceramic, ceramic/polymer, and ceramic/metal composites. Among these composites ceramic/polymer composites have been found to release toxic elements into the surrounding tissues. [[Metals]] face corrosion related problems, and ceramic coatings on metallic implants degrade over time during lengthy applications. Ceramic/ceramic composites enjoy superiority due to similarity to bone minerals, exhibiting biocompatibility and a readiness to be shaped. The biological activity of bioceramics has to be considered under various ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' studies. Performance needs must be considered in accordance with the particular site of implantation.&lt;ref name="Thamaraiselvi" /&gt;

== Processing ==
Technically, ceramics are composed of raw materials such as powders and natural or synthetic [[chemical additives]], favoring either compaction (hot, cold or isostatic), setting (hydraulic or chemical), or accelerating [[sintering]] processes. According to the formulation and shaping process used, bioceramics can vary in density and porosity as [[cements]], ceramic depositions, or ceramic composites.&lt;ref name="Boch" /&gt;

A developing material processing technique based on the biomimetic processes aims to imitate natural and biological processes and offer the possibility of making bioceramics at ambient temperature rather than through conventional or hydrothermal processes [GRO 96]. The prospect of using these relatively low processing temperatures opens up possibilities for mineral organic combinations with improved biological properties through the addition of proteins and biologically active molecules (growth factors, antibiotics, anti-tumor agents, etc.). However, these materials have poor mechanical properties which can be improved, partially, by combining them with bonding proteins.&lt;ref name="Boch" /&gt;

== Commercial Usage ==
Common bioactive materials available commercially for clinical use include 45S5 bioactive glass, A/W bioactive glass ceramic, dense synthetic HA, and bioactive composites such as a [[polyethylene]]–HA mixture. All these materials form an interfacial bond with adjacent tissue.&lt;ref name=" Hench " /&gt;

High-purity alumina bioceramics are currently commercially available from various producers. U.K. manufacturer Morgan Advanced Ceramics (MAC) began manufacturing orthopaedic devices in 1985 and quickly became a recognised supplier of ceramic femoral heads for hip replacements. MAC Bioceramics has the longest clinical history for alumina ceramic materials, manufacturing HIP Vitox® alumina since 1985.&lt;ref name="Kokubo"&gt;Kokubo, T. Bioceramics and Their Clinical Applications, Woodhead Publishing Limited, Cambridge, England, 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-84569-204-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some calcium-deficient phosphates with an apatite structure were thus commercialised as "tricalcium phosphate" even though they did not exhibit the expected crystalline structure of tricalcium phosphate.&lt;ref name="Kokubo" /&gt;

Currently, numerous commercial products described as HA are available in various physical forms (e.g. granules, specially designed blocks for specific applications). HA/polymer composite (HA/polyethyelene, HAPEXTM) is also commercially available for ear implants, abrasives, and plasma-sprayed coating for orthopedic and dental implants.&lt;ref name="Kokubo" /&gt;

==Future trends==
Bioceramics have been proposed as a possible treatment for [[cancer]]. Two methods of treatment have been proposed: [[hyperthermia]] and [[radiotherapy]]. [[Hyperthermia treatment]] involves implanting a bioceramic material that contains a ferrite or other magnetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Łukasz|last2=Janeta|first2=Mateusz|last3=Szafert|first3=Sławomir|title=Designing of macroporous magnetic bioscaffold based on functionalized methacrylate network covered by hydroxyapatites and doped with nano-MgFe 2 O 4  for potential cancer hyperthermia therapy|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2017.04.133|journal=Materials Science and Engineering: C|volume=78|pages=901–911|doi=10.1016/j.msec.2017.04.133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is then exposed to an alternating magnetic field, which causes the implant and surrounding area to heat up. Alternatively, the bioceramic materials can be doped with β-emitting materials and implanted into the cancerous area.&lt;ref name=Shackelford/&gt;

Other trends include engineering bioceramics for specific tasks. Ongoing research involves the chemistry, composition, and micro- and nanostructures of the materials to improve their biocompatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.mt.6300084 |title=Biomaterials Approach to Expand and Direct Differentiation of Stem Cells |year=2007 |last1=Chai |first1=Chou |last2=Leong |first2=Kam W |journal=Molecular Therapy |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=467–80 |pmid=17264853 |pmc=2365728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000081089 |title=Cellular Reactions of Osteoblasts to Micron- and Submicron-Scale Porous Structures of Titanium Surfaces |year=2004 |last1=Zhu |first1=Xiaolong |last2=Chen |first2=Jun |last3=Scheideler |first3=Lutz |last4=Altebaeumer |first4=Thomas |last5=Geis-Gerstorfer |first5=Juergen |last6=Kern |first6=Dieter |journal=Cells Tissues Organs |volume=178 |pages=13–22 |pmid=15550756 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15965741 |year=2005 |last1=Hao |first1=L |last2=Lawrence |first2=J |last3=Chian |first3=KS |title=Osteoblast cell adhesion on a laser modified zirconia based bioceramic |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=719–26 |doi=10.1007/s10856-005-2608-3 |journal=Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''champagne flow''' is an [[astrophysical]] event whereby an [[HII region]] created inside a molecular cloud from [[ionization]] due to a recently formed star (usually an [[OB star|O-star]]) expands outward until it reaches the interstellar medium, at which point the ionized [[hydrogen]] [[gas]] bursts outward like an uncorked champagne bottle. This event is also sometimes called a [[Blister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franco|first1=Jose|last2=Ferrini|first2=Federico|last3=(Ed)|first3=G. TENORIO-TAGLE|title=Star Formation, Galaxies and the Interstellar Medium|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521444125|page=241|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4g9sT_xZp3gC&amp;pg=PA241|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The champagne model is perhaps one of the first [[numerical calculation]]s of the propagation of [[ionisation]] fronts and of the expansion of [[HII region]]s that 
did not assumed a constant density medium around the massive exciting [[star]]. The model assumes that 
[[star formation]] takes place in a dense cloud, surrounded and in pressure equilibrium with a low density inter-cloud gas.
The ample supply of [[UV photon]]s generated by the star rapidly establishes an HII region and the expansion of this, sooner or later 
allows also for the ionisation of the inter cloud gas. Ionisation disrupts then the former pressure balance between the 
cloud and the inter-cloud gas as under the stellar radiation field all photo-ionised gas acquires a temperature of the order of 10000 K.
In this way, the ionised cloud material acquires an excess pressure, a pressure larger than the ionised low density inter cloud gas and this 
provoques the supersonic expansion of the ionised cloud matter into the surrounding gas (the champagne flow). The streaming of matter out of the cloud allows 
for the ionisation of a larger portion of the original cloud susteining in this way the pressure imbalance which eventually leads to the complete disruption
of the parent cloud.   The terms champagne model and champagne flow were coined by [[Mexico|Mexican]] astrophysicist Guillermo Tenorio-Tagle in a paper in 1979 (Astronomy and Astrophysics 1979A&amp;A....71...59T).
The model focus on the  size, [[velocity field]] and the large density variations observed in HII regions.  This article was followed by further [[hydrodynamical]] 
calculations  in one and two dimensions, in collaboration with Drs. Peter Bodenheimer, Harold W. Yorke and Piet Bedijn see:1979ApJ...233…85B.1983A&amp;A...127..313Y,  1979A&amp;A....80..110T,  1982ASSL...93….1T,  1984A&amp;A...138..325Y,  1981A&amp;A....98…85B

A '''clown''' is a comic [[performer]] who employs [[slapstick]] or similar types of [[physical comedy]], often in a [[mime artist|mime]] style.

== History ==
[[File:1954 Episode of the TV series "Super Circus".ogg|thumb|left|Video of a 1954 episode of the ''[[Super Circus]]'' show.]]

Clowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the ''[[Circus clown#The auguste|Auguste]]'' or "red clown" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, [[exaggerated]] footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Modern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the [[circus clown]], which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or ''Varieté'' shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.

Many circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in the [[harlequinade]] that formed part of British [[pantomime]]s, notably at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and the [[Sadler's Wells]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as "Joey", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.

The [[comedy]] that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The "fear of clowns," circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term [[coulrophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin ===
The "''clown''" character developed out of the [[zanni]] "''rustic fool''" characters of the early modern [[commedia dell'arte]], which were themselves directly based on the "''rustic fool''" characters of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]].
Rustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as '' sklêro-paiktês'' (from ''paizein'' "to play (like a child)") or ''deikeliktas'', besides other generic terms for "rustic" or "peasant". In Roman theater, a term for clown was ''fossor'', literally "digger; labourer".

The English word ''[[:wikt:clown|clown]]'' was first recorded c. 1560 (as ''clowne,  cloyne'') in the generic meaning  "rustic, boor, peasant". 
The origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with ''clumsy''.&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic ''klunni'', Swedish ''kluns'' "clumsy, boorish person";  c.f. North Frisian  ''klönne'' and "kluns", also meaning "clumsy person". An alternative proposal derives ''clown'' from Latin ''colonus'' "colonist, farmer".
The verb ''to clown''  "to play the clown onstage" is from about 1600. {{cite web|title=Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=clown&amp;searchmode=none|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is in this sense that "Clown" is used as the name of [[Shakespearean fool|fool characters]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.
The sense of ''clown'' as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on [[Elizabethan theater|Elizabethan]] "rustic fool" characters such as Shakespeare's.

The [[harlequinade]] developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that "Clown" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for [[Harlequin]]'s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.

The now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.&lt;ref name=Neville6&gt;Neville, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern circus clown ===
{{main article|Circus clown}}
The [[circus clown]] developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from [[Philip Astley]]'s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.
[[Tom Belling]] senior (1843–1900) developed the "red clown" or "Auguste" (''Dummer August'') character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated "white clown". Belling worked for [[Circus Renz]] in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or "hobo" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s 1892 opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' ("Clowns").
Belling's ''Auguste'' character was further popularized by [[Nicolai Poliakoff]]'s ''Coco'' in the 1920s to 1930s.

The English word ''clown'' was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French ''clown'', Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian ''klovn'', Romanian ''clovn'' etc.

Italian retains ''Pagliaccio'', a Commedia dell'arte [[zanni]] character,&lt;ref&gt;From ''paglia'', the word for "straw" (after the straw costume of the rustic buffoon character), or from ''bajaccio'' "mocker, scoffer".&lt;/ref&gt; and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French ''Paillasse'', Spanish ''payaso'', Catalan/Galician ''pallasso'', Portuguese ''palhaço'', Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish ''palyaço'',   German ''Pajass'' (via French),&lt;ref&gt;Dialectal [https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id4.htm#!page/41099/mode/1up Bajass] in ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yiddish פּאַיאַץ  (''payats''), Russian пая́ц.

=== History in 20th-century North America ===
In the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the [[tramp]] or [[hobo]]. Examples include [[Marceline Orbes]], who performed at the [[New York Hippodrome|Hippodrome Theater]](1905), [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Tramp]]'' (1914), and [[Emmett Kelly]]'s ''Weary Willie'' based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by [[Otto Griebling]] during the 1930s to 1950s. [[Red Skelton]]'s Dodo the Clown in ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, "a funny man with a drinking problem".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the United States, [[Bozo the Clown]] was an influential ''Auguste'' character since the late 1950s. ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. [[McDonald's]] derived its mascot clown, [[Ronald McDonald]], from the ''Bozo'' character in the 1960s. [[Willard Scott]], who had played ''Bozo'' during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.

Based on the ''Bozo'' template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (''Bozo''-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to "[[Clown Care]]" or "hospital clowning" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. [[Clowns of America International]] (established 1984) and [[World Clown Association]] (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.

The shift of the ''Auguste'' or "red clown" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a ''Bozo''-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the [[evil clown]] character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.&lt;ref&gt;A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded "that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable."{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Hospital clown images 'too scary' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2011-07-05 }} {{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-01-16|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary?|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer}}.

=== Circus clown ===
{{further information|Circus clown}}

=== Pierrot and Harlequin ===
:''See [[Harlequinade]]''
The classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition
has a precedent in the pairing of [[Pierrot]] and [[Harlequin]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].
Originally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.

In the 18th-century English [[Harlequinade]], Harlequin was now paired with Clown.
As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.

=== White clown and Auguste ===
{{anchor|Auguste}}
[[File:LES ROSSYANN Weisscloun und dummer August.JPG|thumb|left|Les Rossyann. ''White clown'' and clumsy ''Auguste'' from France.]]

The ''white clown'', or ''clown blanc'' from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, Joel () [https://books.google.com/books?id=avG5rDz3ENUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 ''Popular Theatre: A Sourcebook''] p.139&lt;/ref&gt; They are also distinguished as the "sad clown" (blanc) and "happy clown" (auguste).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Danièle |last1=Berton |first2=Jean-Pierre |last2=Simard |year=2007 |title=Création théâtrale: Adaptation, schèmes, traduction |language=French}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7FLWMA8MiAC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330 p.330]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.

The auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.

The ''contra-auguste'' plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.

=== Whiteface makeup ===
{{anchor|Whiteface}}
There are two major types of clowns with "whiteface" makeup:
The classic "white clown" is derived from the [[Pierrot]] character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque ''Auguste'' types. [[Francesco Caroli]] and [[Glen Little (clown)|Glenn "Frosty" Little]] are examples of this type.  The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' type, known as "Comedy" or "Grotesque Whiteface". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. 
In the comedic partnership of [[Abbott and Costello]], Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany McCoy, [http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html Clown Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026152528/http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html |date=2015-10-26 }} (2010), citing ''Strutter's Complete Guide to Clown Makeup'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the whiteface clown uses "clown white" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118 /&gt; In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.

Whiteface makeup was originally designed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

America's first great whiteface clown was stage star [[George L. Fox (clown)|George "G.L." Fox]]. Following English [[Joseph Grimaldi]], Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/var1993000449/PP/ "G.L. Fox the original Humpty Dumpty"], Library of Congress (online), accessed 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character clown ===
The character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.

The character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.

==== North American ====
The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the ''hobo'', ''tramp'' or ''bum'' clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. According to American circus expert [[Hovey Burgess]], they are :
* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].
* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his [[luck]] and depressed about his situation.
* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.

== Clown organizations ==
=== Clowns International ===
Clowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Gallery|url=http://www.clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|accessdate=June 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907170445/http://clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|archivedate=September 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Clown Association ===
{{main article|World Clown Association}}
The World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.

=== Clowns of America International ===
{{main article|Clowns of America International}}
Clowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims "to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns".

== Clowning terminology ==

=== Other roles and skills ===
In the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as [[tightrope]], [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[MC|Master of Ceremonies]], or ride an animal. Clowns may also "sit in" with the [[orchestra]]. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.

=== Frameworks ===
'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act.&lt;ref name="simplycircus.com"&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=March 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202950/http://simplycircus.com/circus_dictionary/clowning_framework|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/Circus_Dictionary/Clowning_Framework|website=simplycircus.com|title=Clowning Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.

'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.

=== Gags, bits and business ===
* '''Business''' — the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character.
* '''Gag''' — very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a "bit" or "routine," may become a ''running gag''. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end — or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.
* '''Bit''' — the clown's sketch or routine, made up of one or more "gags" either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material.

=== Menu ===
* '''Entrée''' — clowning acts lasting 5–10 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entrées almost always end with a "blow-off" — the comedic ending of a show segment, "bit," "gag," "stunt," or "routine."
* '''Side dish''' — shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the "entrée," typically lasting 1–3 minutes. Typically made up of various "gags" and "bits," side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a "blow-off."

=== Interludes ===
"Clown Stops" or "interludes" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few ''gags'' or several ''bits''. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called "reprises" or "run-ins" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of "business" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a [[tightrope walker]] the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the ''artiste'' by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.

=== Prop stunts ===
Among the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the "[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]" stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or "[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.

In anthropology, the term "clown" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such "clowns" have an important position are termed "[[clown society|clown societies]]", and a "clown" character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a "[[ritual clown]]".

The most ancient "clowns"  have been found in the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt]], around 2400 BC.&lt;ref name="Bala2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bala |first=Michael |date=Winter 2010 |jstor=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |title=The Clown: An Archetypal Self-Journey |journal=[[Jung Journal: Culture &amp; Psyche]] |volume=4 |issue=1 | pages=50–71 |quote=The one who swallows the largest amount of filth with the greatest gusto is most commended by the fraternity and onlookers. |doi=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In Native American mythology, the [[Trickster]] channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character.  A [[Heyoka]] is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles.  The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse.  The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a [[Winkte]].

Many native tribes have a history of clowning.
The [[Canadian Clowning]] method developed by [[Richard Pochinko]] and furthered by his former apprentice, [[Sue Morrison]], combines European and Native American clowning techniques.

In this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the [[medicine wheel]]. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.

'''Cursive''' (also known as '''script''' or '''longhand''', among other names{{efn|Also known as '''handwriting''', '''looped writing''', '''joint writing''', '''joined-up writing''', or '''running writing'''}}) is any style of [[penmanship]] in which some characters are written joined together in a flowing manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. Formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. The writing style can be further divided as "looped", "[[Italic script|italic]]" or "connected".

The cursive method is used with a number of alphabets due to its improved writing speed and infrequent pen lifting. In some alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke.

== Descriptions ==
Cursive is a style of penmanship in which the symbols of the language are written in a [[wikt:conjoin|conjoin]]ed and/or ''flowing'' manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. This writing style is distinct from "printscript" using [[block letters]], in which the letters of a word are unconnected and in Roman/Gothic letterform rather than joined-up script. Not all cursive [[copybook (education)|copybook]]s join all letters: formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. In the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Latin script|Latin]], and [[Cyrillic (script)|Cyrillic]] alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke. In [[cursive Hebrew|Hebrew cursive]] and [[Roman cursive]], the letters are not connected. In Maharashtra there is a version of Cursive called [[Modi alphabet|'Modi']]

=== Subclasses ===

==== Ligature ====
Ligature is writing the letters of words with lines connecting the letters so that one does not have to pick up the pen or pencil between letters.  Commonly some of the letters are written in a looped manner to facilitate the connections. In common printed Greek texts, the modern small letter fonts are called "cursive" (as opposed to uncial) though the letters do not connect.

==== Looped ====
[[file:Looped cursive sample.jpg|thumb|alt=The first verse of "Good King Wenceslas" in cursive|Looped cursive as taught in Britain in mid-20th century]]
In ''looped cursive'' penmanship, some [[ascender (typography)|ascender]]s and [[descender]]s have loops which provide for joins.  This is generally what people refer to when they say "cursive".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Italic ====
''[[italic script|Cursive italic]]'' penmanship—derived from [[chancery cursive]]—uses non-looped joins or no joins. In italic cursive, there are no joins from g, j, q or y, and a few other joins are discouraged.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518 |title=How Handwriting Boosts the Brain |first=Gwendolyn |last=Bounds |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 5, 2010 |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company|Dow Jones]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0099-9660 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} Italic penmanship became popular in the 15th-century Italian Renaissance. The term "italic" as it relates to handwriting is not to be confused with [[italic type]]d letters that slant forward. Many, but not all, letters in the handwriting of the Renaissance were joined, as most are today in cursive italic.

== Origin ==
The origins of the cursive method are associated with practical advantages of writing speed and infrequent pen-lifting to accommodate the limitations of the [[quill]]. Quills are fragile, easily broken, and will spatter unless used properly. Steel [[dip pen]]s followed quills; they were sturdier, but still had some limitations. The individuality of the provenance of a document (see [[Signature]]) was a factor also, as opposed to machine [[font]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Jean (1997). ''Writing: The Story of Alphabets and Scripts'', London: Thames and Hudson Ltd. ['[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series]&lt;/ref&gt;
Cursive was also favored because the writing tool was rarely taken off the paper.
The term ''cursive'' derives from the 18th century [[Italian language|Italian]] ''corsivo'' from [[Medieval Latin]] ''cursivus'', which literally means ''running''. This term in turn derives from [[Latin]] ''currere'' ("to run, hasten").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=cursive|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cursive|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(also known in Bengali as "professional writing"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}) the letters are more likely to be more curvy in appearance than in standard Bengali handwriting. Also, the horizontal supporting bar on each letter ([[Bengali alphabet#The matra|''matra'']]) runs continuously through the entire word, unlike in standard handwriting. This cursive handwriting often used by literature experts differs in appearance from the [[Bengali script|standard Bengali alphabet]] as it is free hand writing, where sometimes the alphabets are complex and appear different from the standard handwriting.

{{Main|Roman cursive}}
[[File:Hocgracili.jpg|thumb|right|Example of old Roman cursive]]
''Roman cursive'' is a form of handwriting (or a [[script (styles of handwriting)|script]]) used in [[ancient Rome]] and to some extent into the [[Middle Ages]]. It is customarily divided into old (or ancient) cursive, and new cursive. Old Roman cursive, also called [[majuscule]] cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the [[Latin alphabet]], and even by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] issuing commands. New Roman, also called [[minuscule cursive]] or later cursive, developed from old cursive. It was used from approximately the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letter forms that are more recognizable to modern eyes; "a", "b", "d", and "e" have taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters are proportionate to each other rather than varying wildly in size and placement on a line.

{{Main|History of the Greek alphabet}}
[[File:Greek manuscript cursive 6th century.png|thumb|right|Ancient Greek cursive script, 6th century A.D.]]

The [[Greek alphabet]] has had several cursive forms in the course of its development. In antiquity, a cursive form of handwriting was used in writing on [[papyrus]]. It employed slanted and partly connected letter forms as well as many [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s. Some features of this handwriting were later adopted into Greek minuscule, the dominant form of handwriting in the medieval and early modern era. In the 19th and 20th centuries, an entirely new form of cursive Greek, more similar to contemporary Western European cursive scripts, was developed.

== Western Europe ==
During the Middle Ages, the flowing, connected cursive script of the Arabic language inspired Western Christian scholars to develop similar cursive scripts for Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Eastern Mysteries: An Encyclopedic Guide to the Sacred Languages &amp; Magickal Systems of the World (Key of It All) |author=Hulse, David Allen | publisher=Llewellyn Publications | year=2002 | isbn=978-1567184280 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWHjIxkvXYEC | page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scripts then became the basis for all of the Latin-based cursive scripts used in Europe.

=== English ===
[[File:letter.posted.in.1894.arp.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cursive in English letter from 1894]]
[[File:Shakespeare-Testament.jpg|thumb|[[William Shakespeare]]'s will, written in ''secretary hand''&lt;ref&gt;''Cardenio, Or, the Second Maiden's Tragedy'', pp. 131-3: By William Shakespeare, [[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]], John Fletcher (Glenbridge Publishing Ltd., 1994) {{ISBN|0-944435-24-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cursive writing was used in English before the [[Norman conquest]]. [[Anglo-Saxon Charters]] typically include a boundary clause written in [[Old English]] in a cursive script. A cursive handwriting style—[[secretary hand]]—was widely used for both personal correspondence and official documents in England from early in the 16th century.

Cursive handwriting developed into something approximating its current form from the 17th century, but its use was neither uniform, nor standardized either in England itself or elsewhere in the [[British Empire]]. In the English colonies of the early 17th century, most of the letters are clearly separated in the handwriting of [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]], though a few were joined as in a cursive hand. In England itself, Edward Cocker had begun to introduce a version of the French ''[[Ronde script (calligraphy)|ronde]]''&lt;!-- sic --&gt; style, which was then further developed and popularized throughout the [[British Empire]] in the 17th and 18th centuries as [[round hand]] by John Ayers and William Banson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whalley|first=Joyce Irene|title=The Art of Calligraphy, Western Europe &amp; America|year=1980|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=0-906223-64-4|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the American colonies, on the eve of their independence from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], it is notable that [[Thomas Jefferson]] joined most, but not all the letters when drafting the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. However, a few days later, [[Timothy Matlack]] professionally re-wrote the presentation copy of the Declaration in a fully joined, cursive hand. Eighty-seven years later, in the middle of the 19th century, [[Abraham Lincoln]] drafted the [[Gettysburg Address]] in a cursive hand that would not look out of place today.

Note that not all such cursive, then or now, joined all of the letters within a word.

[[File:HandwritingOfOneJohnJay(NotTheFamousOne).jpg|thumb|right|Cursive handwriting from the 19th-century USA.]]
In both the British Empire and the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, before the typewriter, professionals used cursive for their correspondence. This was called a "fair hand", meaning it looked good, and firms trained their clerks to write in exactly the same script.

In the early days{{when|date=June 2017}} of the [[post office]], letters were written in cursive&amp;nbsp;– and to fit more text on a single sheet, the text was continued in lines [[Crossed letter|crossing at 90 degrees from the original text]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Arrow of Chaos: Romanticism and Postmodernity|last = Livingston|first = Ira|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 1997|isbn = 0816627959|location = |pages = 143|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ySwihw-VVP4C&amp;pg=PT143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter = The Romantic Double-Cross: Keats's Letters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block letters were not suitable for this.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Although women's handwriting had noticeably different particulars from men's, the general forms were not prone to rapid change. In the mid-19th century, most children were taught the contemporary cursive; in the United States, this usually occurred in second or third grade (around ages seven to nine). Few simplifications appeared as the middle of the 20th century approached.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

After the 1960s, a movement originally begun by [[Paul Standard]] in the 1930s to replace looped cursive with cursive italic penmanship resurfaced. It was motivated by the claim that cursive instruction was more difficult than it needed to be: that conventional (looped) cursive was unnecessary, and it was easier to write in cursive italic. Because of this, a number of various new forms of cursive italic appeared, including [[Getty-Dubay]], and [[Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting]]. In the 21st century, some of the surviving cursive writing styles are [[Spencerian script|Spencerian]], [[Palmer Method]], [[D'Nealian]], and Zaner-Bloser script.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/from-punishing-to-pleasurable-how-cursive-writing-is-looping-back-into-our-hearts/2018/08/31/aa180b9c-aa06-11e8-a8d7-0f63ab8b1370_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.88491996752d] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest forms of new technology that caused the decline of handwriting was the invention of the [[ballpoint pen]], patented in 1888 by John Loud. Two brothers, László and György Bíró, further developed the pen by changing the design and using different ink that dried quickly. With their design, it was guaranteed that the ink would not smudge, as it would with the earlier design of pen, and it no longer required the careful penmanship one would use with the older design of pen. After World War II, the ballpoint pen was mass-produced and sold for a cheap price, changing the way people wrote. Over time the emphasis of using the style of cursive to write slowly declined{{quantify|date=August 2017}}, only to be later impacted by other technologies such as the phone, computer, and keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How The Ballpoint Pen Killed Cursive|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/08/ballpoint-pens-object-lesson-history-handwriting/402205/|website = The Atlantic|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Decline of Handwriting|last = Enstrom|first = E.A.|date = 1965|journal = The Elementary School Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cursive has been in decline throughout the 21st century due to its perceived lack of necessity. The Fairfax Education Association, the largest teachers' union in Fairfax County, Virginia, has called cursive a "dying art". Many consider cursive too tedious to learn and believe that it is not a useful skill.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Cursive handwriting is disappearing from public schools|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/cursive-handwriting-disappearing-from-public-schools/2013/04/04/215862e0-7d23-11e2-a044-676856536b40_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date = 2013-04-04|access-date = 2015-10-30|issn = 0190-8286|first = T.

On the 2006 [[SAT]], a United States post-secondary education entrance exam, only 15 percent of the students wrote their essay answers in cursive.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Handwriting Is on the Wall |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=11 October 2006 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/10/AR2006101001475_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, students might be discouraged from using cursive on standardized tests due to exams written in hard to read handwriting receive less marks, and some graders may have difficulties reading cursive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/22/exam-markers-complain-about-students-blue-ink-scribbles|title=Poor handwriting 'may hinder students' chances of exam success'|first=Richard|last=Adams|date=21 August 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 survey of 200 teachers of first through third grades in all 50 American states, 90 percent of respondents said their schools required the teaching of cursive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schools debate: Is cursive writing worth teaching? |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |date=23 January 2009 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-01-23-cursive-handwriting_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 nationwide survey found elementary school teachers lacking formal training in teaching handwriting to students. Only 12 percent of teachers reported having taken a course in how to teach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Steve|author2=Harris, Karen R. |author3=Mason, Linda |author4=Fink-Chorzempa, Barbara |author5=Moran, Susan |author6=Saddler, Bruce |title=How do primary grade teachers teach handwriting?

In 2012, the American states of [[Indiana]] and [[Hawaii]] announced that their schools will no longer be required to teach cursive (but will still be permitted to), and instead will be required to teach "keyboard proficiency". Since the nationwide proposal of the [[Common Core State Standards]] in 2009, which do not include instruction in cursive, the standards have been adopted by 44 states as of July 2011, all of which have debated whether to augment them with cursive.&lt;ref name="TIME Newsfeed"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/07/06/typing-beats-scribbling-indiana-schools-can-stop-teaching-cursive/?iid=nfmostpopular |title=Typing Beats Scribbling: Indiana Schools Can Stop Teaching Cursive |first=Kayla  |last=Webley |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=6 July 2011|accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/01/hawaii-no-longer-requires_n_915402.html "Hawaii No Longer Requires Teaching Cursive In Schools"].

==== Conservation efforts and cognitive benefits ====
Many historical documents, such as the United States Constitution, are written in cursive—the inability to read cursive therefore precludes one from being able to fully appreciate such documents in their original format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Five Reasons Kids Should Still Learn Cursive Writing|url = http://time.com/2820780/five-reasons-kids-should-still-learn-cursive-writing/|website = TIME.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|first = Katy|last = Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the decline in the day-to-day use of cursive, it is being reintroduced to the curriculum of schools in the United States. States such as California, Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Jersey, and Tennessee have already mandated cursive in schools as a part of the Back to Basics program designed to maintain the integrity of cursive handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is cursive handwriting slowly dying out in America?|url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/long-held-tradition-cursive-handwriting-slowly-dying-america/|website = PBS NewsHour|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cursive instruction is required by grade 5 in Illinois, starting with the 2018-2019 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An act concerning education|url = http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=100-0548|website = ILGA.gov|accessdate = 2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some{{who|date=December 2015}} argue that cursive is not worth teaching in schools and "in the 1960s cursive was implemented because of preference and not an educational basis; Hawaii and Indiana have replaced cursive instruction with 'keyboard proficiency' and 44 other states are currently weighing similar measures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is Cursive Handwriting Going Extinct?|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/is-cursive-handwriting-going-extinct-734564/|website = Smithsonian|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{attribution needed|date=December 2015}}

With the widespread use of computers, researchers set out to test the effectiveness of both mediums. In a study done by Pam Mueller which compared scores of students who took notes by hand and via laptop computer showed that students who took notes by hand showed advantages in both factual and conceptual learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand Over Laptop Note Taking|last = Mueller|first = Pam|date = 2014|journal = Psychological Science|doi = 10.1177/0956797614524581|pmid = 24760141|access-date =|volume=25|pages=1159–1168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study done by Anne Mangen showed that children showed an acceleration in learning new words when they wrote them by hand rather than on a computer screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Handwriting versus Keyboard Writing: Effect on Word Recall|last = Mangen|first = Anne|date = 2015|journal = Journal of Writing Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning to write in cursive is alleged (by its practitioners) to be a stepping stone to developing neat handwriting, and, in a third study conducted by Florida International University, professor Laura Dinehart concluded that students with neater handwriting tend to develop better reading and writing skills, though it is difficult to conclude causation from such an association.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"/&gt; Aside from these cognitive benefits, students with dyslexia, who have difficulty learning to read because their brains have difficulty associating sounds and letter combinations efficiently, have found that cursive can help them with the decoding process because it integrates hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills and other brain and memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How cursive can help students with dyslexia connect the dots|url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/connecting-dots-role-cursive-dyslexia-therapy/|website = PBS NewsHour|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== German ===
Up to the 19th century, [[Kurrent]] (also known as ''German cursive'') was used in German language longhand. Kurrent was not used exclusively, but in parallel to modern cursive (which is the same as English cursive). Writers used both cursive styles: location, contents and context of the text determined which style to use. A successor of Kurrent, [[Sütterlin]], was widely used in the period 1911-1941 until the Nazi Party banned it, and German speakers brought up with Sütterlin continued to use it well into the post-war period.

Today, three different styles of cursive writing are taught in German schools, the {{ill|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|de|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (introduced in 1953), the {{ill|Schulausgangsschrift|de|Schulausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (1968), and the {{ill|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|de|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grundschrift-schreibschrift.de|title=Grundschrift-Schreibschrift|work=grundschrift-schreibschrift.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German National Primary Schoolteachers' Union has proposed replacing all three with [[Grundschrift]], a simplified form of non-cursive handwriting adopted by [[Hamburg]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/29/germany-teachers-handwriting-schools-schreibschrift|title=German teachers campaign to simplify handwriting in schools|author=Helen Pidd|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian ==
[[File:Russian Cursive Cyrillic.svg|thumb|right|The standard modern Russian Cyrillic cursive alphabet with uppercase and lowercase letters, used in school education.]]
{{main|Russian cursive}}
The ''Russian Cursive [[Cyrillic]]'' alphabet is used (instead of [[Russian alphabet|the block letters]]) when handwriting the modern [[Russian language]]. While several letters resemble Latin counterparts, many of them represent different sounds. Most handwritten Russian, especially personal letters and schoolwork, uses the cursive Russian (Cyrillic) alphabet. Most children in Russian schools are taught in the 1st grade how to write using this Russian script.

== Chinese ==
Cursive forms of [[Chinese written language|Chinese characters]] are used in calligraphy; "running script" is the [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] form and [[Cursive script (East Asia)|"rough script"]] (mistakenly called "grass script" due to misinterpretation) is the cursive. The running aspect of this script has more to do with the formation and connectedness of strokes ''within'' an individual character than with connections between characters as in Western connected cursive. The latter are rare in [[hanzi]] and in the derived Japanese [[kanji]] characters which are usually well separated by the writer.

The '''''Illustrated Bible Dictionary''''',{{efn|Full title: ''Illustrated Bible Dictionary and Treasury of Biblical History, Biography, Geography, Doctrine, and Literature with Numerous Illustrations and Important Chronological Tables and Maps''.{{sfnp|Easton|1893}}}} better known as '''''Easton's Bible Dictionary''''', is a reference work on topics related to the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]] compiled by [[Matthew George Easton]]. The first edition was published in 1893,{{sfnp|Easton|1893}} and a revised edition was published the following year.{{sfnp|Easton|1894}} The most popular edition, however, was the third,  published by [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] in 1897, three years after Easton's death.{{sfnp|Easton|1897}} The last contains nearly 4,000 entries relating to the [[Bible]]. Many of the entries in ''Easton's'' are [[encyclopedia#Characteristics|encyclopedic]] in nature, although there are also short dictionary-type entries.

Because of its age, it is now a [[public domain resource]].

==Basic models: linear regression==
A basic tool for econometrics is the [[multiple linear regression]] model.&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – multiple linear regression model" /&gt; In modern econometrics, other statistical tools are frequently used, but linear regression is still the most frequently used starting point for an analysis.&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – multiple linear regression model"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greene, William|title=Econometric Analysis|date=2012|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780273753568|pages=47–48|edition=7th|chapter=Chapter 1: Econometrics | quote = Ultimately, all of these will require a common set of tools, including, for example, the multiple regression model, the use of moment conditions for estimation, instrumental variables (IV) and maximum likelihood estimation. With that in mind, the organization of this book is as follows: The first half of the text develops fundamental results that are common to all the applications. The concept of multiple regression and the linear regression model in particular constitutes the underlying platform of most modeling, even if the linear model itself is not ultimately used as the empirical specification.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimating a linear regression on two variables can be visualised as fitting a line through data points representing paired values of the independent and dependent variables.

[[File:Okuns law differences 1948 to mid 2011.png|thumb|right|Okun's law representing the relationship between GDP growth and the unemployment rate. The fitted line is found using regression analysis.]]

For example, consider [[Okun's law]], which relates GDP growth to the unemployment rate. This relationship is represented in a linear regression where the change in unemployment rate (&lt;math&gt;\Delta\ \text{Unemployment}&lt;/math&gt;) is a function of an intercept (&lt;math&gt; \beta_0 &lt;/math&gt;), a given value of GDP growth multiplied by a slope coefficient &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; and an error term, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\ \text {Unemployment} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Growth} + \varepsilon. &lt;/math&gt;

The unknown parameters &lt;math&gt; \beta_0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; can be estimated.  Here &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; is estimated to be −1.77 and &lt;math&gt; \beta_0 &lt;/math&gt; is estimated to be 0.83. This means that if GDP growth increased by one percentage point, the unemployment rate would be predicted to drop by 1.77 points.  The model could then be tested for [[statistical significance]] as to whether an increase in growth is associated with a decrease in the unemployment, as [[hypothesis test|hypothesized]]. If the estimate of &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; were not significantly different from 0, the test would fail to find evidence that changes in the growth rate and unemployment rate were related. The variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (unemployment) as a function of the independent variable (GDP growth) is given in [[polynomial least squares]].

==Theory==
{{see also|Estimation theory}}
Econometric theory uses [[statistical theory]] and [[mathematical statistics]] to evaluate and develop econometric methods.&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – mathematical statistics and statistical theory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wooldridge Econometrics – mathematical statistics" /&gt; Econometricians try to find [[estimator]]s that have desirable statistical properties including [[Bias of an estimator|unbiasedness]], [[Efficiency (statistics)|efficiency]], and [[Consistent estimator|consistency]]. An estimator is unbiased if its expected value is the true value of the parameter; it is consistent if it converges to the true value as the sample size gets larger, and it is efficient if the estimator has lower standard error than other unbiased estimators for a given sample size. [[Ordinary least squares]] (OLS) is often used for estimation since it provides the BLUE or "best linear unbiased estimator" (where "best" means most efficient, unbiased estimator) given the [[Gauss-Markov (disambiguation)|Gauss-Markov]] assumptions. When these assumptions are violated or other statistical properties are desired, other estimation techniques such as [[maximum likelihood estimation]], [[generalized method of moments]], or [[generalized least squares]] are used. [[Bayes estimator|Estimators that incorporate prior beliefs]] are advocated by those who favour [[Bayesian statistics]] over traditional, classical or [[Frequentist probability|"frequentist" approaches]].

==Methods==
{{Main|Methodology of econometrics}}

''Applied econometrics'' uses theoretical econometrics and real-world [[economic data|data]] for assessing economic theories, developing [[econometric model]]s, analysing [[economic history]], and [[economic forecast|forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clive Granger]] (2008). "forecasting,"
''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_F000161&amp;edition=current&amp;q=forecast&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=7 Abstract.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518001935/http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_F000161&amp;edition=current&amp;q=forecast&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=7 |date=18 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Econometrics may use standard [[statistical model]]s to study economic questions, but most often they are with [[observational study|observational]] data, rather than in [[experiment|controlled experiments]].&lt;ref name=Introductory_econometrics&gt;{{cite book |last=Wooldridge |first=Jeffrey |date=2013 |title=Introductory Econometrics, A modern approach |url= |location= |publisher=South-Western, Cengage learning |page= |isbn=978-1-111-53104-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the design of observational studies in econometrics is similar to the design of studies in other observational disciplines, such as astronomy, epidemiology, sociology and political science. Analysis of data from an observational study is guided by the study protocol, although [[exploratory data analysis]] may be useful for generating new hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Wold|Herman O. Wold]] (1969). "Econometrics as Pioneering in Nonexperimental Model Building," ''Econometrica'', 37(3), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1912787 369]-381.&lt;/ref&gt; Economics often analyses systems of equations and inequalities, such as [[supply and demand]] hypothesized to be in [[equilibrium (economics)|equilibrium]]. Consequently, the field of econometrics has developed methods for [[parameter identification problem|identification]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]] of [[simultaneous equation methods (econometrics)|simultaneous-equation models]]. These methods are analogous to methods used in other areas of science, such as the field of [[system identification]] in [[systems analysis]] and [[control theory]].  Such methods may allow researchers to estimate models and investigate their empirical consequences, without directly manipulating the system.

One of the fundamental statistical methods used by econometricians is [[regression analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of a linear implementation of this framework, see [[linear regression]].&lt;/ref&gt; Regression methods are important in econometrics because economists typically cannot use [[Contrived experiment|controlled experiments]]. Econometricians often seek illuminating [[natural experiment]]s in the absence of evidence from controlled experiments. Observational data may be subject to [[omitted-variable bias]] and a list of other problems that must be addressed using causal analysis of simultaneous-equation models.&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Leamer (2008). "specification problems in econometrics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000200&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Specification%20problems%20in%20econometrics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231333/http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000200&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Specification%20problems%20in%20econometrics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 |date=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to natural experiments, [[Quasi-experiment|quasi-experimental methods]] have been used increasingly commonly by econometricians since the 1980s, in order to credibly identify causal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Angrist |first1=Joshua D |last2=Pischke |first2=Jörn-Steffen |title=The Credibility Revolution in Empirical Economics: How Better Research Design is Taking the Con out of Econometrics |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |date=May 2010 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=3–30 |doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.3 |url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.24.2.3 |issn=0895-3309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
A simple example of a relationship in econometrics from the field of [[labour economics]] is:

:&lt;math&gt; \ln(\text{wage}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{years of education}) + \varepsilon. &lt;/math&gt;

This example assumes that the [[natural logarithm]] of a person's wage is a linear function of the number of years of education that person has acquired. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; measures the increase in the natural log of the wage attributable to one more year of education. The term &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable representing all other factors that may have direct influence on wage. The econometric goal is to estimate the parameters, &lt;math&gt;\beta_0 \mbox{ and } \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; under specific assumptions about the random variable &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated with years of education, then the equation can be estimated with [[linear regression|ordinary least squares]].

If the researcher could randomly assign people to different levels of education, the data set thus generated would allow estimation of the effect of changes in years of education on wages. In reality, those experiments cannot be conducted. Instead, the econometrician observes the years of education of and the wages paid to people who differ along many dimensions. Given this kind of data, the estimated coefficient on Years of Education in the equation above reflects both the effect of education on wages and the effect of other variables on wages, if those other variables were correlated with education. For example, people born in certain places may have higher wages and higher levels of education. Unless the econometrician controls for place of birth in the above equation, the effect of birthplace on wages may be falsely attributed to the effect of education on wages.

The most obvious way to control for birthplace is to include a measure of the effect of birthplace in the equation above. Exclusion of birthplace, together with the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated with education produces a misspecified model. Another technique is to include in the equation additional set of measured covariates which are not instrumental variables, yet render &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; identifiable.&lt;ref name=pearl00&gt;{{cite book |first=Judea |last=Pearl |year=2000 |title=Causality: Model, Reasoning, and Inference |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0521773628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An overview of econometric methods used to study this problem were provided by [[David Card|Card]] (1999).&lt;ref name=Card:00&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Card |year=1999 |chapter=The Causal Effect of Education on Earning |editor-last=Ashenfelter |editor-first=O. |editor2-last=Card |editor2-first=D. |title=Handbook of Labor Economics |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |pages=1801–1863 |isbn=0444822895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations and criticisms==
{{see also|Criticisms of econometrics}}

Like other forms of statistical analysis, badly specified econometric models may show a [[spurious relationship]] where two variables are correlated but causally unrelated. In a study of the use of econometrics in major economics journals, [[Deidre McCloskey|McCloskey]] concluded that some economists report [[p-value]]s (following the [[Ronald A. Fisher|Fisherian]] tradition of [[tests of significance]] of point [[null hypothesis|null-hypotheses]]) and neglect concerns of [[type II error]]s; some economists fail to report estimates of the size of effects (apart from [[statistical significance]]) and to discuss their economic importance. She also argues that some economists also fail to use economic reasoning for [[model selection]], especially for deciding which variables to include in a regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Loss Function has been mislaid: the Rhetoric of Significance Tests|last=McCloskey|journal=American Economic Review|date=May 1985|volume=75|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Ziliak|Stephen T. Ziliak]] and [[Deirdre McCloskey|Deirdre N. McCloskey]] (2004). "Size Matters: The Standard Error of Regressions in the ''American Economic Review''," ''Journal of Socio-economics'', 33(5), pp. [http://faculty.roosevelt.edu/Ziliak/doc/Size%20Matters%20Journal%20of%20Socio-Economics%20Ziliak%20and%20McCloskey.pdf 527-46] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625163446/http://faculty.roosevelt.edu/Ziliak/doc/Size%20Matters%20Journal%20of%20Socio-Economics%20Ziliak%20and%20McCloskey.pdf |date=25 June 2010 }} (press '''+''').&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, economic variables cannot be experimentally manipulated as treatments randomly assigned to subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leamer|first=Edward|title=Let's Take the Con out of Econometrics|journal=American Economic Review|date=March 1983|volume=73|issue=1|page=34|jstor=1803924}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, economists rely on [[observational studies]], often using data sets with many strongly associated [[covariate]]s, resulting in enormous numbers of models with similar explanatory ability but different covariates and regression estimates. Regarding the plurality of models compatible with observational data-sets, [[Edward Leamer]] urged that "professionals ... properly withhold belief until an inference can be shown to be adequately insensitive to the choice of assumptions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leamer|first=Edward|title=Let's Take the Con out of Econometrics|journal=American Economic Review|date=March 1983|volume=73|issue=1|page=43|jstor=1803924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Economic sociology''' is the study of the social cause and effect of various economic phenomena. The field can be broadly divided into a classical period and a contemporary one, known as "New economic sociology".

The classical period was concerned particularly with [[modernity]] and its constituent aspects which are [[rationalisation (sociology)|rationalisation]], [[secularisation]], [[urbanisation]], [[social stratification]], and so on. As [[sociology]] arose primarily as a reaction to [[capitalist]] modernity, economics played a role in much classic sociological inquiry. The specific term "economic sociology" was first coined by [[William Stanley Jevons]] in 1879, later to be used in the works of [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]] between 1890 and 1920.&lt;ref name="press.princeton.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7525.html |title=Principles of Economic Sociology by Richard Swedberg&amp;nbsp;– An extract |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber's work regarding the [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|relationship between economics and religion]] and the cultural "[[rationalization (sociology)|disenchantment]]" of the modern [[Western World|West]] is perhaps most iconic of the approach set forth in the classic period of economic sociology.

Contemporary economic sociology may include studies of all modern social aspects of economic phenomena; economic sociology may thus be considered a field in the intersection of [[economics]] and sociology. Frequent areas of inquiry in contemporary economic sociology include the social consequences of economic exchanges, the social meanings they involve and the social interactions they facilitate or obstruct.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Swedberg (1990). Economics and Sociology: Redefining Their Boundaries: Conversations with Economists and Sociologists. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-00376-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-691-00376-4}} Description and chapter-preview links, pp. v-vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical==
Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena; emphasizing particularly the role economic structures and institutions play upon society, and the influence a society holds over the nature of economic structures and institutions. The relationship between [[capitalism]] and [[modernity]] is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber's ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905) and Simmel's ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' (1900). Economic sociology may be said to have begun with [[Tocqueville]]'s ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835–40) and ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]'' (1856).&lt;ref name="press.princeton.edu"/&gt; Marx's [[historical materialism]] would attempt to demonstrate how economic forces influence the structure of society on a fundamental level. [[Émile Durkheim]]'s ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' was published in 1922, whilst [[Max Weber]]'s ''[[Economy and Society]]'' was released in the same year.

==Contemporary==

Contemporary economic sociology focuses particularly on the social consequences of economic exchanges, the social meanings they involve and the social interactions they facilitate or obstruct. Influential figures in modern economic sociology include [[Fred L. Block]], [[James Samuel Coleman|James S. Coleman]], [[Paula England]], [[Mark Granovetter]], [[Harrison White]], [[Paul DiMaggio]], [[Joel M. Podolny]], [[Lynette Spillman]], [[Richard Swedberg]] and [[Viviana Zelizer]] in the United States, as well as [[Carlo Trigilia]],&lt;ref name=gil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilding|first=Michael|title=The New Economic Sociology and Its Relevance to Australia|journal=Journal of Sociology|date=September 2005|volume=41|issue=3|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-138056001/the-new-economic-sociology-and-its-relevance-to-australia|accessdate=1 September 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Donald Angus MacKenzie]], [[Laurent Thévenot]] and Jens Beckert in Europe. To this may be added [[Amitai Etzioni]], who has developed the idea of [[socioeconomics]],&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, Amitai. 1988. The Moral Dimension: Toward a New Economics. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Chuck Sabel, [[Wolfgang Streeck]] and [[Michael Mousseau]] who work in the tradition of [[political economy]]/[[political sociology|sociology]].

The focus on mathematical analysis and [[Utility|utility maximisation]] during the 20th century has led some to see economics as a discipline moving away from its roots in the social sciences. Many critiques of economics or economic policy begin from the accusation that abstract modelling is missing some key social phenomenon that needs to be addressed.

Economic sociology is an attempt by sociologists to redefine in sociological terms questions traditionally addressed by economists. It is thus also an answer to attempts by economists (such as [[Gary Becker]]) to bring economic approaches&amp;nbsp;– in particular utility maximisation and [[game theory]]&amp;nbsp;– to the analysis of social situations that are not obviously related to production or trade. [[Karl Polanyi]], in his book ''The Great Transformation'', was the first theorist to come up with the idea of the "embeddedness", meaning that the economy is "embedded" in social institutions which are vital so that the market does not destroy other aspects of human life. The concept of "embeddedness" serves sociologists who study technological developments. Mark Granovetter and Patrick McGuire mapped the social networks which determined the economics of the electrical industry in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, Mark, and McGuire, Patrick (1998) “The Making of an Industry: Electricity
in the United States.” In: M. Callon (ed.) The Laws of the Markets. Oxford:
Blackwell, 147–173.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ronen Shamir analyzed how electrification in Mandatory Palestine facilitated the creation of an ethnic-based dual-economy.&lt;ref&gt;Shamir, Ronen (2013) Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Polanyi's form of market skepticism, however, has been criticized for intensifying rather than limiting the economization of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=2192754 |last=Roth |first= |year=2012 |title=Leaving commonplaces on the commonplace. Cornerstones of a polyphonic market theory |journal=Journal for Critical Organization Inquiry |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=43–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New economic sociology===
A contemporary period of economic sociology, often known as ''new economic sociology'', was consolidated by the 1985 work of [[Mark Granovetter]] titled "Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Granovetter The American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 91, No. 3 (Nov., 1985), pp. 481-510 http://glennschool.osu.edu/faculty/brown/home/Org%20Theory/Readings/Granovetter1985.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These works elaborated the concept of [[embeddedness]], which states that economic relations between individuals or firms take place within existing social relations (and are thus structured by these relations as well as the greater social structures of which those relations are a part). [[Social network|Social network analysis]] has been the primary methodology for studying this phenomenon. Granovetter's theory of the [[Mark Granovetter#The strength of weak ties|strength of weak ties]] and [[Ronald Burt|Ronald Burt's]] concept of structural holes are two best known theoretical contributions of this field.

==Marxist sociology==
{{Main article|Marxist sociology}}
Modern [[Marxist]] thought has focused on the social implications of [[capitalism]] (or "[[commodity fetishism]]") and [[economic development]] within the system of economic relations that produce them. Important theorists include [[Georg Lukács]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Nicos Poulantzas]], [[Ralph Miliband]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Raymond Williams]], [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Antonio Negri]], and [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Socioeconomics==
{{Main article|Socioeconomics}}
Economic sociology is sometimes synonymous with [[socioeconomics]]. Socioeconomics deals with the analytical, political and moral questions arising at the intersection between economy and society from a broad interdisciplinary perspective with links beyond sociology to political economy, moral philosophy, [[institutional economics]] and history.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==US immigration==

At the turn of the 20th century, ethnic whites tended to migrate to urban enclaves on the East Coast and parts of the Midwest. Mexican immigrants settled along South-west border. Chinese immigrants, prior to the Chinese exclusion act, moved and settled along the Pacific states. The regulation of immigrants ebbed and flowed according to economic demands of the labor market and home country's domestic issues. Examples include availability of mine work, railroad building, and steel production or lack of home country's ability to provide adequate career opportunities, food or security.

Working class and low skilled immigrants tended to cluster in the [[ethnic enclave]]s such as Chinatowns, Little Italy's and Koreatowns. This was the result of [[chain migration]], [[Immigration to the United States|US migration policy]], and the placement of availability of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaefer|first=Richard T.|title=Race and ethnicity in the United States|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Boston|isbn=0205216331|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], educated and well skilled immigrant populations did not cluster like their blue collared counterparts. This is particularly true of Indian doctors and Filipino nurses. Both groups have a large population in absolute numbers, but are not as culturally visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Portes|first=Alejandro|title=Immigrant America : a portrait|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520250419|edition=3rd ed., rev., expanded, and updated.|author2=Rumbaut, Rubén G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general immigrants worked for lower wages, and for longer hours, under less-regulated working conditions in dangerous or unhealthy working conditions. Low wages and minimal oversight have widened corporate profits. This is true even for skilled and educated immigrants. Asians on average tend to make more money than Whites. However, when comparing similar high status jobs, Whites still make more. This may explain continued American economic growth since 1965.

In regards to US migration policy, from a [[structural functionalist]] point of view, illegal immigration is tacitly approved by the government and businesses despite surges in nativism starting in the 1980s. As the American population declines, the tax base to support social welfare programs such as Medicare and Social Security shrinks as well. Therefore, government welfare programs are dependent on some level to illegal immigrants who pay into the benefits, but will not receive them in their lifetimes. Further, both their legal and illegal children maintain a positive birth to death ratio, with more individuals living in America paying taxes than those dying. Illegal immigrants and their children play a fundamental role in maintaining government revenues. However, with a functionalist interpretation, it is in the government's best interest to keep these populations suppressed. This is where the interest of government and business intersect: If the undocumented workers were to be documented, employers would be forced to increase wages and the states would offer government assistance. With the fear of deportation after a lengthy detainment from the government and cases of harassment, abuse, rape and intimidation by employers, many illegal immigrants remain quiet about their plight. The second generation immigrants typically display [[reactive ethnic identities]] in response to the suppression and abuse their parents faced, further straining already strained race relations in America.

Nonetheless, due to the diffused structure of the US government and nativist sentiments, mass incarcerations and deportations are on the uptick in America. This has proven to be disastrous to local economies. In the [[Postville Raid]] of 2008, 400 men, women and children were detained by ICE, one third of the town's population. This immediately resulted in the closing of a local food processing plant and immediate decrease in local economic demand. It is estimated that within a radius of twenty miles, 2,800 other jobs were lost – drivers, coffee shop owners and alike – and millions of dollars of lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=US Immigration Reform and Its Global Impact: Lessons from the Postville Raid|year=2013|author= Erik Camayd-Freixas|OL=26175863M|isbn=0230105858}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of Postville asked the Federal government to declare its city as 'disaster zone' given the immediate drop in economic activity. The deportation of undocumented workers had secondary effects for the immigrants' families in their native countries, whose poverty was worsened when the detained individuals could not send remittances. There is a reported case of teenage suicide when the boy had not heard from his father in months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Camayd-Freixas|first=Erik|title=U.S. immigration reform and its transnational impact : a case study of the Postville raid|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=0230105858|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some corners sociological debate today focuses on new immigrants' ability to find employment and to achieve economic self-sufficiency.

According to George Borjas in an essay titled "The Economics of Immigration" (1994), since the 1980s the United States has attracted "lower quality" immigrants with less education and few marketable job skills. Borjas' estimates show that as high as 21 percent of immigrant households participate in social assistance programs consisting of social welfare programs like food stamps and Medicaid. Additionally, economic assimilation is slow due to immigrant's difficulty in securing adequate employment.

Julian Simon, in addition to other economists and policy analysts, claims that recent immigration has either had a positive or neutral effect on the economy. Simon argues that immigrants and their children add to the labor force, paying into long-term benefits such as Social Security.

==Academic associations==
The Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics (SASE) is an international academic association whose members are involved in social studies of economy and economic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sase.org |title=The Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics |publisher=SASE |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Socio-Economic Review]]'' was established as the official journal of SASE in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ser.oxfordjournals.org/|title=Socio-Economic Review |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal aims to encourage work on the relationship between society, economy, institutions and markets, moral commitments and the rational pursuit of self-interest. Most articles focus on economic action in its social and historical context, drawing from sociology, political science, economics and the management and policy sciences. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2015 [[impact factor]] of 1.926, ranking it 56th out of 344 journals in the category "Economics", 21st out of 163 journals in the category "Political Science" and 19th out of 142 journals in the category "Sociology".&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2016 |chapter=Journals Ranked by Impact: Economics, Political Science and Public Administration |title=2015 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Social Sciences |series=[[Web of Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Sociological Association's Economic Sociology section became a permanent Section in January 2001. According to its website, it has about 800 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/asa-communities/asa-sections/all-about-sections/section-membership-history/section-membership-crossrefrence-table |title=Section membership|publisher=American Sociological Association |accessdate=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group of scholars in this area works as Research Committee in Economy and Society (RC02)  within the [[International Sociological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jose I.

The barrow was [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] in 1921, and an east-western aligned coffin was found. It was transported in sealed condition to the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]], where it was opened and the Egtved Girl discovered.

She was buried fully dressed on an oxhide in the coffin. She wore a loose [[bodice]] with sleeves reaching the elbow. She had a bare waist and wore a short string skirt. She had bronze bracelets and a woolen belt with a large disc decorated with spirals and a spike. At her feet were the cremated remains of a child age 5&amp;ndash;6. By her head there was a small [[birch bark]] box which contained an [[stitching awl|awl]], bronze pins and a [[hair net]].

Before the coffin was closed she was covered with a [[blanket]] and an oxhide.  Flowering [[yarrow]] (indicating a summer burial) and a bucket of beer made of wheat, honey, [[bog-myrtle]] and [[cowberry|cowberries]] were placed atop.  Her distinctive outfit, which caused a sensation when it was unearthed in the 1920s, is the best preserved example of a style now known to be common in [[Northern Europe]] during the [[Bronze Age]].  The good preservation of Egtved girl is due to the acidic bog conditions of the soil, which is a common condition of this locale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=Remains of Bronze-Age Cultic Priestess Hold Surprise |url=http://www.livescience.com/50911-bronze-age-danish-burial.html |quote=The girl's final resting place was first unearthed in 1921, in a large burial mound made of peat bog. |newspaper=[[LiveScience]] |date=May 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=Bronze Age priestess travelled great distances, scientists say |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/0522/Bronze-Age-priestess-travelled-great-distances-scientists-say |quote=The burial mound was made out of acidic peat from a bog |newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=May 22, 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists examined [[chemical isotope]]s from tissues in her teeth, fingernails, hair and clothing. The concentration of [[strontium]] in the earth varies with location. These concentrations are reflected in the local water sources from which humans drink, and retained in human tissues. Based on the concentrations of [[strontium-87]] and [[strontium-86]] they found, scientists made informed guesses about the girl's area of origin and where she lived at different times during her life. They suggest that the girl originally lived in [[Schwarzwald|the Black Forest]] region, but married and moved to Denmark. She is believed to have traveled back and forth between the two areas and was buried in Denmark after her death.&lt;ref name="Balter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balter|first1=Michael|title=Coffin remains tell life story of ancient sun-worshiping priestess|journal=Science|date=May 21, 2015|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/05/coffin-remains-tell-life-story-ancient-sun-worshiping-priestess|accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramskov"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramskov|first1=Jens|title=Det er en tysker: Egtvedpigen stammer fra Schwarzwald|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/det-er-en-tysker-egtvedpigen-stammer-fra-schwarzwald-176214|accessdate=27 September 2016|work=Ingeniøren|date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Margarita"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margarita Frei|first1=Karin|last2=Mannering|first2=Ulla|last3=Kristiansen|first3=Kristian|last4=Allentoft|first4=Morten E.|last5=Wilson|first5=Andrew S.|last6=Skals|first6=Irene|last7=Tridico|first7=Silvana|last8=Louise Nosch|first8=Marie|last9=Willerslev|first9=Eske|last10=Clarke|first10=Leon|last11=Frei|first11=Robert|title=Tracing the dynamic life story of a Bronze Age Female|journal=Scientific Reports|date=21 May 2015|volume=5|pages=10431|doi=10.1038/srep10431|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150521/srep10431/full/srep10431.html|pmid=25994525|pmc=4440039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction==
The outfit was reconstructed for the [[National Museum of Denmark]] by the [[Lejre Experimental Centre]] and is on display there. A reconstructed set of clothes, as well as details of the excavation, are on display in the Egtved Girl's museum at the excavation site.

The '''eightfold path''' is a method of [[policy analysis]] assembled by [[Eugene Bardach]], a professor at the [[Goldman School of Public Policy]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene Bardach {{!}} Emeritus Professor of Public Policy|url=https://gspp.berkeley.edu/directories/faculty/eugene-bardach|publisher=University of California at Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is outlined in his book ''A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis: The Eightfold Path to More Effective Problem Solving'', which is now in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CQ Press: Book: A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis: The Eightfold Path to More Effective Problem Solving, 4th Edition, Eugene Bardach |url=http://www.cqpress.com/product/Bardach4e.html |publisher=CQ Press |accessdate=29 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010053147/http://www.cqpress.com/product/Bardach4e.html |archivedate=10 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is commonly referenced in [[Policy|public policy]] and [[public administration]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of scholarly works referencing ''A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis''|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4884126323094470718&amp;as_sdt=20005&amp;sciodt=0,9&amp;hl=en|publisher=Google Scholar|accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bardach's procedure is as follows:
# Define the problem
# Assemble some evidence
# Construct the alternatives
# Select the criteria
# Project the outcomes
# Confront the trade-offs
# Decide
# Tell your story

A possible ninth step, based on Bardach's own writing, might be "repeat steps 1 - 8 as necessary."

== The New York taxi driver test ==
The New York taxi driver test is a technique for evaluating the effectiveness of communication between policy makers and analysts. Bardach contends that policy explanations must be clear and down-to-earth enough for a taxi driver to be able to understand the premise during a trip through city streets. The New York taxi driver is presumed to be both a non-specialist and a tough customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bardach| first = Eugene| title = A practical guide for policy analysis: the eightfold path to more effective problem solving| year = 2000| publisher = Chatham House Publishers, Seven Bridges Press| isbn = 978-1-889119-29-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebriefings.ca/wordpress/?p%3D321 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712110533/http://www.ebriefings.ca/wordpress/?p=321 |archivedate=12 July 2011 |title=Digital Fishers – The Taxi Driver Pitch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronarcosis''', also called '''electric stunning''' or '''electrostunning''', is a profound [[stupor]] produced by passing an electric current through the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electronarcosis |publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Service]] |date=2018 |url=https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004580 |accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electronarcosis may be used as a form of  [[electrotherapy]] in treating certain mental illnesses in humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Merriam-Webster's medical dictionary | publisher =[[Merriam-Webster]] Inc | location = Springfield, Mass | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-87779-914-8 |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/electronarcosis |accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may be used to rendering [[livestock]] unconscious prior to [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]].&lt;ref name="meat"&gt;{{cite web |title=Electrical Stunning of Red Meat Animals |publisher=Humane Slaughter Association |url=https://www.hsa.org.uk/downloads/publications/electricalstunningdownload.pdf |accessdate=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1902, Stephen Luduc discovered he could produce a narcotic-like state in animals, and eventually he tried it on himself, where he remained conscious, but unable to move in a dream-like state.&lt;ref name="Helliwell1950"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Helliwell|first1=P. J.|title=ELECTRONARCOSIS|journal=Anaesthesia|volume=5|issue=4|year=1950|pages=166–170|issn=0003-2409|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.1950.tb12679.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1951, an American psychiatrist [[Hervey M. Cleckley]] published a paper on the results of treating 110 patients having anxiety neuroses with electronarcosis therapy.  He argued that patients may benefit from electronarcosis after other treatments have failed.&lt;ref name="EstesCleckley1951"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Estes|first1=Marion M.|last2=Cleckley|first2=Hervey M.|title=ELECTRONARCOSIS IN A GENERAL HOSPITAL|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=107|issue=11|year=1951|pages=814–820|issn=0002-953X|doi=10.1176/ajp.107.11.814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1974 paper discussed the advantage of using electronarcosis for short term general anesthesia. Researchers achieved electronarcosis by applying 180 mA at a frequency of 500 Hertz to the [[mastoid part of the temporal bone]].&lt;ref name="NegovskyTabak1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Negovsky|first1=V.A.|last2=Tabak|first2=V.Ya.|last3=Pechkin|first3=Ye.N.|title=Short-term electronarcosis: a new method of general anaesthesia for defibrillation|journal=Resuscitation|volume=3|issue=3|year=1974|pages=223–227|issn=0300-9572|doi=10.1016/0300-9572(74)90011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phases==
Electronarcosis results in a conditions similar to an [[epileptic seizure]], with the three phases called ''tonic'', ''clonic'', and ''recovery''.

During the tonic phase the patient or animal collapses and becomes rigid.

During clonic muscles relax and some movement occurs.

During recovery the patient or animal becomes aware.

==Livestock==
Electronarcosis is one of the  [[Stunning#Electrical_stunning|methods used]] to render animals unconscious before slaughter and unable to feel pain. Electronarcosis may be followed immediately by [[electrocution]] or by bleeding.

Modern electronarcosis is typically performed by applying 200 [[Volt]]s of high frequency [[alternating current]] of about 1500 [[Hertz]] for 3 seconds to the animal's head.  High frequency current is not felt as an electric shock and does not cause skeletal muscle contractions.{{cn|date=April 2018}}  A wet animal will pass a current of over an [[Ampere]].  If electronarcosis is not followed by other procedures, the animal will usually recover.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt;

Studies have been used to determine optimal parameters for effective electronarcosis.&lt;ref name="BarbosaAdamczuk2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbosa|first1=RL|last2=Adamczuk|first2=GO|last3=Dvojatzki|first3=P|last4=Trentin|first4=MG|last5=Lima|first5=JD|title=Efficiency of Electrical Stunning by Electronarcosis: Current Situation and Perspective of Improvement in a Medium-Size Processing Plant|journal=Revista Brasileira de Ciência Avícola|volume=18|issue=2|year=2016|pages=331–336|issn=1516-635X|doi=10.1590/1806-9061-2015-0113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Engineering Critical Assessment''' (ECA) is a procedure by which the safety of a welded structure with defects or flaws can be determined.  ECAs utilize the material properties and expected stress history to determine a flaw acceptance criteria which will ensure that welds will not fail during the construction or service life of the welded structure.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The assessment can be used before the structure is in use, or during in-service inspection, to determine whether a given weld is in need of repair.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fracture and Fatigue of Welded Joints and Structures|last=MacDonald|first=K.|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=60–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ECAs are used throughout the energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure industries.  ECAs are based heavily upon [[fracture mechanics]] principles, and reflect an improvement over traditional methods of weld quality assurance, which can be arbitrary or overly conservative.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Background ==
During welding, [[Welding defect|defects]] or flaws can develop.  In some cases, these flaws could potentially affect the integrity of the weld,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twi-global.com/capabilities/integrity-management/engineering-critical-assessment/|title=Engineering Critical Assessment|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in failure by [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[Creep (deformation)|creep]], [[Fracture|brittle fracture]], or [[Yield (engineering)|yielding]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Therefore, codes to determine weld quality must be developed.  Traditionally, welding codes have been based off workmanship criteria.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;API Standard 1104: "Welding of Pipelines and Related Facilities" (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;CSA Z662-11: "Oil and gas pipeline systems" (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;BS 7910: "Guide to methods for assessing the acceptability of flaws in metallic structures" (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;API Standard 579: "Fitness-for-Service" (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  These criteria are determined empirically, typically by estimating the level of weld quality expected from a skilled welder.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/gasimp/docs/FinalReport_TransborderStandards.pdf|title=Comparison of US and Canadian Transmission Pipeline Consensus Standards|last=Michael Baker Jr., Inc|date=May 2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While these criteria have been reliable historically, improvements made in welding technology and materials science are not taken into account.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Kenneth Y.|date=September 2008|title=Reducing Pipeline Construction Costs With Girth Weld ECA|url=http://www.lincolnelectric.com/en-us/industries/Documents/ReducingPipelineConstructionCostswithECA-LincolnElectricPGJ.pdf|journal=Pipeline &amp; Gas Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, over time, workmanship criteria have become increasingly conservative.  This conservatism results in unnecessary repairs, which can increase construction costs and can yield undesirable residual stresses at the location of the repair weld.

Beginning in the late 1970s to early 1980s, engineering critical assessments began to emerge as an alternative to traditional workmanship criteria.  These ECAs relied heavily on recent developments in the field of [[fracture mechanics]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Where workmanship criteria were developed with a limited understanding of material characteristics, and considered only the length of a given weld flaw, these ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria considered additional factors such as:
* The stress history of the weld, including all cyclic and static stresses expected throughout the life cycle of the welded structure 
* The strength of the base metal and weld material&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/faq-engineering-critical-assessment-eca/|title=Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA) Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fracture toughness (measured via [[Crack tip opening displacement]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rules.dnvgl.com/docs/pdf/DNV/codes/docs/2006-01/RP-F108.pdf|title=DNV-RFP-F108: Fracture Control for Pipeline Installation Methods Introducing Cyclic Plastic Strain|last=|first=|date=January 2006|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; testing or [[Charpy impact test]]ing)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; of the base metal and the weld material
* The flaw orientation (e.g., measurement of flaw length ''and'' flaw height, as opposed to flaw length only)
Together, these additional factors allow for more generous flaw acceptance criteria, resulting in fewer unnecessarily repaired welds.

To comply with the flaw acceptance criteria developed during ECA, [[Nondestructive testing|non-destructive examination]] must be utilized.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  [[Ultrasonic testing]] is typically used due to its high accuracy, ability to identify flaw size and orientation, and its ability to provide feedback instantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/sragtech/ndt4.pdf|title=Information for the Procurement and Conduct of NDT|last=|first=|date=April 2008|website=Health and Safety Executive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ECA for oil and gas pipelines ==
ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria are commonly used in the oil and gas industry, particularly with regard to qualification of girth welds on cross-country oil and gas transmission pipelines.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This is because girth welds are typically uniform from weld to weld, allowing construction contractors to utilize mechanized welding.  Mechanized welding increases productivity over manual welding techniques by allowing for better, more uniform control over weld characteristics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria are able to take advantage of the high strength and toughness of the welds produced to develop more generous flaw acceptance criteria.  In addition, the flaws created during mechanized welding are typically oriented differently than flaws developed from manual welding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria more effectively assess these flaws, by considering flaw orientation, rather than just flaw length.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Standards ===
Several standards specific to ECAs for oil and gas pipelines have been developed.  The most commonly used of these are API 1104 Appendix A,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; API 579,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; CSA Z662&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Annex K, and BS 7910.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The standard used depends primarily on the location of the pipeline being installed.  The standards differ in methodology and in extreme cases, can result in significantly different flaw acceptance criteria.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  However, for typical operating conditions, the criteria are easy enough to follow that practical differences between the standards are small.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''European Centre for Minority Issues''' ('''ECMI''') is a [[research institute]] based in [[Flensburg]], [[Germany]], that conducts research into [[Minority group|minority]]-majority relations in [[Europe]]. ECMI is a non-partisan and interdisciplinary institution. It is a non-profit, independent foundation, registered according to German Civil Law.

[[File:ECMI logo 250x69.gif|thumb|ECMI Logo]]

ECMI was established in 1996 by the governments of [[Denmark]], Germany and [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/rubrik/3/in+english/|title=About|publisher=European Centre for Minority Issues|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre is governed by a board composed of nine members: three from Denmark, three from Germany, one representative from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], one from the [[Council of Europe]] and one from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; The institute's first director was Stefan Troebst, now Professor of East European Cultural Studies at the [[University of Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="Starting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/76/2006/12/07/Starting-ECMI.php|title=Starting ECMI|publisher=European Centre for Minority Issues|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director is Tove H. Malloy.&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/rubrik/17/ecmi+staff/|title=ECMI staff|publisher=European Centre for Minority Issues|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre employs a core staff and also hosts visiting [[fellow]]s and visiting research associates.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;
The Centre organizes its activities around three principal themes. It is concerned with the evaluation and further development of universal, regional, bilateral and national standards that may assist in consolidating democratic governance on the basis of ethnic diversity and human rights. In this context, ECMI is also particularly interested in the emerging convergence of standards between EU members and applicant states. A second area of involvement relates to implementation procedures and mechanisms for these diverse standards and the study of their effectiveness. At times, ECMI has been invited to consider standards implementation and majority-minority relations in particular states in cooperation with the government of that state and local groups.

==Publications==

Over the years,the European Centre for Minority Issues has produced a number of Monographs, Reports, Working Papers and Issue Briefs,as well as the peer reviewed online [[open access journal]], Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues  in Europe (JEMIE), in addition to co-editorship (with [[European_Academy_of_Bozen|EURAC Bozen]]) of the flagship publication European Yearbook of Minority Issues. The goal of this publication effort is to increase the awareness and dissemination of topics on minority issues, as well as to encourage further research in this field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3554">'''Forensic Economics''' as defined by the National Association of Forensic Economics is the scientific discipline that applies economic theories and methods to matters within a legal framework. Forensic economics covers, but is not limited to:
* The calculation of pecuniary damages in personal and commercial litigation.
* The analysis of liability, such as the statistical analysis of discrimination, the analysis of market power in antitrust disputes, and fraud detection.
* Other matters subject to legal review, such as public policy analysis, and business, property, and asset valuation.

In a 2012 paper by Eric Zitzewitz entitled “Forensic Economics,” ''Journal of Economic Literature'' 2012, 50(3), 731–769, published by the American Economic Association, "Forensic Economics" was defined as the application of economics to the detection and quantification of harm from behavior that has become the subject of litigation.

The only difference between these two definitions is that one suggests the application of science is itself a scientific discipline.  Notwithstanding this distinction, both definitions refer to the application of [[economics]].  While courts may dictate what economic issues are to be addressed, the economic science that is applied must be that which is taught and practiced in the world at large.

==Examples of applications of economics in litigation==
* Economic damages in injury and death
* Antitrust liability and economic damages
* Unfair practices in international trade
* Economic damages in copyright violation and patent infringement
* Contract violations
* Discrimination
* [[Economic damages]] related to physical and emotional abuse

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3861">The '''Forest of Avon Trust''' is the local charity for trees in the former county of [[Avon (county)|Avon]], which now comprises [[Bristol]], [[North Somerset]], [[South Gloucestershire]], and [[Bath and North East Somerset]].

The Trust's objectives are to plant trees in gardens, streets, green spaces and schools to benefit people and [[wildlife]]. It also provides support to communities and individuals to plant and manage trees, including [[woodland]] and [[orchard]] creation.

The Forest of Avon Trust also provides accredited  [[Open College Network|OCN]] level 3 training for [[Forest schools|Forest School]] leaders and runs woodland activity and [[Outdoor education|outdoor learning]] sessions for schools, nurseries and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OCN Forest School Training 2013 Forest School Taster Day|url=http://lwfarm.org.uk/learning.html|publisher=Lawrence Weston Community Farm|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011 the trust has also run projects with adults with [[Learning_disability#United_Kingdom|learning difficulties]] to increase skills, independence and wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Studies: Benefits to Health and Wellbeing of Trees and Green Spaces|url=http://www.communityforest.org.uk/resources/case_study_health_and_wellbeing.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Community Forest Partnership|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forest of Avon Trust currently manages a community woodland near Upton Cheney, [[South Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest of Avon Trust takes on its first woodland|url=http://www.outdoorswest.org.uk/Home/1173/1810|publisher=Outdoors West|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Forest of Avon Trust was established in 2008 to carry on the work of the Forest of Avon Community Forest, which planted over 1 million trees.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forestofavontrust.org/about/|title=About the Forest of Avon Trust|publisher=Forest of Avon Trust Trust|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then the charity has campaigned for strategic woodland creation, in support of the principles of the [[Community forests in England|Community Forest]].

In their first three years work included: creating mini-orchards in school grounds, donating thousands of locally grown, native trees and shrubs to school and communities, providing advice and support to local groups to enable them to plant trees, delivering environmental awareness and play activities for local schools and nurseries, delivering tailored woodland activities for adults with learning disabilities, advising landowners on woodland management and [[Forestry Commission]] grants and taking on the lease of The Retreat community woodland.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

'''Generative adversarial networks''' ('''GANs''') are a class of [[artificial intelligence]] algorithms used in [[unsupervised machine learning]], implemented by a system of two [[neural network]]s contesting with each other in a [[zero-sum game]] framework. They were introduced by [[Ian Goodfellow]] ''et al.'' in 2014.&lt;ref name="GANs"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1406.2661|title=Generative Adversarial Networks|first1=Ian |last1=Goodfellow |first2=Jean |last2=Pouget-Abadie |first3=Mehdi |last3=Mirza |first4=Bing |last4=Xu |first5=David |last5=Warde-Farley |first6=Sherjil |last6=Ozair |first7=Aaron |last7=Courville |first8=Yoshua |last8=Bengio |class=cs.LG |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This technique can generate photographs that look at least superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics (though in tests people can tell real from generated in many cases).&lt;ref name="ITT_GANs"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1606.03498|title=Improved Techniques for Training GANs|last1=Salimans |first1=Tim |last2=Goodfellow |first2=Ian |last3=Zaremba |first3=Wojciech |last4=Cheung |first4=Vicki |last5=Radford |first5=Alec |last6=Chen |first6=Xi |class=cs.LG |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
One network [[Generative model|generates]] candidates (generative) and the other [[Discriminative model|evaluates them]] (discriminative).&lt;ref name="MyUser_Arxiv.org_April_7_2016c"&gt;{{cite arXiv|class=stat.ML|first2=Jean|last2=Pouget-Abadie|title=Generative Adversarial Networks|eprint=1406.2661|last1=Goodfellow|first1=Ian J.|last3=Mirza|first3=Mehdi|last4=Xu|first4=Bing|last5=Warde-Farley|first5=David|last6=Ozair|first6=Sherjil|last7=Courville|first7=Aaron|last8=Bengio|first8=Yoshua|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DAGUI"&gt;Thaler, SL, US Patent 05659666, Device for the autonomous generation of useful information, 08/19/1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DABUI"&gt;Thaler, SL, US Patent, 07454388, Device for the autonomous bootstrapping of useful information, 11/18/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia of creativity"&gt;Thaler, SL, The Creativity Machine Paradigm, Encyclopedia of Creativity, Invention, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship, (ed.) E.G. Carayannis, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the generative network learns to map from a [[Latent variable|latent space]] to a particular data distribution of interest, while the discriminative network discriminates between instances from the true data distribution and candidates produced by the generator. The generative network's training objective is to increase the error rate of the discriminative network (i.e., "fool" the discriminator network by producing novel synthesised instances that appear to have come from the true data distribution).&lt;ref name="MyUser_Arxiv.org_April_7_2016c" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luc|first=Pauline|last2=Couprie|first2=Camille|last3=Chintala|first3=Soumith|last4=Verbeek|first4=Jakob|date=2016-11-25|title=Semantic Segmentation using Adversarial Networks|journal=NIPS Workshop on Adversarial Training, Dec , Barcelona, Spain|volume=2016|arxiv=1611.08408|bibcode=2016arXiv161108408L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, a known dataset serves as the initial training data for the discriminator. Training the discriminator involves presenting it with samples from the dataset, until it reaches some level of accuracy. Typically the generator is seeded with a randomized input that is sampled from a predefined latent space&lt;ref name = "DAGUI"/&gt; (e.g. a [[multivariate normal distribution]]). Thereafter, samples synthesized by the generator are evaluated by the discriminator. [[Backpropagation]] is applied in both networks &lt;ref name = "DABUI"/&gt; so that the generator produces better images, while the discriminator becomes more skilled at flagging synthetic images.&lt;ref name="OpenAI_com"&gt;{{citation |url=http://openai.com/blog/generative-models/ |title=Generative Models |publisher=[[OpenAI]] |date=  |authors=[[Andrej Karpathy]], [[Pieter Abbeel]], Greg Brockman, Peter Chen, Vicki Cheung, Rocky Duan, Ian Goodfellow, Durk Kingma, Jonathan Ho, Rein Houthooft, Tim Salimans, John Schulman, Ilya Sutskever, And Wojciech Zaremba|accessdate= April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generator is typically a deconvolutional neural network, and the discriminator is a [[convolutional neural network]].

The idea to infer models in a competitive setting (model versus discriminator) was proposed by Li, Gauci and Gross in 2013.&lt;ref name="Li-etal-GECCO2013"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models other than neural networks can be considered. Moreover, the discriminators are allowed to influence the processes from which the datasets are obtained, making them active interrogators as in the Turing test. The idea of adversarial training can also be found in earlier works, such as Schmidhuber in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jürgen|date=November 1992|title=Learning Factorial Codes by Predictability Minimization|journal=Neural Computation|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|pages=863–879|doi=10.1162/neco.1992.4.6.863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Glagolita Clozianus''' is a 14-folio [[Glagolitic script|Glagolitic]] [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[Old_Church_Slavonic#Canon|canon]] [[miscellany]], written in the eleventh century.

What remained of an originally very large codex, having probably 552 folios (1104 pages), are 14 folios containing five [[homily|homilies]]. Two of the homilies are complete; one by [[John Chrysostom]] and one by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], and three of them are fragments, one by John Chrysostom, one by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] and one that is usually attributed to [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]]. Four of those homilies are known from other Old Church Slavonic codices, the exception being the one usually attributed to St. Methodius, which is found only in Clo, and sometimes referred to as the ''Anonymous Homily''.

The codex was named after the Count [[Paris Cloz]] who owned it in the first half of the 19th century. Prior to that, up until the end of the 15th century, it was owned by the Croatian nobles of the [[House of Frankopan]], who used the codex as a house [[relic]] (it was bound with silver and gold) in worship, believing St. [[Jerome]] to be the author. Count Cloz donated the codex to the City Museum in [[Trento|Trent]], where the first 12 folios are being kept today. The remaining 2 folios, discovered by Slovene Slavist [[Franc Miklošič]], are kept in the [[Ferdinandeum]] museum in [[Innsbruck]].

Linguists somewhat disagree when discussing the source of the text; some, arguing on the similarity of the rounded Glagolitic with Sinaitic codices ([[Psalterium Sinaiticum]], [[Euchologium Sinaiticum]]), hold that the manuscript originated in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and others that it was written in [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]], justifying it with the change of ''ь'' to ''ъ'' behind palatal ''č'', ''ž'', ''št'' and ''žd'', a trait commonly found in other Croatian Glagolitic mediaeval manuscripts. The reasonable conclusion that follows is that the manuscript was copied on the Croatian territory from the original written in Macedonia.

The text was first published by [[Jernej Kopitar|Jernej B. Kopitar]] (Vienna 1836, the first 12 folios), together with the [[Freising Fragments]] and the manuscript ''De conversione Bagaorium et Carantanorum''. Franc Miklošič published two folios from Innsbruck in 1860, and both pieces were published together by I. I. Sreznjevski in 1866. Critical edition with Ancient Greek originals was published by [[Václav Vondrák]] (''Glagolita Clozùv'' 1893) and finally by [[Antonín Dostál]] (''Clozianus, staroslověnsky hlaholský sborník tridentský a innsbrucký'', Prague 1959). Dostal's edition contains photographs, Cyrillic transcription, Ancient Greek original, translations to Czech and a dictionary.

[[File:Villapando Temple Plan.jpg|upright|thumb|The floor plan of the Hamburg model corresponds to the lack of outdoor gallery from the plan of Juan Bautista Villalpando: : In Ezechielem Explanationes 1604.]]

The '''Hamburg temple model''' is a [[baroque]] architectural model of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]]. It covers an area of about {{convert|12|m2|sqft}} and is made from wood. It is square, with four wings and nine courtyards, two of them in the central axis.

It was made from 1680 to 1692 after being commissioned by the [[Hamburg]] senator and founder and director of the [[Hamburg Opera]], [[Gerhard Schott]]. The model was first exhibited at the Hamburg Opera. After his death, Schott's heirs put the model up for sale in London, where it was acquired by an agent of [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I]], [[King of Poland]]. In 1732 it was taken to [[Dresden]], where it was shown as part of the collection of [[Jewish ceremonial art]]. After the restructuring of this collection in the early 19th Century the model had several owners, before being acquired by the [[Hamburgmuseum]] in 1910.

Schott's model is in the tradition of many Renaissance and Baroque attempts at reconstruction of the temple by theological and architectural scholars.&lt;!--  considerations examined the original shape of the temple described in the Bible to approach. While most of the experiments were published independently in written or graphic form, is not original bulkhead model.--&gt; The Hamburg-based model closely follows an interpretation by the Spanish Jesuit [[Juan Bautista Villalpando]] in 1604, in turn, based on the [[Third Temple]] described in the [[Book of Ezekiel]].

The reason the expensive and complex model was commissioned is unknown.

'''Houghton College''' is a Christian [[liberal arts]] college in [[Houghton, New York|Houghton]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is affiliated with the [[Wesleyan Church]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.houghton.edu/about-us/history/ History of Houghton]. Houghton.edu. Retrieved on 2013-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The college is a member of both the [[Christian College Consortium]] and the [[Council for Christian Colleges and Universities]].

==History==
Houghton College began in 1883 as Houghton Seminary, a [[coeducation]]al [[high school]] founded by [[Willard J. Houghton]], a [[Wesleyan]] [[Methodist]] minister. In 1899, the first few college classes were offered. James S. Luckey was appointed president in 1908 and Houghton College received its provisional charter from New York in 1923.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; A permanent charter was granted in 1927, and accreditation by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] came in 1935. [[Stephen W. Paine|Stephen Paine]] was appointed president in 1937.  When the former Buffalo Bible Institute merged with Houghton College in 1969, the West Seneca campus was created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.houghton.edu/orgs/star/issues/Oct%207%202005.pdf ''Houghton Star'', October 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904014808/http://campus.houghton.edu/orgs/star/issues/Oct%207%202005.pdf |date=September 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber Dayton was appointed president in 1972 and he was succeeded by [[Daniel R. Chamberlain]] in 1976. The college initiated its first [[master’s degree]] program in 2004 and currently offers nine such degrees.  [[Shirley Mullen]] was appointed president in 2006. From 2012 to 2013, the college set new records of giving to the institution for two years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.houghton.edu/news-media/recent-news/houghton-college-sets-record-giving-second-year-running/284/|title=Houghton College Sets Record Giving, Second Year Running|publisher=Houghton College |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Houghton College faced financial and enrollment challenges which led to academic budget cuts for the 2014–2015 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghtonstar.com/2013/11/09/college-announces-significant-academic-budget-cuts-for-2014-2015/|title=College Announces Significant Academic Budget Cuts for 2014–2015 |first=Sarah|last=Hutchinson |work=Houghton Star |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/09/private-colleges-remain-under-weather|title=Private colleges remain under the weather|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a "strategic reallocation of resources"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/news-media/recent-news/houghton-announces-strategic-realignment-of-academic-programs/335/|title=Houghton Announces Strategic Realignment of Academic Programs|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the development of several new majors including Music Industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghtonstar.com/2014/12/08/new-music-industry-major/|title=New Music Industry Major |first=Laura |last=Johnson |work=Houghton Star |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports Management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/news-media/recent-news/houghton-gets-approval-to-offer-bs-in-sport-recreation-and-wellness-management/586/|title=Houghton Gets Approval to  Offer B.S. in Sport, Recreation and Wellness Management|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Data Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghtonstar.com/2015/01/30/houghton-first-in-nation/|title=Houghton First in Nation to Offer Liberal Arts Data Science Class |first=Luke |last=Lauer |work=Houghton Star |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Houghton College’s main [[campus]] is in the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Houghton, in [[Allegany County, New York]], about {{convert|65|mi|km}} southeast of [[Buffalo, New York]] and {{convert|70|mi|km}} southwest of [[Rochester, New York]]. The {{convert|1300|acre|km2}} of campus sit on the [[Allegheny Plateau]] at roughly {{convert|1300|ft|m}}, on the site of the former [[Caneadea]] Indian Reservation. A new Adult Education program offers a B.S. in Management at a variety of locations. Houghton College opened two locations in Niagara County for their Adult Education Program in 2013, in the city of [[Niagara Falls, N.Y.]], and in [[Lockport, N.Y.]]

==Academics==
Houghton College grants two-year and four-year degrees in 46 majors. The college also offers six graduate degrees through the Greatbatch School of Music.

===First Year Honors===
A distinctive First Year Honors Program is for qualified first-year students.  There are three options: London Honors, East Meets West, and Science Honors. Previously the college offered a Contemporary Contexts program, but was replaced by London Honors in 2014. During London Honors, students spend their spring semester in London studying the development of the western world. East Meets West involves taking integrated classes during normal semester then traveling abroad during "May Term", exploring the roots of Western culture. Science Honors takes place during both first-year semesters at Houghton, involving research in recent real-world issues such as fuel-efficiency, climate change, and energy sources. The theme for 2012-13 was [[Global Warming]] and ways in which to improve Houghton's efforts in [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houghton.edu/academics/Honors-at-Houghton/ Houghton College: Prospective Students Website – Academics – Honors Program].

==Student life==
There are four traditional residence halls and four townhouses residences. Two of the traditional residence halls, Gillette Hall and Lambein Hall, are female residences. Rothenbuhler Hall and Shenawana Hall are male residences. Sophomore, Junior and senior students have the option to live in the townhouses. Houghton College is a distinctly residential campus but does allow for upper class students the opportunity to apply to live in approved off-campus housing, called Community Living Opportunities (CLOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/students/residence-life/college-residences/|title=Residence Life - College Residences|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations and clubs are available for students to join or found their own.  &lt;!-- Detailed lists should not be included, can be found at houghton.edu --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2487">The '''Institute for Language and Speech Processing''' (ILSP) ({{lang-el|Ινστιτούτο Επεξεργασίας του Λόγου, ΙΕΛ}}) is a [[Greece|Greek]] non-profit private foundation focusing on applied research in [[Speech Processing]], [[Natural Language Processing]]  and [[Computer-assisted language learning|Computer-Assisted Language Learning]]. The goal of ILSP is to support the growth of Language Technology in [[Greece]]. For this purpose it has brought together a team of experts and has created the necessary technical infrastructure in accordance with the [[European Community]] policy towards safeguarding the European cultural heritage through technology. ILSP aims to be a pole of attraction for the [[language industry]], which is growing both in Greece and in the rest of [[Europe]], thus contributing to the expansion of activities in this particularly important area of modern IT. The industrial direction which it maintains, the experience of its researchers and the close relations which it keeps with key research centres in other European countries, are the three basic elements in the profile of ILSP.

ILSP carries out applied research in Man-Machine Interfaces, [[Machine Learning]], [[Speech Processing]], [[Text Processing]], Theoretical and [[Computational Linguistics]] and Language Learning Technologies.  Expertise used by the Institute includes basic fields as [[Natural Language Processing]], [[Digital Signal Processing]] and [[Pattern Recognition]]. Its mission is mainly to support basic research, promoting on the other hand the development of new products in the form of laboratory prototypes.

The research taking place both for Natural Language Processing and Speech Processing gives these areas new impetus, which stems from their complementarity. Taking as a fact that the Institute combines in its activities the research in these two thematic areas, it has the ability to successfully deal with those issues that require know-how from both domains.

The Institute pushes the technologies developed in the framework of projects until the phase of industrial prototypes and products, using the full cycle of industrial development including quality control.

==Overview==

The Directorate of the Inter–Services Public Relations (ISPR) was established in 1949 with [[Pakistan Army|army]] [[colonel]] Shahbaz Khan becoming its first director-general.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; The ISPR operates as a unified public relations system for the Pakistan's [[Pakistan Armed Forces|military]], which combined [[Pakistan Army|army]], [[Pakistan Air Force|air force]], [[Pakistan Navy|navy]], and [[Pakistan Marines|marines]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; The ISPR manage the public relations requirement of the armed forces, and is staff with the combined personnel of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|military]] along with civilian officers.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; It functions at the [[Joint Staff Headquarters (Pakistan)|Joint Staff Headquarters]] (JS HQ) and plays an important role for gathering a national support for the [[Pakistani military|armed forces]] at the public level.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; The ISPR also strengthened support for the [[Pakistani military|military]]'s assigned contingency operations while undermining the will of the adversary.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;

In views of [[United States Army|US army]] colonel John Adache, the ISPR interfaces between the [[Pakistan armed forces|armed forces]], [[Media of Pakistan|civil media]], and the [[Pakistani society|civic society]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;  Furthermore, the ISPR also formulates the media policy of the unified [[Pakistan armed forces|armed forces]], safeguards the military interests of the [[Pakistan armed forces|armed forces]] from negative influence, and monitors international and domestic media reporting regarding its military issues.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;

On regular basis, the ISPR broadcasts the televised news regarding the strategic arsenals testings, contingency operations and [[military exercise]]s— both at foreign and domestic areas. In [[Military of Pakistan|Pakistan's military]] staff appointments and assignments, the ISPR is one of the most prestigious directorate of [[Pakistan Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;

Its executive authority, a [[director-general]], is a chief military spokesperson of the Pakistan Armed Forces who reports to [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (Pakistan)|Chairman]] of [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, Pakistan|Joint Chiefs of Staff Secretariat]]; [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] as well the head also directly report to [[Chief of Air Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Air Staff]], [[Commandant]] of [[Pakistan Marines|Marines]], and the [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Naval Staff]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;

==Operations==
The ISPR directorate is staffed with combined personnel of Pakistan's unified [[Pakistan Defence Forces|military]] along with civilian [[Central Superior Services of Pakistan|bureaucrats]] and officials.&lt;ref name="Govt. of Pakistan (PowerPoint)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=staff |title=The ISPR |url=https://lib.vcomsats.edu.pk/library/MPA517/MPA517%20PPT/Lecture_30/Lecture-30.pptx |publisher=Govt. of Pakistan (PowerPoint) |accessdate=18 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISPR functioned at the [[JS HQ (Pakistan)|JS HQ]] and responsible for garnering national support for the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]] as well as strengthen their resolve to accomplish the assigned mission while undermining the will of the adversary.

It also acts as an interface between the armed forces, the media and the public.&lt;ref name="Govt. of Pakistan (PowerPoint)"/&gt; It formulates much of the media policy of Pakistan's military, safeguards the armed forces from negative influences and monitors both international and domestic media.

It is likely that the army is planning the further expansion of ISPR to counter negative propaganda against the state and armed forces by international powers and their funded domestic media campaigns, in ongoing operation against terror outfits and economic terrorism.
That's why, for the first time in its history ISPR was being led by a three-star general,
Lt-General Asim Saleem Bajwa.&lt;ref name="Govt. of Pakistan -(PowerPoint)-"&gt; {{cite web|last1=staff |title=Bajwa, three others promoted to Lt Gen rank |url=https://www.samaa.tv/news/2015/09/bajwa-three-others-promoted-to-lt-gen/ |publisher=Samaa News |accessdate=22 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal media network==

On regular basis, the ISPR release televised press releases on regarding the ongoing [[military exercises]], and notified the [[Media of Pakistan|civilian media]] about the ingenious strategic arsenal testings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISPR Press Release on testings|url=https://www.ispr.gov.pk/front/main.asp?o=t-press_release&amp;id=2707#pr_link2707|publisher=ISPR Press Release|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISPR Press Release, timeline"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DG ISPR|title=ISPR Press release|url=https://www.ispr.gov.pk/front/main.asp?o=t-pr_archive&amp;mon=10&amp;yr=2014&amp;styr=2013|publisher=ISPR Press Release, timeline|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from functioning as the public relations body of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]], the ISPR handles exclusive dissemination of information regarding Pakistan's ongoing military [[War in North-West Pakistan|contingency operations]].&lt;ref name="Govt. of Pakistan (PowerPoint)" /&gt;

== Controversies ==
In recent years, there have been accusations of ISPR going beyond its domain and meddling in media affairs to undermine democracy. Concerns have been raised on ISPR handling media channels (Bol TV, Pak TV et al.), radio stations (FM 89.04, FM 96.00 ) and several media personalities such as Dr Shahid Masood, Arshad Sharif, Sami Ibrahim, Dr Aamir Liaqat etc. to indoctrinate pro-military narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/how-many-radio-stations-journalists-work-for-you-asma-jahangir-asks-ispr/|title=How many radio stations, journalists work for you? Asma Jahangir asks ISPR|work=Daily Pakistan Global|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISPR has regularly been criticized for posting inflammatory tweets on their official Twitter account. In April 2017, Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor (a BPS-21 officer) posted a tweet 'rejecting' Prime Minister's directives to probe Dawn Leaks controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1396876/pakistan-army-rejects-govt-notification-dawn-leaks/|title=Army rejects PM Office statement on Dawn Leaks report - The Express Tribune|date=2017-04-29|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After huge public outcry over the choice of words, ISPR had to redact its earlier tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1332244|title=Army withdraws tweet 'rejecting' PM Office's directives on Dawn story probe|last=Dawn.com|date=2017-05-10|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, during Allama Khadim Rizvi's Islamabad sit-in a tweet was posted attributing COAS's appeal to 'both sides' to exercise restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2017/11/coas-telephones-pm-suggests-handle-islamabad-dharna-situation-peacefully/|title=COAS suggests PM to handle Islamabad dharna situation peacefully|website=www.samaa.tv|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely decried for equating people's elected government against a mob, further strengthening the belief that Army was behind the sit-ins to arm-twist government.

==Media production==

Since the 1990s, the ISPR has been [[Director (film)|directing]], [[Film producer|producing]], assisting in [[Film writer|writings]], and funding the miniseries, drama, and films on military fiction. Some of its highly acclaimed works include: [[Alpha Bravo Charlie]]— a television series on [[Pakistan Army]] directed by [[Shoaib Mansoor]] in 1990

*[[Shahpar]]— a television drama on [[Pakistan Air Force]] funded by ISPR and broadcast at [[ARY Digital]]
*[[PNS Ghazi (Shaheed)]]— a [[thriller drama]] based on [[Pakistan Navy]] broadcast at [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]]
* [[Waar]]
*[[The Glorious Resolve]]
* ''Sunehre Din''
* ''Wilco''
* ''Revenge''
* "Zinda"
* [[Ek Thi Marium]]

'''Libertarian conservatism''' or '''conservative libertarianism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life, mirroring ''[[laissez faire|laissez-faire]]'' [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], but harnesses this to a belief in a more traditional and conservative social philosophy emphasizing authority and duty.{{sfn|Heywood|2015|p=37}} Libertarian conservatism prioritizes [[liberty]] as its main emphasis, promoting [[free expression]], [[freedom of choice]] and [[free market capitalism]] to achieve [[Social conservatism|socially]] and [[Cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] ends as they reject [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]],&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;J. Richard Piper, ''Ideologies and Institutions: American Conservative and Liberal Governance Prescriptions Since 1933'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u93Mj3A-tH8C&amp;pg=PA110 pp. 110–111], {{ISBN|0847684598}}, {{ISBN|978-0847684595}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the opposite way but not excluding the above, libertarian conservatism could be understood as promoting [[civil society]] through conservative institutions and authority - as family, fatherland, religion, education - in the quest of libertarian ends for less state power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/getting-libertarianism-right Getting Libertarianism Right]. [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]]. {{ISBN|978-1-61016-690-4}}. [[Mises Institute]] Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
For Larry Johnston, in [[political science]], the term "libertarian conservatism" is used to refer to ideologies that combine the advocacy of economic principles such as [[fiscal discipline]], respect for [[contract]]s, defense of [[private property]] and [[free market]]s{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–56}} and the [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservative]] stress on self-help and freedom of choice under a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society with social tenets such as the importance of [[religion]] and the value of [[Religious morality|traditional morality]]{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=154}} through a framework of [[Limited government|limited]], [[Constitutional government|constitutional]], [[representative government]].{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–155}}

For Margaret Randall, libertarian conservatism began as an expression of [[individualism]] and the demand for [[personal freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.|title=The Rise of the City: 1878-1898|publisher=The Academy of Political Science|date=September 1933|orig-year=1st pub. 1933|pages=454–456|chapter=Vol. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randall|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Randall|title=Sandino's Daughters: Testimonies of Nicaraguan Women in Struggle|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=January 14, 2018|orig-year=1st pub. 1995|pages=ii|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate'', edited by George W. Carey, contains essays which describe "the tension between liberty and morality" as "the main fault line dividing the two philosophies".&lt;ref&gt;George W. Carey (Editor), ''Freedom &amp; Virtue: The Conservative Libertarian Debate,'' Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1998. {{ISBN|1-882926-19-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson Hultberg wrote that there is "philosophical common ground" between libertarians and conservatives. "The true conservative movement was, from the start, a blend of political libertarianism, cultural conservatism, and non-interventionism abroad bequeathed to us via the Founding Fathers". He said that such libertarian conservatism was "hijacked" by [[neoconservatism]], "by the very enemies it was formed to fight – [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], [[New Deal]]ers, [[Welfare state|welfarists]], [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]], globalists, interventionists, militarists, nation builders, and all the rest of the collectivist ilk that was assiduously working to destroy the Founders' Republic of States".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Hultberg, [http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html "True Conservatism vs. Neo-Conservatism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820085956/http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html|date=August 20, 2008}}, [http://afr.org "Americans for a Free Republic"] website, December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]] wrote that libertarian conservative [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] believe that the way to limit government is to enforce the [[United States Constitution]]. However, DiLorenzo criticized them by writing: "The fatal flaw in the thinking of the libertarian/conservative constitutionalists stems from their unawareness or willful ignorance of how the founders themselves believed the Constitution could be enforced: by the citizens of the free, independent, and sovereign states, not the federal judiciary". He wrote that the powers accrued to the federal government during the [[American Civil War]] overthrew the Constitution of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo74.html|title=Constitutional Futility|last=DiLorenzo|first=Thomas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], a prominent contributor to the ''[[National Review]]'', called his own combination libertarianism and conservatism as "[[fusionism]]".&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;Edward Feser, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/feser2.html "What Libertarianism Isn't"], [[Lew Rockwell.com]], December 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Raico, [https://mises.org/story/1784 "Is Libertarianism Amoral?"], ''New Individualist Review'', Volume 3, Number 3, Fall 1964, 29–36; republished by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], April 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Lew Rockwell]], [[Murray Rothbard]] and others described their libertarian conservative views as [[paleolibertarianism]].&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rockwell|first1=Lew|title=The Case for Paleo-libertarianism|journal=Liberty|issue=January 1990|pages=34–38|url=http://www.pericles.press/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Liberty_Magazine.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued libertarian opposition to "all forms of government intervention – economic, cultural, social, international", but also upholding cultural conservatism in social thought and behavior. They opposed a licentious libertarianism which advocated "freedom from bourgeois morality, and social authority".&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; Rockwell later stated that they dropped that self-description because people confused it with [[paleoconservatism]], which they rejected.&lt;ref name=lewinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/liberal-post-interview.html|title=Do You Consider Yourself a Libertarian?|last=Johnsson|first=Kenny|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/paleoism.html|title=What I Learned From Paleoism|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn H.|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence M. Vance wrote: "Some libertarians consider libertarianism to be a lifestyle rather than a political philosophy... They apparently don't know the difference between libertarianism and [[libertinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|last=Vance|first=Laurence|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Richard Posner]], [[Richard Epstein]] and [[Albert Jay Nock]] have been described as libertarian conservatives.&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/cultural-thought-ludwig-von-mises-0 Cultural Thought of Ludwig von Mises]. [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]. 1991. Lew Rockwell and Jeffrey Tucker. Mises Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig8/mafaldo1.html|title=The Conservative Case for Ron Paul|last=Mafaldo|first=Lucas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Rand Paul]] have been described as combining libertarian and conservative "[[small government]]" ideas and showing how the Constitution defends the individual and most libertarian views.

In 1975, [[Ronald Reagan]] stated: "I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism". However, some libertarians criticized Reagan for un-libertarian policy positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html "Inside Ronald Reagan"], a ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Feser]] emphasized that libertarianism does not require individuals to reject traditional conservative values. Libertarianism supports the ideas of [[liberty]], [[privacy]] and ending the [[War on drugs|war on marijuana]] at the legal level without changing personal values.&lt;ref name="Feser"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
Libertarian conservatism subscribes to the libertarian idea of [[free market capitalism]], advocating minimal to no government interference in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. A number of libertarian conservatives favor [[Austrian economics]] and are critical of [[fiat money]], with many supporting policies like [[pay what you want]] cafes. Libertarian conservatives also advocate for ways to [[Privatization|privatize]] services run by the government, from airports to toll booths.

{{wiktionary|catchphrase}}

The following is a '''list of political [[catchphrase]]s''', that is, distinctive statements uttered by political figures that have gone on to become well known.

Catchphrases may originate as [[political slogan]]s, as portions of prepared [[speech]]es, or from spontaneous utterances, including [[gaffe]]s.  Most catchphrases are in the form of [[sound bite]]s.

==Argentina==

*"¡Seamos libres, que lo demás no importa nada!" ("Let us be free, for the rest doesn't matter!") – Said in a pre-battle speech in 1817 by General [[José de San Martín]] to his troops just before the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] during the [[Crossing of the Andes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2050">'''Poikilohydry''' is the lack of ability (structural or functional mechanism) to maintain and/or regulate water content to achieve [[homeostasis]] of cells and tissue connected with quick equilibration of cell/tissue water content to that of the environment. Frequently, it is coupled with the capacity to tolerate dehydration to low cell or tissue water content and to recover from it without physiological damage. This condition occurs in such organisms as the [[lichen]]s and [[bryophytes]] that lack mechanisms such as a waterproofing [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] or [[stomata]] that can help resist [[desiccation]].  Poikilohydry also occurs in many forms of [[alga]]e, which may be able to survive desiccation between successive high tides, or during occasional stranding due to the drying of a lake or pond.  Similarly, poikilohydry occurs in land plants which survive environmental conditions when water supplies are seasonal or intermittent, as in the liverwort genus ''[[Targionia (plant)|Targionia]]'', which lives in Mediterranean habitats with hot dry summers.

The term is derived from Ancient Greek ποικίλος (poikílos, “spotted or variegate”). The antonym of poikilohydry is [[homoiohydry]], a suite of morphological adaptations and strategies that enable plants to regulate or achieve homeostasis of cell and tissue water content. The [[vascular plants]] have largely lost the capacity to tolerate dehydration. Aside from most seeds and spores, only about 300 species of vascular plants are desiccation-tolerant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/5/788.full Desiccation Tolerance in Bryophytes: A Reflection of the Primitive Strategy for Plant Survival in Dehydrating Habitats?]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[resurrection plant]]s (such as ''[[Selaginella lepidophylla]]'') and aerophytes (including some species of ''[[Tillandsia]]'').{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''Punk ideologies''' are a group of varied social and political beliefs associated with the [[punk subculture]] and [[punk rock]]. In its original incarnation, the punk subculture originated out of working class angst and the frustrations many youth were feeling about economic inequality and the bourgeois hypocrisy and neglect of working people and their struggles.  It was primarily concerned with concepts such as [[poverty]], [[egalitarianism]], [[humanitarianism]], [[anti-authoritarianism]], [[anti-corporatism]], [[anti-consumerism]], [[anti-war]], [[media culture|anti-media culture]], [[mainstream media|anti-mainstream or mainstream media]], [[anti-intellectualism]], against [[selling out]], [[anti-conservative]],  [[anti-nationalism]], anti-[[corporate greed]], anti-infatuation, against vagrancy laws, [[anti-racism]], anti-[[sexism]], [[gender equality]], [[racial equality]], [[civil rights]], [[animal rights]], [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]], [[social rights]], [[free-thought]] and [[non-conformity]]. One of its main tenets was a rejection of mainstream, corporate [[mass culture]] and its values.  It continued to evolve its ideology as the movement spread throughout North America from its origins in England and New York and embrace a range anti-racist and anti-sexist belief systems. Punk ideologies range from [[left wing]] views (e.g., [[NOFX]]) to [[right wing]] beliefs (e.g., [[No Remorse (band)|No Remorse]]) or [[apolitical]] (e.g., [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]).

Punk ideologies are usually expressed through [[punk rock]] music and lyrics, [[punk literature]] such as amateur [[fanzines]], [[spoken word]] performances or recordings, [[punk fashion]], or [[punk visual art]]. Some punks have participated in [[direct action]], such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, [[ecotage]], street barricades, [[squatting]], [[pirate radio]], [[off-grid energy]], [[vandalism]] and public and business [[property destruction]]. Indirect action through counter-propaganda, [[protest]]s or [[boycott]]s. They support and squat in urban and rural collective house's with held group funds in common. [[Punk fashion]] was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the [[status quo]]. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear clothing or have [[tattoos]] that express sociopolitical messages. They stage Punk Rock Food Drives such as D.O.A's Unity for Freedom. Punk visual art also often includes political messages. Many punks wear second-hand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement.

An attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to [[selling out]], which refers to abandoning of one's values and/or a change in musical style toward [[Pop music|pop]] and embracing anything in mainstream capitalist culture or more radio-friendly [[Rock music|rock]] in exchange for wealth, status, or power. Selling out also has the meaning of adopting a more mainstream lifestyle and ideology. The issue of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is important in the punk subculture—the pejorative term ''[[poseur]]'' is applied to those who associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying values or philosophy.

Because [[anti-establishment]] attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of [[independent record label]]s, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of [[major label]]s. The [[do it yourself]] (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, and photocopying magazines, posters and flyers. The expression [[DIY]] was coined by commentators after the fact.

On religious issues, punk is mostly [[atheism|atheist]] or [[agnosticism|agnostic]], but some punk bands have promoted religions such as [[Christian punk|Christianity]], [[Buddhism]],  [[Taqwacore|Islam]], the [[Rastafari movement]] or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna]].

==Specific ideologies and philosophies==
The following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).

===Anarchism===
{{Main|Anarcho-punk}}
[[File:Punk Occupy Pittsburgh protestors (6262172208).jpg|thumb|right|170px|A punk protester carries a sign including an anarchy symbol.]]
There is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to anarchism as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed "peace punks" or "[[anarcho-punk]]s." While some well-known punk bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Exploited]] had songs about [[anarchy]], notably the Pistols' ''[[Anarchy in the UK]]'', they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, these bands are not considered part of the anarcho-punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;Glasper, Ian (2006), ''The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980 to 1984'', Cherry Red publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-901447-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-punks typically believe in [[direct action]]. Many anarcho-punks are [[pacifism|pacifists]] (e.g. Crass and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, [[squatting]], [[graffiti]], [[culture jamming]], [[ecotage]], [[freeganism]], [[boycott]]ing, [[civil disobedience]], [[hacktivism]] and [[subvertising]]. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]). This manifests itself as [[riot]]ing, [[vandalism]], wire cutting, [[Hunt saboteur|hunt sabotage]], participation in [[Animal Liberation Front]]- or [[Earth Liberation Front]]-style activities, and in extreme cases, bombings. Notable anarchist punk artists include: [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Dave Insurgent]], [[Crass]], [[Subhumans (British band)]], [[Colin Jerwood]], and [[Dave Dictor]].

===Animal rights and veganism===
In the 1980s, both [[straight edge]] hardcore punk in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helton|first=Jesse J.|last2=Staudenmeier|first2=William J.|year=2002|title=Re-imagining being 'straight' in straight edge|journal=Contemporary Drug Problems|volume=29|issue=2|page=465|issn=0091-4509|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert T.|title=Nailed to the X: A Lyrical History of Straightedge|journal=Journal of Youth Studies|year=1999|volume=2|issue=2|pages=133–151|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/13676261.1999.10593032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="descartes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/len-tilburger-and-chris-p-kale-nailing-descartes-to-the-wall-animal-rights-veganism-and-punk-cu|last1=Tilbürger|first1=Len|last2=Kale|first2=Chris P|title="Nailing Descartes to the Wall": Animal Rights, Veganism and Punk Culture|publisher=Active Distribution|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; became associated with [[animal rights]]. Consequently, [[vegetarianism]] and [[veganism]] became a feature of the punk subculture.&lt;ref name="descartes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haenfler|first=Ross|title=Straight Edge: Hardcore Punk, Clean Living Youth, and Social Change|year=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-3851-3|ref=harv|page=53 and 427–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as [[Fluff Fest]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="sober"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=YWb7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sober Living for the Revolution: Hardcore Punk, Straight Edge, and Radical Politics|page=137|last=Kuhn|first=Gabriel|publisher=PM Press|date=2010|isbn=1604860510|author-link=Gabriel_Kuhn|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bandcamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://daily.bandcamp.com/2017/09/20/czech-diy-list/|title=The Sincere and Vibrant World of the Czech DIY Scene|publisher=Bandcamp|first=Jacopo|last=Sanna|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apoliticism===
Some punks claim to be non-political, such as the band [[Charged GBH]] and the singer [[G.G. Allin]], although some socio-political ideas have appeared in their lyrics. Some Charged GBH songs have discussed social issues, and a few have expressed anti-war views. G.G. Allin expressed a vague desire to kill the United States president and destroy the political system in his song "Violence Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |title=The GG Allin SuperSite Lyrics - Violence Now - Assassinate The President |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027094628/http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punk subgenres that are generally apolitical include: [[glam punk]], [[psychobilly]], [[horror punk]], [[punk pathetique]], [[deathrock]] and [[pop punk]]. Many of the bands credited with starting the punk movement were decidedly apolitical, including [[The Dictators]], [[Ramones]] (which featured staunch [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Johnny Ramone]] alongside [[liberalism|liberal]] activist [[Joey Ramone]]), [[New York Dolls]], [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Johnny Thunders &amp; The Heartbreakers]], and [[Richard Hell &amp; The Voidoids]].

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian punk}}
[[Christian punk]] is a subgenre of punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Some Christian punk bands are associated with the [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian music industry]],&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/christian-punk-ma0000002639/artists|title=Christian Punk Music Artists - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others reject that association. Ideologies within Christian punk vary, though a number of bands lean towards traditional left-wing politics, most prominently [[Crashdog]], [[Ballydowse]] and [[The Psalters]], the latter two of whom identified as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bramboniusinenglish.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/the-lost-psalters-interview-from-august-11-kortrijk/ |title=The Lost Psalters Interview |date=March 14, 2012 |publisher=Brambonius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://londoncelticpunks.wordpress.com/tag/ballydowse/ |title=Tribute to Ballydowse |publisher=London Celtic Punks Web-Zine |date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of notable Christian punk bands include [[Altar Boys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/altar-boys-mn0000793617/biography |title=Altar Boys |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Crucified]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-crucified-mn0000135837|title=The Crucified - Biography, Albums, Streaming Links - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Five Iron Frenzy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/five-iron-frenzy-mn0000178494 |title=Five Iron Frenzy |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flatfoot 56]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/flatfoot-56-mn0000921885 |title=Flatfoot 56 |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pop-punk band [[MxPx]], who earned a [[Music recording certification|gold record]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mxpx-mn0000521851 |title=MxPx |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservatism ===
{{see also|Conservative Punk}}
A small number are [[Conservatism|conservative]], rejecting leftist-[[anarchism]], [[liberalism]], [[communism]] and [[socialism]] in favor of conservatism. Notable conservative punks include [[Johnny Ramone]], [[Forgotten Rebels]], [[Billy Zoom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markprindle.com/zoom-i.htm |title=Billy Zoom interview |publisher=Markprindle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Escalante]], [[Bobby Steele]], [[Duane Peters]] and [[Dave Smalley]]. Some [[Christian punk]] and hardcore bands have [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political stances, in particular some of the [[New York hardcore|NYHC]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McPheeters |first=Sam |url=https://www.vice.com/read/survival-of-the-streets-137-v16n9 |title=Survival Of The Streets &amp;#124; VICE United States |publisher=Vice.com |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hare Krishna===
{{Further|Krishnacore}}
The Filipino punk band the [[Krishnacore|Wuds]] which was formed in the early 1980s is the first known punk band who composed songs dedicated to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wuds-mn0001790200&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some notable members of the [[New York hardcore]] scene, including [[Ray Cappo]] ([[Youth of Today]], [[Shelter (band)|Shelter]] and other bands), [[John Joseph (rock singer)|John Joseph]] ([[Cro-Mags]]) and [[Harley Flanagan]] (Cro-Mags) converted to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823161134/http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661|date=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to trend within the western hardcore scene that became known as Krishnacore.

===Islam===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[Taqwacore]] is a punk subgenre centred on [[Islam]], its culture and its interpretation. The Taqwacore scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the United States and other western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam. There is no definitive Taqwacore sound, and some bands incorporate styles including hip-hop, techno, and/or musical traditions from the Muslim world. Examples of Muslim punk bands include [[Alien Kulture]], [[The Kominas]] and [[Secret Trial Five]].

===Liberalism===
[[Liberalism|Liberal]] punks were in the punk subculture from the beginning, and are mostly on the [[social liberalism|liberal left]]. Notable liberal punks (second wave, mid-1990s to 2000s) include: [[Joey Ramone]], [[Fat Mike]] of [[NOFX]], [[Ted Leo]], [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] of [[Green Day]], [[Crashdog]],  [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], [[Jared Gomes]] of [[Hed PE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035243/http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Latest-hed-p-e-album-has-plenty-of-messages-116661.php|title=Latest (hed) p.e. album has plenty of messages|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/interviews/1025867/hedp-e|title=(Hed)p.e - Interviews - Killyourstereo.com|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218034734/http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Armstrong]] of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[Tim McIlrath]] of [[Rise Against]]. Some punks participated in the [[Rock Against Bush]] movement in the mid-2000s, in support of the Democratic Party candidate [[John Kerry]].

===Libertarianism===
Libertarian punks advocate [[free market]] [[capitalism]], a [[Night-watchman state|minimal government]] and private ownership of property. Joe Young of the band [[Antiseen]],&lt;ref name=slug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slugmag.com/articles/106/ANTiSEEN.html |title=SLUG Magazine &amp;#124; ANTiSEEN |publisher=Slugmag.com |date=2004-09-29 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exene Cervenka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/24-7/2012/10/13/punk-icon-exene-cervenka-endorses-gary-j |title=Punk Icon Exene Cervenka Endorses Gary Johnson - Reason 24/7 |publisher=Reason.com |date=2012-10-13 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mojo Nixon]] have expressed support for libertarianism. Though originally a conservative,  [[Michale Graves]] has shifted towards libertarianism in recent years.

===Neo-Nazism===
{{Main|Nazi punk|White power rock|Rock Against Communism}}
[[Nazi punk]]s have a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] ideology that is closely related to that of [[white power skinhead]]s. [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]] and his band [[Skrewdriver]] are credited with popularizing [[white power rock]] and [[hatecore]] (for its hateful lyrical themes), or [[Rock Against Communism]]. Nazi punks are different from early punks such as [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]], who are believed to have incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika]]s for shock or comedy value.

===Nihilism===
Centering on a belief in the abject lack of meaning and value to life, [[nihilism]] was a fixture in some early punk rock and [[protopunk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/interview-with-simon-critchley/|title=Nihilism, Punk and the International Necronautical Society: an interview with Simon Critchley -|date=30 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sex Pistols]] were central to the association of punk and nihilsm, with the ''Trouser Press Record Guide'' writing that their "confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio-political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands."&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Ira, "Sex Pistols", in ''The Trouser Press Record Guide'', 4th ed., ed. Ira Robbins, p.585, Collier, 1991. {{ISBN|0-02-036361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, researcher Neil Eriksen argues that though "much of the critical realism [of punk rock] expresses cynicism and nihilism, it does serve to question existing relations in such a way that listeners are forced to think about what is being said",&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/periodicals/theoretical-review/19801802.htm|title=Popular Culture and Revolutionary Theory: Understanding Punk Rock|first=|last=EROL|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that overt rejection of meaning is primarily concerned with challenging existing values.

=== Situationism ===
[[File:DUST Flyer.jpg|thumb|Flyer for DUST happening circa. 1992]]
The [[Situationist International]] (SI) was an early influence on punk subculture in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989"&gt;Marcus, Greil, Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, Harvard University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-571-23228-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Started in continental Europe in the 1950s, the SI was an avant-garde political movement that sought to recapture the ideals of surrealist art and use them to construct new and radical social situations. [[Malcolm McLaren]] introduced situationist ideas to punk through his management of the band [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989" /&gt; [[Vivienne Westwood]], McLaren's partner and the band's designer/stylist, expressed situationist ideals through fashion that was intended to provoke a specific social response. 15% Pus and DUST, subversive 1990s Manchester bands, staged psycho-geographic walks around [[Hulme]] and created human collages from road signs as part of what became known as 'psycho-spectre.' [[Jamie Reid]]'s distinctive album cover artwork was openly situationist.

===Socialism===
[[The Clash]] were a blatantly political punk rock band, introducing [[socialism]] to the punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yfMIaUCBTWMC&amp;pg=PA47 Ensminger, David, ''Left of the Dial: Conversations with Punk Icons'' (Oakland, CA: PM Press) p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qfACzulTwIC&amp;pg=PT327 |title=Seventies Unplugged - Gerard DeGroot - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]] said of his socialist views "I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and 'I'm alright jack' and all those asshole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That's where I'm from and there's where I've made my decisions from. That's why I believe in socialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salewicz|first1=Chris|title=Redemption Song: The Ballad of Joe Strummer|date=May 13, 2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0865479821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the original [[Oi!]] bands expressed a rough form of socialist [[working class]] [[populism]] — often mixed with [[patriotism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

In the 1980s, several notable British socialist punk musicians were involved with [[Red Wedge]]. Notable socialist punks include: [[Attila the Stockbroker]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Bruce La Bruce]], [[Garry Bushell]] (until the late 1980s), [[The Redskins|Chris Dean]], [[The Dicks|Gary Floyd]], [[Jack Grisham]], [[Stewart Home]], [[Dennis Lyxzén]], [[Angelic Upstarts|Thomas Mensforth]], [[Fermin Muguruza]], [[Boikot|Alberto Pla]], [[Tom Robinson (musician)|Tom Robinson]], [[Seething Wells]], [[The Men They Couldn't Hang|Paul Simmonds]], [[Rob Tyner]], Joe Strummer, [[Ian Svenonius]], [[Mark Steel]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] (guitarist for British powerhouse, new wave band, The Jam). Neil Eriksen wrote in 1980: "... we feel that elements of punk rock fulfill a revolutionary cultural function".&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt;

[[Bernie Sanders]], a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] running for [[president of the United States]] in 2016, was endorsed by various bands and musicians including [[Jello Biafra]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]], [[Mike Watt]], [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], [[Keith Morris]], [[Cheetah Chrome]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Belinda Carlisle]] and [[Pussy Riot]] among others. In April 2016, a [[Richmond, VA]] artist named Mickael Broth, created a large mural of a Sanders which was inspired by a classic [[Circle Jerks]]   logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.styleweekly.com/Studi/archives/2016/04/05/punk-rock-bernie-sanders-mural-goes-up-on-broad-street|title=Punk Rock Bernie Sanders Mural Goes Up on Broad Street|first=Brent|last=Baldwin|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders has also been credited as having a major impact on the east coast punk scene in the United States. In the early 1980s as mayor of [[Burlington, VT]], Sanders fought a government ban on live music and had a major goal of building a youth center. That center became [[242 Main Street]], which is currently one of the United States longest running all-ages youth-run DIY punk venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/how-bernie-sanders-242-main-street-shaped-the-northeast-punk-scene-515|title=How Bernie Sanders Shaped the Northeast Punk Scene|website=Vice|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Straight edge===
{{Main|Straight edge|Hardline (subculture)}}
[[Straight edge]], which originated in the [[Washington DC]] hardcore punk scene with [[Minor Threat]] song "Straight Edge" written by frontman [[Ian MacKaye]] and guitarist Brian Baker. Straight edge involves abstaining from [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and [[recreational drug use]]. Some who claim the title straight edge also abstain from [[caffeine]], casual sex and meat. (Although the Washington DC straight-edge scene exhibited a fierce allegiance for Coca-Cola, with supporters rarely, if ever, seen drinking anything else in public.) Those more strict individuals may be considered part of the [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline subculture]]. Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. MacKaye has often spoken out against others labeling themselves as being Straight edge, which was never his intentions for it being a label but it became a movement one in which he became annoyed with. Notable straight edgers: [[Tim McIlrath]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Davey Havok]].

==Criticism of punk ideologies==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Punk ideologies have been criticized from outside and within. [[The Clash]] occasionally accused other contemporary punk acts of selling out, such as in their songs "[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]" and "[[London Calling|Death or Glory]]". [[Crass]]'s song "White Punks on Hope" criticized the late-1970s British punk scene in general and, among other things, accused [[Joe Strummer]] of selling out and betraying his earlier socialist principles. Their song "Punk is Dead" attacked corporate [[Recuperation (sociology)|co-option]] of the [[punk subculture]]. [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman [[Jello Biafra]] wrote many songs, such as '' [[Nazi Punks Fuck Off]]'', criticizing aspects of the punk subculture:  ''"Punk ain't no religious cult
Punk means thinking for yourself
You ain't hardcore cos you spike your hair...''

[[Misfits (band)|Misfit]] frontman [[Michale Graves]], who cofounded the [[Conservative Punk]] website, argued that punks have become "[[hippie]]s with [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]]". However, he has since distanced himself from conservatism.

Author [[Jim Goad]] has been very critical of punk ideologies in many of his writings. In his essay "The Underground is A Lie!", Goad argued that many punks are hypocrites, and he claimed that many punks act poor while hiding the fact they come from [[middle class|middle]] to [[upper class]] backgrounds. In ''Farts from Underground'', Goad claimed that the [[DIY ethic]] never produces anything original, and it allows poor quality work to be championed.

In their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', [[Joseph Heath]] and [[Andrew Potter]] argued that [[counterculture]] politics have failed, and that the punk understanding of society is flawed. They also argued that alternative and mainstream lifestyles ultimately have the same values.

The '''Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science''' ('''RSMAS''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|z|.|m|ə|s}}) is a academic and research institution for the study of [[oceanography]] and the [[atmospheric sciences]] within the [[University of Miami]] (UM). It is located on a 16 [[acre]] (65,000 m²) campus on [[Virginia Key]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]]. It is the only subtropical applied and basic marine and atmospheric research institute in the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underwatertimes.com/ref/ref.php|title=The Reference Desk|accessdate=February 18, 2010|publisher=UnderwaterTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marinesciencetoday.com/2009/07/17/university-roundup-rosentstiel-school-of-marine-and-atmospheric-science-at-the-university-of-miami/|publisher=Marine Science Today|title=University Roundup: Rosentstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami|accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until 2008, RSMAS was solely a [[graduate school]] within the University of Miami, while it jointly administrated an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate program]] with UM's College of Arts and Sciences. In 2008, the Rosenstiel School has taken over administrative responsibilities for the undergraduate program, granting Bachelor of Science in Marine and Atmospheric Science (BSMAS) and Bachelor of Arts in Marine Affairs (BAMA) [[baccalaureate degree]]. [[master's degree|Master's]], including a Master of [[First professional degree|Professional]] Science degree, and  [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorates]] are also awarded to RSMAS students by the UM Graduate School.&lt;ref name=mps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mps.rsmas.miami.edu/|title=Master of Professional Science - Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science - University of Miami|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.edu/gs/index.php/graduate_school/about_us/message_from_the_dean/|title=Message from the Dean {{!}} Graduate School {{!}} University of Miami|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=2011-02-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720000147/http://www.miami.edu/gs/index.php/graduate_school/about_us/message_from_the_dean/|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rosenstiel School's research includes the [[marine biology|study of marine life]], particularly ''[[Aplysia]]'' and [[coral]]; [[climate change]]; air-sea interactions; [[coastal ecology]]; and [[admiralty law]]. The school operates a marine research laboratory ship, and has a research site at an inland [[sinkhole]]. Research also includes the use of data from weather satellites and the school operates its own satellite downlink facility.

==History==
[[Image:Rosenstiel Entrance Plate.jpg|thumb|left|The sign near the entrance to RSMAS.]]

In 1940, University of Miami President Bowman Ashe recruited [[F.G. Walton Smith]], a young British marine biologist who was working in the Bahamas. Smith joined the Department of Zoology, and began organizing the development of a marine laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|title=The History of the Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=April 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525183106/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|archive-date=2011-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the Board of Trustees of the University of Miami established the Marine Laboratory for the University.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; They invited researchers and oceanographers to associate themselves with this laboratory. Its three original objectives were teaching, basic research, and applied marine research. The laboratory focused on subjects specific to the tropical environment. Initially, the Marine Lab was located in a private boathouse on an estate on Belle Isle in [[Miami Beach, Florida]]. In 1945, when the boathouse became structurally unsafe, the lab moved to a converted apartment building in [[Coral Gables, Florida]] near the main campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|title=The History of the Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science|first=Jean|last=Yehle|work=www.rsmas.miami.edu|accessdate=2011-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525183106/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|archive-date=2011-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, a delegation from [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] prompted the [[Florida State Legislature]] to support the development of a state Marine Laboratory in conjunction with the UM lab. It reported to the [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission|State Board of Conservation]], which had no marine research facility and little budget of its own at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AGQpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KMgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3195,6215129&amp;dq=florida+marine+laboratory&amp;hl=en|title=State Adds $25,000 in Tide Fight|work=Daytona Beach Morning Journal |date=January 27, 1954|page=5|quote=The Legislature appropriated $80,000 per year for research work and specified that it be paid from shell revenues.|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship lasted for 12 years until the state of Florida built the board a lab in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]. In 1953, the School's classrooms and laboratories were built at the current Virginia Key location. It was renamed the Institute of Marine Science in 1961,&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|title=Dorothy H. and Lewis Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science|url=http://www6.miami.edu/umbulletin/und/marine/index.htm|accessdate=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became part of the University of Miami's School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Semiannual Status Report NASA GRANT NGR-10-007-010|date=October 31, 1966|url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670082520_1967082520.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the institution was made into an independent school and named to honor [[Lewis Rosenstiel|Lewis and Dorothy Rosenstiel]] after a major contribution from the Rosenstiel's foundation to support progress in atmospheric and marine sciences. In 1977, the school began a joint undergraduate program with Miami's College of Arts &amp; Sciences.&lt;ref name=msc/&gt; The school bought Research vessels and built more facilities to further research projects. From 2003 to 2008, the school operated the Pew Institute for Ocean Science as a joint venture with the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]], and in 2008, the program relocated to [[SUNY at Stony Brook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aafcseafood.org/Documents/conquest_of_the_ocean.pdf|title=Conquest of the Ocean|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stony Brook Southampton Broadens Scope With Ocean Conservation Institute|url=http://www.hamptons.com/detail.php?articleID=4646|first=Kelly |last=Carroll|work=hamptons.com|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, RSMAS took over administrative functions of the University of Miami's undergraduate Marine Science, Marine Affairs, and Meteorology programs.&lt;ref name="msc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/pressreleases/20080820-rsmas.html|title=University of Miami&amp;rsquo;s Rosenstiel School Prepares to Launch Historic Academic Year|accessdate=October 17, 2008|date=August 20, 2008|publisher=University of Miami|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122033210/http://rsmas.miami.edu/pressreleases/20080820-rsmas.html|archive-date=2008-11-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.miami.edu/umbulletin/pdf/RSMASGrad201011.pdf|title=Dorothy H. and Lewis Rosentiel School Of Marine And Atmospheric Science - Graduate|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2008, RSMAS's library merged with the central University of Miami Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/2008_Annual_Report.pdf|title=2008 Rosenstiel Annual Report|page=1|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=February 2, 2011|archivedate=July 23, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723105857/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/2008_Annual_Report.pdf|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, RSMAS started unique a one-year Master of Professional Science degree program aimed at students planning non-research careers in business, government, or non-profit organizations.&lt;ref name=mps /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mps.rsmas.miami.edu/about/|title=About the Program|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3247">The '''sacrifice of the intellect''' (''sacrificium intellectus'', sometimes rendered in Italian, ''sacrifizio dell'intelletto'') is a concept associated with [[Christian]] devotion, particularly with the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] order. It was the "third sacrifice" demanded by the founder of the Jesuits, [[St. Ignatius Loyola]], who required

&lt;blockquote&gt;besides entire outward submission to command, also the complete identification of the inferior's will with that of the superior . [Loyola] lays down that the superior is to be obeyed simply as such and as standing in the place of God, without reference to his personal wisdom, [[piety]] or discretion; that any obedience which falls short of making the superior's will one's own, in inward affection as well as in outward effect, is lax and imperfect; that going beyond the letter of command, even in things abstractly good and praise-worthy, is disobedience, and that the "sacrifice of the [[intellect]]" is the third and highest grade of obedience, well pleasing to God, when the inferior not only wills what the superior wills, but thinks what he thinks, submitting his judgment, so far as it is possible for the will to influence and lead the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th edition, "JESUIT". [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/JEE_JUN/JESUITS.html Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept was taken up in a more individualistic sense by the [[Jansenist]] thinker [[Blaise Pascal]], and particularly by the [[existentialist]] thinker [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who thought that the act of faith requires a leap into the void, which amounts to a sacrifice of the intellect and reason.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kierkegaard, ''Fear and Trembling.'' (Copenhagen: 1843)&lt;/ref&gt; This was quintessentially expressed in the traditional dictum, ''[[credo quia absurdum]]'', "I believe because it is absurd." This view of faith is rejected by the [[Catholic church]], which regards [[reason]] as a path towards direct knowledge of God.&lt;ref&gt;See St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], ''[[Summa Theologica]]''; Pope [[John Paul II]], [[encyclical]] ''[[Fides et ratio]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is often used in a pejorative sense in writings on the [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] of [[religion]] - e.g.:

*[[Max Weber]] states: "There is absolutely no 'unbroken' religion working as a vital force, which is not compelled at ''some'' point to demand the ''credo non quod, sed credo quia absurdum'' - the "sacrifice of the intellect.""&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, "World Rejection and Theodicy", ch.8. See H.H. Gerth and C.W. Mills, ''From Max Weber: essays in sociology'' (1948, 2002), p.352&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to [[Paul Pruyser]], "Sacrifice of the intellect, demanded by a good many religious movements and blithely if not joyously made by a good many religious persons, is surely one of the ominous features of neurotic religion."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Pruyser, "The Seamy Side of Current Religious Beliefs," in H. Newton Maloney &amp; Bernard Spilka, eds. ''Religion in Psychodynamic Perspective: The Contributions of Paul Pruyser'' (Oxford 1991): 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scale factor''' is used in [[computer science]] when a real world set of numbers needs to be represented on a different scale in order to fit a specific [[Computer numbering formats|number format]]. For instance, a 16 bit [[signedness|unsigned]] [[integer]] (''uint16'') can only hold a value as large as 65,535&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. If uint16's are to be used to represent values from 0 to 131,070&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, then a scale factor of 1/2 would be introduced. Notice that while the scale factor extends the range, it also decreases the [[Precision (computer science)|precision]]. In this example, for instance, the number 3 could not be represented because a stored ''1'' represents a real world 2, and a stored ''2'' represents a real world 4.

==Uses==
Certain number formats may be chosen for an application for convenience in programming, or because of certain advantages offered by the hardware for that number format. For instance, early processors did not natively support the [[IEEE]] [[Floating_point|floating point standard]] for representing fractional values, so integers were used to store representations of the real world values by applying a scale factor to the real value. By necessity, this was done in [[software]], since the hardware did not support fractional value.

==Operations on Scaled Values==
Once the scaled representation of a real value is stored, the scaling can '''''often''''' be ignored until the value needs to come back into the "real world". For instance, adding two scaled values is just as valid as unscaling the values, adding the real values, and then scaling the result, and the former is much easier and faster. For other operations, however, the scaling is very important.

Multiplication, for instance, needs to take account of the fact that both numbers are scaled. As an example, consider two real world values ''A'' and ''B''. The real world multiplication of these real world values is:
&lt;pre&gt;A * B = P
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now suppose we're storing the values with a scale factor of ''Z''. If we simply multiply the stored representations we'll get the following:
&lt;pre&gt;AZ * BZ = Q
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note how ''AZ'' is the scaled real world value of ''A'' or simply the product of ''A * Z'', and likewise, ''BZ'' is the scaled representation of ''B''. Also note that we didn't write ''PZ'' as the answer, the reason is simple: PZ is ''not'' the answer. You can see this by rearranging the statement, where each line in the following is equivalent:
&lt;pre&gt;AZ * BZ = Q
A * Z * B * Z = Q
(A * B) * Z * Z = Q
P * Z * Z = Q
PZ * Z = Q
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note how we substituted ''P'' for ''A * B'' on line 4. You can now see that the result of ''AZ * BZ'' (which is ''Q'') is NOT ''PZ'', it's ''PZ * Z''. If ''PZ'' '''''were''''' the answer, we could simply store it directly, since it has the scale factor built in, as is the case with addition and subtraction. For multiplication, however, you can see that the product of two scaled values has an extra scaling built in. As long as this is taken into account, there's still no need to convert ''AZ'' and ''BZ'' into ''A'' and ''B'' before performing the operation, you just need to divide the result by ''Z'' before storing it back. You will then have ''PZ'' stored as the result of the multiplication, which is fine because you weren't storing the result of ''AZ * BZ'', you were storing the scaled representation of the result of ''A * B''.

==Common Scaling Scenarios==
===Fractional Values Scaled to Integers===
As already mentioned, many older processors (and possibly some current ones) do not natively support fractional mathematics. In this case, fractional values can be scaled into integers by multiplying them by ten to the power of whatever decimal precision you want to retain. In other words, if you want to preserve ''n'' digits to the right of the decimal point, you need to multiply the entire number by 10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. (Or if you're working in binary and you want to save ''m'' digits to the right of the [[binary point]], then you would multiply the number by 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, or alternately, [[bit shift]] the value ''m'' places to the left). For example, consider the following set of real world fractional values:
&lt;pre&gt;15.400, 0.133, 4.650, 1.000, 8.001
&lt;/pre&gt;
Notice how they all have ''3'' digits to the right of the decimal place. If we want to save all of that information (in other words, not lose any [[Precision (computer science)|precision]]), we need to multiply these numbers by 10&lt;sup&gt;''3''&lt;/sup&gt;, or 1,000, giving us integer values of:
&lt;pre&gt;15400, 133, 4650, 1000, 8001
&lt;/pre&gt;
(also note that these numbers cannot be stored in 8bit integers, it will require at least 14 bits, or, more realistically, 16.)

===Integer values to Fractional===
Certain processors, particularly [[Digital signal processor|DSPs]] common in the [[embedded system]] industry, have built in support for the [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] arithmetic, such as [[Q (number format)|Q]] and [[IQ (number format)|IQ]] formats.

Since the fractional part of a number takes up some bits in the field, the range of values possible in a fixed point value is less than the same number of bits would provide to an integer. For instance, in an 8 bit field, an unsigned integer can store values from &lt;nowiki&gt;[0, 255]&lt;/nowiki&gt; but an unsigned fixed point with 5 fractional bits only has 3 bits left over for the integer value, and so can only store integer values from &lt;nowiki&gt;[0, 7]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (note that the ''number'' of values that the two fields can store is the same, 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 256, because the fixed point field can also store 32 fractional values for each integer value). It is therefore common that a scaling factor is used to store real world values that may be larger than the maximum value of the fixed point format.

As an example, assume we are using an unsigned 8 bit fixed point format with 4 fractional bits, and 4 integer bits. As mentioned, the highest integer value it can store is 15, and the highest mixed value it can store is 15.9375 (0xF.F or 1111.1111&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;). If the real world values we want to manipulate are in the range [0,160], we need to scale these values in order to get them into fixed point. Note that we ''can not'' use a scale factor of 1/10 here because scaling 160 by 1/10 gives us 16, which is greater than the greatest value we can store in our fixed point format. 1/11 will work as a scale factor, however, because 160/11 = 14.5454... which fits in our range. Let's use this scale factor to convert the following real world values into scaled representations:
&lt;pre&gt;154, 101, 54, 3, 0, 160
&lt;/pre&gt;
Scaling these with the scale factor (1/11) gives us the following values:
&lt;pre&gt;154/11 = 14
101/11 = 9.1818...
54/11 = 4.9090...
3/11 = 0.2727...
0/11 = 0
160/11 = 14.5454...
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note however, that many of these values have been truncated because they contain repeating fractions. When we try to store these in our fixed point format, we're going to lose some of our precision (which didn't seem all that precise when they were just integers). This is an interesting problem because we said we could fit 256 different values into our 8 bit format, and we're only trying to store values from a range with 161 possible values (0 through 160). As it turns out, the problem was our scale factor, 11, which introduced unnecessary precision requirements. The resolution of the problem is to find a better scaling factor. For more information, [[#Picking a Scale Factor|read on]].

==Picking a Scale Factor==
An example above illustrated how certain scale factors can cause unnecessary precision loss. We will revisit this example to further explore the situation.

We're storing representations of real data in 8 bit unsigned fixed point fields with 4 integer bits and 4 fractional bits. This gives us a range of &lt;nowiki&gt;[0, 15.9375]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in decimal, or &lt;nowiki&gt;[0x0.0, 0xF.F]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in [[hexadecimal|hex]]. Our real world data is all integers and in the range [0, 160] in decimal. Note that there are only 161 unique values that we may want to store, so our 8 bit field should be plenty, since 8 bits can have 256 unique configurations.

In the example given [[#Integer values to Fractional|above]], we picked a scale factor of 11 so that all the numbers would be small enough to fit in the range. However, when we began scaling the following real world data:
&lt;pre&gt;154, 101, 54, 3, 0, 160
&lt;/pre&gt;
We discovered that the precision of these fractions is going to be a problem. The following box illustrates this showing the original data, its scaled decimal values, and the binary equivalent of the scaled value.
&lt;pre&gt;154/11 = 14 = 1110.0
101/11 = 9.1818... = 1001.00101110...
54/11 = 4.9090... = 100.111010...
3/11 = 0.2727... = 0.010010...
0/11 = 0 = 0.0
160/11 = 14.5454... = 1110.10010...
&lt;/pre&gt;
Notice how several of the binary fractions require more than the 4 fractional bits provided by our fixed point format. To fit them into our fields, we would simply truncate the remaining bits, giving us the following stored representations:
&lt;pre&gt;1110.0000
1001.0010
0100.1110
0000.0100
0000.0000
1110.1001
&lt;/pre&gt;
Or in decimal:
&lt;pre&gt;14.0
9.125
4.875
0.25
0.0
14.5625
&lt;/pre&gt;
And when we need to bring them back into the real world, we need to divide by our scale factor, 1/11, giving the following "real world" values:
&lt;pre&gt;154.0
100.375
53.625
2.75
0
160.1875
&lt;/pre&gt;
Notice how they've changed? For one thing, they aren't all integers anymore, immediately indicating that an error was introduced in the storage, due to a poor choice of scaling factor.

===Picking a better Scale Factor===
Most [[data set]]s will not have a perfect scale factor; you will probably always get some error introduced by the scaling process. However it certainly may be possible to pick a better scaling factor. For one thing, note that dividing a number by a power of two is the same as shifting all the bits to the right once for each power of two. (It's the same thing in decimal, when you divide by 10, you shift all the decimal digits one place to the right, when you divide by 100, you shift them all two places to the right). The pattern of bits doesn't change, it just moves. On the other hand, when you divide by a number that is NOT an integer power of 2, you are changing the bit pattern. This is likely to produce a bit pattern with even more bits to the right of the binary point, artificially introducing required precision. Therefore, it is almost always preferable to use a scale factor that is a power of two. You may still lose bits that get shifted right off the end of the field, but at least you won't be introducing ''new'' bits that will be shifted off the end.

To illustrate the use of powers of two in the scale factor, let's use a factor of 1/16 with the above data set. The binary value for our original data set is given below:
&lt;pre&gt;154 = 1001 1010
101 = 0110 0101
54 =  0011 0110
3 =   0000 0011
0 =   0000 0000
160 = 1010 0000
&lt;/pre&gt;
As we already knew, they all fit in 8 bits. Scaling these by 1/16 is the same as dividing by 16, which is the same as shifting the bits 4 places to the right. All that really means is inserting a binary point between the first four and last four bits of each number. Conveniently, that's the exact format of our fixed point fields. So just as we suspected, since all these numbers don't require more than 8 bits to represent them as integers, it doesn't have to take more than 8 bits to scale them down and fit them in a fixed point format.

The '''Sea Mammal Research Unit''' (SMRU) is a [[marine science]] research organisation in [[Fife]], Scotland. It provides the UK's main science capability in the field of [[marine mammal]] biology. It is located at the [[Gatty Marine Laboratory]], part of the [[University of St Andrews]]. It was established in 1978, when the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] merged its Seals Research Division and Whale Research Unit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smru.st-andrews.ac.uk/documents/SMRU_Scientific_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

SMRU's current strategic science priorities include evaluating the status of marine mammal populations; investigating the importance of marine mammals as components of [[marine ecosystem]]s; determining the dynamics of marine mammal populations; studying marine mammal social structure and communication; providing the technological basis for observing free-ranging marine mammals and their environment. SMRU also uses the popularity of marine mammals to improve public knowledge about the [[marine environment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smru.st-andrews.ac.uk/pageset.aspx?psr=408&lt;/ref&gt;

SMRU's activities address the requirements for information about marine mammals identified in the UK and Scottish Sustainable Development and Biodiversity Strategies and the Strategy for Scotland’s Coast and Inshore Waters. It is also relevant to the Joint UK Response to the Review of Marine Nature Conservation, the EU Marine Strategy and the UK Small Cetacean Bycatch Response Strategy.

SMRU is an independent NERC collaborative centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/collaborative/smru.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The funding it receives from NERC is mainly to support the [[Conservation of Seals Act 1970]]. SMRU focuses over half of its research effort on [[cetaceans]]. In agreement with NERC, SMRU raises the remainder of its funding from other sources. These include the [[European Union]], [[Defra]], [[Scottish Government]] and UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. It also develops and supplies instrumentation to the science community.

SMRU Consulting Ltd (Europe)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smruconsulting.com/&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 2006 as the commercial arm of the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St Andrews and provides consultancy services and advice on marine environmental issues. They have offices in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific.

Notable SMRU Consulting projects includes Marine Mammal Mitigation on the world's first commercial tidal device at Strangford Loch&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seageneration.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of PAMBuoy, now Decimus - run by St Andrews Instrumentation Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sa-instrumentation.com//&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1st June 2016, a dead Minke whale washed ashore on the West Sands beach of St. Andrews, near to the SMRU, and was discovered by a dog walker that evening. During low-tide on the 2nd June, staff and students from the SMRU, along with the Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Scheme, jointly conducted a necropsy of the whale in view of the public. Noting signature abrasions on the tailstock, and excessive fluid in the lungs, they concluded that the animal had been caught in a fishing trawler's lines, and was drowned by the dragging.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Strandings/posts/1015236731900447&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary treatment''' is a treatment process for [[wastewater]] (or [[sewage]]) to achieve a certain degree of effluent quality by using a [[sewage treatment plant]] with physical phase separation to remove [[settleable solids]] and a biological process to remove dissolved and suspended organic compounds. After this kind of treatment, the wastewater may be called as secondary-treated wastewater.

Secondary treatment is the portion of a sewage treatment sequence removing dissolved and [[colloid]]al compounds measured as [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD).  Secondary treatment is traditionally applied to the liquid portion of sewage after primary treatment has removed settleable solids and floating material. Secondary treatment is typically performed by [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]], aquatic [[microorganism]]s in a managed [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] habitat. [[Bacteria]] and [[protozoa]] consume biodegradable soluble organic contaminants (e.g. [[sugar]]s, fats, and organic short-chain [[carbon]] molecules from human waste, food waste, soaps and detergent) while reproducing to form [[cell (biology)|cell]]s of biological solids. Biological oxidation processes are sensitive to temperature and, between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 40&amp;nbsp;°C, the rate of biological reactions increase with temperature. Most surface aerated vessels operate at between 4&amp;nbsp;°C and 32&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Basin" /&gt;

==Definitions==

=== Primary treatment ===
Primary treatment of sewage by quiescent settling allows separation of floating material and heavy solids from liquid waste. The remaining liquid usually contains less than half of the original solids content and approximately two-thirds of the BOD in the form of colloids and dissolved organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Abbett, p.19-28&lt;/ref&gt; Where nearby water bodies can rapidly dilute this liquid waste, primary treated sewage may be discharged so natural biological decomposition oxidizes remaining waste.&lt;ref&gt;Abbett, p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[San Diego]] used Pacific Ocean dilution of primary treated effluent into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiego.gov/mwwd/facilities/ptloma/ |title=Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant |last= |first= |website= |publisher=City of San Diego |accessdate=5 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secondary treatment ===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defined secondary treatment based on the performance observed at late 20th-century bioreactors treating typical United States municipal sewage.&lt;ref name="EPA-reg"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. "Secondary Treatment Regulation: Secondary treatment." {{CodeFedReg|40|133|102}} ''Code of Federal Regulations.'' 1984-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary treated sewage is expected to produce effluent with a monthly average of less than 30&amp;nbsp;mg/l BOD and less than 30&amp;nbsp;mg/l [[suspended solids]]. Weekly averages may be up to 50 percent higher. A sewage treatment plant providing both primary and secondary treatment is expected to remove at least 85 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from domestic sewage. The EPA regulations describe [[stabilization pond]]s as providing treatment equivalent to secondary treatment removing 65 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from incoming sewage and discharging approximately 50 percent higher effluent concentrations than modern bioreactors. The regulations also recognize the difficulty of meeting the specified removal percentages from [[combined sewer]]s, dilute industrial wastewater, or [[Infiltration/Inflow]].&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1984). "Secondary Treatment Regulation: Special considerations." {{CodeFedReg|40|133|103}}; and "Treatment equivalent to secondary treatment." {{CodeFedReg|40|133|105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where natural waterways are too small to rapidly oxidize primary treated sewage, the liquid may be used to [[irrigation|irrigate]] [[sewage farm]]s until suburban property values encourage secondary treatment methods requiring less acreage. Glacial [[outwash plain|sand deposits]] allowed some northeastern United States cities to use [[slow sand filter|intermittent sand filtration]] until more compact secondary treatment [[bioreactor]]s became available.&lt;ref&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun, p.34-1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sewage treatment#Biological nutrient removal|Biological nutrient removal]] is regarded by some sanitary engineers as secondary treatment and by others as tertiary treatment. The differentiation may also differ from one country to another.

=== Tertiary treatment ===
The purpose of [[Sewage treatment#Tertiary treatment|tertiary treatment]] (also called "advanced treatment") is to provide a final treatment stage to further improve the effluent quality before it is discharged to the receiving environment (sea, river, lake, wet lands, ground, etc.). Tertiary treatment may include biological nutrient removal (alternatively, this can be classified as secondary treatment), disinfection and removal of micropollutants, such as [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s.

==Process upsets==
Process upsets are temporary decreases in treatment plant performance caused by significant population change within the secondary treatment ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;King, p.703&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions likely to create upsets include for example toxic chemicals and unusually high or low concentrations of organic waste BOD providing food for the bioreactor ecosystem.

===Toxicity===
Waste containing [[biocide]] concentrations exceeding the secondary treatment ecosystem tolerance level may kill a major fraction of one or more important ecosystem species. BOD reduction normally accomplished by that species temporarily ceases until other species reach a suitable population to utilize that food source, or the original population recovers as biocide concentrations decline.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, p.308&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dilution===
Waste containing unusually low BOD concentrations may fail to sustain the secondary treatment population required for normal waste concentrations. The reduced population surviving the starvation event may be unable to completely utilize available BOD when waste loads return to normal. Dilution may be caused by addition of large volumes of relatively uncontaminated water such as stormwater runoff into a combined sewer. Smaller sewage treatment plants may experience dilution from cooling water discharges, major plumbing leaks, firefighting, or draining large swimming pools.

A similar problem occurs as BOD concentrations drop when low flow increases waste residence time within the secondary treatment bioreactor. Secondary treatment ecosystems of college communities acclimated to waste loading fluctuations from student work/sleep cycles may have difficulty surviving school vacations. Secondary treatment systems accustomed to routine production cycles of industrial facilities may have difficulty surviving industrial plant shutdown. Populations of species feeding on incoming waste initially decline as concentration of those food sources decrease. Population decline continues as ecosystem predator populations compete for a declining population of lower [[trophic level]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy, pp.386-395&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak waste load===
High BOD concentrations initially exceed the ability of the secondary treatment ecosystem to utilize available food. Ecosystem populations of aerobic organisms increase until oxygen transfer limitations of the secondary treatment bioreactor are reached. Secondary treatment ecosystem populations may shift toward species with lower oxygen requirements, but failure of those species to use some food sources may produce higher effluent BOD concentrations. More extreme increases in BOD concentrations may drop oxygen concentrations before the secondary treatment ecosystem population can adjust, and cause an abrupt population decrease among important species. Normal BOD removal efficiency will not be restored until populations of aerobic species recover after oxygen concentrations rise to normal.

===Design for damage control===
Measures creating uniform wastewater loadings tend to reduce the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth secondary treatment bioreactors are similar to a [[plug flow reactor model]] circulating water over surfaces colonized by [[biofilm]], while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]] keeping microorganisms suspended while water is being treated. Secondary treatment bioreactors may be followed by a physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration of fixed film secondary treatment systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth [[activated sludge]] systems can be operated in a smaller space than fixed-film [[trickling filter]] systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer"&gt;EPA (2004). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/primer.pdf "Primer for Municipal Waste water Treatment Systems."] Document no. EPA 832-R-04-001.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11–13}}

Wastewater flow variations may be reduced by limiting stormwater collection by the sewer system, and by requiring industrial facilities to discharge batch process wastes to the sewer over a time interval rather than immediately after creation. Discharge of appropriate organic industrial wastes may be timed to sustain the secondary treatment ecosystem through periods of low residential waste flow.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, p.301-306&lt;/ref&gt; Sewage treatment systems experiencing holiday waste load fluctuations may provide alternative food to sustain secondary treatment ecosystems through periods of reduced use. Small facilities may prepare a solution of soluble sugars. Others may find compatible agricultural wastes, or offer disposal incentives to [[septic tank]] pumpers during low use periods.

==Process types==

A great number of secondary treatment processes exist, see [[List of wastewater treatment technologies]]. The main ones are explained below.

===Filter beds (oxidizing beds)===
{{main|Trickling filter}}

In older plants and those receiving variable loadings, [[trickling filter]] beds are used where the settled sewage liquor is spread onto the surface of a bed made up of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] (carbonized coal), [[limestone]] chips or specially fabricated plastic media. Such media must have large surface areas to support the biofilms that form. The liquor is typically distributed through perforated spray arms. The distributed liquor trickles through the bed and is collected in drains at the base. These drains also provide a source of air which percolates up through the bed, keeping it aerobic. Biofilms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi form on the media’s surfaces and eat or otherwise reduce the organic content.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|12}} The filter removes a small percentage of the suspended organic matter, while the majority of the organic matter supports microorganism reproduction and cell growth from the biological oxidation and nitrification taking place in the filter. With this aerobic oxidation and nitrification, the organic solids are converted into biofilm grazed by insect larvae, snails, and worms which help maintain an optimal thickness. Overloading of beds may increase biofilm thickness leading to anaerobic conditions and possible [[bioclogging]] of the filter media and ponding on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy, pp.533-542&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rotating biological contactors===
{{main|Rotating biological contactor}}
[[File:Rotating Biological Contactor.png|thumb|right|373 px|Schematic of a typical rotating [[Biological oxidizer|biological contactor]] (RBC). The treated effluent clarifier/settler is not included in the diagram.]]
Rotating biological contactors (RBCs) are robust mechanical fixed-film secondary treatment systems capable of withstanding surges in organic load. RBCs were first installed in [[Germany]] in 1960 and have since been developed and refined into a reliable operating unit. The rotating disks support the growth of bacteria and micro-organisms present in the sewage, which break down and stabilize organic pollutants. To be successful, micro-organisms need both oxygen to live and food to grow. Oxygen is obtained from the atmosphere as the disks rotate. As the micro-organisms grow, they build up on the media until they are sloughed off due to shear forces provided by the rotating discs in the sewage. Effluent from the RBC is then passed through a secondary clarifier where the sloughed biological solids in suspension settle as a sludge.&lt;ref&gt;Steel &amp; McGhee, pp.492-493&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activated sludge===
{{main|Activated sludge}}
[[File:Activated Sludge 1.svg|thumb|right|318px|A generalized schematic of an activated sludge process.]]
Activated sludge is a common suspended-growth method of secondary treatment. Activated sludge plants encompass a variety of mechanisms and processes using dissolved [[oxygen]] to promote growth of biological floc that substantially removes organic material.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Biological floc is an ecosystem of living biota subsisting on nutrients from the inflowing primary clarifier effluent. These mostly carbonaceous dissolved solids undergo aeration to be broken down and either biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide or converted to additional biological floc of reproducing micro-organisms. Nitrogenous dissolved solids (amino acids, [[ammonia]], etc.) are similarly converted to biological floc or oxidized by the floc to [[nitrite]]s, [[nitrate]]s, and, in some processes, to [[nitrogen]] gas through [[denitrification]]. While denitrification is encouraged in some treatment processes, denitrification often impairs the settling of the floc causing poor quality effluent in many suspended aeration plants. Overflow from the activated sludge mixing chamber is sent to a secondary clarifier where the suspended biological floc settles out while the treated water moves into tertiary treatment or disinfection. Settled floc is returned to the mixing basin to continue growing in primary effluent. Like most ecosystems, population changes among activated sludge biota can reduce treatment efficiency. [[Nocardia]], a floating brown foam sometimes misidentified as ''sewage fungus'', is the best known of many different fungi and protists that can overpopulate the floc and cause process upsets. Elevated concentrations of toxic wastes including pesticides, industrial metal plating waste, or extreme pH, can kill the biota of an activated sludge reactor ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy, pp.482-533&lt;/ref&gt;

====Package plants and sequencing batch reactors====
One type of system that combines secondary treatment and settlement is the cyclic activated sludge (CASSBR), or [[sequencing batch reactor]] (SBR). Typically,  [[activated sludge]] is mixed with raw incoming sewage, and then mixed and aerated.  The settled sludge is run off and re-aerated before a proportion is returned to the headworks.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1999). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sbr_new.pdf "Sequencing Batch Reactors."] Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet. Document no. EPA 832-F-99-073.&lt;/ref&gt;

The disadvantage of the CASSBR process is that it requires a precise control of timing, mixing and aeration. This precision is typically achieved with computer controls linked to sensors. Such a complex, fragile system is unsuited to places where controls may be unreliable, poorly maintained, or where the power supply may be intermittent.  [[Extended aeration]] package plants use separate basins for aeration and settling, and are somewhat larger than SBR plants with reduced timing sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hammer, Mark J. | title=Water and Waste-Water Technology | year=1975 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | pages=390–391 | isbn=0-471-34726-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Package plants may be referred to as ''high charged'' or ''low charged''. This refers to the way the biological load is processed. In high charged systems, the biological stage is presented with a high organic load and the combined floc and organic material is then oxygenated for a few hours before being charged again with a new load. In the low charged system the biological stage contains a low organic load and is combined with [[Flocculation|flocculate]] for longer times.

====Membrane bioreactors====
{{Main|Membrane bioreactor}}
Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are activated sludge systems using a [[Membrane technology|membrane]] liquid-solid phase separation process. The membrane component uses low pressure [[microfiltration]] or [[ultrafiltration]] membranes and eliminates the need for a secondary clarifier or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate membrane tank. One of the key benefits of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional [[activated sludge]] (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000&amp;nbsp;mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000&amp;nbsp;mg/L. The elevated biomass concentration in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge retention times, usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete nitrification even in extremely cold weather.

The cost of building and operating an MBR is often higher than conventional methods of sewage treatment. Membrane filters can be blinded with grease or abraded by suspended grit and lack a clarifier's flexibility to pass peak flows.  The technology has become increasingly popular for reliably pretreated waste streams and has gained wider acceptance where infiltration and inflow have been controlled, however, and the life-cycle costs have been steadily decreasing. The small footprint of MBR systems, and the high quality effluent produced, make them particularly useful for water reuse applications.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC (2007). [http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/upload/2008_01_23_mtb_etfs_membrane-bioreactors.pdf "Membrane Bioreactors."] Wastewater Management Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aerobic granulation====
{{Main|Aerobic granulation}}
[[File:Nereda biomass left and activated sludge after only minutes of settling.jpg|thumb|right]]
Aerobic granular sludge can be formed by applying specific process conditions that favour slow growing organisms such as PAOs (polyphosphate accumulating organisms) and GAOs (glycogen accumulating organisms). Another key part of granulation is selective wasting whereby slow settling floc-like sludge is discharged as waste sludge and faster settling biomass is retained. This process has been commercialized as [[Nereda|Nereda process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesourcemagazine.org/mark-van-loosdrecht-professor-at-delft-university-of-technology/ |title=Mark van Loosdrecht – Professor at Delft University of Technology |last=Forster |first=Richard |website=Source |publisher=[[International Water Association]] |accessdate=24 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface-aerated lagoons or ponds===
{{Main|Aerated lagoon}}
[[File:Surface-Aerated Basin.png|thumb|right|318px|A typical surface-aerated basin (using motor-driven floating aerators)]]
Aerated lagoons are a [[low technology]] suspended-growth method of secondary treatment using motor-driven aerators floating on the water surface to increase atmospheric oxygen transfer to the lagoon and to mix the lagoon contents. The floating surface aerators are typically rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;kg [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]/[[watt-hour|kW·h]]. Aerated lagoons provide less effective mixing than conventional activated sludge systems and do not achieve the same performance level. The basins may range in depth from 1.5 to 5.0 metres. Surface-aerated basins achieve 80 to 90 percent removal of BOD with retention times of 1 to 10 days.&lt;ref name=Basin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beychok, M.R.|year=1971|title=Performance of surface-aerated basins|journal=Chemical Engineering Progress Symposium Series|volume=67|issue=107|pages=322–339}} [http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7112203&amp;q=&amp;uid=788301038&amp;setcookie=yes Available at CSA Illumina website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114140052/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7112203&amp;q=&amp;uid=788301038&amp;setcookie=yes |date=2007-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many small municipal sewage systems in the United States (1 million gal./day or less) use aerated lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;Maine Department of Environmental Protection. Augusta, ME. [http://www.lagoonsonline.com "Aerated Lagoons – Wastewater Treatment."] Maine Lagoon Systems Task Force. Accessed 2010-07-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructed wetlands===
{{Main|Constructed wetland}}
Primary clarifier effluent was discharged directly to [[eutrophic]] natural [[wetland]]s for decades before environmental regulations discouraged the practice. Where adequate land is available, stabilization ponds with constructed wetland ecosystems can be built to perform secondary treatment separated from the natural wetlands receiving secondary treated sewage. Constructed wetlands resemble fixed-film systems more than suspended growth systems, because natural mixing is minimal. Constructed wetland design uses plug flow assumptions to compute the residence time required for treatment. Patterns of vegetation growth and solids deposition in wetland ecosystems, however, can create preferential flow pathways which may reduce average residence time.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Middlebrooks &amp; Crites, pp.170-201&lt;/ref&gt; Measurement of wetland treatment efficiency is complicated because most traditional water quality measurements cannot differentiate between sewage pollutants and biological productivity of the wetland. Demonstration of treatment efficiency may require more expensive analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Franson, Mary Ann ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' 14th Edition (1976) American Public Health Association {{ISBN|0-87553-078-8}} pp.89-95&amp;543-544&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emerging technologies===
* Biological Aerated (or Anoxic) Filter (BAF) or Biofilters combine filtration with biological carbon reduction, [[nitrification]] or denitrification. BAF usually includes a reactor filled with a [[filter (water)|filter]] media. The media is either in suspension or supported by a gravel layer at the foot of the filter. The dual purpose of this media is to support highly active biomass that is attached to it and to filter suspended solids. Carbon reduction and ammonia conversion occurs in aerobic mode and sometime achieved in a single reactor while nitrate conversion occurs in [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] mode. BAF is operated either in upflow or downflow configuration depending on design specified by manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=EPA |first= |authorlink = |title =An Emerging Technology: The Biological Aerated Filter |publisher =United States Government Printing Office |volume = |edition = |date =July 1983 |location = |pages = |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Integrated Fixed-Film Activated Sludge 
* Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors typically requires smaller footprint than suspended-growth systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bv.com/Downloads/Resources/Brochures/rsrc_WTR_IFASMBBR.pdf |title=Black &amp; Veatch, Inc. leaflet |accessdate=2015-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026171954/http://bv.com/Downloads/Resources/Brochures/rsrc_WTR_IFASMBBR.pdf |archivedate=October 26, 2010 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sextortion''' is a form of [[sexual exploitation]] that employs non-physical forms of coercion to extort sexual favors from the victim.  Sextortion refers to the broad category of sexual exploitation in which abuse of power is the means of coercion, as well as to the category of sexual exploitation in which threatened release of sexual images or information is the means of coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=De la Cerna|first=Madrilena|title=Sextortion|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/177037/sextortion|accessdate=2012-10-05|newspaper=Cebu Daily News|date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early use of the term appears in print in 1950 in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Sextortion Charges To Come Up Next Week |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/423471351.html?dids=423471351:423471351&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr+05,+1950&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc='SEXTORTION'+CHARGES+TO+COME+UP+NEXT+WEEK&amp;pqatl=google |quote= |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 5, 1950 |accessdate=2010-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since early 2009, The Institute for Responsible Online and Cell-Phone Communication (iroc2.org) began warning the public about the trend of "Sextortion" via live events and websites including www.sextortion.org. This is a trend that grew based on the birth and growth of the trend known as "sexting" whereby compromising images and videos were being shared by individuals without a real understanding of the short and long term consequences of sharing "private' content on digital tools designed for sharing.

In 2009, the International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ), in partnership with the Association of Women Judges in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Philippine Women Judges Association, and the Tanzania Women Judges Association, and with funding from the Government of the Netherlands, launched a three-year program on "Stopping the Abuse of Power through Sexual Exploitation: Naming, Shaming, and Ending Sextortion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stopping the Abuse of Power through Sexual Exploitation: Naming, Shaming and Ending Sextortion – Toolkit|url=http://iawj.org/IAWJ%20International%20Toolkit%20FINAL|publisher=International Association of Women Judges|accessdate=2012-10-05|page=5|format=PDF|year=2012}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Presentations on sextortion were made to judges attending the 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10th Biennial International Conference: {{'}}''Judicial Challenges in a Changing World''{{'}}|url=http://www.iawj.org/InternationalConferences|publisher=International Association of Women Judges|accessdate=2012-10-05}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2012 Biennial World Conferences of the IAWJ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibb|first=Frances|title=Attacks and threats: why judges need support|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/sitesearch.do%3fquerystring=Attacks+and+threats%3A+why+judges+need+support&amp;p=tto&amp;pf=all&amp;bl=on|accessdate=2012-10-05|newspaper=The Times|date=May 31, 2012|location=London|quote=Judges discussed 'sextortion' a mix of sex and corruption where people in authority demand sexual favours for anything, Hale says, from immigration to prosecution decisions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International forum encourages judges to 'mind the gap{{'}}|url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/news/international-forum-encourages-judges-to-mind-the-gap|accessdate=2012-10-05|date=May 31, 2012|agency=The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to NGOs attending the 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ending the Abuse of Power through Sexual Exploitation: Naming, Shaming, and Ending Sextortion.

{{Software development process}}
'''Test automation management tools''' are specific tools that provide a [[Collaborative software|collaborative]] environment that is intended to make [[test automation]] efficient, traceable and clear for stakeholders. Test automation is becoming a cross-discipline (i.e. a mix of both testing and development practices.)

==Motivation==
[[Test automation]] systems usually lack reporting, analysis and meaningful information about project status. Test management systems target manual effort and do not give all the required information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kartashov | first = Peter| title = Test Automation Management: A Call For Better Tools |  url = http://www.automatedtestinginstitute.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1276:ast-magazine&amp;catid=105:ast-cover-description&amp;Itemid=122 | year = 2011| publisher = Automated Software Testing Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test automation management systems leverage automation effort towards efficient and continuous processes of delivering test execution and new working tests by:
* Making transparent, meaningful and traceable reporting for all project stakeholders.
* Easing test debugging through test results analysis workflow.
* Providing valuable metrics and key performance indicators – both technical and business-wise (trend analysis, benchmarking, gap analysis, [[root cause analysis]] and risk point analysis).
* Grid benchmarking and comparison of test execution days reduces analysis and review effort.
* Clean traceability with other testing artifacts (test cases, data, issues, etc.).
* Organizing historical data.
* Post-project analysis and automation performance assessment. (Progress of test coverage shows the group performance.)

==Compliance with Agile==
Test automation management tools fit [[Agile software development|Agile]] Systems Development Life Cycle methodologies. In most cases, test automation covers continuous changes in order to minimize manual regression testing. Changes are usually noted by monitoring test log diffs. For example, differences in the number of failures signal probable changes either in AUT or in test code (broken test code base, instabilities) or in both. Quick notice of changes and unified workflow of results analysis reduces testing costs and increases project quality.

== TDD ==
[[Test-driven development]] utilizes test automation as the primary driver to rapid and high-quality software production. Concepts of green line and thoughtful design are supported with tests before actual coding, assuming there are special tools to track and analyze within TDD process.

== Continuous Integration ==
Another test automation practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam |author2=Huizinga, Dorota  | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management |  url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470042125.html | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | isbn = 0-470-04212-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[continuous integration]], which explicitly supposes automated test suites as a final stage upon building, deployment and distributing new versions of software. Based on acceptance of test results, a build is declared either as qualified for further testing or rejected.&lt;ref name="Fowler, Continuous Integration practices" &gt;{{Cite web

  |title=Continuous Integration
  |accessdate=2009-11-11
  |last=Fowler |first=Martin  |authorlink=Martin Fowler
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dashboards provide relevant information on all stages of software development including test results. However, dashboards do not support comprehensive operations and views for an automation engineer. This is another reason for dedicated management tools that can supply high-level data to other project management tools such as [[test management]], [[issue management]] and [[Change management (engineering)|change management]].

'''''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross: A Study of the Nature and Origins of Christianity Within the Fertility Cults of the Ancient Near East''''' is a 1970 book about the [[linguistics]] of early [[Christianity]] and [[fertility cult]]s in the [[Ancient Near East]]. It was written by [[John Marco Allegro]] (1923–1988).&lt;ref name="FlintVanderKam2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Flint, Peter  |author2=VanderKam, James  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA324 |year= 2005 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-567-08468-2 |pages=324–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AllegroIrvin2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Allegro, John M.  |author2=Irvin, J. R.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross: A Study of the Nature and Origins of Christianity Within the Fertility Cults of the Ancient Near East |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFsSQgAACAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Gnostic Media Research &amp; Publishing |isbn=978-0-9825562-7-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
The book relates the development of language to the development of myths, religions, and cultic practices in world cultures. Allegro argues, through etymology, that the roots of [[Christianity]], and many other religions, lay in [[fertility cult]]s, and that cult practices, such as ingesting [[entheogen|visionary plants]] to perceive the mind of God, persisted into the early [[Christian]] era, and to some unspecified extent into the 13th century with reoccurrences in the 18th century and mid-20th century, as he interprets the fresco of the [[Plaincourault Chapel]] to be an accurate depiction of the ritual ingestion of ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' as the [[Eucharist]]. Allegro argued that Jesus never existed as a historical figure and was a mythological creation of early [[Christian]]s under the influence of [[psychoactive]] mushroom extracts such as [[psilocybin]].&lt;ref name="FlintVanderKam2005"/&gt;

His claims have often been subject to ridicule and scorn due to Allegro's unconventional theory. As ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine put it in an article headed "Jesus as mushroom",&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909327,00.html "Religion: Jesus as Mushroom"], ''Time'', 8 June 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To some biblical scholars in Britain, the new book looked like the psychedelic ravings of a hippie cultist. To others, it was merely an outlandish hoax. One described it as reading "like a Semitic philologist's erotic nightmare".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reaction==
The book has been described as ''"notorious"'' and as ''"one of the strangest books ever published on the subject of [[religion]] and [[pharmacology]]"''.&lt;ref name="Taylor2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Taylor, Joan E. |title=The Essenes, the Scrolls, and the Dead Sea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWIMFY4VnI4C&amp;pg=PA305 |year= 2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-955448-5 |pages=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a [[media frenzy]] when it was published at the dawn of the 1970s. This caused the publisher to apologize for issuing it and forced Allegro's resignation from his university position.&lt;ref name="FlintVanderKam2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Judith Anne |title=John Marco Allegro: The Maverick Of The Dead Sea Scrolls |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXHf8qdq9kYC&amp;pg=PA291 |year=2005 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |isbn=978-0-8028-2849-1 |pages=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Anne Brown suggested that the book was ''"difficult to read and difficult to summarize, because he follows clues that criss-cross different cultures and lead into many-layered webs of association"''.&lt;ref name="Brown2005"/&gt; Mark Hall writes that Allegro suggested the scrolls all but proved that a historical Jesus never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Mark. "Foreword", in Allegro, John M. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls &amp; the Christian Myth''. Prometheus 1992, first published 1979, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Jenkins writes that Allegro was an eccentric scholar who relied on texts that did not exist in quite the form he was citing them, and calls the ''Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' "possibly the single most ludicrous book on Jesus scholarship by a qualified academic".&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Philip (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv6x5kTHGvsC&amp;pg=PA180 "Hidden Gospels"]. Oxford University Press, p. 180, {{ISBN|0195156315}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconsideration==
Some studies of Allegro's work have given new purported evidence and led to calls for his theories to be re-evaluated by the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Michael (2006) [http://www.egodeath.com/WassonEdenTree.htm "Wasson and Allegro on the Tree of Knowledge as Amanita"]. ''Journal of Higher Criticism''.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009 ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' was reprinted in a 40th anniversary edition with 30-page addendum by Prof. [[Carl A. P. Ruck]] of [[Boston University]].&lt;ref&gt;Allegro, John M. (2009) ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'', 40th anniversary edition, Gnostic Media, {{ISBN|978-0-9825562-7-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A more articulate exposition of Allegro's insights into early Christianity and his discoveries studying the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] was published in his 1979 book ''[[The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth]]''.

The work of Allegro also gained recognition and consideration by such late proponents of experiential psychedelia through pharmacological interaction as [[Terence McKenna]], who cited Allegro's claims of certain psychoactive fungi analogizing the [[Eucharist]], spoken in a live lecture in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Brown2005"/&gt;

'''Thermal pollution''' is the degradation of [[water quality]] by any process that changes ambient water [[temperature]]. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a [[coolant]] by [[power plants]] and industrial manufacturers. When water used as a coolant is returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature, the sudden change in temperature decreases [[oxygen]] supply and affects [[ecosystem]] composition. Fish and other organisms adapted to particular temperature range can be killed by an abrupt change in water temperature (either a rapid increase or decrease) known as "Thermal shock."

[[Urban runoff]]—[[stormwater]] discharged to surface waters from [[road]]s and [[parking lot]]s—can also be a source of elevated water temperatures.

==Ecological effects==

[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/01/BAAS151F1U.DTL&amp;tsp=1 "Power plant has no plans to stop killing fish."] ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]],'' January 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was closed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.

=== Warm water ===
Elevated temperature typically decreases the level of [[dissolved oxygen]] of water, as gases are less soluble in hotter liquids. This can harm aquatic animals such as fish, [[amphibians]] and other aquatic organisms. Thermal pollution may also increase the [[metabolic]] rate of aquatic animals, as [[enzyme]] activity, resulting in these organisms consuming more food in a shorter time than if their environment were not changed.&lt;ref name="Goel"&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Pollution - Causes, Effects and Control |last=Goel |first=P.K. |year=2006 |publisher=New Age International |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-224-1839-2 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}} An increased metabolic rate may result in fewer resources; the more adapted organisms moving in may have an advantage over organisms that are not used to the warmer temperature. As a result, [[food chain]]s of the old and new environments may be compromised. Some fish species will avoid stream segments or coastal areas adjacent to a thermal discharge. [[Biodiversity]] can be decreased as a result.&lt;ref name="Kennish"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology of Estuaries&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Anthropogenic Effects |last=Kennish |first=Michael J. |series=Marine Science Series |year=1992 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |isbn=978-0-8493-8041-9 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|415–17}}&lt;ref name="Laws"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aquatic Pollution: An Introductory Text |last=Laws |first=Edward A. |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-34875-7 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|340}}

High temperature limits oxygen dispersion into deeper waters, contributing to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions. This can lead to increased [[bacteria]] levels when there is ample food supply. Many aquatic species will fail to reproduce at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref name="Goel" /&gt;{{rp|179–80}}

[[Primary producer]]s (e.g. plants, [[cyanobacteria]]) are affected by warm water because higher water temperature increases plant growth rates, resulting in a shorter lifespan and species [[overpopulation]]. This can cause an [[algae bloom]] which reduces oxygen levels.

Temperature changes of even one to two degrees [[Celsius]] can cause significant changes in organism metabolism and other adverse [[cellular biology]] effects.  Principal adverse changes can include rendering cell walls less permeable to necessary [[osmosis]], coagulation of cell [[protein]]s, and alteration of [[enzyme]] [[metabolism]].  These cellular level effects can adversely affect [[death|mortality]] and [[reproduction]].

A large increase in temperature can lead to the denaturing of life-supporting enzymes by breaking down [[Hydrogen bond|hydrogen]]- and [[disulphide bond]]s within the quaternary structure of the enzymes. Decreased enzyme activity in aquatic organisms can cause problems such as the inability to break down [[lipids]], which leads to [[malnutrition]].

In limited cases, warm water has little deleterious effect and may even lead to improved function of the receiving aquatic ecosystem. This phenomenon is seen especially in seasonal waters and is known as '''thermal enrichment.''' An extreme case is derived from the aggregational habits of the [[manatee]], which often uses power plant discharge sites during winter. Projections suggest that manatee populations would decline upon the removal of these discharges.

=== Cold water ===
Releases of unnaturally cold water from [[reservoir]]s can dramatically change the fish and macroinvertebrate fauna of rivers, and reduce river productivity. In [[Australia]], where many rivers have warmer temperature regimes, native fish species have been eliminated, and macroinvertebrate fauna have been drastically altered.  This may be mitigated by designing the dam to release warmer surface waters instead of the colder water at the bottom of the reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mollyo|first1=Fran|title=A happier environment for fish|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-09-happier-environment-fish.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|work=[[Phys.org]]|date=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermal shock ===
When a power plant first opens or shuts down for repair or other causes, fish and other organisms adapted to particular temperature range can be killed by the abrupt change in water temperature, either an increase or decrease, known as "thermal shock".&lt;ref name="Laws" /&gt;{{rp|208}}&lt;ref name="Chiras"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chiras |first=Daniel D. |date=2012 |title=Environmental Science |location=Burlington, MA |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett |isbn=9781449614867}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|478}}

==Sources and control of thermal pollution==
[[File:Coal power plant Knepper 1.jpg|thumb|[[Cooling tower]] at [[Gustav Knepper Power Station]], [[Dortmund, Germany]]]]
 
=== Industrial wastewater ===
In the [[United States]], about 75 to 82 percent of thermal pollution is generated by power plants.&lt;ref name="Laws" /&gt;{{rp|335}} The remainder is from industrial sources such as [[petroleum refining|petroleum refineries]], [[pulp and paper mill]]s, [[chemical plant]]s, [[steel mill]]s and [[smelter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Washington, D.C. (May 2014). [http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-04/documents/cooling-water_phase-4_tdd_2014.pdf "Technical Development Document for the Final Section 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule."] Document No. EPA 821-R-14-002. p 4-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA (June 2006).

Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Heated water from these sources may be controlled with:
*[[Cooling pond]]s, man-made bodies of water designed for cooling by [[evaporation]], [[convection]], and [[radiation]]
*[[cooling tower]]s, which transfer [[waste heat]] to the [[atmosphere]] through evaporation and/or [[heat transfer]]
*[[cogeneration]], a process where waste heat is recycled for domestic and/or industrial heating purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/publications/assistance/sectors/notebooks/fossil.html |title=Profile of the Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation Industry |author=EPA |date=1997 |series=Office of Compliance, Sector Notebook Project |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203095518/http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/publications/assistance/sectors/notebooks/fossilsn.pdf |archive-date=2011-02-03 |page=24}} Document No. EPA/310-R-97-007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some facilities use '''once-through cooling''' (OTC) systems which do not reduce temperature as effectively as the above systems. For example, the [[Potrero Generating Station]] in [[San Francisco]] (closed in 2011), used OTC and discharged water to [[San Francisco Bay]] approximately 10&amp;nbsp;°C (20&amp;nbsp;°F) above the ambient bay temperature.&lt;ref&gt;California Environmental Protection Agency.

[[File:Emeryville California Stormwater Curb Extension.jpg|thumb|A [[bioretention]] cell for treating urban runoff in California]]

=== Urban runoff ===
During warm weather, urban runoff can have significant thermal impacts on small streams, as storm water passes over hot parking lots, roads and sidewalks. Storm water management facilities that absorb runoff or direct it into [[groundwater]], such as [[bioretention]] systems and [[infiltration basin]]s, can reduce these thermal effects. These and related systems for managing runoff are components of an expanding [[urban design]] approach commonly called [[green infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/what-green-infrastructure |title=What is Green Infrastructure? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-11-02 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Retention basin]]s (stormwater ponds) tend to be less effective at reducing runoff temperature, as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (August 1999). [http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/urban-stormwater-bmps_preliminary-study_1999.pdf "Preliminary Data Summary of Urban Storm Water Best Management Practices."] Document No. EPA-821-R-99-012. p. 5-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Michigan Institute for Social Research''' (ISR) is one of the largest academic [[social research]] and survey organization in the world, established in 1949. With an annual research budget of over $80 million, ISR includes more than 250 scientists from many academic disciplines – including [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[demography]], [[history]], [[anthropology]], and [[statistics]]. It has been said to be "the premier center for survey research methodology in the world."&lt;ref name=Costello&gt;{{cite news |title=University of Michigan's Institute Shows What Makes Society Tick |first=Nancy |last=Costello |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-31/news/mn-51608_1_survey-research-center |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date= 31 October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1946, the sociologist and economist [[Rensis Likert]] and six colleagues from his wartime work at the [[Bureau of Agricultural Economics]], including [[Angus Campbell (psychologist)|Angus Campbell]], [[Leslie Kish]], and [[George Katona]], formed the Survey Research Center (SRC) at the University of Michigan in order to apply the social survey techniques they had developed to broader issues facing post-war America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kish|first=Leslie|author-link=Leslie Kish|date=1990|title=A Choices Profile: Rensis Likert: Social Scientist and Entrepreneur|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/131305/2/Kish.pdf|journal=Choices: The Magazine of Food, Farm, and Resource Issues|publisher=Agricultural and Applied Economics Association|volume=5|issue=4|pages=36-38|via=AgEcon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCGD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu/history/|title=Research Center for Group Dynamics: History|last=|first=|date=|website=Research Center for Group Dynamics, [[University of Michigan]]|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615163242/http://www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu/history/|archive-date=June 15, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, using techniques developed by Katona, the center began conducting surveys to compute the [[University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index|Consumer Sentiment Index]] that is one of the eleven components the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] includes in its [[Index of Leading Environmental Indicators]].&lt;ref name="Costello" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite speech|last=Curtin|first=Richard T.|title=Surveys of Consumers: Theory, Methods, and Interpretation|location=Washington, D.C.|event=[[National Association for Business Economics]] 44th Annual Meeting|date=September 30, 2002|url=https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/fetchdoc.php?docid=26396|access-date=2008-10-12|via=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The center gained visibility in its field due to a survey conducted in October 1948, when Campbell and [[Robert L. Kahn]] added two questions about political leanings to a survey they were conducting for the [[State Department]] about foreign policy. Their results, compiled just before the [[United States presidential election, 1948|presidential election]] in November, showed a large number of undecided voters and a small lead for [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] over [[Thomas E. Dewey|Thomas Dewey]], at odds with most other polls that predicted a landslide for Dewey. When Truman ended up winning the election, the subsequent examination of polling techniques led to the [[probability sampling]] utilized by the SRC becoming dominant in the field over the [[quota sampling]] that had been favored by other polling outfits.&lt;ref name="Rosegrant"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isr.umich.edu/news-events/insights-newsletter/article/isr-and-the-truman-dewey-upset/|title=ISR and the Truman/Dewey upset|last=Rosegrant|first=Susan|date=April 18, 2012|editor=|website=|publisher=Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402213551/http://www.sampler.isr.umich.edu/2012/featured/isr-and-the-truman-dewey-upset/|archivedate=April 2, 2013|deadurl=|access-date=2018-10-12|df=|ref={{harvid|Rosegrant|2012}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; This survey was the first of what became the [[American National Election Studies]] (or NES). 

Psychologist [[Kurt Lewin]] had founded the Research Center for Group Dynamics at [[MIT]] in 1945, and after his death in 1947 the center's ensuing funding problems prompted its remaining members to find it a new home.&lt;ref name="RCGD" /&gt; The presence of the SRC and the university's support for social sciences led them to move to the University of Michigan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/dis/infoserv/literature/social-science-public-interest.pdf|title=Social Science in the Public Interest: A Fiftieth-Year History of the Institute for Social Research|last=Frantilla|first=Anne|publisher=Bentley Historical Library|year=1998|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor|pages=23|accessdate=2018-10-13}} Cartwright wrote that one of the most important reasons was "the strong emphasis placed upon social science and especially upon social psychology... The Survey Research Center brought to the campus a large group of social psychologists working on many research problems closely bordering upon the work of the Center... There can be no doubt that Ann Arbor in the coming years will be the scene of some of the most important developments in social science."&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948 under a new director, [[Dorwin Cartwright]]. The two groups united to form the Institute for Social Research on February 1, 1949.&lt;ref name="RCGD" /&gt; 

In 1962, [[Warren Miller (political scientist)|Warren Miller]], a [[Political Scientist|political scientist]], created the Inter-university Consortium for Political Research (now known as [[ICPSR]]) to help fund the maintenance and dissemination of the large data sets that the election studies and others were generating. Making such data sets available to all interested researchers was considered revolutionary at a time when the norm was for researchers to closely guard their data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/about/history/early-years.html|title=ICPSR: The Founding and Early Years|last=Austin|first=Erik W.|date=|website=University of Michigan|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SRC's Political Behavior Program, which had taken over direction of the election studies, became the Center for Political Studies in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Warren E.|date=April 1994|title=An organizational history of the intellectual origins of the American National Election Studies|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1475-6765.1994.tb00420.x|journal=European Journal of Political Research|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=247–265|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.1994.tb00420.x|issn=0304-4130|url-access=subscription|subscription=|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Population Studies Center moved from the university's [[University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts|College of Literature, Science, and the Arts]] in 1998, bringing the total number of centers to five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/about/|title=About - Michigan Population Studies Center (PSC)|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Michigan|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The institute is an independent unit of the university, headed by a director who reports directly to the university's provost and executive vice president for academic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spg.umich.edu/org-charts/510000|title=Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Standard Practice Guides|publisher=University of Michigan|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615171119/http://spg.umich.edu/org-charts/510000|archive-date=2018-06-15|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises five separate but interdependent centers:
* Center for Political Studies (CPS): An [[interdisciplinary]] and collaborative [[social science]] research unit of international scope, this center analyzes individual [[political]] behavior and the role of institutions in contemporary society.
* Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR): The world's largest digital social science [[data archive]], this unit has nearly 700 member organizations from around the globe.
* Population Studies Center: One of the oldest [[population]] centers in the United States, the PSC works on [[United States|domestic]] and international demographic and population research.
* Research Center for Group Dynamics: The RCGD's research programs range from achievement, aggression, and culture and cognition to [[evolution]] and human adaptation.
* Survey Research Center: The SRC does interdisciplinary social science research involving the collection and analysis of data from scientific sample surveys.

He is the Gershom Scholem Professor Emeritus of Kabbalah at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He is considered a leading scholar of [[Kabbalah]]; his other research interests include Jewish [[myth]], [[Sabbateans|Sabbateanism]], and the links between [[Judaism]] and [[ancient Greek religion]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. Author of many books and articles, his work is often cited by other scholars. He is the recipient of the 1997 [[Bialik Prize]], the 1999 Gershom Scholem Prize for Kabbalah Research, the 2006 [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture| EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture]], and the 2017 [[Israel Prize]].

==Early life and education==
Yehuda Liebes was born in [[Jerusalem]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt; His father, [[:he:יוסף גרהרד ליבס|Joseph Gerhard Liebes]] (1910–1988), a noted Hebrew translator of classic literature, left his native Germany at the age of 18 to study at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He returned to his homeland to continue his education, but was expelled from his university due to the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. He then undertook agricultural training in [[Latvia]] with a Zionist movement. There he married his first wife, with whom he settled in [[Pardes Hanna-Karkur|Pardes Hanna]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]] and had two daughters before they divorced. In 1941 Liebes married his second wife, Mira, a native of [[Riga]] who had grown up in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1250272|title=דמותו של פרופ' יהודה ליבס: חוקר קבלה שנוי במחלוקת ודתי ציוני|language=Hebrew|trans-title=Professor Yehuda Liebes: A Controversial Kabbalah Scholar and Religious Zionist|first=Dalia|last=Karpal|date=13 March 2009|accessdate=5 January 2017|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, a daughter (Tamar, today head of the Department of Communications at Hebrew University) and a son (Yehuda).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; On his mother's side, Yehuda was a cousin of Israeli intellectual [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; 

Liebes was acquainted with [[Gershom Scholem]], the father of modern Kabbalah scholarship, from an early age, as his parents were friends of Scholem. Scholem attended Yehuda's [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] and gave him as a gift [[:he:ישעיה תשבי|Yeshayahu Tishby]]'s book ''Mishnat HaZohar'' ("The Wisdom of the [[Zohar]]").&lt;ref name=musaf/&gt;
 
[[File:Scholem card catalog.jpg|125px|left|thumb|[[Gershom Scholem]]'s card catalog]]
Liebes graduated from the [[Hebrew University Secondary School]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; In 1965, he enlisted in the [[Paratroopers Brigade]] for his [[Conscription in Israel|compulsory army service]], and in 1967, served in the [[Six-Day War]] as a non-commissioned officer.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; During [[Reserve duty (Israel)|reserve duty]] in 1969, he was injured during a Palestinian attack on his post in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], lost several teeth, and was hospitalized for several months.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

In 1967, Liebes began his studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt; After earning undergraduate and graduate degrees, he pursued his doctoral research under Scholem.&lt;ref name=alan/&gt;&lt;ref name=card&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/collections/jewish-collection/scholem/scholem-card-catalog/Pages/Scholem-Prologue.aspx|title= Gershom Scholem's Milon HaZohar Card Index|first=Yehuda|last=Liebes|publisher=[[National Library of Israel]]|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholem gave Liebes access to handwritten note cards he had prepared for a lexicon of [[Zohar]] terminology that he never wrote,&lt;ref name=card/&gt; and Liebes submitted his dissertation on ''Peraḳim be-milon sefer ha-Zohar'' (Chapters in the Dictionary of the Book of the Zohar) (1976).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

==Teaching career==
Liebes began lecturing in the Hebrew University's Department of Jewish Thought in 1971. He became a full professor in 1993.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; His course subjects include Kabbalah, Jewish myth, and the Zohar.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt; He has also taught on Zohar at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=huji/&gt;

 |quote=I do not really like the term 'Jewish mysticism'. The order of the words is not correct. You have to say 'mystical Judaism', because Kabbalah is first and foremost an interpretation of an aspect of the Jewish religion. … The inclusion of all mystical phenomena under the heading 'mysticism' is a mistake, because it causes people to think everything is the same—Christian mysticism, Jewish mysticism, Muslim mysticism. The Kabbalah is an interpretation of the Jewish religion, of [[Torah]] and [[Mitzva|mitzvot]], of the people and the land of Israel".

Liebes has also translated Greek, Latin, and Arabic religious poetry into Hebrew.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

==Controversial views==
Challenging the traditional ascription of the Zohar to the 2nd-century disciples of [[Shimon bar Yochai]] in [[Israel]], Liebes asserts that a group of 13th-century Spanish Kabbalists, which included [[Moses de León]], composed the work, each reflecting his own approach to Kabbalah.&lt;ref name=alan/&gt; Liebes claims that the ''Ketem Paz'' on the Zohar and the Kabbalistic hymn ''[[Bar Yochai (song)|Bar Yochai]]'' were written by two different authors with similar names, not the one [[Shimon Lavi]] who is traditionally credited with authoring both works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.nli.org.il/sites/nlis/he/Song/pages/Articles/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8_%D7%A8'_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90.aspx |title= ר' שמעון לביא |language=Hebrew|trans-title=Rabbi Shimon Lavi|publisher=[[National Library of Israel]]|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebes also finds Christian and Sabbatean inspiration in the ideas of Rebbe [[Nachman of Breslov]]&lt;ref name=alan/&gt; and, at the same time, Sabbatean influences on the disciples of the Vilna Gaon [[Misnagdim|who opposed Hasidism]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

Liebes angered [[Religious Zionism|National Religious]] Jews in Israel when he claimed to find a Christian allusion in the [[Amidah]], the central prayer of the [[Jewish prayer|Jewish liturgy]]. Liebes asserted that the conclusion of the 14th blessing, "''keren yeshua''" ("horn of salvation") refers not to [[David]], but to [[Jesus]] (''Yeshua'' in Hebrew).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

Liebes publishes in Hebrew and has expressed opposition to the study of Jewish thought in English. He has allowed only a few of his works to be translated into English, in conjunction with his academic degree and tenure.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Liebes received the 1997 [[Bialik Prize]] for his book ''The Secret of the Sabbatean Faith'' (1995).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; In 1999 he received the Peace Prize for the study of Kabbalah&lt;ref name=huji/&gt; and the Gershom Scholem Prize for Kabbalah Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academy.ac.il/RichText/GeneralPage.aspx?nodeId=1079|title=Gershom Scholem Prize for Kabbalah Research|publisher=[[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the 2006 [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture| EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture]], in the category of Humanities, for his work on Sabbateanism.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.emetprize.org/laureates/humanities/jewish-philosophy/prof-yehuda-liebes/|title=Emet Prize Laureates|publisher=Emet Prize for Science, Art and Culture|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 he received the [[Israel Prize]] for his work on Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/380233|title=Israel Prize for Kaballah to Professor Yehuda Liebes|date=5 February 2017|accessdate=21 January 2018|work=[[Arutz Sheva|Israel National News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Liebes and his wife Esther have three children. In 1977, after he completed his doctorate, they joined the nucleus of the new community of [[Shilo, Mateh Binyamin|Shilo]], living in a caravan near [[Ofra]], but left after nine months.&lt;ref name=musaf/&gt; The couple resides in the [[Kiryat Moshe]] neighborhood of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; Esther formerly worked as librarian of the Gershom G. Scholem Collection at the Hebrew University Library.&lt;ref name=musaf/&gt;

Liebes identifies politically with the [[Right-wing politics|extreme right]] and religiously with [[Religious Zionism]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;
