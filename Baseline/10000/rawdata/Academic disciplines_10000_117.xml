'''A due''' {{IPA-it|a ˈduːe|}} in [[Italian language|Italian]] or '''à deux''' {{IPA-fr|a dø|}} in [[French language|French]] is a musical direction meaning "for two".&lt;ref&gt;Ammer, Christine. ''The [[HarperCollins]] Dictionary of Music, 3rd ed.'' New York: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Most often seen in its abbreviated form ''a2'', the marking signifies that on a staff that normally carries parts for two players, both players are to play the single part in [[unison]].&lt;ref&gt;Randel, Don Michael (ed.). ''Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians.'' Cambridge, London: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally seen in scores and parts where two players or sections of the same instrument share a staff. The instruction ''a2'' indicates that both players or sections should play the notes indicated, while ''primo'' and ''secondo'' (often abbreviated to ''1.'' and ''2.'' or ''I&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''II&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;'') indicate that only a single player or section should play while the other remains [[tacet]].

'''''Aesthetic Journalism: How to Inform Without Informing''''' is a book by Italian writer, curator and artist [[Alfredo Cramerotti]]. Recognising the "blurring of margins between artistic and information practices"&lt;ref&gt;Cramerotti, Alfredo. 2009. ''Aesthetic Journalism: How to Inform Without Informing'', Chicago: Intellect, The University of Chicago Press. p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; as a main feature in contemporary culture, Cramerotti sets out the Who, What, Where, When and How, and Why of Aesthetic Journalism.

Cramerotti identifies this "investigative approach" in contemporary art and photography as the use of fieldwork, reportage, interviews, document analysis, graphic mapping and information distribution. He cites a number of artists who employ these strategies: [[Hans Haacke]], [[Martha Rosler]], Lukas Einsele, Laura Horelli, [[Renzo Martens]], [[Alfredo Jaar]], [[Renée Green]], The Atlas Group/[[Walid Raad]] and Bruno Serralogue. For Cramerotti, Aesthetic Journalism implies the critical use of documentary techniques and journalistic methods where the medium itself undergoes questioning. He posits that aesthetics, understood as a "process in which we open up our sensibility to the diversity of the forms of nature (and manmade environment)"&lt;ref&gt;Cramerotti, Aesthetic Journalism, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; can open up the mechanisms of art and media to expose the limitations of photojournalism, documentation and the ethics of representation. In doing so, Aesthetic Journalism renders productive readings of reality, information, fact, fiction and objectivity.

Although "the process leading up to aesthetic journalism can be considered from both perspectives as art being absorbed by the generalist media, or as journalism becoming a (common) art form",&lt;ref&gt;Cramerotti, Aesthetic Journalism, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Cramerotti's text speculates on the mutual convergence of art and media into a new cross discipline of Aesthetic Journalism.

The concepts outlined in the book have been a key tool in the development of the [[Chamber of Public Secrets']] curatorial approach for the 8th edition of [[Manifesta]], the European Biennial of Contemporary Art: [[Manifesta 8]] taking place in the region of Murcia, Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turbulence.org/blog/2009/12/31/aesthetic-journalism-by-alfredo-cramerotti|title=Networked_Performance — "Aesthetic Journalism" by Alfredo Cramerotti|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asia-Japan Women's Resource Center''' (AJWRC) is a [[non-governmental organisation]] founded in 1994 that advocates [[gender equality]], the end of violence against women, a more just society, and environmentally [[sustainable development]].

AJWRC holds events like empowerment seminars and study groups for women, training and workshops, and they also publish research and conduct outreach campaigns in furtherance of their mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humantrafficking.org/organizations/141 HumanTrafficking.org organization overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002845/http://www.humantrafficking.org/organizations/141 |date=March 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The activities serve to raise awareness among Japanese women of global as well as domestic issues. Because [[Japan]] is a leading nation in the Asian economy and international politics, the organisation feels an obligation to encourage Japanese women to take a leading role in advocacy for improved [[human rights]]. Additionally, Japan is the destination for the largest number of cross-border [[human trafficking]] victims in [[Asia]], which AJWRC takes as further impetus for their mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aworc.org/org/ajwrc/ajwrc.html AWORC member profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Disparity between genders has been shrinking in most developed countries over the last century, but AJWRC holds that Japan has lagged behind the trend. As examples, women represent a mere 10% of the [[National Diet]], [[Japan]]'s legislative body, and women earn just 60% of the salary of their male counterparts in the workforce.

AJWRC grew out of the Asian Women's Association, which was founded in 1977, when gender inequality was even more severe. It wasn't until 1985 that the Japanese government ratified a [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]],&lt;ref&gt;Yuji Iwasawa. ''International Law, Human Rights, and Japanese Law.'' Page 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and the country received failing marks as late as 1986 in [[Humana]]'s ''World Human Rights Guide''&lt;ref name=Iwasawa234&gt;Yuji Iwasawa. ''International Law, Human Rights, and Japanese Law.'' Page 234.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the status of women, and is one of the industrialized world's least equal countries in terms of gender gap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2011.pdf WEF Gender Gap Report]. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AWA initially focused on protesting the [[sex trade]], but as their influence grew, they expanded their mandate to tackle women's issues more broadly in the country, eventually forming AJWRC as it is today. According to the group's website, they work "to end all forms of violence and discrimination against women, toward democratic Japanese society based on respect for [[human rights]] and gender equality, and toward a fair and sustainable global society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajwrc.org/eng/modules/pico1/index.php?content_id=1 AJWRC Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metropolis"&gt;Jessica Ocheltree, [http://metropolis.co.jp/features/global-village/asia-japan-womens-resource-center/ Asia-Japan Women’s Resource Center], Metropolis, 9 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political campaigning}}

In [[political campaign]]s, an '''attack ad''' is an [[advertisement]] whose message is designed to wage a personal attack against an opposing candidate or [[political party]] in order to gain support for the attacking candidate and attract voters. Attack ads often form part of [[negative campaigning]] or [[smear campaign]]s, and in large or well-financed campaigns, may be disseminated via [[mass media]].

An attack ad will generally unfairly criticize an opponent's [[party platform|political platform]], usually by pointing out its faults. Often the ad will simply make use of innuendo, based on [[opposition research]].

Televised attack ads rose to prominence in the United States in the 1960s, especially since [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations require over-the-air [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial]] TV stations with licenses issued by the FCC—effectively all regulated TV stations, since others would either be [[Public broadcasting|public television]] or be [[Pirate television|pirated]]—to air political ads by both parties, whether it be attack ads or more traditional political ads. Although [[cable television]] and the Internet are not required to air such ads, attack ads have become commonplace on both mediums as well.

==Examples==

===United States===
[[File:Commercial-LBJ1964ElectionAdDaisyGirl.ogv|thumb|300px|thumbtime=3|"Daisy" advertisement]]
One of the earliest and most famous television attack ads, known as "[[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]]", was used by [[Lyndon Johnson]] against [[Barry Goldwater]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]]. The ad opened with a young girl innocently picking petals from a daisy, while a man's voice performed a countdown to zero. It then zoomed in to an extreme close-up to her eye, and cut to an image of a [[nuclear explosion]]. The ad was shocking and disturbing, but also very effective. It convinced many that Goldwater's more aggressive approach to fighting the [[Cold War]] could result in a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear conflict]].&lt;ref name="daisy"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er5h_TXun6o|title=Daisy Girl|medium=Television ad|people=Schwartz, Tony (director)|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attack ads were used again by the campaign of [[George H.W. Bush]] against Democratic candidate [[Michael Dukakis]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]]. The two most famous were the "Willie Horton" and "Tank Ride" ads. The "Willie Horton" ad began with a statement of Vice President Bush's support of the death penalty. Then it described the case of [[Willie Horton]], who was convicted of murder. The ad state that Governor Dukakis's prison furlough program (unsupervised weekend passes from Massachusetts prison) released Horton ten times; in one of those furloughs, he kidnapped a young couple, stabbed the boy and repeatedly raped the girl. The ad ended with, "Weekend prison passes. Dukakis on crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTdUQ9SYhUw|chapter=Analysis of a "Willie Horton" ad from the 1988 campaign|title=Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story|publisher=InterPositive Media|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Tank Ride" ad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm10.html |title=Michael Dukakis, 1988 – Another Landmark Image |work=100 Photographs that Changed the World |publisher=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801060800/http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm10.html |archivedate=August 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1988 was an attack on Dukakis by the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presidentialcampaign2004.coas.missouri.edu/general/spots_analysis/bush88tank_movie.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202175405/http://presidentialcampaign2004.coas.missouri.edu/general/spots_analysis/bush88tank_movie.html|archivedate=2008-02-02|title=Presidential Campaign 2004 – Their Message and Their Analysis|publisher=TV Spot History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the ad was inaccurate, it created a lasting negative impression and helped guarantee Dukakis' defeat. The ad suggested that Bush was more supportive of [[military spending]] and weapons programs than Dukakis. The footage, pulled from the news media, showed Dukakis riding a tank in his attempt to counter the claim that he was weak on defense. He wore a large, oversized helmet and a wide smile, which was used by the GOP to insinuate that he was a fool. The GOP also added gear sounds from an [[Semi-trailer truck|18-wheeler truck]] to imply that Dukakis could not run the tank smoothly – although tanks do not have gears that grind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geer, John G.|year=2006|title=In Defense of Negativity: attack ads in presidential campaigns|location=Chicago|publisher=the University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226284996|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic presidential primaries]] featured an ad by [[Hillary Clinton]] directed at her main rival at the time, [[Barack Obama]], which aired days before the [[Texas Democratic primary and caucuses, 2008|Texas primary]]. The ad began by showing children asleep in bed while phone rang in the background. A [[voice-over]] stated that it was 3 a.m., the phone was ringing in the [[White House]], and that "something’s happening in the world". The voice-over then asked voters if they wanted someone who "already knows the world’s leaders, knows the military" and is "tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world" to pick up the phone.&lt;ref name="oldref8"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yr7odFUARg|title=Hillary Clinton Ad – 3 AM White House Ringing Phone|year=2008|publisher=Hillary Clinton campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Obama was never mentioned by name, the implication was clear and the ad set off a firestorm of discussion and controversy, causing even Obama himself to respond and describe it as an ad that "play[ed] on people’s fears", predicting it would not work.&lt;ref name="oldref9"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/01/us/politics/01campaign.html?_r=1|author=Seelye, Katherine Q.|author2=Zeleny, Jeff.|date=March 1, 2008|title=Clinton Questions Role of Obama in Crisis|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the campaign, after Obama had become the Democratic nominee, Republican nominee [[John McCain]] echoed a similar sentiment. In a controversial ad called "Celebrity", McCain's campaign asked, "[Barack Obama] is the biggest celebrity in the world. But, is he ready to lead?" The ad juxtaposed Obama supporters with photos of [[Britney Spears]] and [[Paris Hilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McCain calls Obama the biggest celebrity in the world|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/07/30/mccain-ad-calls-obama-biggest-celebrity-in-the-world/|work=CNN Politics|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, attack ads had spread online as political candidates publish their ads on [[YouTube]]. [[Carly Fiorina]], a Republican candidate from California, released a video on YouTube depicting former Republican opponent [[Tom Campbell (California politician)|Tom Campbell]], as a "[[Fiscal conservative]] in name only”.&lt;ref name="oldref5"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/us/politics/21ads.html|author=Steinhauer, Jennifer|date=March 20, 2010|title=Dose of Venom for Candidates Turns Ads Viral|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
The first attack ads of the [[Mexican general election, 2006|2006 Mexican general election]] were launched by the conservative [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] against [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]]; the ad claimed that López Obrador's "populistic" proposals would drive Mexico further into economic crisis and bankruptcy. The [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] answered with attack ads against the current president [[Felipe Calderón]], claiming that he was partly culpable for the [[Mexican peso crisis|1994 economic crisis]]; since Calderón was running with a motto of "the president of employment", the ads closed with, "dirty hands, zero employments". After López Obrador alleged that Calderón was illegally patronizing his brother-in-law [[Hildebrando Zavala]], the tagline was changed to "dirty hands, one employment for his brother-in-law".

===Canada===
Although it has been found that [[Elections in Canada|Canadian elections]] are less likely to use attack ads than US elections, there is still remains a strong presence of negative ads in Canadian campaigns. Comparatively, Canadians were more likely to use acclaim ads- or ads that praise another individual- than Americans, as American campaigns are much more likely to use attack ads than Canadian campaigns. Overall, however, Canadian campaigns are more likely to use attack ads than acclaim ads, similarly to the US.&lt;ref&gt;Mahone, J. A. (2009). ''A comparative content analysis of televised political advertising in the United States and Canada in 2004 and 2008'' (Order No. 1478438). Available from ProQuest Central. (304874542). Retrieved from http://proxyau.wrlc.org/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/304874542?accountid=8285&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political usage ===
Political attack ads across all types of media can have different strategic aims. Some are character attacks, trying to persuade the viewer to think differently about a candidates character in hopes that they will reconsider their perception of the candidate and who they are as a person. Another strategy is an attack on the candidates' policy or political ideas. This attempts to derail one's support for a candidate by persuading them that the candidate-under-attack's political ideas are illogical or will be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Elmelund-PrÃ¦stekÃ¦r, Christian. “Beyond American Negativity: toward a General Understanding of the Determinants of Negative Campaigning.” ''European Political Science Review'', vol. 2, no. 01, 2010, p. 137., [[doi:10.1017/s1755773909990269]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-political usage===
While attack ads have primarily been relegated for political usage, there have been some instances of private businesses running them. In 2013, [[Highmark]], a healthcare company associated with the [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]], and the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] (UPMC) were unable to reach an agreement on whether Highmark's insurance would be accepted at UPMC. Highmark also entered into negotiations to acquire the struggling [[West Penn Allegheny Health System]]; Highmark and UPMC then started airing attack ads at each other. Both parties' ads accused the other of pushing patients with their respective health insurance plans to hospitals operated by their respective health insurance provider, as well as attacking each other's [[nonprofit]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2013/08/01/upmc-and-highmark-engage-in-tv-ad-war/|title=UPMC and Highmark Engage in TV Ad Wars|date=August 1, 2003|publisher=CBS Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/4481931-74/upmc-highmark-health#axzz2bXiuA6El|author=Pucko, Timothy|author2=Conti, David|title=UPMC sues Highmark over advertising campaign|date=August 5, 2013|publisher=TribeLive News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-city/upmc-pittsburgh-stake-positions-for-court-fight-on-nonprofit-status-680393/|author=Hamill, Sean D.|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|title=UPMC, Pittsburgh stake positions for court fight on nonprofit status|date=March 22, 2013|publisher= PG Publishing Co., Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on voter turnout ==
Studies suggest that attack ads have no effect on [[Voter turnout]] in the United States. There is, in fact, a noted negative impact on voter turnout by some researches, but it has no bearing on the evidence as it is statistically insignificant. The only case in which evidence reveals a correlation between negative advertising and voter turnout is for "late" negativity. This is when two conditions exist for the voter: they have already selected their preferred candidate and the attack and the negativity is about their selected candidate. If these two conditions exist, there is a negative effect on voter turnout. In this case, a forty percent increase in "late" negative ads will decrease the likelihood of turnout by 0.087, and a sixty percent increase in late ads merits a 0.145 decrease in turnout. Thus, the only case in which attack ads have been found to effect on voter turn out is when the voter has already selected their candidate, as they realize that their candidate is potentially no better than the alternative options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krupnikov|first=Yanna|date=2011-10-01|title=When Does Negativity Demobilize?

==Effectiveness==
Studies claim that 82% of Americans dislike attack ads, and 53% believe that the "ethics and values" of election campaigns have worsened since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipsitz|first=Keena|author2=Trost, Christine|author3= Grossmann, Matthew|author4= Sides, John|title=What Voters Want From Political Campaign Communication|journal=Political Communication|date=1 July 2005|volume=22|issue=3|pages=337–354|doi=10.1080/10584600591006609|url=http://home.gwu.edu/~jsides/polcomm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voting public see attack ads as an element of smear campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gann Hall|first=M.|author2=Bonneau, C.

In a 1999 survey of Virginia voters, 80.7% felt it is fair for a candidate to criticize an opponent for "talking one way and voting another", though but only 7.7% feel it is fair for a candidate to attack an opponent for the "behavior of his/her family members".&lt;ref name="freedman"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Freedman, P.|author2=Lawton, D.|author3=Wood, W.|title=Do's and Don'ts of Negative Ads: What Voters Say|journal=Campaign Elections|volume=20|pages=20–25|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political operatives, however, have found attack ads to be useful, and [[social psychologist]]s claim that negative information has a tendency "to be more influential than equally extreme or equally likely positive information."&lt;ref name=Lau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lau|first=Richard R.|author2=Rovner, Ivy Brown|title=Negative Campaigning|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=June 1, 2009|volume=12|issue=1|pages=285–306|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.071905.101448|url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/lau/articles/Lau-Rovner_NegativeCampaigning.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Toronto]] professor Scott Hawkins "suggests that even a mention in the media that a candidate or party is planning to run negative advertisements can be beneficial, since it plants seeds of doubt in the voter's mind, especially early in the campaign when voters tend to be less involved. If the reported claims turn up in advertisements later in the campaign, they already seem familiar to the voter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McGuffin, Ken|url=https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/news/detail.asp?ID=78|title=Political Attack Ads Can be Effective but Risky|date=May 2004|publisher=Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto|accessdate={{date|March 2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, researchers have consistently found that negative advertising has positive effects. Negative advertising "is likely to stimulate voters by increasing the degree to which they care about the election's outcome or by increasing ties to their party’s nominee;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.stevenfinkel.info/files/Finkel%20and%20Geer%201998.pdf|author=Finkel, Steven E.|author2=Geer, John G.|title=A Spot Check: Casting Doubt on the Demobilizing Effect of Attack Advertising|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=42|number=2|date=April 1998|pages=573–595|doi=10.2307/2991771}}&lt;/ref&gt; it makes the election seem more important, and thus increases [[voter turnout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Ken|author2=Freedman, Paul|title=Campaign Advertising and Voter Turnout: New Evidence for a Stimulation Effect|journal=The Journal of Politics|year=2002|volume=64|issue=3|doi=10.1111/0022-3816.00143|pages=721–740|jstor=1520110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found that negative advertisements only appeal to [[Partisan (political)|partisan voters]], and that it alienates independents, causing elections to be fought among partisan extremes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Iyengar, Shanto|author2=Ansolabehere, Stephen|title=Going negative : how attack ads shrink and polarize the electorate|year=1996|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=9780684822846|edition=1st paperbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backfires===
If an ad is seen as going too far or being "too personal", voters may turn against the party that put the ad out. For example, in the Canada [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]], the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative (PC) Party]] attacked [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] leader [[Jean Chrétien]] by implicitly [[1993 Chrétien attack ad|mocking his Bell's Palsy partial facial paralysis]]. Outrage followed, and the PC Party's image was badly damaged in the polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=1993: Is this a prime minister?|work=Political Attack Ads|publisher=CBC News Online|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/who-attackads/|medium=Interactive graphic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar backlash happened to the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2006 federal election, when they created an attack ad suggesting that Conservative leader [[Stephen Harper]] would use armed Canadian soldiers to police major cities. Though [[2006 Liberal Party of Canada election ads|the ads]] were never aired, they diminished the believability of other ads by the Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/canadavotes2006/national/2006/01/12/elxn-libs-research-military.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225113027/http://www.cbc.ca/story/canadavotes2006/national/2006/01/12/elxn-libs-research-military.html|archivedate=February 25, 2008|title=Martin says he only approved transcript of controversial 'soldiers ad|date=January 12, 2008|publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leaked copy, broadcast on the news, offended many Canadians, particularly the [[Military of Canada|military]], some of whom were fighting in Afghanistan at the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In the run up to and the [[2015 Canadian federal election]] itself, [[Justin Trudeau]], Leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and the son of Canadian Prime Minister, [[Pierre Trudeau]], was subjected to a sustained negative ad campaign by the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. However, the "Just Not Ready" campaign was judged by the public as unfair and mocking of the Liberal leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campbell|first1=Bradley|title=Stephen Harper underestimated Justin Trudeau, but it was the mocking way he did it that cost him the election|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-10-20/stephen-harper-underestimated-justin-trudeau-it-was-mocking-way-he-did-it-cost|accessdate=October 21, 2015|work=PRI|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, the advertising campaign lowered public expectations of Trudeau's performance that even Conservative personnel noted that he would impress people if he showed any display of competence in public events such as the televised debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hamilton|first1=Graeme|title=Graeme Hamilton: Justin Trudeau’s stunning victory for the Liberals should finally silence his doubters|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/graeme-hamilton-justin-trudeau-emerges-victorious-from-an-election-campaign-that-should-finally-silence-his-doubters|accessdate=October 21, 2015|work=National Post|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That proved to be the case, and Trudeau took advantage of the public's low expectations to impress the public with his articulate and passionate manner to garner support throughout the campaign until his party won a [[majority government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gagnon|first1=Michelle|title=Justin Trudeau's rise shows the benefits of being underestimated|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-justin-trudeau-michelle-gagnon-1.3259553|accessdate=October 21, 2015|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=October 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Republican challenger [[Paul R. Nelson]] campaigned against Democrat [[Ron Kind]] for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Nelson's ad stated, "Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money, he’d just rather spend it on sex," and, "Instead of spending money on cancer research, Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|medium=Television ad|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKln7salIrg|title=Paul R. Nelsion Sex Studies Ad|publisher=Paul R. Nelson for Congress Committee|location=Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson’s challenge fell short, as Ron Kind was reelected, while the attack's outrageous presentation provoked an uproar from Republicans and Democrats alike.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} A 1999 survey showed that challengers lose almost 3 points on the feeling thermometer (a 100-point scale used to assess survey-takers feelings on certain issues)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Survey Research Methods|title=Feeling Thermometer|editor-first=Paul J.|editor-last=Lavrakas|author=Nelson, Shannon C.|isbn=9781412918084|url=http://srmo.sagepub.com/view/encyclopedia-of-survey-research-methods/n183.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a candidate engages in [[mudslinging]]. The study also shows that the influence of negativity is less powerful for challengers than for incumbents.{{clarify|date=October 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2586118|author=Kahn, Kim Fridkin|author2=Patrick J.

== Front groups ==
Campaigns often establish or support [[front groups]] (organizations that appear to be independent [[voluntary association]]s or [[Charity organization|charity]]) to run counter-attack ads. This technique ties into the wider practice of [[astroturfing]]. Former political [[speechwriter]] [[Leonard Steinhorn]] points out that "issue ads" run by front groups use deceptive names to hide their true sponsors – such as the pharmaceutical industry–backed [[United Seniors Association]], which spent $17 million on ads during the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 US presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Leonard Steinhorn|author=Steinhorn, Leonard|year=2004|chapter=Ads Are Us: Political Advertising in a Mass Media Culture|title=Campaigns and Elections American Style|editor1-first=James A.|editor1-last=Thurber|editor2-first=Candice J.|editor2-last=Nelson|location=Boulder|publisher=Westview Press|page=121|isbn=9780813341811}}&lt;/ref&gt; As front ads are not controlled by the candidates they support, the candidates are insulated from criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Robert N.|title=Winning the War of Words: The "Front Group" Label in Contemporary Consumer Politics|journal=The Journal of American Culture|date=February 23, 2007|volume=30|issue=1|pages=96–109|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.2007.00467.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bible-related |interpretation}}

'''Bible prophecy''' or '''biblical prophecy''' comprises the passages of the [[Bible]] that supposedly reflect communications from [[Abrahamic god#The Supreme Deity|God]] to humans through [[prophets]]. [[Jews]], [[Christians]] and [[Muslims]] usually consider the biblical prophets to have received [[revelation]]s from God.

Prophetic passages{{mdash}}inspirations, interpretations, admonitions or predictions&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite OED|prophecy}} "b. An instance of divinely inspired speech or writing; a revelation from God or a god; a prophetic text. Also as a mass noun: such writings considered collectively."&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}}appear widely distributed throughout Biblical narratives. Some future-looking [[prophecy| prophecies]] in the Bible are conditional, with the conditions either implicitly assumed or explicitly stated.

In general, believers in biblical prophecy engage in [[exegesis]] and [[hermeneutics]] of scriptures which they believe contain descriptions of [[global politics]], [[natural disaster]]s, the future of the nation of [[Israel]], the coming of a [[Messiah]] and of a [[Kingdom of God| Messianic Kingdom]]—as well as the [[eschatology |ultimate destiny of humankind]].

==Overview==
Prophets in the [[Hebrew Bible]] often warn the [[Israelites]] to repent of their [[sin]]s and [[idolatry|idolatries]], with the threat of punishment or reward. [[Blessing]]s and [[Curse#Biblical curses|catastrophes]] are attributed to the deity. According to believers in Bible prophecy, many of these prophecies are viewed as having been fulfilled within later passages.

In Judaism and Christianity, a number of biblical passages have been taken as prophecies of a coming [[Messiah]]. [[Christian]]s believe that these [[Messianic prophecies]] are fulfilled by Christ [[Jesus]], while followers of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] still await the arrival of the [[Jewish Messiah]] and other signs of [[Jewish eschatology]]. Most Christians believe many messianic prophecies will be fulfilled with the [[Second Coming of Christ]], though some Christians ([[Full Preterism|Full Preterists]]) believe that all [[Messianic prophecies]] have already been fulfilled. Rabbinic Judaism does not separate the original coming of the Messiah and the advent of the [[Messianic Age]]. For details of the differences, see [[Christianity and Judaism]].

Another much-discussed issue concerns the "[[end times]]", or "last days", particularly according to the Revelation of John.

===Genesis===
{{See also|Covenant of the pieces|Greater Israel}}
{{bibleref2|Genesis|15:18}} promises [[Abraham]] and his descendants the land of [[Canaan]] from the river of Egypt to the [[Euphrates]], and Genesis 17:8 states:
{{quote|And I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are now an alien, all the land of Canaan, for a perpetual holding; and I will be their God.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis|17:8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[F. F. Bruce]] argues that the fulfilment of this prophecy occurred during [[David]]'s reign. He writes:
{{quote|David's sphere of influence now extended from the Egyptian frontier on the Wadi el-Arish (the "brook of Egypt") to the Euphrates; and these limits remained the ideal boundaries of Israel's dominion long after David's empire had disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce, ''Israel and the Nations'', Michigan, 1981 [1963], page 32.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

[[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]] point to [[corporate personality]] here to connect Abraham with the Jewish nation. [[H. Wheeler Robinson]] writes:
{{quote|Corporate personality is the important Semitic complex of thought in which there is a constant oscillation between the individual and the group – family, tribe, or nation – to which he belongs, so that the king or some other representative figure may be said to embody the group, or the group may be said to sum up the host of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6KubFGfBXUMC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=corporate+personality+Wheeler |first= Sidney|last= Greidanus|author-link= Sidney Greidanus|title= Preaching Christ from the Old Testament|date= 1999|page= 198|publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|accessdate= 2009-04-13 | isbn= 978-0-8028-4449-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Exodus, Deuteronomy, Joshua, and Judges===
God is represented as guaranteeing that the Israelites would drive out the [[Amorite]]s, Canaanites, [[Hittites|Hittite]]s, [[Perizzite]]s, [[Hivite]]s and [[Jebusite]]s from their lands, which the [[Israelites]] wanted to appropriate ({{bibleref2|Exodus|34:10–11}}). The same applies to the [[Girgashite]]s ({{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|7:1–2}}). In {{bibleref2|Exodus|34:10–27}}, this is referred to as a [[biblical covenant|covenant]], commandments being given. In Judges, the Israelites are described as disobeying the commandment to worship no other gods ({{bibleref2|Judges|3:6}}) and, as a result, not being able to drive out the Jebusites ({{bibleref2|Joshua|15:63}}). The Israelites did not drive all of the Canaanite tribes out in the lifetime of Joshua. The books of [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]] (Chapters 1) mention towns that could not be defeated. According to [[Books of Samuel|2 Samuel]], the Israelites occupied Canaan but the complete seizure took place only when David defeated the Jebusites in [[Jerusalem]] and made it the capital of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]]. ({{bibleref2|2 Sam|5:6–7}})&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Herrmann, ''A History of Israel in Old Testament Times'', London, 1981, SCM Press Ltd, page 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Davidic dynasty===
{{Main article|Davidic dynasty in Bible prophecy}}
God states that the house, throne and kingdom of David and his offspring (called "the one who will build a house for my Name" in the verse) will last forever (2 Samuel 7:12–16; 2 Chronicles 13:5; Psalm 89:20–37). 1 Kings 9:4–7 as well as 1 Chronicles 28:5 and 2 Chronicle 7:17 state that Solomon's establishment is conditional on [[Solomon]] obeying God's commandments.

Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 2:1; 6:7–10) and did not obey God's commandments (1 Kings 11:1–14).

The destruction of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] in 586 BC brought an end to the rule of the royal house of David.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=593&amp;letter=J|title=Judah, Kingdom of - JewishEncyclopedia.com|last=|first=|date=|work=jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars including Saul of Cyrene{{who|date=November 2018}} state that God has promised an eternal dynasty to David unconditionally (1 Kings 11:36; 15:4; 2 Kings 8:19). They feel the conditional promise of 1 Kings 9:4–7 seems to undercut this unconditional covenant. Most interpreters have taken the expression "throne of Israel" as a reference to the throne of the [[United Monarchy]]. They see this as a conditionalization of the unconditional dynastic promise to David's house expressed in 1 Kings 11:36, 15:4 and 2 Kings 8:19. They argue the presence of both unconditional and conditional promises to the house of David would create intense theological dissonance in the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]].&lt;ref name="Nelson1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard D. Nelson|title=First and Second Kings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCgUvQOIvD0C&amp;pg=PA29|year=1987|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-23742-4|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Joseph Collins|title=A Short Introduction to the Hebrew Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWNohGTPy48C&amp;pg=PA125|year=2007|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-6207-3|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChaferWalvoord1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lewis Sperry Chafer|author2=John F.

[[Christian]]s believe that the promise is of surviving descendants that could fulfill the role of king rather than a permanent earthly kingship.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, L. O.

===Kings===
*According to the [[Books of Kings]], God told [[Zedekiah]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down. You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon... You will not die by the sword; you will die peacefully. (Jeremiah 34:2–5)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Books of Kings and [[Jeremiah]] relate that Zedekiah's eyes were put out after he was taken to the King of Babylon and that he remained a prisoner in Babylon until his death (2 Kings 25:6–7 and Jeremiah 52:10–11). There is no other historical record of what happened with Zedekiah in Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Herrmann, ''A history of Israel in Old Testament times'', London, 1981, SCM Press Ltd, page 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

*God is also represented as promising Josiah that because he humbled himself before God, he would be ''"buried in peace"'' and the book goes on to say he shall not see the disaster to come on Judah (2 Kings 22:19–20).
Josiah fought against the Egyptians although the pharaoh, [[Necho II]], prophesied that God would destroy him if he did (2 Chronicles 35:21–22)—possibly Josiah was ''"opposing the faithful prophetic party"''.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce, ''Israel and the Nations'', Michigan, 1981, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Josiah was killed in battle against the Egyptians (2 Kings 23:29–30).  However, Judah was in a time of peace when Josiah died, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

===Isaiah===
{{Details|Isaiah 7:14}}
*When the Jews heard that "Aram has allied itself with Ephraim" God is said to have told them:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It will not take place, it will not happen... Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people. ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|7:1–9|31}})
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|28:5–6|31}} "God delivered the King of the Jews, [[Ahaz]], into the hands of the King of Syria, who carried away a great multitude of them captives to [[Damascus]]. And he was also delivered into the hand of the King of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter".&lt;br /&gt;In {{bibleverse||Isaiah|7:9|31}} the prophet says clearly that a prerequisite for the fulfillment of the prophecy is that Ahaz stands firm in his faith. This means that he should trust God and not seek military help in the Assyrians which Ahaz nevertheless did.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce, ''Israel and the Nations'', Michigan, 1981, pages 62–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Book of Isaiah also foretold;'''
*Babylon would be overthrown by the [[Medes]] ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|13:17–19|31}}) and its palaces taken over by wild animals. ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|13:21–22|31}})
Christian apologists state that the prophecy in Isaiah chapters 13 and 21 could possibly have been directed originally against [[Assyria]] whose capital Nineveh was defeated in 612 BC by a combined onslaught of the Medes and Babylonians. According to this explanation the prophecy was later updated and referred to Babylon&lt;ref&gt;''New Jerusalem Bible'', Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem – revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Isaiah 21:1.&lt;/ref&gt; not recognizing the rising power of Persia. On the other hand, it can be mentioned that the Persian King [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] after overthrowing Media in 550 BC did not treat the [[Medes]] as a subject nation.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Instead of treating the Medes as a beaten foe and a subject nation, he had himself installed as king of Media and governed Media and Persia as a dual monarchy, each part of which enjoyed equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce, ''Israel and the nations'', Michigan, 1981, page 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Damascus will become a "heap of ruins. The cities of Aroer will be deserted and left to flocks". ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|17:1–2|31}})
The prophecy may date from 735 BC when Damascus and Israel were allied against Judah.&lt;ref name="New Jerusalem Bible 1985"&gt;''New Jerusalem Bible'', Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem – revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Isaiah 17:1.&lt;/ref&gt; Tiglath-Pileser took Damascus in 732 BC,&lt;ref name="New Jerusalem Bible 1985"/&gt; which some apologists point to as a fulfillment of this prophecy, but this campaign never reduced the city to rubble.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The depiction of Damascus as a "heap of ruins" has been understood as figurative language to describe the despoiling of the city, the leading of its people as captives to Kir (an unidentified city), and the way that the city lost much of its wealth and political influence in the years following Tiglath-Pileser's attack.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TbMCAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=bible+then+and+now&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qMOCT9HTMqXQ0QXw8fWABw Jenny Roberts, ''Bible Then and Now'', MacMillan, p. 59]&lt;/ref&gt; The prophecy is also believed by some to have a future fulfilment relating to end-time developments concerning Israel.

The passage is consistent with {{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:9|31}}, which states that Assyria defeated the city and exiled the civilians to Kir.

*The river of [[Ancient Egypt]] (identified as the Nile in RSV) shall dry up. (19:5).
*"The land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt." ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|19:17|31}})
*"There shall be five cities in [[Ancient Egypt]] that speak the Canaanite language." ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|19:18|31}})
*"In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. 24 In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. 25 The LORD Almighty will bless them, saying, 'Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.'" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|19:23–25|31}})
Some theologians argue the statement that the "land of Judah" will terrify the Egyptians is not a reference to a large army from Judah attacking Egypt but a circumlocution for the place where God lives. They argue it is God and his plans that will cause Egypt to be terrified. They go on to argue the second "in that day" message from verse 18 announces the beginning of a deeper relationship between God and Egypt which leads to Egypt's conversion and worshiping God (verses 19–21). They say the last "in that day" prophecy (verses 23–25) speaks about Israel, Assyria and Egypt as God's special people, thus, describing eschatological events.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cLN08jf_C2EC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=isaiah+19:17#PPA360,M1 Gary V.

The unknown second prophet [[Book of Isaiah#Authorship|(See ''Deutero-Isaiah'')]] predicts the coming of Cyrus, ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|44:28|31}}, {{bibleverse||Isaiah|45:1|31}}) who will liberate the Jews from their Babylonian exile and bring them to the promised land. The second Isaiah, 40–55, comes from the late exilic period, about 540 BC.

There are many scholars, however, who point out that the prophet himself spoke of Cyrus arguing that Deutero-Isaiah interpreted Cyrus' victorious entry into Babylon in 539 BC as evidence of divine commission to benefit Israel. The main argument against the idols in these chapters is that they cannot declare the future, whereas God does tell future events like the Cyrus predictions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dBY5iuvcKawC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=isaiah+45+cyrus#PPA99,M1 Paul D.

===Jeremiah===
[[Jeremiah]] prophesied that;
*"...all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honour the name of the Lord." (3:17 (NIV))
*Hazor will be desolated. (49:33)
*The [[Babylonian captivity]] would end when the "70 years" ended. ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|29:10|31}})
It lasted 68 years (605 BC–537 BC) from the capture of the land of Israel by Babylon&lt;ref&gt;Jehoiakim in Harper Collins' Bible Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and the exile of a small number of hostages including Daniel, Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael ({{bibleverse||Daniel|1:1–4|31}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Promise and the Blessing |last=Harbin |first=Michael A. |year=2005 |publisher=Zondervin |location=Grand Rapids |isbn=0-310-24037-9 |pages=308–309}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted 60 years (597–537 BC) from the deportation of the 10,000 elite ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:14|31}}) including Jehoiachin and Ezekiel&lt;ref name="Harbin 2005 309"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Promise and the Blessing |last=Harbin |first=Michael A. |year=2005 |publisher=Zondervin |location=Grand Rapids |isbn=0-310-24037-9 |page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there is a discrepancy with Jeremiah's numbers of exiles ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:28–30|31}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Promise and the Blessing |last=Harbin |first=Michael A. |year=2005 |publisher=Zondervin |location=Grand Rapids |isbn=0-310-24037-9 |page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted 49 years (586–537 BC) from the exile of the majority of Judah ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:11|31}}) including Jeremiah who was taken to Egypt and leaving behind a poor remnant ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:12|31}}).&lt;ref name="Harbin 2005 309" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, some Christian scholars try to explain the figure in a different way stating that Jeremiah gave a round number.&lt;ref&gt;''New Jerusalem Bible'', Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem – revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Jeremiah 25:11.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The "kings of the [[Medes]]" would "take vengeance" on Babylon. ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|51:11|31}})
Christian commentaries have considered the conquering Persian force an alliance between the Persians and the Medes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wycliffe Bible Commentary: Old Testament''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Reader's Companion''&lt;/ref&gt; One suggests the use of the term "Medes" is due to earlier recognition among the Jews and because the generals of Cyrus were apparently Medes.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 51:11 in ''The Pulpit Commentary: Jeremiah (Vol. II)''&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Babylon Ruins Marines.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|US Marines in front of [[Babylon#Reconstruction|Babylon as it stood in 2003]]]]
*Jeremiah prophesied that Babylon would be destroyed at the end of the seventy years. (25:12) (Babylon fell to the Persians under Cyrus in 539 BC (66, 58 or 47 years after the beginning of the Babylonian exile depending on how you count). According to Daniel 5:31, it was the currently unidentified "[[Book of Daniel#Identity of "Darius the Mede"|Darius the Mede]]" who captured Babylon.)
*[[Babylon]] would never again be inhabited.(50:39) ([[Saddam Hussein]] began to reconstruct it in 1985,&lt;ref name=Babylon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolismag.com/html/content_0699/ju99monu.htm Monuments to Self | Metropolis Magazine | June 1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210184039/http://www.metropolismag.com/html/content_0699/ju99monu.htm |date=2005-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was abruptly halted by the [[invasion of Iraq]].

*"The Levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings, to burn cereal offerings, and to make sacrifices for ever".
The destruction of temple by the Romans in 70 brought an end to the Jewish sacrificial system.(33:18) (See [[Korban]]) Christians have stated this refers to the millennium in which Christ reigns for a thousand years, since Jeremiah 33:18 goes along with the eternal reign of the line of David in verses 21–22.&lt;ref&gt;J. Barton Payne, ''Encylopaedia of Biblical Prophecy'', 1996, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

*God will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals; and will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there.(9:11)
*God will have compassion on Israel and cause them to return to the land after scattering them among the nations (12:14, 15; 31:8–10; 33:7).

===Gospels===
{{Details|Abomination of desolation|Olivet Discourse|Second Coming}}
*In Matthew 10, when Jesus sent forth the twelve disciples, he told them:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the [[Son of man|Son of Man]] comes." (Matthew 10:23)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Christian response is varied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Moffatt puts it "before the Son of man arrives" as if Jesus referred to this special tour of Galilee. Jesus could overtake them. Possibly so, but it is by no means clear. Some refer it to the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], others to the coming of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] at [[Pentecost]], others to the [[Second Coming]]. Some hold that Matthew has put the saying in the wrong context. Others bluntly say that Jesus was mistaken, a very serious charge to make in his instructions to these preachers. The use of ἑως [heōs] with aorist subjunctive for a future event is a good Greek idiom.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, A. (1997). Word Pictures in the New Testament. Vol.V c1932, Vol.VI c1933 by Sunday School Board of the Southern Baptist Convention. (Mt 10:23). Oak Harbor: Logos Research Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Preterist]] scholars explain this verse as referring to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD with the phrase "before the [[Son of Man]] comes" meaning before judgment comes upon the nation of Israel and the city of Jerusalem for [[Rejection of Jesus|rejecting Jesus Christ as The Messiah]]. They reject to refer Matthew 10:23 to the second coming of Jesus because Jesus speaks to his disciples about the towns of Israel:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Such a view completely divorces the passage from its immediate and localized context, such as the fact that this was an admonition to the apostles – and not directed to a generation several millennia removed from the first century.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Zahn, F.F. Bruce, J. Barton Payne, etc. hold this opinion [http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/668-what-is-the-meaning-of-matthew-10-23 – What is the meaning of Matthew 10:23?]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Wycliffe Bible Commentary disagrees with this view:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the similar context of Mt 24:8–31 the great tribulation and the second advent are in view. Hence, the "coming of the Son of man" is probably eschatological here also. This would have been more readily understood by the disciples, who would hardly have thought to equate this "coming" with the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, C. F., &amp; Harrison, E. F. (1962). The Wycliffe Bible commentary : New Testament (Mt 10:16). Chicago: Moody Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In Matthew 12:40 Jesus says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth." (See also Matthew 16:21, 20:19, Mark 8:31, 9:31, 10:34, Luke 11:29–30 and John 2:19) According to Mark 15:42–46, Jesus was buried in Friday night and according to Matthew 28:1–6 and John 20:1, Jesus' tomb was found empty on Sunday dawn.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is customary for eastern nations to count part of a day as a whole 24-hour day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matthew 12:40 (multiple translations)|url=http://bible.cc/matthew/12-40.htm|work=bible.cc|accessdate=August 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Jesus prophesies in Matthew 16:27–28:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the Son of Man is going to come in his [[God the Father|Father's]] glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done. I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Christian responses have been varied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some of them that stand here (τινες των ὁδε ἑστωτων [tines tōn hode hestōtōn]). A ''crux interpretum'' in reality. Does Jesus refer to the transfiguration, the resurrection of Jesus, the great day of Pentecost, the destruction of Jerusalem, the second coming and judgment? We do not know, only that Jesus was certain of his final victory which would be typified and symbolized in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, A. (1997). Word Pictures in the New Testament. Vol.V c1932, Vol.VI c1933 by Sunday School Board of the Southern Baptist Convention. (Mt 16:28). Oak Harbor: Logos Research Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Preterism|Preterists]] respond that Jesus did not mean His second coming but a demonstration of His might when He says "coming in his kingdom". In this view, this was accomplished by the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD when some of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] were still living and thus fulfilling the word of Jesus that only some will not have died.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Knox Chamblin, Professor of New Testament Emeritus, Columbia Theological Seminary: [http://www.thirdmill.org/newfiles/kno_chamblin/NT.Chamblin.Matt.16.21-28.pdf Commentary on Matthew 16:21–28] – see last 4 paragraphs&lt;/ref&gt;
Others argue it refers to the Transfiguration.&lt;ref&gt;Blomberg, C. (2001, c1992). Vol. 22: Matthew (electronic ed.). Logos Library System; ''The New American Commentary'' (261). Nashville: Broadman &amp; Holman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walvoord, J. F., Zuck, R. B., &amp; Dallas Theological Seminary. (1983-c1985). The Bible Knowledge Commentary: An Exposition of the Scriptures (2:59). Wheaton, Illinois: Victor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wycliffe Bible Commentary states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This coming of the Son of Man in his kingdom is explained by some as the destruction of Jerusalem and by others as the beginning of the Church. But referring it to the Transfiguration meets the requirements of the context (all Synoptists follow this statement with the Transfiguration, Mk 9:1; Lk 9:27). Furthermore, Peter, who was one of those standing here, referred to the Transfiguration in the same words (II Pet 1:16–18). Chafer calls the Transfiguration a "preview of the coming kingdom on earth" (L. S. Chafer, Systematic Theology, V, 85).&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, C. F., &amp; Harrison, E. F. (1962).

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*He also prophesies to [[Caiaphas]] (Matthew 26:64, KJV):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The word "you will see" is in Greek "ὄψεσθε" [opheste, from the infinitive optomai]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scripture4all.org/OnlineInterlinear/NTpdf/mat26.pdf#page=13 Online Interlinear New Testament in Greek – Matthew 26]&lt;/ref&gt; which is plural. Jesus meant that the Jews, and not just the high priest, will see his coming.

*Jesus declared in [[Gospel]] accounts of Matthew, Luke and John that [[Saint Peter|Peter]] would deny him three times before cock-crow. Mark states that the [[rooster|cock]] crowed after the first denial as well as after the third denial. (First crow is not found in the NIV version)

Christians argue that the first cock-crow is simply missing from Matthew, Luke, and John. In Matthew ({{bibleref2|Matthew|26:34}}), Luke ({{bibleref2|Luke|22:34}}), and John ({{bibleref2|John|13:38}}), Jesus foretells three denials of Peter before cock-crow. {{bibleref2|Matthew|26:69–75}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|22:54–62}}, {{bibleref2|John|18:15–27}} report the fulfillment of this prophecy. In {{bibleref2|Mark|14:30}}, Jesus speaks of two cock-crows, which is mentioned in {{bibleref2|Mark|14:66–72}} as having taken place. Christians argue that Matthew, Luke, and John removed the first cock-crow and diminished (Luke even eliminated) the partial exit by Peter after the first denial (which Mark reports).&lt;ref&gt;''New Jerusalem Bible'', Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem – revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Mark 14:68&lt;/ref&gt; If Mark was the "interpreter of Peter",&lt;ref&gt;Papias, quoted in Eusebius, ''History of the Church'', trans. G.A. Williamson (London: Penguin Books Ltd., 1965). 3.39.15 / pp. 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt; he would have gotten his information directly and thus would be considered the more reliable source.

* Matthew 24:1,2 states (cf Luke 21:6):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. "Do you see all these things?" he asked. "I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Preterists claim these verses are metaphorical.&lt;ref&gt;John A.T., Robinson, ''Redating the New Testament'', London, 1976, page 20, "it was the temple that perished by fire while the walls of the city were thrown down"&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the destruction of the temple in A.D. 70&lt;ref&gt;Jos Wars vii. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilled this despite the existence of the [[wailing wall]].&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, C. F., &amp; Harrison, E. F. (1962). ''The Wycliffe Bible commentary: New Testament'' (Mt 24:2). Chicago: Moody Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, D. A. (1994). ''New Bible commentary'' : 21st century edition. Rev. ed. of: ''The New Bible Commentary''. 3rd ed. / edited by D. Guthrie, J.A. Motyer.  1970. (4th ed.) (Mt 24:2). Leicester, England;  Downers Grove, Ill., USA: Inter-Varsity Press. "But Jesus’ prophecy of not one stone left on another was to be literally fulfilled; all that survived the Roman assault was part of the platform on which they were built (including the ‘Wailing Wall’)."&lt;/ref&gt; The IVP Bible Background Commentary states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some stones were left on others (e.g., part of one wall still stands), but this fact does not weaken the force of the hyperbole: the temple was almost entirely demolished in A.D. 70.&lt;ref&gt;Keener, C. S., &amp; InterVarsity Press. (1993). The IVP Bible background commentary : New Testament (Mt 24:2). Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The parts of the wall Jesus refers to in the verse may not have included the wailing wall. Recent archaeological evidence suggest that the wailing wall part of the temple complex was not completed until an uncertain date in or after 16 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/uk-israel-archaeology-idUSLNE7AM01J20111123 | work=Reuters | first=Maayan | last=Lubell | title=Old coins force re-think on Jerusalem's Western Wall | date=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Matthew 24:7–8 is part of Jesus response to the disciples in verse 5 asking, "when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?" It states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The famines part of this verse has often been associated with the third seal of Revelation (Rev. 6:5–6), and the pestilences and earthquakes aspect has often been associated with the fourth seal of Revelation (Rev. 6:7–8).&lt;ref name="Wycliffe 24:7-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiersbe"/&gt; The presence of the term birthpains could be representative of better times ahead.&lt;ref name="Wycliffe 24:7-8"&gt;Pfeiffer, C. F., &amp; Harrison, E. F. (1962). ''The Wycliffe Bible commentary: New Testament'' (Mt 24:7–8). Chicago: Moody Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars point out that these events have always been on earth, so the verse must refer to a significant increase in the intensity of them.&lt;ref name="Wiersbe"&gt;Wiersbe, W. W. (1997, c1992). ''Wiersbe's Expository Outlines on the New Testament'' (88). Wheaton, Ill.: Victor Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also instances of erroneous, or untraceable, quotations from the prophets cited by the early Christians:
*Matthew 27:9 paraphrases Zechariah 11:12 and 13 in relation to buying a field for [[30 pieces of silver]], but attributes it as a saying of Jeremiah. Jeremiah is described as buying a field (Jeremiah 32:6–9) but for seventeen [[shekel]]s of silver rather than 30.

Christian writers have given several responses. First is that the use of Jeremiah is meant to refer to all the books of prophecy. Second is that although Jeremiah said this, any record has not survived. Third is this was the result of a scribal error because of the single letter difference in the abridged versions of the names.

*Matthew 2:23 refers to a prophecy being fulfilled by Jesus living in [[Nazareth]] which is not found in the Old Testament.

Christians have given several responses. First is that this prophecy has not survived to the present day. Second is the Greek word ''nazaret'' does not mean Nazarene but is related to the Hebrew word ''netzer'' which can be translated as 'branch'. Third is that the verse is not a prophetic saying but simply reflects an Old Testament requirement for the Messiah to be held in contempt, (Psalm 22:6–8; 69:9–11, 19–21; Isaiah 53:2–4, 7–9) which they argue Nazarenes were (John 1:46; John 7:52).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Answering The Atheist|date=January 18, 2004|volume=4|issue=3|url=http://www.lookinguntojesus.net/ata20040118.htm|publisher=Limestone Church of Christ|location=Kingston, Ontario, Canada|title=Where is the OT prophecy for Matthew 2:23?|accessdate=August 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725113534/http://www.lookinguntojesus.net/ata20040118.htm|archivedate=25 July 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{bibleverse||Mark|1:2–3|31}} quotes from both {{bibleverse||Malachi|3:1|31}} and {{bibleverse||Isaiah|40:3|31}} but attributes to Isaiah only.
Some scholars respond that this is because the Malachi reference was just an introduction,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yEKfTSCESyMC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=mark+1:2+quotation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zv_kN5KzCH&amp;sig=EAShA_5MsxlpGEZnneOLAWkKVk0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pmMSSvf5A9GBkQXHwd2EDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=23#PPA37,M1 Steve Moyise, M.J.J.Menken, ''Isaiah in the New Testament'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, page 37]&lt;/ref&gt; which made it significantly less important than Isaiah 40:3, leading to the whole being attributed to the prophet Isaiah. Other reasons given are Isaiah's authority was considered higher than Malachi and the Isaiah text was better known.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0MjWS_4La_EC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=mark+1:2+quotation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jj2-ZkRORJ&amp;sig=ocYLEdV4rLKZ6_O-f1KK8130LVk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pmMSSvf5A9GBkQXHwd2EDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=26#PPA27,M1 James R.

===Letters of Paul===
*Paul the apostle prophesied about the [[Second Coming]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. (1 Thessalonians 4:15–17)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Christians argue that Paul speaks about his own presence at the last day only hypothetically.&lt;ref&gt;''New Jerusalem Bible'', Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in ''La Bible de Jerusalem'' – revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to 1 Thessalonians 4:15: "Paul includes himself among those who will be present at the parousia: more by aspiration, however, than by conviction."&lt;/ref&gt; They point out Paul later states the Day of the Lord comes like a thief ({{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:1–2|31}}) which is a word Jesus uses himself ({{bibleverse||Matthew|24:43–44|31}}) expressing the impossibility of predicting His second coming ({{bibleverse||Matthew|24:36|31}}).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VPO4POTRD44C&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=romans+13:11Ben Witherington, III, ''The Paul Quest'', InterVarsity Press, 2001, pages 141–142]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Paul prophesied in 1 Thessalonians 5:2–11: "For you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, Peace and safety, destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape."
*In {{bibleref2|2Thess|2:3–4||2 Thessalonians 2:3–4}}, Paul prophesied that the [[Man of sin]] would sit in the temple of God declaring himself as God. The [[Temple in Jerusalem]] was destroyed in 70 AD.
There are different attempts to explain the term "to take his seat in the temple of God". Some understand it as a divine attribute which the [[Man of Lawlessness|man of lawlessness]] arrogates to himself and hence no conclusion can be drawn for time and place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W_OJNyhn8kgC&amp;pg=PA520&amp;dq=2+thessalonians+2:3+temple&amp;lr= Herman N. Ridderbos, ''Paul: An Outline of his Theology'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1997, pages 520–521]&lt;/ref&gt; Many in the early Church, such as Irenaeus, Hippolytus of Rome, Origen and Cyril of Jerusalem, believed a [[Third Temple|literal Temple would be rebuilt]] by the [[Antichrist]] before the Lord's Second Coming whereas Jerome and John Chrysostom referred the Temple to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aogf2fT9UhoC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=2+thessalonians+2:3+temple&amp;lr= T. L. Frazier, ''A Second Look at the Second Coming, Conciliar Press Ministries, Inc., 2005, pages 141–142]&lt;/ref&gt; Also some today's scholars refer the phrase "God's temple" to the Church pointing out that Paul used this term five other times outside 2 Thessalonians and does not refer it to a literal temple.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zlyPH_3Pvl4C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=2+thessalonians+2:3+temple Gregory K.

*1 Timothy 4:1–3 says "in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth".
The [[Church fathers]] such as [[John Chrysostom]] who lived at the time of [[Gnostics]], the [[Marcionites]], the [[Encratites]], the [[Manicheans]]—who rejected Christian marriage and the eating of because they believed that all flesh was from an evil principle—asserted this text referred to such sects and that they were therefore "in the latter times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.newadvent.org/fathers/230612.htm|title=Church Fathers: Homily 12 on First Timothy (Chrysostom)|last=|first=|date=|work=newadvent.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti004.htm|title=New Advent Bible: 1 Timothy 4|last=|first=|date=|work=newadvent.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Protestant theologian [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]]&lt;ref&gt;''Exposition of the Entire Bible''&lt;/ref&gt; believed that this refers to the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], particularly [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|priestly celibacy]] and [[Lent]] as promulgated by the medieval church. (see [[Great Apostasy]])
*Paul wrote in Romans 13:11,12: "...our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here."
Some Christian scholars believe the verses 11–14 refer to the era of salvation beginning with Christ's resurrection&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8WvWqGSiL2AC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=romans+13:11 J.

===Other New Testament books===
* The [[Epistle of Jude]] quotes a prophecy from the [[pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphical]] [[Book of Enoch]]. ({{bibleverse||Jude|14–15|31}}) Christians have argued that a canonical book quoting from a noncanonical source does not elevate the source to the same level; doing so simply addresses a point made by the other author. They point out the Old Testament quotes books never used in the canon, such as {{bibleverse||Joshua|10:13|31}} and {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|1:18|31}} quoting from the [[Book of Jashar]], and in the New Testament, Paul quotes pagan writers [[Aratus]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|17:28|31}}), [[Menander]] ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:33|31}}), and [[Epimenides]] ({{bibleverse||Titus|1:12|31}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Promise and the Blessing |last=Harbin |first=Michael A. |year=2005 |publisher=Zondervin |location=Grand Rapids |isbn=0-310-24037-9 |page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested that the author of Jude might have been aware that the text of 1 Enoch 1:9 which he was quoting is in fact a form of [[midrash]] of Deuteronomy 33:2,&lt;ref&gt;cf. comparison of texts in Charles, R.H. ''Book of Enoch with the Greek Fragments'', London 1904&lt;/ref&gt; so the prophecy is originally that of Moses, not "Enoch the Seventh from Adam" (itself a section heading from 1En.60:8)&lt;ref&gt;Nickelsburg, George W.E., ''1 Enoch'', Hermeneia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revelation===
*In this first-century text, Jesus is spoken of as telling the [[Seven churches of Asia|Seven churches of Asia Minor]] ({{bibleverse||Revelation|1:3|31}}, {{bibleverse||Revelation|1:7|31}}) that he will come "soon". ({{bibleverse||Revelation|22:7|31}}, {{bibleverse||Revelation|22:10|31}})&lt;br /&gt;(''see also'' [[Seven seals]], [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], [[two witnesses]], [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], [[The Beast (Bible)|The Beast]], [[Whore of Babylon]], [[Millennialism]])
The word "soon" (other translations use "shortly" or "quickly") does not have to be understood in the sense of close future. The [[Norway|Norwegian]] scholar Thorleif Boman explained that the Israelites, unlike [[Europeans]] or people in the West, did not understand time as something measurable or calculable according to Hebrew thinking but as something qualitative:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have examined the ideas underlying the expression of calculable time and more than once have found that the Israelites understood time as something qualitative, because for them time is determined by its content.'' &lt;ref&gt;Thorleif Boman, ''Hebrew Thought compared with Greek'', W.W.Norton &amp; Company, New York – London, 1970, page 137&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the Semitic concept of time is closely coincident with that of its content without which time would be quite impossible. The quantity of duration completely recedes behind the characteristic feature that enters with time or advances in it. Johannes Pedersen comes to the same conclusion when he distinguishes sharply between the Semitic understanding of time and ours. According to him, time is for us an abstraction since we distinguish time from the events that occur in time. The ancient Semites did not do this; for them time is determined by its content.&lt;ref&gt;Thorleif Boman, ''Hebrew Thought compared with Greek'', W.W.Norton &amp; Company, New York – London, 1970, page 139&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Messianic prophecies in Judaism==
{{Main article|Jewish messianism}}
The following are the scriptural requirements in Judaism concerning the Messiah, his actions, and his reign. Jewish sources insist that the Messiah will fulfill the prophecies outright. Some Christians maintain that some of these prophecies are associated with a putative [[second coming]] while Jewish scholars state there is no concept of a second coming in the Hebrew Bible.

===Jesus===
While Christian biblical scholars have cited the following as prophecies referencing the life, status, and legacy of Jesus, Jewish scholars maintain that these passages are not messianic prophecies and are based on mistranslations/misunderstanding of the Hebrew texts.
*Deuteronomy 18:18
*[[Isaiah 7:14]] – Matthew 1:22,23 states "The ''virgin'' will be with child and will give birth to a son, and ''they'' will call him Immanuel" — which means, "God with us". However the Jewish translation of that passage reads "Behold, the ''young woman'' is with child and will bear a son and ''she'' will call his name Immanuel."&lt;ref name="jewsforjudaism"&gt;http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/pdf/EnglishHandbook.pdf English Handbook Page 34&lt;/ref&gt; Isaiah chapter 7 speaks of a prophecy made to the Jewish King [[Ahaz]] to allay his fears of two invading kings (those of Damascus and of Samaria) who were preparing to invade Jerusalem, about 600 years before Jesus’ birth. Isaiah 7:16: "For before the boy will know enough to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose ''two kings'' you dread will be forsaken."
*[[Isaiah 53]] – According to many Christians, the suffering servant mentioned in this chapter is actually a reference to the crucifixion and suffering of Jesus on the cross to [[Atonement in Christianity|atone]] for the sins of mankind. However, according to the classical Jewish comentators, the suffering servant described in Isaiah chapter 53 is actually the Jewish people; sometimes Isaiah mentions groups of people as if they were one person.
*[[Ministry of Jesus#Capernaum as prophecy|Isaiah 9:1,2]] – In Isaiah, the passage describes how Assyrian invaders are increasingly aggressive as they progress toward the sea, while Matthew 4:13–15 has re-interpreted the description as a prophecy stating that Jesus would progress (without any hint of becoming more aggressive) toward Galilee. While Matthew uses the [[Septuagint]] rendering of Isaiah, in the [[Masoretic text]] it refers to the region of the gentiles rather than Galilee of the nations.
*[[Prophecy of seventy weeks|Daniel 9:24–27]] – King James Version puts a definite article before "Messiah the Prince". (Daniel 9:25) The original Hebrew text does not read "the Messiah the Prince", but, having no article, it is to be rendered "a mashiach, a prince". The word [[mashiach]]["anointed one", "messiah"] is nowhere used in the Jewish Scriptures as a proper name, but as a title of authority of a king or a high priest. Therefore, a correct rendering of the original Hebrew should be: "an anointed one, a prince." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/faq/faq043.html Jews for Judaism FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Flight into Egypt#Prophecy of Hosea|Hosea 11:1]] –  Matthew 2:14 states, "So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: 'Out of Egypt I called my son.'" However, that passage reads, "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son."
*[[Psalm 22:16]] – The [[New International Version|NIV]] renders this verse as "they have pierced my hands and my feet", based on the [[Septuagint]]. However, there is some [[they have pierced my hands and my feet|controversy]] over this translation, since the Hebrew [[Masoretic Text]] reads כארי ידי ורגלי ("like a lion my hands and my feet").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psalm 22:16 (New International Version)|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2022:16&amp;version=NIV|work=biblegateway.com|accessdate=August 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the NIV translation is correct, however, then it would also be a prophecy of crucifixion since the original text was written before the [[Persian people|Persians]] had invented the first early stages of crucifixition.
*Psalm 16:10
*Psalm 34:20 - States that none of the messiah's bones will be broken. In John 19:31-33, during the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, the Jews asked the Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] to break the legs of those who were being crucified because it was the [[Sabbath day]]. When breaking the legs of the two who were crucified with Jesus, they had come to Jesus and they had found that he was already dead and did not break his legs. Thus many Christians believe that this event  is the fulfillment of this prophecy.
*Psalm 69:21
*Isaiah 9:6 – The verse reads: "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called ''Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace''."
*Psalm 110:1 – Matthew 22:44 states "The Lord said to my ''Lord'': Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet." Although Hebrew has no capital letters, the Hebrew translation of that passage reads "The Lord said to my ''lord''" indicating that it is not speaking of God.
*Micah 5:2 – Matthew 2:6 quotes this prophecy as fulfillment of the prophecy: "But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel." The verse in the Old Testament reads "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." It describes the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb's second wife, Ephrathah. (1 Chr. 2:18, 2:50–52, 4:4)
*Zechariah 12:10 – According to many Christians this passage predicts the people looking on the Messiah whom they have pierced, while God's grace is being poured out on the House of David (Israel) and the city of Jerusalem.
*Zechariah 9:9 – The [[Gospel of Matthew]] describes Jesus' triumphant entry on [[Palm Sunday]] as a fulfillment of this verse in [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]]. Matthew describes the prophecy in terms of a [[colt (horse)|colt]] and a separate donkey, whereas the original only mentions the colt. Matthew 21:1–5 reads: {{cquote|Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, ''and'' a colt with her: loose ''them'', and bring ''them'' unto me. All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, ''and'' a colt the foal of an ass}}. The Hebrew translation of the prophecy reads: {{cquote|Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion!/Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem/See, your king comes to you/righteous and having salvation/gentle and riding on a donkey/on a colt, the foal of a donkey.}}
The gospels of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]] state Jesus sent his disciples after only one animal. (Mark 11:1–7, Luke 19:30–35, John 12: 14,15) Critics claim this is a contradiction with some mocking the idea of Jesus riding two animals at the same time. A response is that the text allows for Jesus to have ridden on a colt that was accompanied by a donkey, perhaps its mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Promise and the Blessing |last=Harbin |first=Michael A. |year=2005 |publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids |isbn=0-310-24037-9 |pages=415 &amp; 636}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Matthew 2:17,18 gives the killing of innocents by Herod as the fulfillment of a prophecy in Jeremiah 31:15–23:  "A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because they are no more. (The phrase "because her children are no more" refers to the [[Assyrian captivity|captivity]] of Rachel's children. The subsequent verses describe their return to Israel.)
* II Samuel 7:14 – Hebrews 1:5 quotes this verse as, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son.".

==Rabbi Rashi==
[[Rashi]], a 10th century French rabbi, gave the following commentaries regarding Bible prophecies:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/63255/jewish/The-Bible-with-Rashi.htm Chabad.Org Tanakh With Rashi's Commentary]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Genesis 15:18 " '''To your seed I have given''' The word of the Holy One, blessed be He, is like an accomplished fact."
* Genesis 17:8 " '''for an everlasting possession''' And there I will be to you for a God (Gen. Rabbah 46:9), but if one dwells outside the Holy Land, it is as though he has no God (Keth. 110b)."
* Exodus 34:11 " '''the Amorites...''' Six nations are [enumerated] here [not the proverbial seven], because the Girgashites [i.e., the seventh nation] got up and emigrated because of them [the Israelites]. -[from Lev. Rabbah 17:6, Yerushalmi Shevi ith 6:1.]"
* Deuteronomy 7:1 " '''He will cast away''' Heb. וְנָשַׁל. This is an expression meaning casting away, and causing to fly. Similarly is (Deut. 19:5),“and the iron [axe blade] will cause to fly [from the tree].”
* Joshua 15:63 " '''the children of Judah could not drive them out''' We learned in Sifrei : Rabbi Joshua the son of Korha says: They really could, but they were not permitted, because of the oath which Abraham had sworn to Abimelech. Now these Jebusites were not of the Jebusite nation, but the Tower of David which was in Jerusalem, was called Jebus, and the inhabitants of that section were of the Philistines. And when the children of Judah conquered Jerusalem, they did not drive out the inhabitants of that section."
* Judges 1:19 " '''but they could not drive out''' Targum Jonathan paraphrases: But after they had sinned, they were unable to drive out the inhabitants of the plain." 
* Judges 1:21 " '''the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem''' There was a section in Jerusalem called Jebuse, which was populated by the descendants of Abimelech who were not driven out because of the oath [which Abraham had sworn], until the coming of David. This was because his grandson was still alive and Abraham had sworn [Gen. 21:23] to him, his son, and grandson."
* 2 Samuel 5:6 " '''to the Jebusites''' Mezudath Zion is called Jebus. Now they (the inhabitants of the area) were of the seed of Abimelech, and they were in possession of two statues, one blind and the other lame, symbolizing Isaac (who was blind in his latter years. See Gen. 22:1) and Jacob (who turned lame as a result of his bout with the angel. See Gen. 32:26), and in their mouths was the oath that Abraham had sworn to Abimelech (Gen. 22:23). For this reason they (the Israelites who had conquered the land) did not drive them out, for when they took Jerusalem they failed to take the stronghold, as it is stated: “And the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the people of Judah were unable, etc.” (Josh. 15:63) - it was learned: R. Joshua b. Levi said: They were indeed able but were not permitted."
* 2 Chronicles 13:5 " '''a covenant of salt''' with endurance and permanence."
* 2 Chronicles 35:22 " '''and he did not hearken to the words of Neco from the mouth of God''' who said to him from the mouth of God, for so said Isaiah, (19:2): 'And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians.' This is what the Kallir composed: 'He withheld his troops from marching to Aram Naharaim, in order that no single sword should pass through Ephraim; and he did not hearken to the prophet to turn back, for it was decreed that Egyptian be set against Egyptian.'"
* 1 Kings 9:7 " '''and this house which I have made sacrosanct for My Name''' There is a condition between Me and You, “If you heed not…” What is stated there? “I shall make desolate your sanctuaries” (Lev. 26:31)."
* 1 Kings 11:36 " '''a kingdom''' Heb. ניר, a kingdom. ניר is an expression of a yoke."
* Daniel 2:38-45 " '''You are the head of gold''' You are the golden head of the image that you saw, for your kingdom is strong, and now it is in existence and is very prominent. '''And after you will arise another kingdom lower than you''' And after you, after the reign of your son, Belshazzar, will arise a kingdom that will take the ruling power from your seed, lower and humbler than your kingdom. '''lower''' Aram. אֶרַע, lower, as silver is lower and humbler than gold, and you saw that the breast, which is after the head, was of silver; so will the kingdom of Media and Persia, which will follow the kingdom of Babylon, be humbler than the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar. '''it will crumble and shatter''' It will crumble and shatter all the nations. '''it will be a divided kingdom''' It will be a divided kingdom; two kings will rise from it at once, strong and weak, as explained below (verse 42): “part of the kingdom will be strong.” '''that they will mingle with the seed of men''' They will intermarry with the other nations but they will not be at peace and truly cleave to them wholeheartedly, and their laws will differ from the laws of the other nations. '''And in the days of these kings''' in the days of these kings, when the kingdom of Rome is still in existence. '''the God of heaven will set up a kingdom''' The kingdom of the Holy One, blessed be He, which will never be destroyed, is the kingdom of the Messiah. 
* Daniel 7:4-8 " '''The first one was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle''' It was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle; that is the kingdom of Babylon, which was ruling at that time, and so did Jeremiah see it (4:7): “A lion has come up from its thicket,” and he says also (48:40): “like an eagle he shall soar.” '''until its wings were plucked''' Its wings were plucked, which is an allusion to its downfall. '''resembling a bear''' This represents the kingdom of Persia, which will reign after Babylon, who eats and drinks like a bear and is enwrapped in flesh like a bear. '''and it stood to one side''' and it stood to one side, indicating that when the kingdom of Babylon terminates, Persia will wait one year, when Media will reign. '''and there were three ribs in its mouth''' Aram. וּתְלָת עִלָעִין בְּפֻמַּהּ, three ribs. Our Sages explained that three provinces were constantly rebelling against it [i.e., Persia] and making peace with it; sometimes it would swallow them and sometimes spit them out. That is the meaning of “in its mouth between its teeth,” sometimes outside its teeth, sometimes inside (Kid. 72a), but I say that the three עִלָעִין are three kings who will rise from Persia: Cyrus, Ahasuerus, and Darius who built the Temple. '''four wings… four heads''' They are the four rulers to whom Alexander of Macedon allotted his kingdom at his death, as is written in the book of Joseph ben Gurion (Book 3, ch. 14), for this third beast is the kingdom of Antiochus, and it is called נָמֵר because it issued decrees upon Israel [which were] spotted (מְנֻמָּרוֹת) and varied one from the other. '''and… ten horns''' Aram. וְקַרְנַיִן עֲשַׂר. The angel explained to him that these are the ten kings who would ascend [the throne] of Rome before Vespasian, who would destroy the Temple.	'''speaking arrogantly''' words of arrogance. That is Titus, about whom the Rabbis, of blessed memory, said (Gittin 56b) that he blasphemed and berated and entered the Heichal with brazenness."
* Daniel 7:25 " '''until a time, two times, and half a time''' This is an obscure end, as was said to Daniel (12:4): “And you, Daniel, close up the words and seal,” and the early commentators expounded on it, each one according to his view, and the ends have passed. We can still interpret it as I saw written in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon, that they are the 1,335 years stated at the end of the Book (12:12): “Fortunate is he who waits [and reaches the days one thousand three hundred and thirty-five],” and he explains the appointed time as until the time of two times and a half time, and he [Rav Saadia Gaon] said that the times are 480 [years], which is the time from the Exodus from Egypt until the Temple was built, and 410 [years], [which are] the days of the First Temple, totaling 890, and another half of this time, 445, totaling 1,335. Figure these from the time the daily sacrifice was discontinued until the daily sacrifice will be restored to its place; it was discontinued six years prior to the destruction, and there is somewhat of a proof in this Book. [See Rashi to 8:14.] Others bring further proof to this computation, namely that (Deut. 31: 18): “And I, will hide My face” [the words] הַסְתֵּר אַסְתִּיר add up in gematria to 1,335." 
* Daniel 8:14 " '''Until evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred''' I saw an interpretation in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon for this matter, but it has already passed, and he interpreted further “until evening and morning,” that evening about which it says (Zech. 14:7): “and it shall come to pass that at eventide it shall be light,” and we are confident that our God’s word will stand forever; it will not be nullified. I say, however, that the עֶרֶב and בֹּקֶר stated here are a gematria, and there is support for this matter from two reasons: 1) that this computation should coincide with the other computation at the end of the Book, and 2) that Gabriel said to Daniel later on in this chapter (verse 26): “And the vision of the evening and the morning is true.” Now, if he had not hinted that the computation was doubtful, why did he repeat it to say that it was true? And the seer was commanded to close up and to seal the matter, and to him, too, the matter was revealed in a closed and sealed expression, but we will hope for the promise of our king for end after end, and when the end passes, it will be known that the expounder has erred in his interpretation, and the one who comes after him will search and expound in another manner. This can be interpreted [as follows]: namely, that עֶרֶב בֹּקֶר has the numerical value of 574, ע = 70; ר = 200; ב = 2; ב = 2; ק = 100; ר = 200. Added together, this equals 574; plus 2,300, we have 2,874. '''and the holy ones shall be exonerated''' The iniquity of Israel shall be expiated to bring an end to the decrees of their being trodden upon and crumbled since they were exiled in their first exile to Egypt, until they will be redeemed and saved with a perpetual salvation by our king Messiah, and this computation terminates at the end of 1, 290 years from the day the daily sacrifice was removed, and that is what is stated at the end of the Book (12:11): “And from the time the daily sacrifice is removed, and the silent abomination placed, will be 1,290 years,” and no more, for our king Messiah will come and remove the silent abomination. The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction of the Second Temple, and an image was set up in the Heichal. Now that was the seventeenth day of Tammuz, when Apostomos burned the Torah, put an end to the daily sacrifice, and set up an image in the Heichal, as we learned in Tractate Ta’anith (26b), but for the six years that I mentioned, I have no explicit proof, but there is proof that the daily sacrifice was abolished less than a complete shemittah cycle before the destruction, for so did Daniel prophesy about Titus (9:27): “… and half the week of years [shemittah cycle] he will curtail sacrifice and meal-offering,” meaning that a part of the week of years before the destruction, sacrifices will be abolished. So it is explained below in this section. Let us return to the earlier matters, how the computation of “evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred,” fits exactly with the time commencing from the descent to Egypt to terminate at the end of 1,290 years until the day that the daily sacrifice was abolished: 210 years they were in Egypt. 480 years transpired from the Exodus until the building of the Temple. 410 years the Temple existed. 70 years was the Babylonian exile. 420 years the Second Temple stood. 1,290 should be added until the end of days, totaling: 2,880. Subtract six years that the daily sacrifice was removed before the destruction, for Scripture counted 1,290 years only from the time that the daily sacrifice was removed. Here you have the computation of “evening and morning, and 2,300” added to the computation. Fortunate is he who waits and reaches the end of days 45 years over 1,290 [years]. We may say that the king Messiah will come according to the first computation, and he will subsequently be concealed from them for forty-five years. Rabbi Elazar HaKalir established (in the concluding poem of the portion dealing with the month of Nissan): in the foundation of his song: six weeks of years, totaling 42. We may say that the three years that did not total a week of years he did not count. And I found it so in Midrash Ruth that the king Messiah is destined to be concealed for forty-five years after he reveals himself, and proof is brought from these verses."
* Daniel 12:11-12 " '''And from the time the daily sacrifice was removed''' in order to place a silent abomination in its stead, are days of one thousand two hundred and ninety years since the daily sacrifice was removed until it will be restored in the days of our King Messiah, and this calculation coincides with the calculation of (8:14): “evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred” from the day of their exile to Egypt until the final redemption: Egyptian exile 210; From their Exodus until the First Temple 480; First Temple 410; Babylonian exile 70; Second Temple 420; Totaling 1590. The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction, which equals 1584. Add 1290, and the total sum is 2874; like the numerical value of בֹּקֶר עֶרֶב [574] plus 2300 [2874]." '''Fortunate is he who waits etc.''' Forty five years are added to the above number, for our King Messiah is destined to be hidden after he is revealed and to be revealed again. So we find in Midrash Ruth, and so did Rabbi Eleazar HaKalir establish (in the concluding poem of the morning service of the portion dealing with the month of Nissan): “and he will be concealed from them six weeks of years.”
* Ezekiel 29:11 " '''neither shall it be inhabited for forty years''' Forty-two years of famine were decreed in Pharaoh’s dream, corresponding to the three times the dream is written. He saw seven bad cows and seven bad ears of grain (Gen. 41) and he told it to Joseph; hence we have [it mentioned] twice, and Joseph said to him, “The seven thin and bad cows and the seven empty ears,” totaling forty-two for the famine. But they had only two, as it is stated (ibid. 45:6): “For it is two years now that the famine has been on earth,” and when Jacob came down to Egypt, the famine ceased, for behold in the third year they sowed, as it is stated (ibid. 47:19): “and then you give us seed that we may live etc.,” and the forty years were paid to them now: “neither shall it be inhabited for forty years.” תֵּשֵּׁב means sera asijiee in Old French. will be settled, peopled."
* Ezekiel 29:21 " '''On that day will I cause the horn of the House of Israel to blossom out''' I have neither heard nor found the explanation of this verse. What is the blossoming of the horn of Israel in the downfall of Egypt? Was not Israel exiled eight years before the downfall of Egypt? [Therefore,] I say that “On that day” refers back to the above section, (verse 13): “At the end of forty years, I will gather the Egyptians.” That count ends in the year that Belshazzar assumed the throne, and we find in Daniel that in that year the kings of Persia began to gain strength, and downfall was decreed upon Babylon, as it is said (Dan. 7:1): “In the first year of Belshazzar,… Daniel saw a dream, etc.” ; (verse 4) “The first one was like a lion” - that is Babylon. And it is written (ad loc.): “I saw until its wings were plucked off, etc. (verse 5) And behold another, second beast, resembling a bear” that is Persia. And it is written (ad loc.) “And thus it was said to it, ‘Devour much flesh.’” i.e., seize the kingdom. And the kingdom of Persia was the blossoming of the horn of Israel, as it is said regarding Cyrus (Isa. 45:13): “He shall build My city and free My exiles.” Now, how do we know that the forty years of Egypt ended at that time? [The proof is that] Egypt was given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in the twenty-seventh [year] of Nebuchadnezzar, in the year that this prophecy was said to Ezekiel. Add forty years, and you have sixty-seven. Deduct from them forty-five for Nebuchadnezzar and twenty-three for Evil-Merodach, as we say in Megillah (11b), one of these years counting for both [kings], as we say there: “they were incomplete years.”
* Ezekiel 30:4 " '''and there will be quaking in Cush''' [Heb. חַלְחָלָה,] expression of trembling. When they hear of Egypt’s downfall, they will fear for their lives: perhaps the king of Babylon will rise up against them."
* Ezekiel 30:18 " '''a cloud will cover her''' Trouble will come upon her and cover her, and it will become dark [for her] like a day covered with clouds."
* Ezekiel 30:21 " '''I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt''' already another time, for I placed his army in the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, as it is said in the Book of Jeremiah (46:2): “Concerning Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco, the king of Egypt, which was on the Euphrates in Carcemish, whom Nebuchadnezzar king smote, etc.” '''and behold, it was not bound''' from that day on, as it is said at the end of the Book of Kings (II 24:7): “And the king of Egypt no longer went out of his land, for the king of Babylonia had taken from the river of Egypt,” and with this expression Jeremiah, too, prophesied concerning that blow, using the language “it has no cure,” as it is said (Jer. 46:11): “Go up to Gilead and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt; in vain you have increased medicines, you have no cure.” חֻבָּשָּׁה is an expression of binding, for they bind the broken bone."
* Jeremiah 12:14-15 " '''My wicked neighbors''' Egypt, Ammon and Moab, Tyre and Sidon, who were neighbors of Eretz Israel and were inflicting harm upon them. '''I will return and have pity on them''' They all suffered close to the destruction of the Temple, and concerning each one it is stated in this Book, “I will return the exile of…” 
* Jeremiah 33:18 " '''for all time''' There shall not be cut off from them seed fit to offer up a burnt-offering or to burn a meal-offering."
* Jeremiah 34:5 " '''You shall die in peace''' Our Sages stated that Nebuchadnezzar died during his lifetime (Moed Katan 28b), for all the days of Nebuchadnezzar his prisoners were not freed from their imprisonment, and when Nebuchadnezzar died, Zedekiah emerged from the prison. He died the next day and was buried with pomp."
* Isaiah 7:9 " '''if you do not believe''' My prophecy, you, Ahaz, and his people, for I know that you are wicked. 
* Isaiah 7:14 " '''the young woman''' My wife will conceive this year. This was the fourth year of Ahaz. '''Immanuel''' [lit. God is with us. That is] to say that our Rock shall be with us, and this is the sign, for she is a young girl, and she never prophesied, yet in this instance, Divine inspiration shall rest upon her. This is what is stated below (8:3): “And I was intimate with the prophetess, etc.,” and we do not find a prophet’s wife called a prophetess unless she prophesied. Some interpret this as being said about Hezekiah, but it is impossible, because, when you count his years, you find that Hezekiah was born nine years before his father’s reign. And some interpret that this is the sign, that she was a young girl and incapable of giving birth."
* Isaiah 13:17 " '''Behold I stir up Media against them''' Darius the Mede assassinated Belshazzar. So Scripture states (Dan. 5:30): “On that very night, Belshazzar… was slain” ; (ibid. 6:1) “And Darius the Mede acquired the kingdom.”
* Isaiah 13:22 " '''and her days''' The days of her flourishing shall not be extended, for Israel was promised (Jer. 29: 10): “When seventy years of Babylon are over, I will remember you.” And that remembering will be through Cyrus king of Persia, who will take the kingdom from Babylon after Darius the Mede, for they both, Media and Persia, joined over it, [i.e., over Babylon,] and stipulated between themselves, if the kings are from us, the governors are from you."
* Isaiah 17:2 " '''The cities of Aroer are abandoned''' Jonathan renders this as an expression of destruction. Comp. (Jer. 51:58) “shall be destroyed (עַרְעֵר תִּתְעַרְעַר) , and he explained it in reference to the cities of Aram, i.e., Jonathan renders it: Their cities are abandoned, they are destroyed. The Midrash Aggadah (introduction to Lam. Rabbah 10 [with variations], Yalkut Machin) asks in amazement, since Aroer was [part] of Eretz Israel, as it is said (Num. 32:34): ” and Aroer.“ He is dealing with Damascus and he announces matters concerning Aroer? But, since in Damascus there were streets as numerous as the days of the solar year, and in each one was a pagan deity, which they would worship one day in the year, and the Israelites made them all into one group and worshipped all of them every day, he, therefore, mentioned the downfall of Aroer juxtaposed to Damascus. I explain it, however, according to the simple meaning of the verse, as follows: Since Rezin and Pekah son of Remaliah joined together, and the prophet prophesying about the downfall of Damascus, and saying, ” Behold, Damascus shall be removed from [being] a city," and the cities of Aroer which belonged to Pekah were already abandoned, for the Reubenites and the Gadites had already been exiled, and they were always given to the flocks of sheep, and the sheep of Moab would lie there undisturbed, he continues to say that the kingdom of Pekah shall continue to be gradually terminated, and that Samaria, too, shall be captured in the days of Hoshea, and then (v. 3) And a fortress shall cease from Ephraim and a kingdom from Damascusfor Rezin shall be killed."
* Isaiah 19:5 " '''And water from the sea shall dry up''' And the sea shall not return the Nile to its source, but the Nile will descend into it and will not ascend to water Egypt."
* Isaiah 19:17 " '''And the land of Judah shall be to Egypt for a dread''' When those remaining in Egypt from the captivity of Sennacherib hear of his downfall, that he will fall in the land of Judah without any physical warfare, they will know that the Divine Presence is manifest in Israel and that their Savior is mighty, and they will fear and be frightened of the land of Judah."
* Isaiah 19:18 " '''On that day there shall be five cities, etc.''' We learned in Seder Olam (ch. 23): Following Sennacherib’s defeat, Hezekiah stood up and released the armies he had brought with him from Egypt and from Cush in chains before Jerusalem, and they imposed upon themselves the kingdom of heaven, and returned to their place, and it is said: “On that day there shall be five cities, etc.” They went and built an altar to the Lord in the land of Egypt and they would sacrifice on it to heaven, to fulfill what was said: On that day there shall be an altar to the Lord in the land of Egypt. Some of our Sages expounded it in the tractate Menahoth (109b) as referring to the altar of the temple of Onias the son of Simon the Just, who fled to Egypt and built an altar there."
* Isaiah 19:23-25 " '''there shall be a highway''' And there shall be a paved road by which they will always go from Egypt to Assyria. '''and Assyria shall come upon Egypt''' Jonathan renders: And the Assyrians shall wage war with the Egyptians. '''Israel shall be a third to Egypt and to Assyria''' for a blessing, since there was no prominent nation in the world at that time like Egypt and like Assyria, and the Jews were humble in the days of Ahaz and in the days of Hoshea the son of Elah. And the prophet states that, through the miracle that will be performed for Hezekiah, Israel’s name will be greatly magnified, and they will be as prominent as one of these kingdoms in regards to blessing and greatness. '''Which...blessed them''' [lit. him,] i.e., Israel. '''Blessed is My people''' Israel, whom I chose for Myself as a people when they were in Egypt. '''and the work of My hands''' I showed them with the mighty deeds I performed wondrously against Assyria, and through those miracles they will repent and be as though I just made them anew, and they will be My heritage, Israel. Jonathan paraphrased this in a similar manner."
* Zechariah 10:11 " '''the waves of the sea''' to sink Tyre."

* Haggai 2:6 " '''and I will shake up''' with the miracles performed for the Hasmoneans. '''the heaven, etc.''' And they will understand that My Shechinah rests in this House, and they will bring gifts of silver and gold, as is written in the book of Joseph ben Gurion."

==Muhammad==
These passages have been interpreted by some Muslim scholars as prophetic references to [[Muhammad]]. This claim has always been unacceptable to most Bible scholars. All the following are Muslim scholars' interpretations of various Biblical passages.
*Genesis 21:13,18 – God promises to make [[Ishmael]] a great nation. Ishmael is the half brother of [[Isaac]], the father of the Jews. 
*Deuteronomy 18:18 and 33:1,2 – God promises to raise a prophet who would be among the brethren of the Jews and like unto Moses. Muslim scholars interpret "brethren" as a reference to [[Ishmaelites]], the ancestors of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Muhammad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicity.com/Mosque/Muhammad_Bible.HTM|title=Muhammad In The Bible|work=islamicity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe that Muhammad resembled Moses as a married father; warrior; law-giver; who was forced to immigrate; and raised by non-parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/prophet/bible_like_moses.html|title=A Prophet Like Unto Moses|work=themodernreligion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book of Mormon==
[[Mormons]] believe that the following biblical passages prophesy or otherwise support the provenance of the [[Book of Mormon]]:

*(Gold plates to come out of the earth) – Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. (Psalm 85:11)
*(Book of Mormon = Stick of Joseph; the Bible = Stick of Judah) – The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions: And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand. And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these? Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.(Ezekiel 37: 15–20)
*(Moroni thought to be the angel bringing the gospel in the form of the Book of Mormon) – "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." (Revelations 14:6,7)

==Use by conservative Christians==
Biblical prophecy is believed to be [[biblical literalism|literally true]] by a number of conservative Christians, such as [[Norman Geisler]] and [[Young Earth Creationists]]. Interpreters uphold this principle by providing details of prophecies that have been fulfilled.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Interpreters also dispute the legitimacy of non-biblical prophets and [[psychic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year =1999|title =Nostradamus (from Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics, Baker Book House, 1999)|publisher =John Ankerberg|url =http://www.johnankerberg.org/Articles/theological-dictionary/TD1001W4.htm|accessdate =2007-11-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060526/http://www.johnankerberg.org/Articles/theological-dictionary/TD1001W4.htm| archivedate= 28 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Peter Stoner]] and Dr. Hawley O. Taylor, for example, believed the Bible prophecies were too remarkable and detailed to occur by chance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} [[Arthur C. Custance]] maintained that the Ezekiel Tyre prophecy (Ezek. 26: 1–11; 29:17–20) was remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://custance.org/old/hidden/3ch3.html |title=Prophetic Fulfillments that are Indisputable: or A Tale of Two Cities |first=Arthur C. |last=Custance |authorlink=Arthur Custance |work=custance.org |accessdate=August 14, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725095745/http://custance.org/old/hidden/3ch3.html| archivedate= 25 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These interpretive issues are related to the more general idea of how passages should be read or interpreted—a concept known as [[Biblical hermeneutics]]. Bible prophecy is an area which is often discussed in regard to [[Christian apologetics]]. Traditional Jewish readings of the Bible do not generally reflect the same attention to the details of prophecies. [[Maimonides]] stated that [[Moses]] was the greatest of the prophets and only he experienced direct revelation.&lt;ref&gt;"Moses was superior to all prophets, whether they preceded him or arose afterwards. Moses attained the highest possible human level. He perceived God to a degree surpassing every human that ever existed....God spoke to all other prophets through an intermediary. Moses alone did not need this; this is what the Torah means when God says "Mouth to mouth, I will speak to him." "Maimonides' Principles: The Fundamentals of Jewish Faith", in ''The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology, Volume I'', Mesorah Publications 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Concern with Moses' revelation involves law and ethical [[Torah|teaching]] more than predictive prophecy. According to Maimonides'  [[Guide for the Perplexed]] the prophets used metaphors and analogies and, except for Moses, their words are not to be taken literally.

According to the [[Talmud]], prophecy ceased in Israel following the rebuilding of the second temple. Nonetheless [[Maimonides]] held that a prophet can be identified if his or her predictions come true.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Multiple fulfillments==
Many scholarly and popular interpreters have argued that a prophecy may have a dual fulfillment; others have argued for the possibility of multiple fulfillments. In some senses this has been occasionally referred to as an '''apotelesmatic''' interpretation of specific prophecies.

In [[Christian eschatology]], the idea of at least a dual fulfillment is usually applied to passages in the [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] books of Daniel or Revelation, and to the [[Olivet Discourse|apocalyptic discourse of Jesus]] in the synoptic gospels (Matthew 24, Mark 13, Luke 21), especially in interpretations that predict a future [[Great Tribulation|tribulation]] and a future [[Antichrist]] figure. [[Christian eschatology#Futurism|Futurists]] and [[Christian eschatology#Historicism|Historicists]] usually hold to variations of this view, while [[Christian eschatology#Preterism|Preterists]] see the same passages as applying only to events and persecutions from the time of Daniel through the first century CE.  Some who believe in multiple fulfillment tend to restrict the idea to a view of history where ancient events reflecting Israel and first-century Judaism and Christianity are predictors of larger future events to happen on a global scale at a point in time, while others tend to include symbolic applications of prophecies to multiple entities and events throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., "...the seven heads would mean all the oppressive, tyrannical civil governments during all human history from the days of Nimrod to the very end of time. This would be the larger view of the subject, what theologians call the apotelesmatic meaning of the prophecy, ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]''—the way the heavenly intelligences see it." {{Cite book|title=The Time of the End|last=Price|first=George McCready|publisher=Southern Publishing Association|year=1967|location=Nashville, TN|page=38|author-link=George McCready Price}} PDF copy retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://gospel-herald.com/price_gm/toe_index.htm|title=The Time of the End|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=7 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305205247/http://gospel-herald.com/price_gm/toe_index.htm|archivedate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Kett]] suggested multiple fulfillments in his 1799 book ''History the Interpreter of Prophecy'', in which he outlined numerous fulfillments for Antichrist prophecies, with chapters on the "Papal power", "Mahometanism" and "Infidelity" as parts of a long series of fulfillments of the prophecies.

[[Samuel Horsley]] (1733-1806) stated "The application of the prophecy to any one of these events bears all the characteristics of a true interpretation".&lt;ref name="Inspiration and Interpretation"&gt;As quoted by J. W. Burgon, in Appendix A of [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31090: ''Inspiration and Interpretation''](1861, reproduced online at Project Gutenberg).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moses Stuart]] (1780–1852) differentiated the idea that a prophetic passage has an inherent dual sense or double meaning from the idea of a later application of the prophecy in subsequent events, separate from the original prophecy: "In these principles there is no double sense; no ὑπόνοια ''[huponoia or "suspicion"]'', in the sense in which that word is usually employed and understood.  But there may be an apotelesmatic view or sense of a passage in the ancient Scriptures; and this is the case whenever a proceeding or a principle is reillustrated or reconfirmed.  This makes out no double sense, but a fuller and more complete exhibition of the one and simple meaning of the original.  Well may it be named a πλήρωσις ''[plerosis or "fulfillment / fulfilling"]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stuart|first=Moses|date=1852|title=Observations on Matthew 24:29–31, and the Parallel Passages in Mark and Luke, With Remarks on the Double Sense of Scripture|url=|journal=Bibliotheca Sacra|volume=IX|issue=July, 1852|pages=462, 463|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stuart noted prior usage of the term "apotelesmatic" by European interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stuart|first1=Moses|title=A Commentary on the Book of Daniel|date=1850|pages=192, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other interpreters have referred to an apotelesmatic meaning of prophecy as a collapsing of perspective of "near" and "far" or "inaugurated" and "consummated" fulfillments, where from the viewpoint of the ancient Israelite prophet local events affecting Israel are merged with end-time cosmic events relating to the kingdom of God.

[[Carl Friedrich Keil|C. F. Keil]] (1807–1888) suggested in an influential commentary "this uniting together of the two events is not to be explained only from the perspective and apotelesmatic character of the prophecy, but has its foundation in the very nature of the thing itself.  The prophetic perspective, by virtue of which the inward eye of the seer beholds only the elevated summits of historical events as they unfold themselves, and not the valleys of the common incidents of history which lie between these heights, is indeed peculiar to prophecy in general, and accounts for the circumstance that the prophecies as a rule give no fixed dates, and apotelesmatically bind together the points of history which open the way to the end, with the end itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Book of the Prophet Daniel|last=Keil|first=C. F.|publisher=T&amp;T Clark|others=Translated by The Rev. M. G. Easton, D.D.|year=1884|isbn=|series=Clark's Foreign Theological Library, Fourth Series, Vol. XXXIV|location=|pages=9, 10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventh-day Adventist theologian [[Desmond Ford]] (Historicist) termed this belief the '''apotelesmatic principle''' and stated "The ultimate fulfillment is the most comprehensive in scope, though details of the original forecast may be limited to the first fulfillment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/DesmondFordDaniel814TheDayOfAtonementAndTheInvestigativeJudgment|title=Daniel 8:14, the Day of Atonement, and the Investigative Judgment|last=Ford|first=Desmond|year=1980|isbn=|location=|pages=485|via=}} Ford's application of this principle to the Adventist understanding of the prophecy of Daniel 8:14 created a [[Sanctuary Review Committee|controversy]] that caused his termination of employment with that denomination.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Dispensationalism|Dispensational]] Futurist theologian [[J. Randall Price|Randall Price]] applies the term "apotelesmatic" primarily to the sense of "prophetic postponement" or "an interruption in fulfillment" that dispensationalists hold occurs between the sixty-ninth and seventieth weeks of the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks|seventy weeks prophecy of Daniel 9:24–27]]: "The technical expression for this delay in the fulfillment of the messianic program for Israel is derived from the Greek verb ''apotelo'' meaning, 'to bring to completion, finish.' The usual sense of ''telos'' as 'end' or 'goal' may here have the more technical idea of 'the consummation that comes to prophecies when they are fulfilled' (Luke 22:37). With the prefix ''apo'', which basically has the connotation of 'separation from something,' the idea is of a delay or interruption in the completion of the prophetic program. Therefore, ''apotelesmatic'' interpretation recognizes that in Old Testament texts that present the messianic program as a single event, a near and far historical fulfillment is intended, separated by an indeterminate period of time. Dispensational writers have referred to this as an 'intercalation' or a 'gap.' However, prophetic postponement better expresses this concept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Price|first1=Randall|title=Prophetic Postponement|url=http://www.worldofthebible.com/Bible%20Studies/Prophetic%20Postponement.pdf|website=World of the Bible Ministries|accessdate=7 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414044854/http://www.worldofthebible.com/Bible%20Studies/Prophetic%20Postponement.pdf|archivedate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Halley's Bible Handbook'', the ''Scofield Reference Bible'' and many other Bible commentaries hold that the "little horn" of Daniel 8 is fulfilled both with [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] (reigned 175-164 BC) and with a future Antichrist. Henry Kett, taking the writings of Sir Isaac Newton, advanced to identifying three fulfillments: Antiochus Epiphanes, the Romans, and a future Antichrist. Several [[Historicist]] interpreters (Faber, Bickersteth, Keith, Elliott, etc.) proposed the same, but noted that the Roman Empire is classified in two forms, the Pagan and the Papal, and that the Roman Empire was also split (East and West), and that in the East [[Mohammed]] or his religion were also meant, and more particularly the Turks, and that the final form (particularly according to authors writing after the [[Crimean War]] of 1853-1856) was Russia.&lt;ref name="Daniel-by-Neser"&gt;[http://israelmusthear.co.za/Books/The_Book_of_Daniel.pdf: Daniel by F.W.C. Neser]&lt;/ref&gt;

Methodist theologian [[Adam Clarke]] (ca 1761-1832) concurred with Anglican bishop [[Thomas Newton]] (1704-1782) that the [[abomination of desolation]] as a proverbial phrase could include multiple events “substituted in the place of, or set up in opposition to, the ordinances of God, his worship, his truth, etc.”&lt;ref name="sacred-texts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cmt/clarke/dan012.htm|title=Commentary on the Bible by Adam Clarke: Daniel: Daniel Chapter 12|work=sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for viewing some, or all of the following events as partial fulfillments of this prophecy simultaneously:

*  the re-dedication of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem to [[Zeus]] by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] in 167 BC
*  the worship of the Roman standards on the [[Temple Mount]] under [[Titus]] in 70 AD
*  the building of the [[Dome of the Rock]] by the [[Umayyad Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] in circa 690 AD

The [[British Israelism|British Israelist]] [[Howard Rand]] (1963) wrote, “because men have been able to see one—and only one—fulfillment, they have missed the greater scope of this prophecy and their understanding of the full message has been thwarted. ... Too, because of the double, triple and quadruple applications of this prophecy to world events, an enormous amount of history is involved in the cryptogrammic language of the vision.”&lt;ref name="Daniel-by-Rand"&gt;Rand, H. B. (1963) ''Study in Daniel'', (Merrimac: Destiny Publishers) pp. 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===End times===
{{Main article|End time}}
Among most [[Christian denomination]]s, the prophecy that [[Second Coming|Jesus will return to Earth]] is a major doctrine, which can be seen by its inclusion in the [[Nicene Creed]]. Many specific timeframes for this prediction have been declared by individuals and groups, although many of these dates have expired without the occurrences predicted.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Timeline of unfulfilled Christian Prophecy]]&lt;/ref&gt;  An official statement of [[Holy See|the Vatican]], issued in 1993, asserted, "''we are already in the last hour''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1993 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, Christ already reigns through the Church, statement 670) |publisher=The Vatican |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a7.htm |accessdate=2007-11-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929152621/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a7.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17543">'''Building services engineering''' is a [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineering]] discipline that strives to achieve a safe and comfortable [[Indoor air quality|indoor environment]] whilst minimizing the [[environmental impact]] of a [[building]].

'''Alternative titles''': The term ''Building services engineering'' is also commonly known as ''Architectural engineering'', ''Technical building services'', ''Building engineering'', or ''Facilities and services planning engineering''. The term ''Building services engineering'' is widely used in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (incl. [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]), but in the [[United States of America]], the field is also known as ''Building systems engineering'', ''[[Architectural engineering]]'' or ''[[Building engineering]]'', though the latter two disciplines generally have a broader scope, also encompassing elements of [[Structural engineering]] and more traditional architectural tasks such as room planning and material selection. In India the engineers are known as ''facilities planners''. In some counties, a ''building services architect'' is an engineer with experience in the integration of building services.

==Scope==
Building services engineers are responsible for the design, installation, operation and monitoring of the technical services in buildings (including [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[public health system]]s, also known as [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]] or [[HVAC]]), in order to ensure the safe, comfortable and [[environmentally friendly]] operation. Building services [[engineer]]s work closely with other construction professionals such as architects, structural engineers and quantity surveyors. Building services engineers influence the architectural design of building, in particular facades, in relation to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and indoor environment, and can integrate local energy production (e.g. façade-integrated [[photovoltaics]]) or community-scale energy facilities (e.g. [[district heating]]). Building services engineers therefore play an important role in the design and operation of energy-efficient buildings (including [[green building]]s, [[passive house]]s, and [[Energy-plus-house|Plus-houses]], and [[Zero-energy building]]s). With buildings accounting for about a third of all carbon emissions&lt;ref&gt;https://webstore.iea.org/technology-roadmap-energy-efficient-buildings-heating-and-cooling-equipment&lt;/ref&gt; and over a half of the global electricity demand,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/buildings/&lt;/ref&gt; building services engineers play an important role in the move to a [[Low-carbon economy|low-carbon society]], hence mitigate [[global warming]].

The career path of a building services engineer can take a very wide range of directions. Within the broad field of building services engineering, new roles are emerging, for example specialization in [[renewable energy]], [[sustainability]], low-carbon technologies, energy management, [[building automation]], and [[Building information modeling|building information modeling (BIM)]]. Building services engineers increasingly seek status as accredited [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), [[BREEAM]] (BRE Environmental Assessment Method), or CIBSE Low Carbon Consultants (LCC) and Energy Assessors (LCEA) auditors, in addition to their status as [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered]]/[[European Engineer|professional engineer]].

Building services engineering encompasses much more than just [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]] or [[HVAC]]), but also the following:
* '''Mechanical''' services:
** [[Energy]] supply – [[gas]], [[electricity]] and [[renewable energy|renewable]] sources
** [[Escalators]] and [[Elevator|lifts]]
** [[Heating]] including low-exergy (low-temperature) solutions
** [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]]. This includes clean-room solutions (e.g. hospitals, labs) and industrial ventilation (factory spaces and processes)
** [[Air conditioning]] and other applications of [[refrigeration]]
* '''Electrical''' services:
** [[Low voltage]] (LV) systems, [[distribution board]]s and [[switchgear]]
** Communication lines, telephones and IT networks ([[Information and communications technology|ICT]])
** [[Building automation]]
** [[Lightning]] protection
** [[Fire]] detection and protection
** [[Security]] and [[alarm]] systems
* '''Public health''' services:
** [[Plumbing]] solutions for [[water]] supply, both potable cold water and DHW (domestic hot water), 
** [[Drainage]] of waste water (sewage) from inside a building and drainage/treatment of external surface runoff around a building. Increasing use of grey-water recycling and solutions to delay runoff (e.g. green roofs and infiltration beds)
** Solutions for [[hygiene]] and [[sanitation]], including [[cleaning]], [[indoor air quality]], and health technology (e.g. isolation wards)
* '''Other''':
** Building-integrated features such as [[passive cooling]]
** [[Natural lighting]] and [[artificial lighting]], and building [[facades]]
** [[Building engineering physics|Building physics]], especially related to heat and moisture transfer, daylighting etc.

Examples of roles/duties a Building Services Engineer may have include:
* '''[[Consultant]] engineer''': Designing layouts and requirements for building services for residential or commercial developments. Design management is the business side of design, which aims to create the right environment to control and support a culture of creativity and innovation, and to embrace the iterative nature of design involving the many disciplines that, collectively, will deliver design solutions – and all at the same time as ensuring that an organisation’s commercial goals and objectives are achieved and that all is done in an ethically sound way. Typically the building services engineering installation is worth 30–60% of the total value of a contract. Design management is not the same as project management. Project management focuses on a wider range of administrative skills but is not normally sympathetic to the peculiarities of delivering a fully coordinated functioning design, taking into account its unique nature and dealing with the changing requirements of clients and the external factors over which there is little control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Portman|first=Jackie|title=Building Services Design Management|date=July 2014|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford:UK|isbn=978-1118528129}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[General contractor|Contractor]]''': Supervising the installation of the building services, commissioning systems. This includes tasks such as [[Testing, adjusting, balancing|TABS]].
* '''[[Facility management|Facilities manager]]''': Operation, servicing, and continuous commissioning of existing buildings and plant.

==Professional bodies==
The two most notable professional bodies are:
* The [[ASHRAE|American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]] (ASHRAE) was founded in 1894.
* The [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] (CIBSE) was founded in 1976, and received a Royal Charter in the [[United Kingdom]], and formally recognising building services engineering as a profession. Its objectives of the Institution are to: ''support the Science, Art and Practice of building services engineering, by providing our members and the public with first class information and education services and promoting the spirit of fellowship which guides our work.''

==Education==
Building services engineers typically possess an academic degree in building services engineering, [[mechanical engineering]] or [[electrical engineering]]. The length of study for such a degree is usually 3–4 years for a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (BEng) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc) and 5–6 years for a [[Master of Engineering]] (MEng).

The list below includes accredited education programs. In the United Kingdom, the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers ([[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers|CIBSE]]) accredits university degrees in Building Services Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cibse.org/membership/accredited-courses/list-of-accredited-courses&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[ABET]] accredits degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abet.org/AccredProgramSearch/AccreditationSearch.aspx Search All Accredited Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817205746/http://www.abet.org/AccredProgramSearch/AccreditationSearch.aspx |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building services engineering software==
Many tasks in building services engineering involve the use of engineering software, for example to design/model or draw solutions. The most common types of tool are whole building energy simulation&lt;ref&gt;K. Mahmud, U. Amin, M.J. Hossain, J. Ravishankar, "Computational tools for design, analysis, and management of residential energy systems", Applied Energy, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.111&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] (traditionally 2D) or the increasingly popular [[Building Information Modeling]] (BIM) which is 3D. 3D BIM software can have integrated tools for Building Services calculations such sizing ventilation ducts or estimating noise levels. Another use of 3D/4D BIM is that empowers more informed decision making and better coordination between different disciplines, such as [[collision detection|'collision testing']].

&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent members include [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], [[Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland|BUND]] (or Friends of the Earth Germany), and [[IG Bauen-Agrar-Umwelt|IG BAU]] (a multi-sector trade union).

A key issue for the Alliance is the prevention of new coal-fired power plants (the Anti-Coal Campaign).&lt;ref name="dirty-thirty-2014"&gt;

== Activities ==

=== Alternative Energy Summit ===

The Alliance organizes an Alternative Energy Summit annually to discuss energy and climate policy issues.

In a April 2016 media report over the future of [[RWE]], an Alliance expert stated that the power company had become completely unprofitable after failing to adapt to the [[Energiewende in Germany|German Energiewende]].&lt;ref name="muenten-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berlin Climate Talks ===

Since November 2015, the Alliance has organized the Berlin Climate Talks.  The format is now four per year, each with a different theme.  The launch event was devoted to civil society proposals for a more climate-friendly aviation concept for Germany.

=== Anti-Coal Campaign ===

Started in 2008, the most important campaign for the Alliance is the Anti-Coal Campaign.  The campaign coordinates and supports civil society activities to prevent new coal power plants from being built in Germany.  Coal is more carbon intensive than other fossil fuels, so that even the most advanced lignite-fired power plant discharges twice as much {{co2}} as a gas-fired power plant.  Coal power plants have a lifetime of 40–50 years and create high {{co2}} emissions throughout their lives.  Without a coal phase-out, the Alliance questions whether the German government can meet its future {{co2}} emissions targets.

Following a [[Greenpeace]] protest against [[lignite]] mining in the [[Lusatia|Lausitz]] in September 2013, a petition of 112,157 signatures in support was handed to the Lausitz authorities.  Daniela Setton, an energy policy speaker from the Alliance, commented that it was the most successful collection of signatures against a new German opencast mine ever.&lt;ref name="deutschlandradio-2013"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 the Alliance co-authored and co-published a report on the top 30 most polluting coal-fired power plants in Europe and called for their decommissioning.&lt;ref name="gutmann-etal-2014"&gt;

In July 2016, the Alliance, together with [[Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland|BUND]], the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]], and the [[Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung|Rosa Luxemburg Foundation]] released a report on the aftermath of [[lignite]] mining in Germany.&lt;ref name="iass-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The report, co-authored by [[:de:Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies|IASS Potsdam]], argues that the financial resources needed to remedy the damage caused by lignite mining are not adequately backed up by the existing mining operators [[Vattenfall]] (who later sold its lignite-fired plants and mines to [[Energetický a průmyslový holding|EPH]]), [[RWE]], and [[:de:MIBRAG|MIBRAG]].

=== Global Climate Day of Action ===

For the annual Global Climate Day of Action, the Alliance organizes nationwide demonstrations for the general public, to protest at the lack of environmental awareness in politics and the economy and to encourage climate protection measures.

Alliance spokesperson Katharina Reuter, in an interview with [[Deutschlandfunk]] in December 2011, criticized the exit by [[Canada]] from the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref name="geers-2011"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Networking and training ===

In addition to activist activities, the Alliance mediates and maintains the substantive and tactical networks of its member organizations and with other civil society actors.  In addition, the Alliance offers its members opportunities for further development, for example through specific seminars.

'''Clown society''' is a term used in [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] for an organization of comedic entertainers ([[Heyoka]] or "clowns") who have a formalized role in a culture or society.

==Description and function==
Sometimes clown societies have a sacred role, to represent a [[trickster]] character in religious ceremonies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Other times the purpose served by members of a clown society is only to [[parody]] excessive seriousness, or to deflate pomposity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In the sense of how clowns function in their culture:{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}
*A clown shows what is wrong with the ordinary way of doing things.
*A clown shows how to do ordinary things in a different fashion that is revealing of what would otherwise be perceived as the serious or true state of things.

Members of a clown society may dress in a special [[costume]] reserved for  clowns, which is often a [[ridiculous]]ly extreme or improper form of normal dress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Some members paint their body with horizontal black and white stripes, which represent a [[skeleton]].&lt;ref&gt;Lotsee Patterson, Mary Ellen Snodgrass (1994) ''Indian terms of the Americas'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=V7L54EZ5M1AC&amp;pg=PA122 p.122]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cazeneuve1957p242"&gt;Cazeneuve (1957) p.242 quotation: {{quotation|...leur corps est peint souvent de raies blanches et noires qui leur donnent plus ou moins l'apparence de squelettes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the [[Zuni people|Zuni]] clown society of the [[Pueblo Indians]], "one is initiated into the [[Ne'wekwe]] order by a ritual of filth-eating" where "[[mud]] are smeared on the body for the [[clown]] performance, and parts of the performance may consist of sporting with mud, smearing and daubing it, or drinking and pouring it onto one another".&lt;ref name="Parsons34"&gt;{{cite journal

While in their costume, clowns have special permission from their society to parody or criticize defective aspects of their own culture. They are always required to be funny. Other persons living within the same culture may recognize a clown when they see one, but seldom consciously understand what the clowns do for their society. The typical explanation is "He's just a funny man."{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In the case of the [[jester]] at the English Royal Court with his cap of bells and [[pig's bladder]] stick he was allowed to make fun of, be indelicate and sometimes downright rude to members of the royal family and their entourage without fear of reprisal.

Clown societies usually train new members to become clowns. The training normally takes place by an [[apprentice]] system, although there may be some rote schooling as well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Sometimes the training is [[improvisational comedy]], but usually a clown society trains members in well known forms of costume, pantomime, song, dance, and common visual gags. Occasionally these include a scripted performance, or skit, which is part of a standard repertoire that "never gets old," and is expected by members of the culture that the clown society is part of.

In Native North America. [[humor]] assumes "a sacred position within ceremonials";&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, Sally L. A. (2000). ''A disarming laughter: The role of humor in tribal cultures: An examination of humor in contemporary Native American literature and art''. Ph.D Dissertation, University of Oklahoma.=&lt;/ref&gt; examples are found in [[Trickster]] traditions, [[Pueblo clown societies]], [[Cherokee]] [[Booger Dance|"Booger" dances]], and aspects of the Northwest Coast Potlatch.&lt;ref name="Johansen05"&gt;{{cite journal

 | url = http://www.utpjournals.com/simile/issue18/Johansen1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humor is a fundamental aspect of Native American life, and has many purposes related to sacred rituals and social cohesion.&lt;ref name="Johansen05" /&gt;

==Examples==
* [[Circus clowns]] function as a clown society, in [[western culture|occidental culture]].
* [[Sacred clown]]s are called [[heyoka]] in [[Lakota people|Lakota]] Sioux [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American culture]].
* Members of the [[Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army]] combine the ancient arts of clowning and fooling with the relatively recent skills of non-violent [[direct action]].
* [[The Oxford Imps]]

==Difference from school for comedians==
A ''clown society'' is different from, but closely related to a school for [[comedian]]s. Comedians serve many of the same social functions of parody and social criticism, and also embody the role of the trickster, but a comedian usually only uses slightly exaggerated mannerisms to show that he/she is joking. Comedians who are not also clowns do not wear a blatantly outrageous or formalized costume.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Also, a ''[[comedian]]'' has to take personal responsibility for his/her humour and its consequences, whereas a person in [[clown]]-costume has some protection from reprisal.

&lt;!-- There is another difference between a "comedian" and a "comic" a comic is nearer to the traditional clown, as in the case of someone like Ken Dodd who wears loud and exaggerated costumes but still is basically a "stand-up" and manages to bridge the gap between the two different styles. --&gt;
As a general rule, a ''[[comedian]]'' says funny things, a ''[[comic]]'' does funny things, and a ''[[clown]]'' does things funny.

'''Computer ethics''' is a part of [[practical philosophy]] concerned with how computing professionals should make decisions regarding professional and social conduct.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southernct.edu/organizations/rccs/resources/research/introduction/bynum_shrt_hist.html#maner|title=A Very Short History of Computer Ethics |last= Bynum |first=Terrell Ward |publisher=Southern Connecticut Wein University|accessdate=2011-01-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418122849/http://www.southernct.edu/organizations/rccs/resources/research/introduction/bynum_shrt_hist.html|archivedate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Margaret Anne Pierce, a professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computers at Georgia Southern University has categorized the ethical decisions related to computer technology and usage into three primary influences:
# The individual's own personal code.
# Any informal code of ethical conduct that exists in the work place.
# Exposure to formal codes of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pierce |first1=Margaret Anne |last2=Henry |first2=John W. |title=Computer ethics: The role of personal, informal, and formal codes |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=April 1996 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=425–437 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m3201253822641r0/ |doi=10.1007/BF00380363 }} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
The term computer ethics was first coined by Walter Maner,&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt; a professor at [[Bowling Green State University]]. The conceptual foundations of computer ethics are investigated by [[information ethics]], a branch of philosophical [[ethics]] promoted, among others, by [[Luciano Floridi]].&lt;ref name=InformationEthics&gt;

==History==
The concept of computer ethics originated in the 1940s with MIT professor [[Norbert Wiener]], the American mathematician and philosopher. While working on anti-aircraft artillery during [[World War II]], Wiener and his fellow engineers developed a system of communication between the part of a cannon that tracked a warplane, the part that performed calculations to estimate a trajectory, and the part responsible for firing.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt; Wiener termed the science of such information feedback systems "[[cybernetics]]," and he discussed this new field with its related ethical concerns in his 1948 book, ''Cybernetics''.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;&lt;ref name=BynumSEP&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bynum |first1=Terrell |title=Computer Ethics: Basic Concepts and Historical Overview |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/ethics-computer/ |date=21 December 2014 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Wiener's second book, ''[[The Human Use of Human Beings]]'', delved deeper into the ethical issues surrounding information technology and laid out the basic foundations of computer ethics.&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt;

A bit later during the same year the world's first [[computer crime]] was committed. A programmer was able to use a bit of computer code to stop his banking account from being flagged as overdrawn. However, there were no laws in place at that time to stop him, and as a result he was not charged.&lt;ref name=BriefHistory&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Computer Ethics |url=http://www.comphist.org/computing_history/new_page_5.htm |website=Learning Computing History |date=5 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors. No references.|date=April 2015}} To make sure another person did not follow suit, an ethics code for computers was needed.

In 1973, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) adopted its first code of ethics.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt; [[SRI International]]'s [[Donn B. Parker|Donn Parker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/about/alumni/alumni-hall-fame-2002#Parker|title=Alumni Hall of Fame: Donn Parker|publisher=SRI International|accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; an author on computer crimes, led the committee that developed the code.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;

In 1976, medical teacher and researcher Walter Maner noticed that ethical decisions are much harder to make when computers are added. He noticed a need for a different branch of ethics for when it came to dealing with computers. The term "computer ethics" was thus invented.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt;

In 1976 [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] made his second significant addition to the field of computer ethics. He published a book titled ''[[Computer Power and Human Reason]]'',&lt;ref name=ObituaryWeizenbaum&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Joseph Weizenbaum |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V128/N12/weizenbaum.html |newspaper=The Tech |edition=Online |volume=128 |issue=12 |date=14 March 2008 |publisher=MIT News office |location=Cambridge, MA |accessdate=29 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which talked about how [[artificial intelligence]] is good for the world; however it should never be allowed to make the most important decisions as it does not have human qualities such as wisdom. By far the most important point he makes in the book is the distinction between choosing and deciding. He argued that deciding is a computational activity while making choices is not and thus the ability to make choices is what makes us humans.

At a later time during the same year [[Abbe Mowshowitz]], a professor of Computer Science at the City College of New York, published an article titled "On approaches to the study of social issues in computing." This article identified and analyzed technical and non-technical biases in research on social issues present in computing.

During 1978, the [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]] was adopted by the United States Congress, drastically limiting the government's ability to search bank records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Right to Financial Privacy Act |website=Electronic Privacy Information Center |url=https://epic.org/privacy/rfpa/ |accessdate=29 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year [[Terrell Ward Bynum]], the professor of Philosophy at Southern Connecticut State University as well as Director of the Research Center on Computing and Society there, developed the first ever curriculum for a university course on computer ethics.{{Citation needed |date=April 2015}} Bynum was also editor of the journal ''[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]].''&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt; In 1983 the journal held an essay contest on the topic of computer ethics and published the winning essays in its best-selling 1985 special issue, “Computers and Ethics.”&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;

In 1984, the United States Congress passed the Small Business Computer Security and Education Act, which created a [[Small Business Administration]] advisory council to focus on computer security related to small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|98|HR|3075|pipe=Small Business Computer Security and Education Act of 1984|site=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1985, [[James Moor]], Professor of Philosophy at DartMouth College in New Hampshire, published an essay called "What is Computer Ethics?"&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt; In this essay Moor states the computer ethics includes the following: "(1) identification of computer-generated policy vacuums, (2) clarification of conceptual muddles, (3) formulation of policies for the use of computer technology, and (4) ethical justification of such policies."&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;

During the same year, Deborah Johnson, Professor of Applied Ethics and Chair of the Department of Science, Technology, and Society in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences of the University of Virginia, got the first major computer ethics textbook published.&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt; Johnson's textbook identified major issues for research in computer ethics for more than 10 years after publication of the first edition.&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt;

In 1988, Robert Hauptman, a librarian at St. Cloud University, came up with "[[information ethics]]", a term that was used to describe the storage, production, access and dissemination of information.&lt;ref name=BriefHistory/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors. No references.|date=April 2015}} Near the same time, the [[Privacy Act of 1974#Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act|Computer Matching and Privacy Act]] was adopted and this act restricted United States government programs identifying debtors.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|100|S|496|pipe=Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988|site=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1992, ACM adopted a new set of ethical rules called "ACM code of Ethics and Professional Conduct"&lt;ref name=ACMethics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics|title=ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] |date=16 October 1992 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of 24 statements of personal responsibility.

Three years later, in 1995, Krystyna Górniak-Kocikowska, a Professor of Philosophy at Southern Connecticut State University, Coordinator of the Religious Studies Program, as well as a Senior Research Associate in the Research Center on Computing and Society, came up with the idea that computer ethics will eventually become a global ethical system and soon after, computer ethics would replace ethics altogether as it would become the standard ethics of the information age.&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt;

In 1999, Deborah Johnson revealed her view, which was quite contrary to Górniak-Kocikowska's belief, and stated that computer ethics will not evolve but rather be our old ethics with a slight twist.&lt;ref name=BriefHistory/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors. No references.|date=April 2015}}

Post 20th century, as a result to much debate of ethical guidelines, many organizations such as ABET&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abet.org/about-abet/|title=About ABET {{!}} ABET|website=www.abet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer ethical accreditation to University or College applications such as "Applied and Natural Science, Computing, Engineering and Engineering Technology at the associate, bachelor, and master levels" to try and promote quality works that follow sound ethical and moral guidelines.

==Internet privacy==
{{main|internet privacy}}
[[Privacy]] is one of the major issues that has emerged since the internet has become part of many aspects of daily life. Internet users hand over [[personal information]] in order to sign up or register for services without realizing that they are potentially setting themselves up for invasions of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;CSC300 Lecture Notes @ University of Toronto, 2011. For more information on this topic, please visit the [http://epic.org Electronic Privacy Information Center] website.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=April 2015}}

Another example of [[privacy issues]], with concern to [[Google]], is [[Website visitor tracking|tracking]] [[web search|searches]]. There is a feature within searching that allows Google to keep track of searches so that advertisements will match your search criteria, which in turn means using people as products.

There is an ongoing discussion about what privacy and privacy enforcement measures imply. With the increase in [[social networking]] sites, more and more people are allowing their private information to be shared publicly. On the surface, this may be seen as someone listing private information about them on a social networking site, but below the surface, it is the site that could be sharing the information (not the individual). This is the idea of an [[opt-in]] versus [[opt-out]] situation. There are many privacy statements that state whether there is an opt-in or an opt-out policy. Typically an opt-in [[privacy policy]] means that the individual has to tell the company issuing the privacy policy if they want their information shared or not. Opt-out means that their information will be shared unless the individual tells the company not to share it.

==Identifying issues==
Identifying ''ethical'' issues as they arise, as well as defining how to deal with them, has traditionally been problematic. In solving problems relating to ethical issues, [[Michael Davis (philosopher)|Michael Davis]] proposed a unique problem-solving method. In Davis's model, the ethical problem is stated, facts are checked, and a list of options is generated by considering relevant factors relating to the problem.  The actual action taken is influenced by specific ethical standards.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Ethical standards==
Various national and international professional societies and organizations have produced code of ethics documents to give basic behavioral guidelines to computing professionals and users.  They include:

== Life ==
Born in [[Elgin, Illinois]], Meadows was educated in science, receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[chemistry]] from [[Carleton College]] in 1963 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[biophysics]] from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1968. After a yearlong trip from England to Sri Lanka and back, she became a research fellow at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], as a member of a team in the department created by [[Jay Forrester]], the inventor of [[system dynamics]] as well as the principle of magnetic data storage for computers. She taught at [[Dartmouth College]] for 29 years, beginning in 1972.&lt;ref name = "meadows2008"&gt;Meadows, Donella H. 2008, ''Thinking in Systems: A Primer'', Chelsea Green Publishing, Vermont, p. 213 (About the Author), {{ISBN|978-1-60358-055-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 2001 of a bacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/171610/limits-growth-book-launched-movement 'The Limits to Growth': A Book That Launched a Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meadows was honored both as a Pew Scholar in Conservation and Environment (1991) and as a [[MacArthur Fellowship|MacArthur Fellow]] (1994).&lt;ref name = "meadows2008" /&gt; She received the Walter C. Paine Science Education Award in 1990. Posthumously, she received the [[John H. Chafee]] Excellence in Environmental Affairs Award for 2001, presented by the [[Conservation Law Foundation]].

Meadows wrote "The Global Citizen,"&lt;ref name = "meadows2008" /&gt; a weekly column on world events from a systems point of view. Many of these columns were compiled and published as a book by the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8yE5PzCacXoC&amp;dq=global+citizen&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7nP7JSAhIS&amp;sig=EutjsehkGNfPYVkpJzzLTGvwapk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cPxNSp_eCYXk7AOu4KyKBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3 The Global Citizen Donella H. Meadows, 1991; 300 pp. Island Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is recognized as a formative influence on hundreds of other academic studies, government policy initiatives, and international agreements.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Meadows was a longtime member of the United States Association for the [[Club of Rome]], which instituted an award in her memory, the US Association for the Club of Rome Donella Meadows Award in Sustainable Global Actions. The award is given to an outstanding individual who has created actions in a global framework toward the sustainability goals Meadows expressed in her writings.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Work ==

=== ''The Limits to Growth'' ===
{{main article|The Limits to Growth}}

In 1972, she was on the MIT team that produced the global [[computer simulation|computer model]] "[[World3]]" for the [[Club of Rome]], providing the basis for ''The Limits to Growth.'' The book reported a study of long-term global trends in population, economics, and the environment. The book made headlines around the world and began a debate about the limits of [[Earth]]'s capacity to support human economic expansion—a debate that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;"To Grow or not to Grow", Newsweek, March 13, 1972, pages 102-103&lt;/ref&gt; Meadows was the book's lead author, and it had three coauthors: her husband [[Dennis Meadows]], [[Jørgen Randers]], and William W. Behrens III.

===The Balaton Group===
In 1982, Donella and Dennis Meadows created an international "network of networks" for leading researchers on resource use, environmental conservation, systems modeling, and sustainability. Since its foundation, the members have met at [[Lake Balaton]], Hungary, every autumn. While the formal name for the network was the International Network of Resource Information Centres (INRIC), it became more popularly known as the [[Balaton Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Balaton Group History |url=http://www.balatongroup.org/FAQ.html |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2015-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205175146/http://www.balatongroup.org/FAQ.html |archivedate=February 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the location of its meetings.

=== Sustainability Institute and Related Organizations ===
Meadows founded the Sustainability Institute, which combined research in global systems with practical demonstrations of [[sustainable development|sustainable]] living, including the development of a [[cohousing]] (or [[ecovillage]]) and organic farm at [[Cobb Hill]] in [[Hartland, Vermont]]. In 2011, the Sustainability Institute, originally adjacent to Cobb Hill, was renamed the Donella Meadows Institute and moved to Norwich, Vermont. Additional organizations that sprang from the Sustainability Institute include Sustainable Food Lab, Climate Interactive, and Sustainability Leaders Network.

=== State of the Village report ===
In 1990, Meadows published the State of the Village report under the title, "Who lives in the 'Global Village'?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empowermentresources.com/info2/theglobalvillage.html Meadows, Donnella. (1990, May 31). "Who lives in the 'Global Village'?" ''The Global Citizen'']&lt;/ref&gt; which likened the world to a village of 1,000 people. Since then, "If the world were a village of 100 people", derived from her work but further reducing the numbers to those of a village of 100 people, has been published by others in English, Spanish, and Japanese.

=== Twelve leverage points ===
{{Main article|Twelve leverage points}}
Meadows published ''Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System'', one of her best-known essays, in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainabilityinstitute.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf |title=Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System |date=1999 |accessdate=2015-10-25 |website=The Sustainability Institute |publisher= |last=Meadows |first=Donella |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008160618/http://www.sustainabilityinstitute.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the most and least effective types of interventions in a system (of any kind).

'''Earlham Institute''' (EI, formerly '''The Genome Analysis Centre''' (TGAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earlham Institute – Decoding living systems for a better world|url=http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/news/people-skills-training/2016/160627-n-earlham-institute-decoding-living-systems/|website=www.bbsrc.ac.uk|publisher=BBSRC|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a life science research institute located at the [[Norwich Research Park]] (NRP), [[Norwich]], [[England]]. EI's research is focused on exploring living systems by applying computational science and biotechnology to answer ambitious biological questions and generate enabling resources.

== History ==

The institute was established by the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] in partnership with [[East of England Development Agency]] (EEDA), [[Norfolk County Council]], [[Norwich City Council]], [[South Norfolk|South Norfolk Council]] and the Greater Norwich Development Partnership. It cost £13.5 million, and was built by [[Morgan Sindall]]. It was officially opened on 3 July 2009&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; by [[John Sulston]], winner of the 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], and former Director of the [[Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]], another genomics research institution.

In early June 2011, it unveiled a supercomputer on its site that has the most powerful processor in the world that runs [[Red Hat Linux]], with six terabytes of [[Random-access memory|RAM]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} It was installed to crack the structure of the [[wheat]] genome, which is five times larger than the human genome.

In June 2016, Earlham Institute completed a rebranding project which saw the name transition from The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC) to Earlham Institute (EI).

== Structure ==

It is situated on the [[Norwich Research Park]], to the west of Norwich on the former A47 ([https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1995444 B1108]), and adjacent to the west of the [[University of East Anglia]], next to the [[River Yare]].

== Function ==

The goal of this institute is to be at the forefront of data intensive science in biology, to be a leader in bioinformatics innovation and the application of genome technology and to enable bioscience through dissemination of the data and technology produced in the institute and in collaboration with external scientists worldwide. Project specialisms include wheat and [[ryegrass]], but the wider research carried out includes vertebrate, evolutionary, environment, and regulatory genomics as well as data infrastructure and software development to support the international bioscience community. EI makes its research [[open access]] where possible.

==Directors==
Earlham Institute has been directed by:
* Prof Jane Rogers from July 2009 to December 2012; 
* Prof Mario Caccamo from January 2013 to July 2015;
* Prof Dylan Edwards from August 2015 (Interim Director)
* Prof Neil Hall from April 2016 (Current Director)

== Communicating Science ==

One of the responsibilities of EI is to communicate the science it undertakes to a range of audiences, such as the international scientific community, the general public, school children, and students. It runs various programmes throughout the year to deliver this responsibility, as well as producing editorial features to explain the research it carries out.

== Facilities==

EI has a state-of-the-art scientific training facility which helps support the delivery of workshops and training courses to support the international bioscience community.

===Sequencing Platforms===
EI is equipped with next-generation sequencing and genomics platforms for high-throughput data generation for research projects. EI historically has been an early adopter of new technologies for its scientific research, but also makes these available to the UK bioscience community through its [http://www.earlham.ac.uk/national-capability-genomics/ National Capability in Genomics].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14352">'''Economic [[restructuring]]''' refers to the phenomenon of Western [[urban areas]] shifting from a [[manufacturing]] to a [[service sector]] economic base. This transformation has affected demographics including [[income]] distribution, [[employment]], and [[social hierarchy]]; institutional arrangements including the growth of the [[corporate]] complex, specialized producer services, capital mobility, [[informal economy]], nonstandard work, and public outlays; as well as geographic spacing including the rise of [[world cities]], [[spatial mismatch]], and metropolitan growth differentials.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen 1990, Noyelle &amp; Stanback 1984, Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990, Musterd &amp; Ostendorf 1998, Kalleberg 2000 and Katz 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographic impact==
As cities experience a loss of manufacturing jobs and growth of services, sociologist [[Saskia Sassen]] affirms that a widening of the social hierarchy occurs where high-level, high-income, salaried professional jobs expands in the service industries alongside a greater incidence of low-wage, low-skilled jobs, usually filled by immigrants and minorities.&lt;ref name="Sassen 1990"&gt;Sassen 1990&lt;/ref&gt; A "missing middle" eventually develops in the wage structure.&lt;ref name="Musterd &amp; Ostendorf 1998"&gt;Musterd &amp; Ostendorf 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Several effects of this [[social polarization]] include the increasing concentration of poverty in large U.S. cities, the increasing concentration of black and Hispanic populations in large U.S. cities, and distinct social forms such as the [[underclass]], [[informal economy]], and entrepreneurial immigrant communities.&lt;ref name="Sassen 1990"/&gt; In addition, the declining manufacturing sector leaves behind strained blue-collared workers who endure chronic [[unemployment]], economic insecurity, and [[Economic stagnation|stagnation]] due to the global economy's [[capital flight]].&lt;ref name="Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990"&gt;Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Wages and unionization rates for manufacturing jobs also decline. One other qualitative dimension involves the [[Feminisation of the workplace|feminization]] of the job supply as more and more women enter the labor force usually in the service sector.&lt;ref name="Sassen economic restructuring"&gt;{{citation|author= Sassen, Saskia|title=Economic Restructuring and the American City|publisher=Annual Review of Sociology|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both costs and benefits are associated with economic restructuring. Greater efficiency, job creation, [[gentrification]], and enhanced national competitiveness are associated with [[social exclusion]] and inclusion.{{Clarify|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref name="Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990"/&gt; The low-skilled, low-income population faces the loss of opportunities, full participation in society, lack of access in labor market and school, weak position in housing markets, limited political participation, and restricted social-cultural integration. Conversely, high-skilled, high-income professionals enjoy social inclusion with modern amenities, conveniences, social participation, and full access to public resources.&lt;ref name="Musterd &amp; Ostendorf 1998"/&gt;

Furthermore, sociologist [[William Julius Wilson]] argues that the [[deindustrialization]] of manufacturing employment have exacerbated joblessness in impoverished African American communities correlating with a rise in single-mother households, high premature mortality rates, and increasing [[incarceration]] rates among African American males. With some African Americans gaining professional [[upward mobility]] through [[affirmative action]] and [[equal opportunity]] sanctions in [[education]] and [[employment]], African Americans without such opportunities fall behind. This creates a growing economic class division among the African American demographic accentuated by global economic restructuring without government response to the disadvantaged. Furthermore, Wilson asserts that as the black [[middle class]] leave the predominantly black [[inner city]] neighborhoods, informal employment information networks are eroded. This isolates poor, inner city residents from the labor market compounding the concentration of poverty, [[welfare dependency]], rise of unemployment, and physical isolation in these areas.&lt;ref name="Wilson Declining Race"&gt;{{citation|author= Wilson, William J.|title=The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson Truly Disadvantaged"&gt;{{citation|author= Wilson, William J.|title=The Truly Disadvantaged: the Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City youth are also affected such as in New York City. The declines in education, health care, and social services and the dearth of jobs for those with limited education and training along with the decay of public environments for outdoor play and recreation have all contributed to fewer autonomous outdoor play or "hanging out" places for young people. This in turn affects their gross motor development, cultural build-up, and identity construction. Children become prisoners of home relying on television and other outlets for companionship. Contemporary urban environments restricts the opportunities for children to forge and negotiate peer culture or acquire necessary social skills. Overall, their ecologies have eroded in recent years brought about by global restructuring.&lt;ref name="Katz City Youth"&gt;{{citation|author= Katz, indi|title=Disintegrating Developments: Global Economic Restructuring and the Eroding of Ecologies of Youth|publisher=Routledge|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional arrangements==
When the [[1973 oil crisis]] affected the world capitalist economy, economic restructuring was used to remedy the situation by geographically redistributing production, consumption, and residences.
City economies across the globe moved from goods-producing to service-producing outlets.
Breakthroughs in transportation and communications made industrial capital much more mobile. Soon, producer services emerged as a fourth basic [[economic sector]] where routine low-wage service employment moved to low-cost sites and advanced corporate services centralized in cities.&lt;ref name="Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990"/&gt; These technological upheavals brought about changes in institutional arrangements with the prominence of large corporations, allied business and financial services, nonprofit and public sector enterprises. [[Global cities]] such as New York and London become centers for international finance and headquarters for [[multinational corporations]] offering cross currency exchange services as well as buildup of foreign banking and trading. Other cities become regional headquarters centers of low-wage manufacturing. In all these urban areas the corporate complex grows offering banking, insurance, advertising, legal council, and other service functions. Economic restructuring allows markets to expand in size and capacity from regional to national to international scopes.&lt;ref name="Noyelle City Transformation"&gt;{{citation|author1=Noyelle, Thierry J.  |author2=Stanback, Thomas M., Jr.|title=The Economic Transformation of American Cities|publisher=Rowman &amp; Allanheld Publishers|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, these institutional arrangements buttressed by improved technology reflect the interconnectedness and internationalization of firms and economic processes. Consequently, capital, goods, and people rapidly flow across borders.&lt;ref name="Musterd &amp; Ostendorf 1998"/&gt; Where the mode of regulation began with [[Fordism]] and [[Taylorization]] in the [[industrial age]] then to [[mass consumption]] of [[Keynesian economics]] policies, it evolves to differentiated and specialized consumption through international competition.&lt;ref name="Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990"/&gt; Additionally, in the labor market, nonstandard work arrangements develop in the form of part-time work, temporary agency and contract company employment, short-term employment, [[contingent work]], and independent contracting. Global economic changes and technological improvements in communications and information systems encouraged competitive organizations to specialize in production easily and assemble temporary workers quickly for specific projects. Thus, the norm of standard, steady employment unravels beginning in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="Musterd Urban Segregation"&gt;{{citation|author1=Musterd, Sako  |author2=Ostendorf, Wim|title=Urban Segregation and the Welfare State: Inequality and Exclusion in Western Cities|publisher=Routledge|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalleberg Nonstandard Work"&gt;{{citation|author= Kalleberg, Arne L.|title=Nonstandard Employment Relations: Part-time, Temporary, and Contract Work|publisher=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another shift in institutional arrangement involves public resources. As economic restructuring encourages high-technology service and knowledge-based economies, massive public de-investment results. Across many parts of the U.S. and the industrialized Western nations, steep declines in public outlays occur in housing, schools, social welfare, education, job training, job creation, child care, recreation, and open space. To remedy these cutbacks, [[privatization]] is installed as a suitable measure. Though it leads to some improvements in service production, privatization leads to less public accountability and greater unevenness in the distribution of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Katz 1997&lt;/ref&gt; With this reform in privatizing public services, [[neoliberalism]] has become the ideological platform of economic restructuring. Free market economic theory has dismantled Keynesian and collectivists’ strategies and promoted the [[Reaganomics|Reagan]] and [[Thatcherism|Thatcher]] politics of the 1980s. Soon free trade, flexible labor, and capital flight are used from [[Washington D.C.]] to London to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Peck &amp; Tickell 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, economic restructuring requires [[decentralization]] as states hand down power to local governments. Where the federal government focuses on mainly warfare-welfare concerns, local governments focus on productivity. Urban policy reflects this market-oriented shift from once supporting government functions to now endorsing businesses.&lt;ref name="Peck Neoliberalism"&gt;{{citation|author1=Peck, Jamie  |author2=Tickell, Adam|title=The Urbanization of Neoliberalism: Theoretical Debates Neoliberalizing Space|publisher=Antipode|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan City Limits"&gt;{{citation|author1=Logan, John R.  |author2=Swanstrom, Todd|title=Beyond City Limits: Urban Policy and Economic Restructuring in Comparative Perspective|publisher=Temple University Press|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic impact==
Urban landscapes especially in the U.S. have significantly altered in response to economic restructuring. Cities such as Baltimore, Detroit, St. Louis and others face population losses which result in thousands of abandoned homes, unused buildings, and vacant lots, contributing to [[urban decay]]. Such transformations frustrate [[urban planning]] and revitalization, fostering deviance in the forms of drug-related activity and vagrancy.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Older, compact, industrial U.S. cities have been rendered obsolete. Urban spaces become playgrounds for the urban gentry, wastelands for low-paid service workers, and denizens for the [[underground economy]]. In some areas, [[gentrification]] projects have caused displacement of poverty-stricken residents.&lt;ref name="Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990"/&gt; [[Sunbelt]] cities such as [[Miami]] and [[Atlanta]] rise to become key business centers while Snowbelt cities such as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and Youngstown decline.&lt;ref name="Noyelle &amp; Stanback 1984"&gt;Noyelle &amp; Stanback 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Even housing markets respond to economic restructuring with decaying housing stocks, escalating housing prices, depleting tax base, changes in financing, and reduction in federal support for housing. Soon, spatial divisions among wealthy and poor households exacerbate.&lt;ref name="Sassen 1990"/&gt; Moreover, with the movement of blue-collared employment from central cities, geographically entrenched housing discrimination, and suburban land use policy, African American youths in inner cities become victims of [[spatial mismatch]], where their residences provide only weak and negative employment growth and they usually lack access to intrametropolitan mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael 1998&lt;/ref&gt; High-order services, an expanding sector in the industrialized world, become spatially concentrated in a relative small number of large metropolitan areas, particularly in suburban office agglomerations.&lt;ref name="Cohen Abandoned Houses"&gt;{{citation|author= Cohen, James R.|title=Abandoned Housing: Exploring Lessons from Baltimore|publisher=Housing Policy Debate|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raphael Spatial Mismatch"&gt;{{citation|author= Raphael, Steven|title=The Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis and Black Youth Joblessness|publisher=Journal of Urban Economics|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coffey Intrametropolitan"&gt;{{citation|author1=Coffey, William J. |author2=Drolet, Rejean |author3=Polese, Mario |title=The Intrametropolitan Location of High Order Services|publisher=Papers in Regional Science|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
In cultural terms, economic restructuring has been associated with [[postmodernity]] as its counterpart concerning flexible accumulation. Additionally, the term carries with it three core themes: historical, radical rupture into post-industrial economic order; priority of economic forces over social/political forces; and structure over agency where the process is independent of human will, as it takes place according to economic logic (Logan &amp; Swanstrom 1990). In addition, economic restructuring demonstrates the increasing complex and human-capital intensive modern society in Western nations.&lt;ref name="Noyelle &amp; Stanback 1984"/&gt;

'''Environmental''', '''ecological''' or '''green gentrification''' is a process in which cleaning up pollution or providing green amenities increases local property values and attracts wealthier residents to a previously polluted or disenfranchised neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="Banzhaf&amp;McCormick"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banzhaf |first1=H. Spencer |last2=McCormick |first2=Eleanor |title=Moving beyond cleanup: Identifying the crucibles of environmental gentrification |journal=NCEE Working Paper Series |date=2006 |url=https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/working-paper-moving-beyond-cleanup-identifying-crucibles-environmental}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dooling|first=Sarah|date=2009|title=Ecological gentrification: A research agenda exploring justice in the city|url=|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|volume=|pages=621–639|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green amenities include green spaces, [[park]]s [[green roof]]s, [[garden]]s and [[Green building|green and energy efficient building materials]].  These initiatives can heal many environmental ills from industrialization and beautify urban landscapes.  Additionally, greening is imperative for reaching a sustainable future.  However, if accompanied by gentrification, such initiatives can have an ambiguous social impact if the poor (especially renters) are displaced or forced to pay higher housing costs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; First coined by Sieg et al. (2004)&lt;ref name="Sieg_etal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sieg |first1=Holger |last2=Smith |first2=V. Kerry |last3=Banzhaf |first3=H. Spencer |last4=Walsh |first4=Randall |title=Estimating the general equilibrium benefits of large changes in spatially delineated public goods |journal=International Economic Review |date=2004 |volume=45 |issue=4 |page=1047–77 |doi=10.1111/j.0020-6598.2004.00297.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, environmental gentrification is a relatively new concept, although it can be considered as a new hybrid of the older and wider topics of gentrification and environmental justice.  Various studies have analyzed the social implications of greening projects specifically with regards to housing affordability and displacement of vulnerable citizens.

== Gentrification ==

[[Gentrification]] is a process whereby a neighbourhoods is transformed in order to cater to a wealthier home buyer or investor.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gentrification|last=Lees|first=Loretta|last2=Slater|first2=Tom|last3=Wyly|first3=Evlin K.|publisher=Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process often takes place in [[Working class|working-class]] neighbourhoods that are inhabited by low-income residents.  [[Real estate development|Real-estate development]] such as luxury condominiums or the transformation of old factories into trendy lofts, attract wealthier investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London: aspects of change|author=Ruth Glass|year=1964|publisher=London: MacGibbon &amp; Kee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loft Living|last=Zukin|first=Sharon|publisher=Rutgers UP|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the process progresses, low-income residents are pushed out or to the outskirts of the neighbourhood as real-estate and rent prices are increased due to demand.  Also, as middle-class residents enter the neighbourhood surrounding businesses transform to accommodate desires.  [[Gentrification]] has often been promoted by local governments through policies that promote ‘[[urban renewal|'urban renewal.']]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Generally, the process is considered to benefit the local economy and improve neighbourhoods.  Three phases of [[gentrification]] are generally recognized:
# 1960's-1970s - an irregular process led by the government which hoped to reinvest capital to the inner-city.  
# 1970s - widespread in big cities and spreading to smaller towns across North America.  Promotion of art communities such as Soho Manhattan to attract residents and investors.
# 1990s - extensive large-scale development increased in scale and complexity through public-private partnerships.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hackworth|first=Jason|last2=Smith|first2=Neil|date=2001|title=The changing state of gentrification|url=|journal=Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As wealthier citizens have started to demand green amenities, cities have shifted their focus to marrying urban redevelopment with green initiatives all of which follow a similar process.

== Urban planning and sustainability ==

Cities and individuals are responding the [[ecological crisis]] through [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] planning and actions.  Currently, the [[United Nations]] estimates that approximately 54% of the world's inhabitants are living in cities.  This number is expected to increase to 66% by the year 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nations|first=United|date=2014|title=World urbanization prospects:  the 2014 revision, highlights|url=|journal=Population Division United Nations|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many ways, the city functions like a metabolic organism, extracting, using and disposing of resources across space and time.  Therefore, studying the urban environment can often reveal spatial positions of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heynen|first=Nik|last2=Kaika|first2=Maria|last3=Swyngedouw|first3=Eric|date=|title=Urban political ecology|url=|journal=Urban Political Ecology and the Politics of Urban Metabolism|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in the United States there is a negative correlation between the provision of urban green space and [[African Americans|African-American]] and [[Hispanic]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wen|first=Ming|date=2013|title=Spatial disparities in the distribution of parks and green spaces in the USA|url=|journal=Annals of Behavioral Medicine|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spaces that are provided tend to have a lack in municipal upkeep and policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownlow|first=Alec|date=2006|title=Inherited fragmentations and narratives of environmental control and entrepreneurial Philadelphia|url=|journal=In the Nature of Cities:  Urban Political Ecology and the Politics of Urban Metabolism|volume=|pages=208–225|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, green space in affluent neighbourhoods tend to promote activities for [[wealth]]y citizens which help to maintain a certain social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dooling|first=Sarah|date=2008|title=Ecological gentrification:  re-negotiating justice in the city|url=|journal=Critical Planing|volume=15|pages=40–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainability]] is a tool that has been used by governments and developers to promote green initiatives in cities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quastel|first=Noah|date=2009|title=Political ecologies of gentrifiction|url=|journal=Urban Geography|volume=7|pages=694–725|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Growing out of the promotion of [[sustainable development]] for [[Developing country|developing countries]], [[sustainability]] emerged as a global proposal at the [[Earth Summit|1992 United Nations Earth Summit]].  In theory, [[sustainability]] is achievable through a balance of three pillars - [[economy]], [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[social equity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=W. M.|date=2009|title=The future of sustainability: re-thinking environment and development in the twenty-first century|url=|journal=Report for the IUCN Renowned Thinkings Meeting|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in practice it still remains a challenge.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green gentrification:  urban sustainability and the struggle for environmental justice|last=Gould|first=Kenneth A.|last2=Lewis|first2=Tammy L.|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The social equity portion of sustainability is concerned with providing local communities ability to participate in [[decision-making]] as well as benefit from development projects.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Public participation]] aims to ensure that local concerns and needs are met.

In many examples, the redevelopment of brownsites (post-industrial areas) have become foundations for large-scale urban greening redevelopment.  These sites are typical of past industrial landscapes - near the downtown core and waterfront and in need of environmental remediation. Environmental redevelopments often promote sustainability through urban planning mechanisms such as [[New Urbanism|new urbanism]] which promotes that planning that focus on building cities that are [[livable]] and [[Walkability|walkable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Home from nowhere: remaking our everyday world for the twenty-first century|last=Kuntsler|first=James Howard|publisher=A touchstone book|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[File:Diagonal Mar before.jpg|thumb|An image of the disenfranchised site of Diagonal Mar before its redevelopment.]]

==== Sant Marti District ====

[[File:Diagonal Mar after.jpg|thumb|An image of Diagonal Mar after redevelopment.]]
A 15-year study (1990-2005) examined the social impacts or enhancing urban green spaces across the city of [[Barcelona]].  During the 1990s and 2000s, 18 new urban green parks were added to the city planning agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parcs I|first=Jardins Barcelona|date=2007|title=In Memoria|url=|journal=Barcelona: Ajuntament de Barcelona, Parcs I Jardins|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First and foremost, as Barcelona was awarded the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic Games]], the city prepared for the event through numerous urban developments which influenced a transformation of [[public space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anguelovski|first=Isabelle|date=2014|title=Neighborhood as a refuge: community reconstruction, place remaking, and environmental justice in the city|url=|journal=MIT Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the city had been concerned with providing [[urban park]]s for the purpose of socializing and exercising.  However, as the Olympics were  swiftly approaching, urban planners and city governments took the opportunity to develop green spaces for mega-events.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anguelovski|first=Isabelle|date=2017|title=Assessing green gentrification in historically disenfranchised neighborhoods:  a longitudinal and spatial analysis of Barcelona|url=|journal=Urban Geography|volume=|pages=1–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These new types of spaces prioritize the aesthetic features of urban green space in an effort to attract tourists and offer memorable landscapes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The legacy of mega-event [[urban park]]s can be observed in three notable parks around the city - Parc del Port Olimpic, Parc del Poblenou and Parc de Diagnol Mar.  All three of these parks have shifted neighborhood demographics towards greater affluence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The city of Barcelona released its plan for [[sustainability]] titled ''Barcelona Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan 2020.''  This document does not contain plans for housing affordability or social impacts that are a result from large-scale development.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Diagonal Mar project provides an example of the green initiatives being coupled with large-scale [[Urban planning|urban redevelopment]] on a previous brownfield site.  Historically, the area was an industry hub as it is located near the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  The [[Diagonal Mar i el Front Marítim del Poblenou|Diagonal Mar]] project includes luxury condominiums, three hotels, three office buildings, a shopping mall nested within an urban green space.  The project has been criticized for not considering local input into planning as lacking spaces for social interactions for citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sauri|first=David|date=2009|title=Changing conceptions of sustainability in Barcelona's public parks|url=|journal=Geographical Review|volume=99.1|pages=23–36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies suggest that green [[gentrification]] has occurred in correspondence with park development in the [[Sant Martí (district)|Sant Marti]] district.  Using neighbourhood measurements of wealth, the authors suggest that demographic shifts of the neighbourhood have taken place at an alarming rate 1990-2005.  Moreover, areas surrounding parks have experienced clear indicators of these changes as there has been an increase in:  residents with a bachelor's degree,  residents from the global North, household income or home sale and an overall decrease in the population of residents 65 and older living alone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== The High Line =====
[[File:Highline after.jpg|thumb|An image of the High Line after its redevelopment.]]
The [[High Line]], is a 1.45-mile-long (2.33&amp;nbsp;km) an elevated public park that was constructed on a historic freight line along the west side of [[Manhattan]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921033407/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-high-line-section-opens-extending-park-34th-st-article-1.1946927|title=New High Line section opens, extending the park to 34th St|last=Green|first=F|date=September 21, 2014|work=Daily News|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous to its [[redevelopment]], the [[High Line]] represented the deterioration of New York’s industry, the neighbourhood of alongside the High Line, Chelsea, had frequent delinquency.  Since the 1980s the city government has attempted to tear down this eyesore.  In response, activists ventured to save this icon of history and instead promoted the idea that the [[High Line]] could be returned to the community as a provision of public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=High Line:  The inside story of New York city's park in the sky|last=David|first=Joshua|last2=Hammond|first2=Robert|publisher=FSG Originals|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the High Line was acquired by the [[CSX Transportation]] Inc. in 1999, community board meetings provided an avenue for alternative uses to be proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loughran|first=Kevin|date=2014|title=Parks for profit:  The high line, growth machines, and uneven development of urban public spaces|url=|journal=City &amp; Community|volume=13.1|pages=49–68|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around the same time, Joshua David and Robert Hammond formed a non-profit they called [[Friends of the High Line]] of which their main goal was to acquire public and private funds to save the bridge from demolition.  Notable celebrities - [[Edward Norton]], [[Martha Stewart]] and [[Kevin Bacon]] provided financial support for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/arts/design/how-everyone-jumped-aboard-a-railroad-to-nowhere.html|title=How everyone jumped aboard a railroad to nowhere|last=Demonchaux|first=Thomas|date=May 8, 2005|work=|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Friends of the High Line presented a redevelopment strategy to the [[Mayoralty of Michael Bloomberg|Bloomberg administration]], promoting that the bridge could be converted into a public park.  [[High Line|Friends Of the High Line]] suggested that this would provide economic benefits to the surrounding neighborhood and generate substantial tax revenues.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/nyregion/with-next-phase-ready-area-around-high-line-is-flourishing.html|title=The High Line isn't just a sight to see; it's also an economic dynamo|last=McGeehan|first=Patrick|date=June 5, 2011|work=New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Mayoralty of Michael Bloomberg|Bloomberg administration]] accepted the initiative.  Mayor Bloomberg provided a statement of support by stating, “The Board’s ruling is a great win for all New Yorkers.  It allows us to implement our plans to preserve this valuable historic resource, create a much needed public open space and strengthen our city’s economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehighline.org/|title=Mayor authorization for High Line project [press release]|last=Friends of the High Line|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that this project has ignited [[gentrification]] can be observed through the soaring real estate prices as well as types of activities that are being attracted to the [[High Line]] and its surrounding areas.  In just two years, there has been a production of $2 Billion real-estate construction which has contributed an additional $900 million in tax revenues.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Additionally, the relocation of [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] nearby sheds light on the popularity of the park.

The [[High Line]], although presented as a public park, privileges certain users and activities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Friends of the High Line]] allow for only certain types of vendors as well as provides private security guards.  Visitors of the High Line can enjoy artisanal foods, micro-brewed beer and browse up-scaled art merchant booths.  The promotion of economic growth and certain types of consumption coupled with surveillance results in the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberalization]] of this public spaces.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Which is to say, The High Line, although a famous icon for the city, may fall short of providing open spaces and benefits for ''all'' citizens to use and enjoy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Instead it more closely resembles a place of spatial 'privileged'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=PrivilegeL  A Reader|last=Kimmel|first=Michael|publisher=Westview Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Boulder, CO|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where claims to public space are dominated by upper-class citizens.

Concurrently in 2007, the Bloomberg administration released the ''[[PlaNYC|PlaNYC 2030: A Greater, Greener New York]]'' which aimed to combat climate change through expanding sustainability measured with 132 initiatives.  One goal highlights the social pillar of sustainability by having a goal that every citizen in the city will have a green space within a 10-minute walking distance from their home.

==== Vancouver ====

===== False Creek =====
The traditional urban layout of [[Vancouver]] was reminiscent of a small-town.  Grid-iron patterned streets were lined with single-family dwellings, businesses could be found along main streets and industry was concentrated along shorelines and inlets.  The 1960s ushered in a shift towards higher densities through high rise residential buildings in the downtown core.  In the 1980s, redevelopment of [[Brownfield land|brownsites]] (former industrial areas) for condominium development in the [[False Creek]] region was a result of it being the site for [[Expo 67|Expo 1986]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=Caroline A.|date=1988|title="Life on the upslope":  the postmodern landscape of gentrification|url=|journal=Society and Space|volume=6 |issue=2|pages=169–190|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, this area was the heartland of industry and had begun to deteriorate as industry shifted.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  After the [[Expo 67|Expo]] the site was acquired by Hong Kong billionaire [[Li Ka-shing|Li Ka-Shing]] for $320 million and a numerous residential luxury developments followed suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olda|first=K.|date=1998|title=Globalization and urban change: tales from Vancouver via Hong Kong|url=|journal=Urban Geography|volume=19 |issue=4|pages=360–385|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These developments promoted a tone of [[sustainability]] that were supported through planning documents such as Livable Region Strategic Planning (1996).  Urban planning strategies such as [[Smart growth|Smart Growth]] stressed environmental goals could be achieved through the provision of [[Walkability|walkable]] and [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] urban areas which would reduce [[urban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Rob|date=2005|title=Sustainability schizophrenia or "actually existing sustainabilities? toward a broader understanding of politics and promises of local sustainability in the US|url=|journal=Geoforum|volume=|pages=410–417|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critiques of [[Smart growth|Smart Growth]] highlight the often ignored equity aspects of the strategy as they often ignore low-income residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pozdena|first=Randal J.|date=2002|title=Smart growth and its effects on housing markets:  the new segregation|url=|journal=National Center for Public Policy Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Affordable housing in Canada|Housing affordability]] became an issue during 2001-2007 as the price for a typical two-bedroom in the west end of Vancouver shifted from $260,000 to $650,000.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Marc|date=2008|title=Affordable EcoDensity - Making affordable housing a core principle of Vancouver's EcoDensity charter|url=|journal=The Canadian Center for Policy Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the city council accepted [[EcoDensity]] as a solution to housing affordability which promoted further [[Urban density|densification]] of downtown and surrounding neighbourhoods.  [[EcoDensity]] is the solution to housing affordability rather than provision of social housing.  A number of towers were constructed in the downtown Eastside displaced approximately 4,000 low-income residents from June 2007-January 2008.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Critiques of [[EcoDensity]], suggest that the strategy does not account for enough citizen input in planning measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New growth-management experiments in Canada|last=Robinson|first=Pamela|publisher=Planning for climate change: strategies for mitigation and adaptation for spatial planners|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vancouver]] has become one of the most popular cities in the world to live as it offers breathtaking mountain views and access to numerous beaches.  As Vancouver was awarded the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], which led to the development of “Millenium Water” along the South Eastern portion of [[False Creek]] which became the site for the [[Olympic village 2010|Olympic Athlete Village]].  This project boasted European-styled walkways, [[green roof]]s and [[sustainability]] characteristics.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millenniumwater.com|title=Vancouver's last waterfront community|last=Millenium Water|first=|date=2008|website=|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No low-income housing was provided with this project and one-bedroom condos starting price was $500,000.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  In an effort to reduce [[Environmental issue|ecological impacts]], the project promoted a [[habitat restoration]] project whereby leftover dirt was used to create an island for bird nesting.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In 2006, water squatters, people living in boats in [[False Creek]] waters, were evicted in an effort to clean up the area.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The [[False Creek]] redevelopment was advertised as a park-like nature for new residents and tourists and promoted as a space for leisure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The intemperate rainforest: nature, culture and power on Canada's west coast|last=Braun|first=Bruce|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars suggest that there is a disconnect between the promotion of environmental discourses and issues of equity which results in a [[class conflict]] over space in the city.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Although Vancouver is a highly desirable place to live, the promotion of sustainability through policies ignores provision of much needed affordable housing allocations.

'''Gender mainstreaming''' is the [[public policy]] concept of assessing the different implications for people of different genders of any planned [[policy]] action, including [[legislation]] and [[Program (management)|programmes]], in all areas and levels. Mainstreaming essentially offers a pluralistic approach that values the diversity among people of different genders.

The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The idea has been pushed in the [[United Nations]] development community. The idea was formally featured in 1995 at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], and was cited in the document that resulted from the conference, the [[Beijing Platform for Action]].

== Definition ==
Most definitions of gender mainstreaming conform to the UN [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] formally defined concept:
: Mainstreaming a gender perspective is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve [[gender equality]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/52/plenary/a52-3.htm Report of the Economic and Social Council for 1997]". A/52/3.18 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are different approaches to gender mainstreaming:

''Institutional perspective:''  The ways in which specific organizations adopt and implement mainstreaming policies. This will often involve an analysis of how national politics intersects with international norms and practices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|last=Shepard|first=Laura J.|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Discursive'' ''perspective:'' Queries the ways in which mainstreaming reproduces power relations through language and issue-framing. This approach will often involve looking at documents, resolutions and peace agreements to see how they reproduce the narratives of gender in a political context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These approaches are not necessarily competing, and can be seen as complimentary.

The ways in which approaches are used, however, can also reflect differing feminist theories. For example, ''liberal feminism'' is strongly invoked by mainstreaming through the binary approach of gender in strict relation to the public sphere of policymaking. ''Poststructuralist feminism'' can be seen in mainstreaming thought which seeks to displace gender difference as the sole axis of difference and to highlight the diversity of policy its ramifications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Prioritizing gender equality===

Gender mainstreaming tries, among others, to ascertain a [[gender equality]] perspective across all [[policy]] areas.&lt;ref name="True, Jacqui 2010"&gt;True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 371&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacqui True, a Professor of politics and international relations, "[e]very [[policy]] or piece of [[legislation]] should be evaluated from the perspective of whether or not it reduces or increases gender inequalities."&lt;ref name="True, Jacqui 2010"/&gt; This concept of [[gender equality]] is not limited to formal equality, it includes as well equality de facto, which is a more holistic approach to gender [[policy]] in order to tackle the interconnected causes that create an unequal relation between the sexes in all areas of life (work, politics, sexuality, culture, and violence).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", Social Politics 12(3): 417&lt;/ref&gt;

Lombardo notes that "[t]here should be evidence that [[gender equality]] objective and policies of special concern for women (for example, [[social policy]]) have been prioritized in the organization among competing objectives (in terms of financial and human resources, type of measures adopted, voting systems used, and so forth)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Incorporating gender into politics and decision making===

Puechguirbal takes a discursive approach to argue that in order to successfully mainstream a gendered perspective in politics, language needs to be reevaluated and used to change the parameters of how women are perceived.

Historically, documents concerning international agreements, peacekeeping arrangements and legal resolutions have perpetuated stereotypes that disempower women. This can be seen through the use of language, even as simply as in the UN Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program's (DDR) motto: 'One man, on weapon'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Reference of gender issues should be found in all [[policy]] areas. "There must be evidence that the [[mainstream]] political agenda has been reoriented by rethinking and rearticulating [[policy]] ends and means from a gender perspective," Lombardo says, referencing [[Rounaq Jahan]], a political scientists, feminist leader and author.&lt;ref name="Lombardo, E. 2005"&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", ''Social Politics'' 12(3): 417&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] states, "women's equal participation in political life plays a pivotal role in the general process of the advancement of women."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Beijing Platform for Action, G. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, according to the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] "[w]ithout the active participation of women and the incorporation of women's perspective at all levels of decision-making, the goals of equality, development and peace cannot be achieved."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Therefore, Lombardo claims that women and men should be equally represented in any decision-making institution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Charlesworth agrees and believes that every effort should be made to broaden women's participation at all levels of decision-making.&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"&gt;Charlesworth, H., (2005) "Not waving but Drowning: Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the United Nations", 18 ''Harvard Human Rights Journal'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-conflict peace-building (PCPB) ====
An area of policy and decision making that will particularly benefit from gender mainstreaming is post-conflict peace-building, also known as PCPB. Various feminist research has concluded that men and women experience violent conflict differently and moreover, the current policies surrounding PCPB are insufficient in addressing the disadvantaged position of women in male-dominated power structures that are further reinforced by peace-building efforts, both from the domestic and international communities. Gender mainstreaming in PCPB would emphasize the importance of gendered considerations of particular issues that disproportionally affect women in post-conflict settings. This would mean that policy reflected an acknowledgment of the many instances of wartime sexualized violence perpetrated on women, among other issues that (primarily) women face during conflict. A major focus of the effort towards gender mainstreaming in post-conflict peace-building policy is to lessen the international community's inclination towards building a return to 'normal' for the post-conflict region. Much of feminist research has found that returning to 'normal' is of little comfort for women, who were burdened by the patriarchal systems that were in place before conflict broke out. As Handrahan&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Handrahan|first=Lori|date=|title=Conflict, gender, ethnicity and post-conflict reconstruction|url=|journal=Security Dialogue|volume=35|pages=429–445|via=University of Victoria library database}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes, the international community involved in much of PCPB "tolerates high levels of violence against women in their own societies." Policy that prioritized gender in its applications and goals would seek to build a society where women are better off than they were before conflict broke out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Shifts in institutional culture===

Gender mainstreaming can be seen as a process of organizational change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bibbings|first=Sharleene May|title=The politics of mainstreaming in critical perspective|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Pub.|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=9781443835121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming must be institutionalized through concrete steps, mechanisms, and processes in all parts of the organization.&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt; According to Lombardo, this change involves three aspects: [[policy]] process, [[policy]] mechanisms; and [[policy]] actors. She explains as follows:

"1. A shift in [[policy]] process means that the process "is reorganized so that ordinary actors know how to incorporate a gender perspective" or that gender expertise is included "as normal requirement for [[policy]]-makers" (Council of Europe 1998, 165&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. 1998. Gender Mainstreaming: Conceptual Framework, Methodology and Presentation of Good Practices: Final Report of Activities of the Group of Specialists on Mainstreaming. EG-S-MS. Strasbourg: Council of Europe&lt;/ref&gt;).

2. A shift in [[policy]] mechanism involves (a) the adoption of horizontal cooperation on [[gender]] issues across all [[policy]] areas, levels, and departments; and (b) the use of appropriate [[policy]] tools and techniques to integrate the gender variable in all policies and to monitor and evaluate all policies from a [[gender]] perspective.

3. The range of [[policy]] actors participating in the policy-making process is broadened to include, apart from policy-makers and civil servants, gender experts and civil society."&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", Social Politics 12(3): 417-18&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender budgeting ==
{{Main|Gender budgeting}}

Gender budgeting encompasses activities and initiatives aiming at the preparation of [[budget]]s or the analysis of policies and budgets from a gender perspective. It can also be referred to as gender-sensitive budgeting or gender-responsive budgeting. Gender budgeting does not aim at creating separate budgets for women, or only increasing spending on women’s programmes. It is rather concerned with addressing budgetary [[gender inequality]] concerns, as for instance, how gender hierarchies influence budgets, and gender-based unpaid or low paid work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=72–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As Jacqui True says, "[m]ainstreaming was established as a global strategy for achieving [[gender equality]], and in turn for achieving sustainable economic development in the 1995 [[Beijing Platform for Action]] ratified by all [[United Nations]] member states. It is now incumbent upon nation-states and international organizations to carry out gender mainstreaming. As such, mainstreaming has achieved widespread endorsement by individual governments, regional supra-state bodies."&lt;ref&gt;True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 369&lt;/ref&gt; What follows is a non-exhaustive list of examples of these endorsements.

===Nicaragua===
The election of 1990 in [[Nicaragua]] brought to office the first female [[president]] in the Americas. On April 25, 1990, [[Violeta Chamorro]] became the first and only woman to defeat a male incumbent presentment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prevost|first=G.|title='The Nicaraguan Revolution: Six Years After The Sandinista Electoral Defeat'|journal=Third World Quarterly|year=1996|volume=17|issue=2|pages=307–327|doi=10.1080/01436599650035707}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This helped to change and mobilize [[mainstream]] [[gender]] structure within [[Nicaragua]]. In 1993 the existing outdated Sandinista Women's organization, the Nicaraguan Institute for Research on Women, was revitalized and renamed by the Chamorro government as the Nicaraguan Institute for Woman (INIM). This was to encourage the involvement of Nicaraguan women in the country's economic, social, cultural, and political development and to promote a change in mainstream gender constructs.&lt;ref name="Isbester 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isbester|first=Katherine|title=Still Fighting: The Nicaraguan Women's movement, 1977-2000,|year=2001|publisher=University of Pittsburgh press|location=Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the INIM aims to institute in all sectors a system of gender-focus indicators and to achieve equal opportunity in all State body programming.&lt;ref name="General Assembly"&gt;{{cite web|last=General Assembly|first=United Nations|title=Nicaraguan Institute for women Instrumental in Mainstream Gender Equality Strategies, Anti-Discrimination,|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/wom1595.doc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the INIM with 62 women's groups held discussions to mobilize their initiatives and form a bill of action. The discussions formed a plan, which defined [[patriarchy]], [[sexism]], and [[gender stereotypes]] to reduce inequality in education, employment, and violence.&lt;ref name="Isbester 2001"/&gt;

Although the Nicaraguan Institute for Women claimed to "have been instrumental in mainstreaming [[gender equality]] principles and strategies into agriculture, socio-economic development, higher education, and sexual and [[domestic violence]] prevention," the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2007 raised several concerns, such as the backlog of important women's rights legislation in the country, the lack of studies on [[abortion]], and the available funds of the Institute.&lt;ref name="General Assembly"/&gt;

===Taiwan===
Under the influence of the UN community, the usage of the term increased in [[Taiwan]] since 2000. Local feminist organizations have different views on gender mainstreaming. Some groups considered that the Commission on Women Rights Promotion under [[Executive Yuan]] should be expanded, while other groups, including the [[National Alliance of Taiwan Women's Associations]], considered that gender mainstreaming is not promotion of women's rights but an assessment of all policies and requires a specific organization.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Fang-Mei. "性別主流化在台灣：從國際發展到在地化實踐". ''第一屆性別研究與公共政策學術研討會'', Taipei:[[Shih Hsin University]]. April 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foundation of Women's Rights Promotion and Development]] (FWRPD) has conducted research on gender mainstreaming and gender equality development, produced gender resources kits for training and education, networked women groups and entrepreneurs, participated in international exchange in [[UN]], [[APEC]] gender related meetings.&lt;ref name="website_apecwln.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apecwln.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/Taiwan%20Women's%20Organizations.pdf |title=Taiwan's Women's Organizations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=APEC Women Leaders Network |publisher=APEC Women Leaders Network. |access-date=2015-11-15 |quote= }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN Peacekeeping Operations===

The [[United Nations]] began acknowledging the importance of gender mainstreaming as a tool towards achieving [[gender equality]] in the mid-1990s, as outlined in the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] and the Report from the Secretary General to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Nations, Fourth World Conference on Women|title=Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/pdf/BDPfA%20E.pdf|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=United Nations General Assembly |title=E/1997/66 |url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/1997/66 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001054742/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E%2F1997%2F66 |archivedate=2013-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000, the [[UN Security Council]] passed Resolution 1325,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1325(2000)|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a resolution that called for an enhanced female participation in the prevention, management and resolution of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 373&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peacekeeping]] was an area of particular concern, and the [[Security Council]] recognized "the urgent need to mainstream a gender perspective into [[peacekeeping]] operations."&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 1325, 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Council requested "the [[Secretary-General]], where appropriate, to include in his reporting to the [[Security Council]], progress on gender mainstreaming throughout peacekeeping missions and all other aspects relating to women and girls."&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 1325, 4&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there has been an increase in female peacekeeping personnel. As of 2012, in [[peacekeeping]] operations and special political missions, 29 percent of international and 17 percent of national staff were women. If we compare these figures with the 48 percent representation of women at the [[UN Headquarters]], the participation of women in the [[United Nations Peacekeeping]] operations still faces challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Nations|title=Women in Peacekeeping|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/issues/women/womeninpk.shtml|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===

The equality [[policy]] of the [[European Union]] consists of three pillars: (1) [[anti-discrimination]], (2) [[affirmative action]] policies, and (3) gender mainstreaming.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Calvo, D.|year=2013|title=What is the problem of gender? Mainstreaming gender in migration and development policies in the European Union|location=Gothenburg|publisher=Department of Sociology and Work Science|type=Doctoral Dissertation|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/31823/1/gupea_2077_31823_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}

In the 1990s the [[European Union]] officially put gender mainstreaming on their agenda, "fixing the principle in [[treaty]] articles, action programs and communications, and setting up institutional bodies and mechanisms to promote the incorporation of a gender perspective into policymaking."&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 2&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, gender mainstreaming was introduced in 1991 in the European Community as an element of the Third Action Programme on Equal Opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, Mark A. and Hafner-Burton, Emilie. 2000. Gender Mainstreaming in the European Union, Harvard Jean Monnet Working Paper 2/000, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the legal basis for gender mainstreaming in European law is Article 8 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU). This article states the following: "In all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women".

What follows is a non-exhaustive overview of current gender governance initiatives in the [[European Union]] that encourages gender mainstreaming.

For instance, since 1997 gender mainstreaming has been part of the [[European Employment Strategy]], a concept launched by the [[European Council]]. The [[European Employment Strategy]] requires governments to adopt an approach that complies with the concept of gender mainstreaming, while deciding on employment policies.&lt;ref name="Rubery, Jill 2005"&gt;Rubery, Jill, 2005, Reflections on Gender Mainstreaming: An Example of Feminist Economics in Action?, Feminist Economics 11(3), November 2005, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Alison E. 2008. Too late for gender mainstreaming? Taking stock in Brussels Journal of European Social Policy (2008) 18 (3): 4&lt;/ref&gt; Some concrete examples: new equal opportunities acts requiring mainstreaming (e.g., in France social partners are required to promote gender equality through collective bargaining); mainstreaming or [[gender]] assessment in individual ministries or areas of public services (e.g., in Finland and Sweden); and [[gender]] assessment of all new pieces of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Rubery, Jill, 2005, Reflections on Gender Mainstreaming: An Example of Feminist Economics in Action?, Feminist Economics 11(3), November 2005, 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jill Rubery, a Professor of comparative employment system at Manchester School of Management, so far "the experience has been mixed: though the argument that increasing women's employment is critical to the achievement of Europe's aspirations for a higher employment rate has been widely accepted, there is a much weaker and more fragile commitment to improving the quality of work available to women."&lt;ref name="Rubery, Jill 2005"/&gt;

A second example is the Transnational Women's Networks.&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"&gt;Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 12&lt;/ref&gt; As such we can cite the [[European Women's Lobby]] (EWL) as an important women's organization at EU level that was created in 1990. About 2,500 [[NGOs]] of 30 European countries are part of the EWL.&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|51}} The [[European Women's Lobby]] encourages "coordination of women's civic groups on the EU stages."&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt; The EWL lobbied for increasing the involvement of women's organizations in the process of gender governance.&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|51}} In addition the EWL has been pushing for "an EU Strategy to promote, implement and facilitate civil society and specifically women's organizations input into the European debate as an essential part of the European social model."&lt;ref&gt;European Women's Lobby. 2005a. Contribution from the European Women's Lobby to the Green Paper on an EU Approach to Managing Economic Migration, COM(2005)811 final, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Another important organization is [[Women in Development Europe]] (WIDE). This network, created in 1985, consists of NGOs, women's organizations, gender experts, and activists active in development. [[Women in Development Europe]] monitors European economic and developmental policies and practices&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|52}}  and is involved at many phases in policy-making activities as knowledge source.&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|52}}

Another [[gender]] governance actor is the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE), established in May 2007. The EIGE has as mandate to "provide expertise, improve knowledge and raise visibility of equality between men and women".&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|53}}

Obviously there are many more initiatives on EU level, to name a few: Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|57}} High Level Group on Gender Mainstreaming,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|58}} Inter-Service Group on Gender Equality,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt; Informal Group of Experts on Gender Equality in Development Cooperation,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|61}} Women in Europe for our Common Future.&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt;

==Criticism==

===Ineffective results===
Maria Stratigaki, Assistant Professor at the Department of Social Policy of [[Panteion University]], claims that the transformative effect of gender mainstreaming was minimal and its application has led to contradictory results. It opened important opportunities for specific policies in new [[policy]] areas, whereas in some other it diluted [[positive action]]. She also claims that, at least as of 2003, gender mainstreaming has failed to affect core [[policy]] areas or radically transform [[policy]] processes within the European Institutions.&lt;ref name="Stratigaki, M 2005"&gt;Stratigaki, M., (2005) "Gender Mainstreaming vs Positive Action. An Ongoing Conflict in EU Gender Equality Policy", ''European Journal of Women's Studies'' 12 (2): 165-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say that gender mainstreaming has not increased women's participation in decision making. As Charlesworth notes, "[i]n the most readily measurable area, the United Nations' employment of women in professional and managerial posts, progress has been glacial. In 2004, women held 37.4 percent of these positions. The annual growth rate toward the 50 percent target [...] is predicted to be 0.4 percent. On top of this slow growth, there is a considerable hierarchy based on sex. On June 30, 2004, women held 83.3 percent of positions at the lowest professional level, P-1, but just 16.7 percent at the highest staff level, Under-Secretary-General."&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt; In a similar vein, concerning the [[European Union]], Lombardo reports that as of 2003 women represented only 20 percent of the representatives of the head of state or government the member states, 10 percent of the representatives of national parliaments, 31.25 percent of the representatives of the [[European Parliament]] and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", Social Politics 12(3): 422&lt;/ref&gt;

True claims that mainstreaming gender does not end in simply increasing the number of women within a specific institution. It is about changing social consciousness, so that the effects of a policy for both women and men are truly analyzed before they are implemented. While it is necessary for [[feminists]] to engage with mainstream institutions, the ability of gender mainstreaming to deconstruct the embedded masculinization of institutions varies depending on the characteristics of the policy, the political nature of the institution, and the depth of the institution's consultation with civil society and other members of the women's rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;"True, J. (2010) "Mainstreaming Gender in International Relations". ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'' (New York: Routledge) L.J. Shepherd (Ed.) 194"&lt;/ref&gt; The danger of gender mainstreaming is that large compromises can be made for small gains and can lead to what feminist and sociology professor Carol Dines calls "trickle-down [[feminism]]"—i.e., "working to increase the ranks of women in elite jobs without a strategy for wider economic and social change represents a kind of "trickle-down [[feminism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/25/having-it-all-women-anne-marie-slaughter |title='Having it all' looks very different for women stuck in low-paid jobs &amp;#124; Gail Dines &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor implementation===
Charlesworth remarks that "[a]lthough it has not been difficult to encourage the adoption of the vocabulary of mainstreaming, there is little evidence of monitoring or follow-up. A consistent problem for all the organizations that adopted gender mainstreaming is the translation of the commitment into action."&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt; She continues: "A review of gender mainstreaming policies implemented under the [[United Nations Development Programme]], [[World Bank]], and [[ILO]] found inadequate budgeting for the gender components of projects, insufficient development of analytical skills, poor supervision of the implementation of gender components and a general lack of political commitment both within the organization and at the country level."&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt;

===Hindering progress===
Stratigaki claims that [[positive action]] was sidelined after the launch of gender mainstreaming as a result of the specific way gender mainstreaming was used by the opponents of [[gender equality]]. According to Stratigaki, "[a]lmost all analyses of [gender mainstreaming] agree that it is a strategy which complements but does not replace previous gender specific equality policies like equal treatment legislation and positive action." However, she states too that "in a hostile gender equality policy environments (i.e. patriarchal structures of institutional organisations or the prevalence of policy objectives contrary to gender equality etc.), [gender mainstreaming] may be conceived and applied as an alternative to positive action and used to downplay the final overall objective of [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="Stratigaki, M 2005"/&gt;

True is of the opinion that in practice, attempts to mainstream gender within international institutions have led to the marginalization and increasing invisibility of gender in each policy area. Anne-Marie Goetz, a Clinical Professor at [[NYU]], and Joanne Sandler, a consultant for gender equality and organizational development, argue that ironically, mainstreaming gender runs the risk of becoming everyone's responsibility, yet nobody's at the same time.&lt;ref name="True, J., 2010, p. 196"&gt;True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. ''Gender Mainstreaming in International Institutions''. New York: Routledge. p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming can allow those in power who are not genuinely interested in the women's movement to adopt the language of women's rights, a reflection of power politics that becomes more of a tool used to legitimize the actions of governments. Gender mainstreaming then becomes more about advising governments than advancing gender equality.&lt;ref name="True, J., 2010, p. 198"&gt;True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. ''Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions''. New York: Routledge. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticism===

As differences are silenced, the kind of [[feminism]] that is likely to be mainstreamed could be a western, white, or middle class brand of feminism. When mainstreaming decisions within international organizations are made by elites can undermine the input of local women's groups.&lt;ref name=Palmary&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Palmary, I.|author2=Nunez, L.|year=2009|title=The Orthodoxy of Gender Mainstreaming: Reflecting on Gender Mainstreaming as Strategy for Accomplishing the Millennium Development Goals|journal=Journal of Health Management|volume=11|issue=65|pages=65–78|doi=10.1177/097206340901100105}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}}

When gender mainstreaming policies are drafted without consulting sections of the women's movement (i.e., women's rights civil society groups), they lack ground level-expertise. [[Policy]] decisions related to gender that are made without consulting sections of the women's movement do not demonstrate a clear political willingness to addressing gender inequality. When institutions reach out to the women's rights movement, it demonstrates transparency, inclusiveness, accountability and the implementation process is more likely to be monitored with diligence.&lt;ref name="True, J., 2010, p. 199"&gt;True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions. New York: Routledge. p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), as an attempt at mainstreaming gender into development, were formed with minimal consultation with women's groups. The MDGs have led to a considerable amount of theoretically discourse about the goals but less analysis about how they will be implemented.&lt;ref name=Palmary/&gt;{{rp|78}}

True highlights the tendency for gender mainstreaming to become a guise under which women are used as economic subjects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women are framed in terms of advancing economic growth, as opposed to the inherent normative ideal for women and men to hold equal positions of power in society.

The '''Gobabeb Training and Research Center''' is an internationally recognised centre for dry land training and research in Namibia. It is located in the [[Namib Desert]], 120&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Walvis Bay]]. 
[[Image:gobabeb from air.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Gobabeb Training and Research Centre]]
Gobabeb was founded by the Austrian [[entomologist]] Dr. Charles Koch in 1962. Since 1998 Gobabeb has been a joint Venture between the ''Ministry of Environment and Tourism'' (MET) and the ''Desert Research Foundation Namibia'' (DRFN). Gobabeb conducts research in the fields of [[climate]], ecology and [[geomorphology]]. Further it tests, demonstrates and promotes [[Appropriate technology|Appropriate Technologies]]. By conducting training courses Gobabeb aims to improve the public awareness and knowledge of dry land ecology and environmental issues. The station consists of permanent researchers, students, and interns, as well as short time visitors such as school and university groups, and tourists. Gobabeb also hosts film crews, journalists and artists.

== Station ==
[[File:Gobabeb Watertower.jpg|thumb|The iconic watertower of Gobabeb]]
The Station is located 120&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Walvis Bay]] in Namibia's largest nature reserve ''Namib Naukluft Park''. Gobabeb lies at the meeting point of three different ecosystems: the ephemeral [[Kuiseb River]], the [[Sand dune|Sand Dunes Sea]] to the south and the [[Gravel|gravel plains]] to the north. This offers an excellent diversity of environments in which to conduct research.

=== Climate ===

As the station is located in the [[Namib desert]], the climate is [[hyperarid]] with an average annual precipitation of 23.8&amp;nbsp;mm, about 65% during the summer months (December to May). In 2010/2011 an extreme rainfall of about 165 millimetres was measured during rainy season. With each average monthly temperature above 18&amp;nbsp;°C, in [[Köppen climate classification]], the climate is considered as [[Tropical_climate|tropical]]. With an average annual temperature of 21.4&amp;nbsp;°C, the climate is nearly 6&amp;nbsp;°C warmer than the temperate coast (15.5&amp;nbsp;°C at Walvis Bay) though at about 400 m above sea level : given that Gobabeb is at about 60&amp;nbsp;km from the coast it is much less under the influence of the cold coastal ocean Benguela current than coastal areas such as Walvis Bay. A cold coastal ocean current cools the above oceanic air. The latter being cooled, water vapour in that air may become liquid water. Therefore, clouds and particularly fogs may appear, hugely diminishing insolation and thus temperature. Thus cold ocean currents along western coast of continents doubly cool these coasts : by their own cold and by the nebulosity (due to clouds including fogs and mists) they bring. For instance Walvis Bay has 140 days of fog per year while Gobabeb has "only" 94 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raison.com.na/Pages%2020%20to%2045.pdf| page 27&lt;/ref&gt; Gobabeb's remoteness from the Atlantic explains why it is significantly warmer than the Namibian coast ''(Walvis Bay average temperature is only 15.4&amp;nbsp;°C)'' despite being at a greater altitude.

The Station consists of the Community Research – Center, a library, laboratories, an office block, a meeting hall, the iconic water tower, staff houses and accommodations for visitors.

== History ==
[[File:Dr. Charles Koch on fieldtrip in gravel plains.jpg|thumb|Dr. Charles Koch, Gobabeb's first director (at right), on a field trip in the gravel plains]]
[[File:Gobabeb Gedenktafel Koch.jpg|thumb|The plaque on the wall pays tribute to Dr. Charles Koch]]
Gobabeb was formerly a Topnaar community called ''!Nomabeb'', which means ''place of the figtree''. In 1958 the Austrian [[entomologist]] Dr. Charles Koch did an expedition in the [[Namib Desert]], focused on the large diversity of beetles found in the area. One year later the South African [[Transvaal Museum]] decided to found a research station in, what was at the time known as, [[South West Africa]] (today called [[Namibia]]). In 1962 the ''Namib Desert Research Station'' (''NDSR'') was founded, with Dr. Charles Koch appointed as the first director of the station. The government of South Africa, which controlled South West Africa, supported Gobabeb by giving the ground on leasehold for 50 years and financial support of R2,000 per year.

In 1963 the construction of the staff houses, laboratory, office block, garages and a small water tower was completed. In 1965 a partnership between Gobabeb and the ''[[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|South African Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]]'' (''CSIR'') led to the foundation of the ''Desert Ecological Research Unit'' (''DERU''). The partnership provided R25,000 for the station which was invested in additional buildings.

Five years later, in 1970, the director Dr. Charles Koch died and the biologist Dr. Mary Seely took over the directorship. In 1983, the first Open Weekend was held at Gobabeb, beginning a tradition that continues to this day. In 1989 the first course for Namibian university students in ''Ecology Methods'' was held at Gobabeb.

With the Independence of Namibia in 1990 the ''DERU'' became the ''Desert Research Foundation of Namibia'' (DRFN). The main seat of the DRFN moved to [[Windhoek]], but the research station remained in Gobabeb. In March 1998 ''Gobabeb Training and Research Center'' (''GTRC'') was founded as a [[Joint venture|joint venture agreement]] between the ''DRFN'' and the ''Ministry of Environment and Tourism'' (''MET'').  Additionally, the German ''Ministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung'' (''Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development'') has been a great supporter of GTRC.

Since the formation of the joint venture, Gobabeb has operated as a research, training and education centre. Researchers from all over the world study subjects including [[desertification]], water procurement, and the [[adaption]] of animals and plants to the desert environment. In 2002, after 32 years directorship at Gababeb, Dr. Mary Seely passed the position on to Dr. Joh Henschel. The new director arranged the building of several new accommodations for visitors as well as the building of the Community Resource – Center at Gobabeb.

From 2002 to 2004 Gobabeb's energy system was overhauled as a part of the ''Demonstration Project at Gobabeb of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency'' (DeGREEE). In May 2005 Prime Minister [[Nahas Angula|Angula]] officially inaugurated of the ''Gobabeb Training and Research Center''.
In March 2011 Joh Henschel resigned his position as director, ushering in a period of transition at Gobabeb lasting from March to August 2011, when the station's affairs were handled by a management committee and an overseer. In January 2013 Gillian Maggs-Kölling was appointed Executive Director of GTRC.

==Research==
The overall goal of research at Gobabeb is to '''improve the understanding of arid land ecosystems, particularly their variability,''' with a focus on supporting well-trained specialists and decision-makers in southern Africa and the world. Gobabeb has been the locus of much of the basic research on Namib desert [[organism]]s and, more broadly, into the ecology of southern African [[desert]]s and [[Arid|arid land]]. Every year over 100 scientists visit Gobabeb to undertake research and in the past 50 years, over 1900 publications has been produced at Gobabeb. As a result of such research, the worldwide knowledge about animals and plants coping with the extreme conditions of the desert has vastly improved.
[[Image:Onymacris unguicularis.jpg|thumb|One of Gobabebs greatest discoveries: The beetle Onymacris unguicularis]]

The fields of research at Gobabeb include: 
*Desert [[organism]]s and their [[biodiversity]]
*Arid land ecosystems and geo-processes
*Preventing [[desertification]]
*[[Climate]] and [[climate change]]
*[[Restoration Ecology]] of [[degraded land]]s
*[[Appropriate Technology]]
*[[Alternative Livelihood]]s within the limits of arid environments

The results of this research contribute to many other projects. In particular, long term ecological monitoring of [[climate]] and [[biodiversity]], which in some cases has been collected continuously for almost 50 years, represents a valuable contribution to global scientific knowledge. Additionally, research results from Gobabeb support the ''Kuiseb Basin Management Committee'' to undertake its integrated land and water management program. 
In 2010, the ''Namib Ecological Restoration and Monitoring Unit'' (''NERMU'') was established at Gobabeb to address the issue of expanding [[uranium mining]] and [[prospecting]] within the Namib desert. To date, ''NERMU'' has researched or is researching the impact of mining and prospecting on the ''Hartmann's Mountain Zebra'', the ''Husab Sand Lizard'', ''hypolithic cyanobacteria'' and other organisms.

== Training ==
Training is a '''primary function''' of the ''Gobabeb Training and Research Center''. Over 1.000 learners come to Gobabeb each year, receiving training in various fields.

Most of the participants are students from primary, secondary and tertiary school. However, farmers, private persons, community representatives and interested groups are also trained. The training is broad-based and concentrates on using participatory methods and hands-on approaches. The Programs are provided by Gobabeb staff, visiting trainers and local, regional and international expert. Training is offered in the fields of community based [[natural resource management]], arid land management, [[desertification]], ecology and [[appropriate technology]].

In addition to short training courses, Gobabeb has offered long-term tertiary training to over 180 students at the centre.
The ''Summer Desertification Programme'' (''SDP'') ran from 1993 to 2005. Participants were presented with a real-life research problem concerning [[land degradation]], and involving bio-physical and socio-economic factors.

Following the end of funding of ''SDP'', the Gobabeb ''In-Service Training Programme'' (''GIST'')began in 2005 as a partnership between the [[Polytechnic of Namibia]] and Gobabeb. ''GIST'' research projects included one term of study (approximately 3-month) and covered a wide variety of topics related to the ecology of the Namib Desert.

In 2009, the ''GIST Program'' transformed into the ''Gobabeb Training and Research Internship Program'' (''GTRIP''), opening the course to all Namibian university students and recent graduates. Since 2010, research in the ''GTRIP'' course has focused on [[restoration ecology]] in the Namib Desert, contributing to the goals of ''NERMU''.

Gobabeb hosts also national and international interns and volunteers

== Appropriate technology ==

The ''Gobabeb Training and Research Center'' has been built as an example of [[appropriate technology]], which shows how appropriate technology and [[sustainable development]] can be used in daily life. It demonstrates techniques that are applicable at community and commercial/industrial levels.
[[File:Gobabeb solar panels.jpg|thumb|A part of the "Demonstration Project at Gobabeb of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency" (DeGREEE) Project: The solar panels]]

Following systems at Gobabeb are installed under the heading of Appropriate Technology:

*A solar-diesel hybrid energy system, consisting of 370 [[solar panels]], 60 [[lead acid batteries]] and two [[diesel generator]]s. Through this system, more than 90% of all energy used at Gobabeb, mainly for electricity and water heating, is provided by the sun.
*A water recycling system. All sewage water from the station goes into a [[trickle filter|trickling filter]] system and gets used again.
*[[Fog]] harvesting. With the help of different kinds of nets, fog water is harvested at Gobabeb. One net can gather up to 3.3 litres of water per square meter on a foggy night. This method might have practical application in the Topnaar settlements along the [[Kuiseb River]].
*Appropriate Buildings.  New buildings are made of clay bricks which are made from silt of the Kuiseb River. The thick walls of these bricks are thermally ideal for the desert, being warm in winter and cool in summer.
*Waste management. All organic waste is fed to goats belonging to the Topnaar community. [[Recycling|Recyclable]] waste like glass, metals, plastics and paper are taken to [[Walvis Bay]] where they are handed to recycling agencies linked to the Walvis Bay Municipality.
*[[Solar energy|Solar]] Cooking. Gobabeb uses two different kind of [[solar cooker]]s, box cookers and a parabolic cooker, all of which do not require any electricity.

==Library==
[[File:Gobabeb Library.jpg|thumb|The Gobabeb Centre Library]]
The '''Gobabeb Centre Library''' is built for researchers, students and staff, working in and around Gobabeb, as well being open to interested visitors. The library provides access to information and works done in and around Gobabeb and in the [[Namib Desert]].  
The Library started in 1963 with its first in-house publications ''Scientific Papers of the Namib Desert Research Station'' by Gobabeb's first Director Dr. Charles Koch. Since then the library has grown to house the most extensive collection on arid zone research in ecology and [[biology]] in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].  It is certainly the leading information centre on the Namib Desert and also includes information on deserts of the world.  This information is stored in ''books (1780''), ''journal offprint publications (18790'') and in ''30 journal holdings''.  
To offer easier access to library for our users, Gobabeb is in the process of digitising information stored in the library. With the help of D-LIB it soon will be possible to get information from the ''Gobabeb Centre Library'' via Internet.

Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding [[King Arthur]]), are usually classified as [[cultural heritage]] or [[legend]]s, because they do not show the "disinterested investigation" required of the discipline of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Knowing Teaching and Learning History, National and International Perspectives |last= Seixas |first= Peter |editor= Peter N.

Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state [[chronicle]], the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts survived.

Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a [[Outline of academic disciplines#History|major discipline]] in university studies.

==Etymology==
[[File:History-Dielman-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|''History'' by [[Frederick Dielman]] (1896)]]
The word ''history'' comes ultimately from [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ἱστορία|ἱστορία]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(stori/a|ἱστορία}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''historía''), meaning "inquiry", "knowledge from inquiry", or "judge". It was in that sense that [[Aristotle]] used the word in his {{lang|grc|[[History of Animals|Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα Ἱστορίαι]]}}&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora"&gt;Ferrater-Mora, José. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai'' "Inquiries about Animals"). The ancestor word {{lang|grc|ἵστωρ}} is attested early on in [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Heraclitus]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[ephebos|ephebes]]' oath, and in [[Boeotia|Boiotic]] inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar).

The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as ''historia'', meaning "investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative". ''History'' was borrowed from Latin (possibly via [[Old Irish]] or [[Old Welsh]]) into [[Old English]] as ''stær'' ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"&gt;"history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, as Latin became [[Old French]] (and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]), ''historia'' developed into forms such as ''istorie'', ''estoire'', and ''historie'', with new developments in the meaning: "account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (c. 1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c. 1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c. 1462)".&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

It was from Anglo-Norman that ''history'' was borrowed into [[Middle English]], and this time the loan stuck. It appears in the thirteenth-century ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'', but seems to have become a common word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing in [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' of the 1390s (VI.1383): "I finde in a bok compiled | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire". In [[Middle English]], the meaning of ''history'' was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, esp. human affairs" arose in the mid-fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

With the [[Renaissance]], older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that [[Francis Bacon]] used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote about "[[Natural history|Natural History]]". For him, ''historia'' was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by [[memory]] (while [[science]] was provided by [[reason]], and [[poetry]] was provided by [[fantasy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an expression of the linguistic [[Synthetic language|synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy]], English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and [[storytelling]] in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".

The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;Whitney, W. D. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historian'' in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], the substantive "history" is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, "History", or the word ''[[historiography]]''.&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Historians' History of the World - Title Page.jpg|thumb|The title page to ''[[The Historians' History of the World]]'']]
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of [[Benedetto Croce]], "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a "true discourse of past" through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Whitney, (1889). [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 2842].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.

All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search – 3.0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917065532/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=17 September 2005 }}, "History".&lt;/ref&gt; The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the "true past").

The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the [[humanities]] and at other times as part of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. Page 1. {{ISBN|0-415-05682-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Page 416.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, French [[historian]] [[Fernand Braudel]] revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[geography]] in the study of global history.

Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an [[oral tradition]], and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Lemon (1995). The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. Page 201. {{ISBN|0-415-12346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.

[[Archaeology]] is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical [[Annapolis, Maryland]], USA; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.

There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and prehistory==
{{Human history and prehistory|250}}
{{Further|Protohistory}}

The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1930&amp;dq=Jack+Goody+2007&amp;sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote:
{{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p.108, {{ISBN|0-14-020652-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography}}
[[File:Guicciardini M Francesco La Historia dItalia.jpg|thumb|left|The title page to ''La Historia d'Italia'']]
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, [[world view]], use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Historiography: Ancient, medieval, and modern'' (University of Chicago Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the twentieth century: From scientific objectivity to the postmodern challenge'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Philosophy of history}}
{{unreferenced section| date= January 2016}}
Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; Historical method basics &lt;/div&gt;

The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
# ''When was'' the source, written or unwritten, produced ([[Calendar date|date]])?
# Where was it produced ([[Internationalization and localization|localization]])?
# By whom was it produced ([[author]]ship)?
# From what pre-existing material was it produced ([[wikt:analysis|analysis]])?
# In what original form was it produced ([[integrity]])?
# What is the evidential value of its contents ([[credibility]])?
The first four are known as [[historical criticism]]; the fifth, [[textual criticism]]; and, together, external criticism. ''The sixth and final inquiry'' about a source is called internal criticism.

The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 BC – ca.425 BC)&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=5|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history". However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at [[Causality|cause and effect]], rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"/&gt; In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]], with events regularly recurring.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=6|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval [[China]]. The groundwork for professional historiography in [[East Asia]] was established by the [[Han dynasty]] court historian known as [[Sima Qian]] (145–90 BC), author of the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji''). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of [[Chinese historiography]]. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his ''Shiji'' as the official format for [[Twenty-Four Histories|historical texts]], as well as for biographical literature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[Secularity|secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"/&gt;

In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systemic bias|systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography"&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin Ahmed (1999).

W. Akhtar (1997). "The Islamic Concept of Knowledge", ''Al-Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought &amp; Culture'' '''12''' (3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany.

In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[Great Man theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included [[Fernand Braudel]], [[E. H. Carr]], [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Bruce Trigger]], [[Marc Bloch]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Peter Gay]], [[Robert Fogel]], [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Lawrence Stone]]. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of [[digital history]] has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] and [[Gerhard Ritter]] argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the [[imagination]], and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]] (cf. ''[[History of mentalities|histoire des mentalités]]''). Intellectual historians such as [[Herbert Butterfield]], [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[George Mosse]] have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of [[social history]] to emerge in the post-WWII era was ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Detlev Peukert]] sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] period.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[Georges Lefebvre]], [[Eugene Genovese]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[François Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]] defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history}}
The [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist historiography]] was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail M. Krom, "From the Center to the Margin: the Fate of Marxism in Contemporary Russian Historiography," ''Storia della Storiografia'' (2012) Issue 62, pp 121-130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periods===
{{Main|Periodization}}
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.&lt;ref name="Marwick-p169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillan Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period. [[Century|Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.&lt;ref name="Tosh-p168-169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prehistoric periodisation====
The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. The usual method for periodisation of the distant [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] past, in [[archaeology]] is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. Here prehistory is divided into a series of "chapters" so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Time|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0415311977|location=Oxon|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This narrative content could be in the form of functional-economic interpretation. There are periodisation, however, that do not have this narrative aspect, relying largely on relative chronology and, thus, devoid of any specific meaning.

Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through [[radiocarbon dating]] and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used. Periodisation, however, is not viewed as a perfect framework with one account explaining that "cultural changes do not conveniently start and stop (combinedly) at periodisation boundaries" and that different trajectories of change are also needed to be studied in their own right before they get intertwined with cultural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Living Landscape: Bronze Age Settlement Sites in the Dutch River Area (C. 2000-800 BC)|last=Arnoldussen|first=Stijn|publisher=Sidestone Press|year=2007|isbn=9789088900105|location=Leiden|pages=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Geographical locations===
Particular [[Geography|geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[Country|countries]], and [[City|cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. According to [[Jules Michelet]] in his book ''Histoire de France'' (1833), "without geographical basis, the people, the makers of history, seem to be walking on air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Relations of History and Geography: Studies in England, France and the United States|last=Darby|first=Henry Clifford|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=2002|isbn=0859896994|location=Exeter|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization. There is also the case of climate, which historians like [[Ellsworth Huntington]] and Allen Semple, cited as a crucial influence on the course of history and racial temperament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history from early times to A D 2000|last=Rao|first=B.V.|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

*** [[History of Southeast Asia]] has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}

[[Military history]] concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat. The "new military history" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.&lt;ref name=Pavkovic&gt;{{Cite book | last =Pavkovic

===History of religion===
{{Main|History of religions}}

The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include ''[[Church History (journal)|Church History]]'', ''[[The Catholic Historical Review]]'', and ''[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]]''. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Cochrane |title=What Is Catholic Historiography? |journal=Catholic Historical Review |volume=61 |issue=2 |year=1975 |pages=169–190 |jstor=25019673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.&lt;ref&gt;For example see {{cite journal |first=Sofia Boesch |last=Gajano |first2=Tommaso |last2=Caliò |title=Italian Religious Historiography in the 1990s |journal=Journal of Modern Italian Studies |year=1998 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=293–306 |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social history===
{{Main|Social history}}
''Social history'', sometimes called the ''new social history'', is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stearns, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Social History'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security'', Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with social history while [[political history]] came next with 1425 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007 - listed by research interest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530073940/http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html |date=30 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great Man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=978-0-582-48488-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=978-0-300-14424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subfields====
The chief subfields of social history include:
* [[Demographic history]]
* [[History of education]]
* [[Ethnic history]]
* [[History of the family]]
* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labour history]]
* [[Rural history]]
* [[Urban history]]
** [[American urban history]]
* [[Women's history]]
Smaller specialties include:
* [[History of childhood]]
* [[Gender history]]

===Cultural history===
{{Main|Cultural history}}
Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
Cultural history includes the study of [[History of art|art in society]] as well is the study of images and human visual production ([[iconography]]).&lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, {{ISBN|978-2-84736-185-8}}.

===Diplomatic history===
{{Main|Diplomatic history}}
[[Diplomatic history]]  focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of [[International relations#History|international relations]] between states or across state boundaries over time. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War, "diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies."&lt;ref&gt;Muriel E Chamberlain, ''Pax Britannica'? British Foreign Policy 1789–1914'' (1988) p 1&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.

===Economic history===
{{main|Economic history|Business history}}
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, "Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?," Historically Speaking (April 2010) v. 11#2 pp 17-20, with responses pp 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business history]]  deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history is most often taught in business schools.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Amatori, and Geoffrey Jones, eds. ''Business History Around the World'' (2003) [https://www.questia.com/read/114846992 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental history===
{{main|Environmental history}}
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Hughes, ''What is Environmental History'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/What-Environmental-History/dp/0745631886/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World history===
{{main|World history}}
{{See also|History of the world|Universal history}}
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ainslie Embree]] and Carol Gluck, eds., ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''  (M.E. Sharpe, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Akita, "World History and the Emergence of Global History in Japan,"''Chinese Studies in History'', Spring 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 84-96&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.

It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others.

The World History Association publishes the ''Journal of World History'' every quarter since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501050602/http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~world/|title=H-World - H-Net|website=www.h-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.

===People's history===
{{Main|People's history}}
A [[people's history]] is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the [[Populism|perspective of common people]]. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[nonconformist]]s, and the otherwise forgotten people. The authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the [[History Workshop Journal|History Workshop]] movement in Britain in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wade Matthews|title=The New Left, National Identity, and the Break-up of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfmZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|pages=20–21|isbn=9789004253070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual history===
{{Main|Intellectual history|History of ideas}}
Intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony |last=Grafton |title=The History of Ideas: Precept and Practice, 1950–2000 and beyond |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=67 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=1–32 |url=http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Maryanne Cline |editor-last=Horowitz |title=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender history===
{{Main|Gender history}}
[[Gender history]] is a sub-field of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.

===Public history===
{{Main|Public history}}
[[Public history]] describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;David Glassberg, "Public history and the study of memory." ''The Public Historian'' (1996): 7-23. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377910 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events.They discover this information through archaeological evidence, written primary sources from the past and other various means such as place names. In [[list of historians|lists of historians]], historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. [[Chronicle]]rs and [[annals|annalists]], though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.

==The judgement of history==
{{see also|Ash heap of history}}
Since the 20th century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the "judgement of history."&lt;ref name="Curran2000p413"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413 pp.413-5]&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of [[Judgment (law)|legal judgement]]s, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.&lt;ref name="Curran2000p415"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415 p.415]&lt;/ref&gt; A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of [[collective memory]].

==Pseudohistory==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}

[[Pseudohistory]] is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard [[Historical method|historiographical conventions]] in a way which undermines their conclusions.
Closely related to deceptive [[Historical negationism|historical revisionism]], works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

==Teaching history==

===Scholarship vs teaching===
A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor [[Charles Harding Firth]], Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as Manchester University, where [[Thomas Frederick Tout]] was professionalizing the History undergraduate programme by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Roots, "Firth, Sir Charles Harding (1857–1936)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33137, Online; accessed 10 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reba Soffer, "Nation, duty, character and confidence: history at Oxford, 1850–1914." ''Historical Journal'' (1987) 30#01 pp: 77-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Donoghue, ''The Last Professors: The Corporate University and the Fate of the Humanities'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980, attention increasingly moved toward teaching [[world history]] or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Swansinger, "Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York," ''History Teacher'', (November 2009), 43#1 pp 87-96&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.

The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the ''[[Nouvelle histoire]]'' as disseminated after the 1960s by ''Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery." Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, " The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s," ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199-221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias in school teaching===
[[File:Historybooks.JPG|thumb|History books in a bookstore]]
In several countries history textbooks are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Nicholls, ed. ''School History Textbooks across Cultures: International Debates and Perspectives'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favourable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the [[Nanking Massacre]] has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schneider, "The Japanese History Textbook Controversy in East Asian Perspective," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', May 2008, Vol. 617, pp 107-122&lt;/ref&gt; It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;"Problems of Teaching Contemporary Russian History," ''Russian Studies in History'', Winter 2004, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Blackwell-Synergy.com |journal=International Affairs |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=365–370 |doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00708.x|year = 2008|last1 = Wedgwood Benn|first1 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], especially the [[Southern United States|southern part]] history about [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[American Civil War]] are controversial topics. [[McGraw-Hill Education]] for example, was criticised for describing Africans brought to American plantations as "workers" instead of slaves in a textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny|last2=Hauser|first2=Christine|date=5 October 2015|title=Texas Mother Teaches Textbook Company a Lesson on Accuracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/publisher-promises-revisions-after-textbook-refers-to-african-slaves-as-workers.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.&lt;ref&gt;"Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India," ''History Workshop Journal'', April 2009, Issue 67, pp 99-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Volodina, "Teaching History in Russia After the Collapse of the USSR," ''History Teacher'', February 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp 179-188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace."  The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."&lt;ref&gt;Simone Lässig and Karl Heinrich Pohl, "History Textbooks and Historical Scholarship in Germany," ''History Workshop Journal'' Issue 67, Spring 2009 pp 128-9 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v067/67.lassig.html online at project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''iMelody''' is a non-polyphonic [[ringtone]] exchange object format,&lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.sonyericsson.com/getDocument.do?docId=74305 Sony Ericsson W800 White Paper (R2A)]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF file, page 19) (you'll need to enter in a text from a captcha image in order to download the file)&lt;/ref&gt; used for [[mobile phone]]s [Extension: '''.imy'''], defined by [[Ericsson]] and [[Sony Ericsson]] together with other manufacturers and is based on Ericsson's proprietary eMelody format. The iMelody format was made because the eMelody had some musical limitations.

== Transferring melody to mobile phones ==
In order to transfer these ringtones to a mobile phone, one could simply send an [[Short message service|SMS message]] with the iMelody/eMelody text as the text of the message, or one could make a plain text file containing the iMelody/eMelody text and using the extension of either .imy for iMelody or .emy for eMelody and transfer the file to the mobile phone by [[bluetooth]], [[IrDA]] (infrared), or by a data cable. The file could also be attached to an [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] message or an e-mail message.

== iMelody ==
'''MIME''': "text/x-iMelody" or "audio/iMelody"

'''Extension''': ".imy"

Here is an example of an advanced ringtone in the iMelody format, this is a silent ringtone that only makes the phone's vibrating motor vibrate constantly:
 BEGIN:IMELODY
 VERSION:1.2
 FORMAT:CLASS1.0
 BEAT:25
 MELODY:vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeon (r2vibeonvibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2ledonr2vibeonr2vibeon

'''''Inside the Neolithic Mind: Consciousness, Cosmos and the Realm of the Gods''''' is a [[cognitive archaeology|cognitive archaeological]] study of [[Neolithic]] religious beliefs in Europe co-written by the archaeologists [[David Lewis-Williams]] and David Pearce, both of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. It was first published by [[Thames and Hudson]] in 2005. Following on from Lewis-Williams' earlier work, ''[[The Mind in the Cave]]'' (2002), the book discusses the role of human cognition in the development of religion and Neolithic art.

The premise of ''Inside the Neolithic Mind'' is that irrespective of cultural differences, all humans share in the ability to enter into [[altered states of consciousness]], in which they experience [[entoptic phenomenon]], which the authors discern as a three-stage process leading to visionary experiences. Arguing that such altered experiences have provided the background to religious beliefs and some artistic creativity throughout human history, they focus their attention on the Neolithic, or "New Stone Age" period, when across Europe, communities abandoned their nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles and settled to become sedentary agriculturalists.

Adopting case studies from the opposite ends of Neolithic Europe, Lewis-Williams and Pearce discuss the archaeological evidence from both the Near East &amp;ndash; including such sites as [[Nevalı Çori]], [[Göbekli Tepe]] and [[Çatalhöyük]] &amp;ndash; and Atlantic Europe, including the sites of [[Newgrange]], [[Knowth]] and [[Bryn Celli Ddu]]. The authors argue that these monuments illustrate the influence of altered states of consciousness in constructing cosmological views of a tiered universe, in doing so drawing ethnographic parallels with [[shamanism|shamanistic]] cultures in Siberia and Amazonia.

Academic reviews published in such peer-reviewed journals as ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' were mixed. Critics argued that the use of evidence was selective, and that there was insufficient evidence for the authors' three-stage model of entopic phenomenon. Others praised the accessible and engaging writing style.

==Synopsis==
In their preface, Lewis-Williams and Pearce explain their approach, and their reasons for comparing megalithic art and archaeology from the Near East and Atlantic Europe. They express their opinion that such comparisons are made possible &amp;ndash; despite the cultural and geographical differences &amp;ndash; because of the "universal functioning of the human brain" which unites all ''Homo sapiens'' and leads different societies to develop similar religious and cosmological beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 6&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:GobeklitepeHeykel.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Monolith]] with animals in high and low [[relief]] from Göbekli Tepe.]]

Chapter one, "The Revolutionary Neolithic", explores the background to [[Neolithic|this period of time]], in which humans became increasingly sedentary and developed agriculture. Discussing the various different understandings of the Neolithic advocated within archaeology, they propose that it should be seen as a "revolutionary" period than as "a revolution" in itself, in this way challenging the view made famous by [[V. Gordon Childe]]. Moving on to an exploration of why humans adopted agriculture, they proclaim their adherence to [[Jacques Cauvin]]'s concept of the Symbolic Revolution. From there, they discuss the role of religion, suggesting that it should be understood as a tripartite system uniting experience, practice and belief. This leads on to a discussion of some of the earliest archaeological evidence for the Neolithic, at [[Nevalı Çori]] and [[Göbekli Tepe]], both in Southeastern Turkey, referring to the theory that the ritual beliefs practiced here resulted in the development of agriculture. Lewis-Williams and Pearce round off the chapter by quoting [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem "[[Kubla Khan, or A Vision in a Dream. A Fragment|Kubla Khan]]", written after an experience in an [[altered state of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 13&amp;ndash;36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second chapter, "The Consciousness Contract", the authors explore such altered states of consciousness, beginning with a discussion of the life and work of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Listing the symptoms of such altered states, they put forward their three-stage model for how the human brain experiences these states, and then interprets them as recognisable images.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 37&amp;ndash;59.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter three, "Seeing and Building a Cosmos", proceeds to discuss early humanity's conceptions of [[cosmology]], which the authors argue was probably divided into several tiered realms through which shamans were believed to traverse while in an altered state of consciousness. They follow this with a discussion of the shamanic symbolism of the eye, drawing comparisons with the eyes in the clay statues from 'Ain Ghazal and the [[Plastered human skulls|plastered skulls]] from other Near Eastern sites.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 60&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter four, "Close Encounters with a Built Cosmos", examines two Neolithic settlements in the Near East &amp;ndash; 'Ain Ghazal and [[Çatalhöyük]] &amp;ndash; and argues that their layout and design may have reflected shamanistic conceptions of cosmology. In doing so, the authors draw parallels with the ethnographically-recorded [[Barasana]] people of Amazonia, whose ''maloca'' buildings were understood as cosmological microcosms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 88&amp;ndash;122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fifth chapter, "Domesticating Wild Nature", the authors seek to explore how the people of the Neolithic Near East might have understood the concepts of "death", "birth" and the "wild", drawing on ethnographic examples from various recorded shamanistic societies in order to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 123&amp;ndash;148.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter six, "Treasure the Dream Whatever the Terror", discusses how aspects of consciousness and cosmology can make their way into myth, expanding on the problematic nature of defining "myth". Turning to the [[structuralism|structuralist]] ideas of anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], they discuss Lévi-Strauss's ideas of neurologically based "mythemes" that provided the building blocks for myths; although rejecting his structuralism, they concur that there is a neuropsychological "deep structure" behind mythology, and proceed to compare the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' with a [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] narrative, "The Cave of the Reindeer Woman."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 149&amp;ndash;168.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Newgrange, Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The entrance stone to Newgrange; Lewis-Williams and Pearce argue that these motifs represent entopic phenomenon that have resulted from altered states of consciousness.]]

The seventh chapter, "The Mound in the Dark Grove", turns its attention to Atlantic Europe, on the western end of the continent. Opening with a reference to [[William Blake]], the authors focus their attention on two Early Neolithic tombs on the island of [[Anglesey]] off the Welsh coast: [[Bryn Celli Ddu]] and [[Barclodiad y Gawres]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 169&amp;ndash;197.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter eight, "Brú na Bóinne", examines the [[Brú na Bóinne|valley of the same name]] in [[County Meath]], Ireland, the home to a number of Early Neolithic tombs. Lewis-Williams and Pearce turn their attention to the most prominent two, [[Newgrange]] and [[Knowth]], arguing that their architectural designs reflect cosmological views of the world influenced by altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 198&amp;ndash;249.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the penultimate chapter, "Religion de Profunais", the authors examine a number of recurring features in Neolithic Western Europe which they believe can shed light on the religious beliefs of the period. Exploring ritual elements to the act of flint mining at such sites as [[Grimes Graves]], they discuss the potential shamanic symbolism of [[quartz]]. From there, they look at the art motifs found at sites in this part of the continent, highlighting the argument of Dronfield that such motifs were an attempt to depict entopic phenomenon, in doing so drawing ethnographic parallels with the artworks created by shamans among the [[Tukano people]] of Amazonia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 250&amp;ndash;280.&lt;/ref&gt; The concluding chapter, "East is East and West is West", discusses the authors' views on the potential of their theory, making reference to [[Christopher Hawkes|Hawkes' ladder of inference]]{{Failed verification|date=January 2014}} and arguing for the need to consider [[emic and etic|emic]] perspectives when dealing with past societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 281&amp;ndash;290.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic reviews===
Susan A. Johnston of [[George Washington University]] reviewed the book for the ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' journal, in which she noted that many of the authors' analyses were "interesting, and sometimes quite new and innovative." However, she also felt that there was a disconnection between the theoretical underpinnings to the tome and the analyses that followed; noting that while they were trying to avoid the neurological determinism which had been critiqued by [[Paul Bahn]] and Patricia Helvenston in their ''Waking the Trance Fixed'' (2005), she nevertheless thought their approach similar to it. Ultimately acknowledging that the analysis on offer do not require the neurological backing that the authors provide, Johnston suggested that the contemporary preoccupation with rooting archaeological interpretations in "biological reality" was a part of the "21st-century mind".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Joh06|Johnston 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' journal published a review of ''Inside the Neolithic Mind'' authored by [[Chris Scarre]] of [[Durham University]], in which he noted the controversial nature of Lewis-Williams' "three stages of trance" model, proclaiming that those already unconvinced by the theory will get little from the new book. Scarre noted that inevitably, there was "much to question and to applaud" in the work, before highlighting that the use of evidence was selective, and that the art on the Breton megaliths was not included.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sca07|Scarre 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[American Scientist]]'' published a review authored by Brian D. Hayden of [[Simon Fraser University]], in which he described it as a "very enjoyable" book, praising the book's vignettes as making it "eminently readable". Although remarking that the authors' "endorse cognitive interpretations that are quite different from the more economic and practical interpretations that I generally favor", Hayden nevertheless commented that he agreed with their basic premise. He comments that while some of their assertions do seem plausible, others &amp;ndash; for instance their claims that the idea of a tiered cosmos has a neurological basis &amp;ndash; are less so, being the sort of "speculative indulgences" that he believes typify "English archaeology". Moving on to discuss the authors' views on the relationship between altered states of consciousness and power elites, he expresses his disagreement with them, noting that "the issues of domestication and the emergence of socioeconomic complexity are poorly served by cognitively based explanations."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hay06|Hayden 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

David S. Webster of [[Durham University]]'s Archaeological Services reviewed the work for the ''European Journal of Archaeology'' in which he highlighted its "popular tone and style" and use of the "contentious" three mode-model of trance states, a model he dismisses as a "myth".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Web05|Webster 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Archaeology'', the publication of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], Michael Balter positively reviewed ''Inside the Neolithic Mind'', praising its "superb writing" and "lavishly illustrated descriptions" of archaeological sites. Although he notes that most archaeologists would concur that Neolithic people probably believed in a spirit world, he expressed his belief that "they may balk at the idea" that the act of climbing down step ladders at Çatalhöyük symbolized the descent into the underworld or that hearths in the floors of 'Ain Ghazal symbolized the transformation of fire, rather than the remnants of cookery. He also noted that archaeologists would be more receptive to their idea that geometric patterns on European megaliths have parallels with similarities in Southern Africa and California. Concluding his review, Balter remarked that the authors "can be assured that their foray into the Neolithic mind will not be ignored."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bal05|Balter 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''internal consistency of the Bible''' concerns the coherence and textual integrity of the [[Bible]]. Disputes regarding biblical consistency have a long history.&lt;!--Summary evidences in article, no source needed!--&gt;

Classic texts that discuss questions of inconsistency from a critical secular perspective include the ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'' by [[Baruch Spinoza]], the ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' of [[Voltaire]], the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' by [[Thomas Paine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paine | first = Thomas | authorlink = Thomas Paine | title = Writings of Thomas Paine — Volume 4 (1794–1796): the Age of Reason by Paine | publisher = Project Gutenberg | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3743 | accessdate = 2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consistency==
{{See also|Biblical inerrancy}}
For many believers, the internal consistency of the Jewish and Christian scriptures is important because they feel that any inconsistencies or contradictions could challenge belief in truth of their contents and the view that they are of divine origin.{{cn|date=August 2018}} On the subject of the Jewish text, B. Barry Levy writes about the [[Torah]] that "the textual integrity of every biblical book should be extremely important to those interested in either the [[Hebrew Bible]] or classical Jewish thought". Levy also writes that "Despite the popular, pious-sounding assumption that the Torah text is letter-perfect, frequent and extensive discussions by highly respected [[rabbinic]] leaders demonstrate that they, in some measure similar to modern scholars, were concerned about its true textual state; some of them even tried to clarify known textual doubts and to eliminate many troublesome inconsistencies."&lt;ref&gt;Levy, BB., ''Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible Text in Jewish Law'', Oxford University Press, 2001, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the modern writer Joshua Golding states that even though it contains inconsistencies, this "does not imply that God did not reveal the Torah".&lt;ref&gt;Golding, JL., ''Rationality and Religious Theism'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003, p.106
&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Christian evangelists [[John Ankerberg]] and [[Dillon Burroughs]] state that "the Bible's teachings, if perfect, must be consistent with one another" and that "the Bible is consistent with itself from beginning to end".&lt;ref&gt;Ankerberg, J. and Burroughs, D., ''Taking a Stand for the Bible: Today's Leading Experts Answer Critical Questions about God's Word'', Harvest House Publishers, 2009, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Catholic writers have argued that "If we believe the Scriptures are divinely inspired, we must also believe them to be internally coherent".&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, S., and Mitch, C., ''Ignatius Catholic Study Bible: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon'', Ignatius Press, 2013, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Pastor [[Erwin Lutzer]] argues that the Bible is consistent in asserting that it is the word of God, and that this is a reason for accepting that it is of divine origin: "The sixty-six books speak with a consistent voice that these are the words of God".&lt;ref&gt;Lutzer, EW., ''Seven Reasons Why You Can Trust the Bible'', Moody Publishers, 2008, pp. 16 &amp; 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of traditional Jewish and Christian belief have also argued that inconsistencies undermine the value of scripture. The [[deist]] minister [[Joseph Barker (minister)|Joseph Barker]], speaking in 1854, described the Bible as "the most inconsistent, the most monstrous and blasphemous representations of God that can possibly be conceived by the human mind" and argued that "The book that contradicts science and contradicts itself is a book of no authority whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Hartford Bible Convention'', Partridge &amp; Brittan, 1854, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern Islamic critic writes that if the Bible can be shown to be inconsistent, "then those who preach the Bible and read the Bible must seriously reconsider their source of information concerning their faith."&lt;ref&gt;Rashad Abdul Mahaimin, ''Jesus and the Bible'', Islamic Books, 2003, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

One response to this kind of criticism is to argue that no inconsistencies exist. As theologian [[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] explains, some Christians read the Bible with the assumption that "Scripture is ''self-consistent''", and that if there appear to be contradictions between two texts, they believe that "more careful reading is required to show that they really cohere". Barton states that "this is not the Bible that we have in fact got". He also points out that Judaism understands that texts "may sometimes be in dialogue with each other" and "something positive may emerge from a kind of creative tension".&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J., ''The Bible: The Basics'', Routledge, 2010. pp. 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Christian writers, however, while agreeing that inaccuracies and inconsistencies occur, argue that these do not necessarily make the Bible false&lt;ref&gt;Giles, T., ''A Doubter's Guide to the Bible'', Abingdon Press, 2010, Ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is no longer desirable to try to [[Gospel harmony|harmonize all four Gospels into "one consistent account"]], because "we have learned that each of the four Gospels has its own ... unique image of Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;Garvey, JD. and Garvey, SJ., ''Why a Church Catholic?'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1988, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Randel Helms]] argues that the books of the Bible were written for and against different points of view—that the Bible's authors were often motivated to write because they wanted to challenge or correct those who had written before them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helms |first=Randel |authorlink= |title=The Bible Against Itself: Why the Bible Seems to Contradict Itself |accessdate= |year=2006  |publisher=Millennium Press |location= |isbn=0-9655047-5-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMqWPAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Bible+against+itself&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV09XX-KTJAhXDGz4KHSukBcEQ6AEIHDAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
{{See also|Biblical inerrancy|Divine inspiration}}

===Jewish===
The [[Torah]] is viewed by some as the literal word of God, [[Mosaic authorship|dictated to Moses]]. According to the 12th-century Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]], "The Torah that we have today is the one dictated to Moses by God".&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Commentary on Mishnah, Sanhedrin 11:1, Article 8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neviim|Prophets]], such as [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Jonah]], are said to have heard and reported the word of God,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Isaacs, RH., ''Messengers of God: A Jewish Prophets Who's who'', Jason Aronson, 1998, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Kethuvim|Writings]] (the category that includes books such as [[Psalms]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] and [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]]) "were excluded from the prophetic collection because their inspiration appeared to be human rather than Divine".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', 2nd ed., vol. 3, pp. 577–578.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "In the broadest sense, the Scriptures taken as a whole, and subsequently the totality of Jewish spiritual teaching, fall within the connotation of God's word."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', 2nd ed., vol. 21, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern Jewish scholars have an accommodating view of the nature of the Torah, not necessarily viewing it as strictly internally consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Levenson|2004|p=9}} "One aspect of narrative in Genesis that requires special attention is its high tolerance for different versions of the same event, a well-known feature of ancient Near Eastern literature, from earliest times through rabbinic midrash. ... This could not have happened if the existence of variation were seen as a serious defect or if rigid consistency were deemed essential to effective storytelling."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian===
{{See also|Biblical inspiration}}
[[Justin Martyr]], a 2nd-century Christian writer, declared the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] generally preferred in the early Church, to be "completely free of errors".&lt;ref&gt;Hengel, M.,
The Septuagint as a Collection of Writings Claimed by Christians:
Justin and the Church Fathers before Origen, in Dunn, JDG., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9zCh9SBb6Y8C&amp;dq=%27%27JEWS+AND+CHRISTIANS+The+Parting+of+the+Ways&amp;q=septuagint+free+errors#v=snippet&amp;q=septuagint%20free%20errors&amp;f=false ''Jews and Christians''], Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1992, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote that "the author of Holy Scripture is God".&lt;ref&gt;"Quod auctor sacrae Scripturae est Deus". [[Thomas Aquinas]], ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', [http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/st_q1.html Article 10].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1646) asserts that the Bible's authority depends "wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the Author thereof; and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God".&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]], Chapter I, Paragraph iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian groups, such as the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches follow the Jewish practice of describing certain books as [[apocrypha]] (although not all churches regard the same list of books as apocryphal, see also [[biblical apocrypha]]).

Assertions that the Bible contains inconsistencies contradicts [[Martin Luther]]'s statement that "God cannot lie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtio.com/articles/bissar37.htm |title="Lessons from Luther on the Inerrancy of Holy Writ" Luther, Martin. '&amp;#39;Weimarer Ausgabe'&amp;#39; 10 III, 162 |publisher=Mtio.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther accepted that mistakes and inconsistencies existed, but concluded that they did not necessarily undermine the truth of the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham N. Stanton|Graham Stanton]], ''Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels'' (HarperCollins, 1995) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

German Lutheran theologian [[Andreas Osiander]] took a different view, proposing in ''Harmonia evangelica'' (1537) a number of attempted [[Gospel harmony|harmonisations]], including the suggestion that Jesus must have been [[Crown of Thorns|crowned with thorns]] twice, and that there were three separate episodes of [[Jesus and the money changers|cleansing of the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham N. Stanton|Graham Stanton]], ''Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels'' (HarperCollins, 1995) p. 8; [[John S. Kloppenborg|John S. Kloppenborg Verbin]], "Is There a New Paradigm?", in Horrell, Tuckett (eds), ''Christology, Controversy, and Community: New Testament Essays in Honour of David R. Catchpole'' (BRILL, 2000), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Christian approaches to biblical consistency are reminiscent of the split between Luther and Osiander, and can be broadly divided between [[biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] and [[biblical infallibility|infallibility]]. The former, followed by the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and by [[evangelical Christians]] in the United States in general, holds that the original [[biblical manuscript]]s have "God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter", so that "all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp |title=The Baptist Faith and Message, I. The Scriptures |publisher=Sbc.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gleason Archer]], whose reconciliation of difficult texts echoes that of Osiander, allow that textual scholarship and an understanding of the historical context of individual passages is necessary to establish true, original biblical text, but that that text, once discovered, is without error.

The infallibility approach followed by some theologians and scholars, primarily of the Catholic and Anglican churches, and some mainline Protestant denominations, avoids many of the pitfalls of inerrancy by holding that the Bible is without error only in matters essential to salvation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary|year=1989|publisher=Pearson|pages=1023–1033|author=Raymond F Collins|edition=1st|editor=Raymond Brown |editor2=Joseph Fitzmyer |editor3=Roland Murphy (Eds.)|chapter=Essay 65: "Inspiration", 65:29–50, pp. 1029f}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that guidance is necessary for the correct interpretation of apparent inconsistencies; the latter part being common to all Orthodox and Catholic Christians, regardless of views of biblical inerrancy, being the primary role of the [[magisterium]].

According to Roman Catholic biblical scholar [[Raymond E. Brown]], this approach found expression in ''[[Dei verbum]]'', one of the key documents adopted at the [[Second Vatican Council]], which stated that scripture teaches "solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm ''Dei verbum'', Chapter III, from the Catechism of the Catholic Church]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that Scripture is [[biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] only "to the extent to which it conforms to the salvific purpose of God,"&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Brown, ''The Critical Meaning of the Bible'', Paulist Press (1981), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent P. Branick, ''Understanding the New Testament and Its Message: An Introduction'', (Paulist Press, 1998), p. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; without necessarily being reliable on matters such as paleontology or political history; this view is challenged by some conservative Catholic scholars.&lt;ref name="JI"&gt;{{cite book|last=|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary|year=1989|publisher=Pearson|pages=1023–1033|author=Raymond F Collins|edition=1st|editor=Raymond Brown |editor2=Joseph Fitzmyer |editor3=Roland Murphy (Eds.)|chapter=Essay 65: "Inspiration"|quote="Clearly, Vatican II intended to recapitulate traditional teaching on inspiration....In this regard, Vatican II's statement on inspiration concurs with the views of many evangelical Christians."

===Muslim===
In the Middle Ages, [[Ulema|Muslim scholars]] such as [[Ibn Hazm]], [[al-Qurtubi]], [[al-Maqrizi]], [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], and [[Ibn al-Qayyim]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Izhar ul-Haqq]], Ch. 1 Sect. 4 titled ([[s:ar:إظهار الحق/القول في التوراة والإنجيل|القول في التوراة والإنجيل]]).&lt;/ref&gt; based on their interpretation of [[Quran]]ic and other traditions,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]]'s explication of [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]]'s&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] had tampered with the scriptures, a concept known as ''[[tahrif]]''.

The theme of ''tahrif'' was first explored in the writings of Ibn Hazm (10th century), who rejected claims of [[Mosaic authorship]] and posited that [[Ezra]] was the author of the Torah. His arguments against the authenticity of the biblical text in both the [[Tanakh]] and New Testament included chronological and geographical inaccuracies and contradictions; what he considered theological impossibilities ([[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] expressions, stories of [[extramarital sex]], and the attributing of sins to prophets), as well as what he saw as a lack of reliable transmission (''[[tawatur]]'') of the text. He argued that the falsification of the Torah could have taken place while there existed only one copy kept by the [[Kohen|Aaronic priesthood]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Ibn Hazm's arguments had a major impact upon Muslim literature and scholars, and these and other [[polemic]]al ideas were modified only slightly by some later authors.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', BRILL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Power in the Portrayal: Representations of Jews and Muslims in Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century'', chapter "An Andalusi-Muslim Literary Typology of Jewish Heresy and Sedition", pp. 56 and further, Tahrif: p. 58, {{ISBN|0-691-00187-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Under Crescent and Cross'': The Jews in the Middle Ages, p. 146, {{ISBN|0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn al-Layth, Ibn Rabban, and [[Ibn Qutayba]], found that there had been no corruption of the text but denounced as ''tahrif'' what they considered misleading interpretations of the text.&lt;ref name="Adang1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Camilla Adang|title=Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible: From Ibn Rabban to Ibn Hazm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4Ut1MjLQTMC&amp;pg=PA223|date=1 January 1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10034-3|pages=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th-century commentator [[Ibn Khaldun]] argued in the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (Introduction) that no distortion had taken place: "the statement concerning the alteration is unacceptable to thorough scholars and cannot be understood in its plain meaning".&lt;ref name="Sawyer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=John F.

==Biblical criticism and criticism of the Bible==
{{Main|Biblical criticism|Criticism of the Bible}}
The study of inconsistencies in the Bible has a long history. In the 17th century, [[Spinoza]] considered the Bible to be, "...a book rich in contradictions."&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, L., ''Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity: Essays and Lectures in Modern Jewish Thought'', SUNY Press, 1997, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, [[Thomas Paine]] in [[The Age of Reason]] compiled many of the Bible's self-contradictions. And in 1860, William Henry Burr produced a list of 144 self-contradictions in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, WH., ''Self-Contradictions of the Bible'', 1860, reprinted Library of Alexandria, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biblical studies|Biblical scholars]] have studied inconsistencies in and between texts and canons as a means to study the bible and the societies that created and influenced it. The field has been given rise to theories such as [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s&lt;ref&gt;
Wellhausen, J., ''Prolegomena to the History of Israel: With a Reprint of the Article 'Israel' from the Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1885. reprinted Cambridge University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[documentary hypothesis]] and the [[Deuteronomist#Deuteronomistic history|deuteronomistic history]] (concerning the origins of the Torah and the history of Israel contained in the books from [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] to [[Books of Kings|Kings]] respectively),&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, SL., ''The trouble with Kings: the composition of the book of Kings in the Deuteronomistic history'', Supplements to Vetus testamentum, Brill, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and similar theories to explain why the [[Synoptic Gospels]] disagree with each other, and with the [[Gospel of John]].

===Biblical canons===
{{See also|Biblical canon|Development of the Christian Biblical canon|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon}}
The question of inconsistency covers not only the text but even the composition of scripture. Since the Bible never enumerates its own component parts, those who believe it is inerrant must appeal to extra-biblical authority to justify which books to include.&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Taylor, ''The Faith of a Moralist'' (Macmillan, London, 1930) II, p. 209; quoted in Brand Blanchard, ''Reason and Belief'' (Allen and Unwin, 1974), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries, different communities have accepted shifting collections of books. The size of these [[biblical canon]]s varies enormously, from the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritans]], who consider the five books of the [[Torah]] alone to be authoritative,&lt;ref&gt;The Pentateuch, or Torah, is the first five books of the bible - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Ethiopian Bible]], which contains all the books of all other churches plus such titles as the [[Josippon|Book of Josephus]] and the [[First Epistle of Clement|Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The contents of canons have varied over time, books regarded as authoritative by some Christians at some points in history being excluded from the collections of later communities—this was the fate of the [[List of gospels|many apocryphal Gospels]] from the first few centuries of the Church (the [[Gospel of Thomas]] is a famous example); books long regarded as canonical in one branch of Christianity may be dropped by others on doctrinal grounds (the fate of the [[deuterocanonical books]], canonical in the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] but repudiated by the Protestants because they are not included in the [[Hebrew Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;"More Than One Bible." Christian History, issue 43, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and supported doctrines to which the [[Protestant reformation|Protestant reformers]] objected such as the [[intercession of saints]], [[purgatory]], [[prayers for the dead]] etc.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&amp;pg=PA42 |title=Mercer dictionary of the Bible |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09|isbn=9780865543737|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wo8csizDv0gC&amp;pg=PA163 |title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1995-02-13 |accessdate=2012-10-09|isbn=9780802837813}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some books that could have been included, such as the [[Book of Enoch]], quoted as scriptural in {{bibleverse||Jude|1:14-15|KJV}}, were excluded from the canons of almost all later communities (see [[Book of Enoch#Canonicity|Canonicity of the Book of Enoch]]).

===Attribution of the books===
{{Main article|Authorship of the Bible}}
The question of internal consistency in the Bible also involves the attribution of authorship to its books. For instance, the words of the Torah, or the first five books of the Old Testament, have traditionally been believed to be by the hand of [[Moses]], and the New Testament Gospels have been attributed to the [[Four Evangelists]]. Modern scholarship calls these attributions into question.

Eliot Rabin writes: "For the past 400 years, readers have been openly questioning the traditional attribution of these five books to Moses."&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, E., ''Understanding the Hebrew Bible: A Reader's Guide'', KTAV Publishing House, 2006, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he quotes [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his 1651 [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']] as writing that, when Genesis 12:6 has "and the Canaanite was then in the land", it could not have been written by Moses. Hobbes may have been the first European to question this attribution in print, arguing that the words can "only sensibly be used by someone who is writing when the Canaanites no longer are in the land ... But the Canaanites were in the land when Moses was alive."&lt;ref&gt;Martinich AP., ''The Two Gods of Leviathan: Thomas Hobbes on Religion and Politics'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabin also quotes the 11th-century rabbi, [[Rashi]], as saying that Moses could not have written, in Deuteronomy 34:5, "And Moses died there", but it must have been written by [[Joshua]]. However, it is also noted that the second-century commentator [[Rabbi Meir]], has it that God dictated those words to Moses, who wrote them down with a tear in his eye.&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, E., ''Understanding the Hebrew Bible: A Reader's Guide'', KTAV Publishing House, 2006, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In none of the four [[Gospels]] does the text say that a particular book is written by the evangelist who is attributed as its author. Writers such as M. N. Ralph say that in reading the Gospels one will be struck by "a great deal of evidence" that they are compilations inherited from written and oral sources "rather than eyewitness accounts". So scholars conclude that the attributions are "not to the person who compiled it."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, MN., ''A Walk Through the New Testament: An Introduction for Catholics'', Paulist Press, 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscripts===
{{Further information|Biblical manuscript|Textual criticism}}
Manuscripts also differ. Usually the differences are minor—matters of spelling and the like—but occasionally they are significant, as in the case of the [[Comma Johanneum]], a clause in the [[First Epistle of John]] that bears explicit witness to the doctrine of the Christian [[Trinity]], but is not found in any manuscript earlier than the 10th century (codex 221), where it is shown as a marginal note.&lt;ref name=DBWallace&gt;Daniel B. Wallace,"[http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=1185 The Comma Johanneum and Cyprian]".&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example from the Old Testament is the difference between the [[Septuagint]] and [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] descriptions of the battle of [[David]] and [[Goliath]]: the Septuagint version is shorter and avoids the narrative inconsistencies of the familiar Masoretic story, notably the famous incident of [[Saul]] asking who David is as though he does not know his own harpist and shield-bearer.

There are also important differences between the Masoretic and [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan]] version of the [[Pentateuch]] in the readings of many sentences. Some distinctions seem motivated by (or reflect) actual philosophical differences between [[Judaism]] and [[Samaritanism]]. Some of these are glaringly obvious, like the inclusion of a passage in the Samaritan version of the [[Ten Commandments]] that restates the command to build an altar on [[Mount Gerizim]], and says plainly that Mount Gerizim is the site where all future sacrifices must be offered. Since the location of God's holy site is probably the central original difference between Judaism and Samaritanism, it makes sense that this passage is in one version and not the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.meson.org/religion/torahcompare.php |title=The Samaritan Pentateuch |publisher=Web.meson.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contradictions===
Most questions of Biblical inconsistency relate to contradictions in the narrative. Some relate to apparently minor details, for example: the number of soldiers in an army (e.g. {{bibleverse|1|Chron.|21:5|niv}} vs. {{bibleverse|2|Sam.|24:9|niv}}), the year a certain king began his reign (e.g. {{bibleverse|2|Chron.|36:9|kjv}} vs. {{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:8|kjv}}), the details of [[Apostle Paul]]'s itinerary (Acts 9,11,15,18:22,21 vs. Galatians 1:18,2:1). In some cases, seemingly trivial points of differences can actually have an enormous significance for the interpretation of a book or for the reconstruction of the history of Ancient Israel, how the world was created, why God allows suffering, or the religious significance of Jesus' death.&lt;ref&gt;

What is the significance of Jesus’ death?), and another author has another."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars find inconsistencies in the Old Testament and Torah and ascribe many of them to the process by which they were created. For example, the [[documentary hypothesis]] asserts that repetitions and contradictions are the result of texts that have been woven together from diverse sources written by different authors, at different times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Brettler|2004|pp=3–5}} "Slowly, with the rise of rationalism, particularly as associated with figures such as Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) and especially Benedict (Baruch) Spinoza (1632-1677), the view that the Torah was a unified whole, written by Moses, began to be questioned. ... This culminated in the development of the models of the Documentary Hypothesis in the 19th century, according to which the Torah (or Hexateuch) is composed of four main sources or documents which were edited or redacted together: J, E, P, and D. Each of these sources or documents is embedded in a (relatively) complete form in the current Torah, and is typified by vocabulary, literary style, and theological principles."&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Jensen wrote, "no better explanation has as yet been found of the complexities of composition of the [[Pentateuch]], and it continues to command a good consensus among scholars".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jensen, ''God's Word to Israel'', Liturgical Press (September 1982), p. 36. {{ISBN|0-8146-5289-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this point, Ronald Witherup gives the example of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1-2, which most scholars view as two separate stories of creation written by different authors in different time periods. "Most biblical scholars accept Genesis 1 as originating around the sixth century B.C. with a group of scribes who were concerned about the preservation of the liturgical traditions of the Jews (thus the concern for the seven-day schema of creation and the notion of the sabbath). Genesis 2, on the other hand, originates from an earlier, more primitive tradition dated to around the tenth century B.C." Fundamentalists argue that this is simply the same story told twice, the first time (Gen 1:1-2:4) being poetic and the second one (Gen 2:4-25) being more anthropomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. Witherup, ''Biblical Fundamentalism: What Every Catholic Should Know'', Liturgical Press (2001), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are further examples of other types of inconsistency in the Old Testament. In the account of the slaughtering of an animal before the Temple, it states that the animal: "was killed at the entrance to the tabernacle, north of the altar, and cut up." The most natural interpretation of the Hebrew wording is that the slaughtering was done by the one making the offering rather than by the priest. If so, it contradicts Ezek 44:11, where it is done by the Levites, and 2 Chr 29:22, 24 where done by the priests.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several places in the Old Testament where numerical figures can be directly compared. For example, both {{bibleref2|Ezra|2:1–65|NIV}} and {{bibleref2|Nehemiah|7:6–67|NIV}} present the list of Jewish families that "came up out of [[Babylonian captivity|the captivity of the exiles]] ... and returned to Jerusalem and Judah". But the two lists disagree on the number of members of each family. In total, there are nearly ''twenty'' numerical discrepancies between the lists.&lt;ref&gt;The discrepancies occur in the following families: Arah, Pahath-Moab (through the line of Jeshua and Joab), Zattu, Bani, Bebai, Azgad, Adonikam, Bigvai, Adin, Bezai, Hashum, Bethlehem (and Netophah), Bethel (and Ai), Magbish, Lod (and Hadid and Ono), Senaah, Asaph, Shallum (and Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita and Shobai), Delaiah (and Tobiah and Nekoda), and the singers.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in both cases a total figure of 42,360 people is given,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Ezra|2:64|NASB}}; {{bibleverse|Nehemiah|7:66|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the partial figures do not add up to the total.&lt;ref&gt;Oded Lipschitz, Joseph Blenkinsopp, ''Judah and the Judeans in the Neo-Babylonian Period'', (Eisenbrauns, 2003) p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; A third version of the list exists in the apocryphal book [[1 Esdras]].

In Deuteronomy chapter 4, verses 1 and 8 state that Moses is about to teach the laws "today". Verse 8, in the Hebrew text, even says that the "entire Torah" is to be taught today. However, verse 5 suggests that the laws have already been delivered some time in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, T., in Schipper, B. and Teeter DA. ''Wisdom and Torah: The Reception of ‘Torah’ in the Wisdom Literature of the Second Temple Period'', BRILL, 2013, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Oxford Bible Commentary'' notes that:
{{quote|as has long been recognized, there remain a number of variations or inconsistencies of detail, which suggests that two or more accounts have been combined. In particular, the creative acts are introduced in different ways. While in some cases God creates simply by speaking ("And God said..."), in others we are told that he performed certain actions: he made, separated, named, blessed, placed.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, orthodox rabbis, such as [[Mordechai Breuer]] deny that such inconsistencies are evidence that the words were not all created by God. He asserts that such hypotheses are false, and that the contradictory portrayals of creation are not because they were written by different authors. "Instead we refer them to the different qualities of God."&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, M., The study of the Bible and fear of Heaven, in Carmy, S. (ed), ''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996, pp.159-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal consistency of the text===
Jewish scholars are concerned that all copies of the [[Torah]] are identical, and that each copy is consistent in its statements and in its language. The aim is to preserve the work in a condition as close to its original state as possible. This extends to consistency in spelling and the use of individual words.

B. Barry Levy notes that the 16th-century [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|Rabbi Ibn Zimra]] recounted "how he restored the scrolls to their original state" and noted "the importance of having textual consistency in the scrolls, because criticisms of how Jews preserved and transmitted the Torah text contained accusations that they willfully changed it."&lt;ref&gt;Levy, BB., ''Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible Text in Jewish Law'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Levy also suggests that "Torah scrolls remain prized and frequently used ritual objects, and scribes have continually worked as carefully as possible to copy them, always holding dear the belief that they were producing as accurate and correct a text as they could. Unfortunately even this commitment and care could not guarantee a letter-perfect text".&lt;ref&gt;Levy, BB., ''Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible Text in Jewish Law'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Shnayer Leiman writes that, "Errors have crept into the best Torah scrolls. Every so often a Torah has to be returned to the ark due to an error discovered while being read in public."&lt;ref&gt;Leiman, SZ., Response to Rabbi Brewer, in Carmy, S. (ed), ''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996, p.186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several grammatical errors are known to appear in copies of the Torah. As Shai Cherry notes, "Since one of the Rabbinic assumptions is that the Torah is perfect, at a minimum one would expect there to be no grammatical mistakes. After all, shouldn't God be an inerrant grammarian?" For examples of such mistakes, Cherry notes that, in the Cain and Abel story, where 'sin' is mentioned, "''sin (chatat)'' is feminine, but the predicate is masculine." Rabbis have suggested that this is because sin starts out weak like a woman, but ends as strong as a man. Also, in verse 7 of this story, which concerns 'daughters' so that all four suffixes should be feminine, two of them are masculine. Cherry says that such problems ought to be ascribed to "sloppy editing," but that those who believe the Torah is perfect, would say that these errors were put there intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, S., ''Torah Through Time: Understanding Bible Commentary from the Rabbinic Period to Modern Times'', Jewish Publication Society, 2010, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===
Christian theologians agree that the New Testament has a single and consistent theological focus on the salvific nature of Christ, but the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament consists of several different theologies. Some of these complement each other, while others are contradictory, even within the same book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rolf P. Knierim]], ''The Task of Old Testament Theology'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1995), p. 1; Isaac Kalimi, "The Task of Hebrew Bible/ Old Testament Theology - Between Judaism and Christianity" in Wonil Kim, ''Reading the Hebrew Bible for a New Millennium'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of a single unifying theology, common themes recur, including (although no list can be exhaustive) [[monotheism]], the divine origins of human morality, God's election of a chosen people, the idea of the coming [[Messiah]], and the concepts of [[sin]], faithfulness, and [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]. The study of these is central to both Jewish and Christian theologies, even if they differ in their approaches. For example, although both religions believe in the coming Messiah, the Jewish expectation is different from the Christian view.

Within Christianity, themes such as the nature of God ([[trinitarianism]] and [[nontrinitarianism]]),&lt;ref&gt;God as Communion By Patricia A. Fox, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christology|nature of Jesus]], [[Christian views on the Old Covenant|views of the old covenant]], [[original sin]], [[predestination]], [[ordination of women]], [[Hell in Christianity|hell]], [[Christian eschatological differences|biblical prophecies]], etc. have continued to be a matter of dispute among theologians and [[Religious denomination|various denominations]].

===New Testament===
{{main article|Textual criticism#New Testament}}
The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in three major manuscript traditions: the 4th century CE [[Alexandrian text-type]]; the [[Western text-type]], also very early but prone to paraphrase and other corruptions; and the [[Byzantine text-type]], which makes up above 80% of all manuscripts, the majority comparatively very late in the tradition. Scholars regard the Alexandrian text-type as generally more authoritative when treating [[textual criticism|textual variations]]. The majority of differences are minor—matters such as variant spellings&lt;ref&gt;K. Aland and B. Aland, "The Text Of The New Testament: An Introduction To The Critical Editions &amp; To The Theory &amp; Practice Of Modern Text Criticism", Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (June 1995). {{ISBN|0-8028-4098-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[F. F. Bruce|Bruce, Frederick Fyvie]], "''The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?''", Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (May 2003), {{ISBN|0-8028-2219-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;—although at a few points the oldest manuscripts show important inconsistencies compared with the more recent ones: these include the endings of [[Mark 16]], describing Jesus' post-resurrection appearances, from the [[Gospel of Mark]]; the absence from [[Gospel of John|John]] of the story of [[Pericope Adulterae|the woman taken in adultery]]; and an explicit reference to the [[Trinity]] in [[1 John]] (the [[Comma Johanneum]]). Scholars such as [[Bart Ehrman]] have speculated that [[John 21]] was appended to the gospel at a later date&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman; [[Misquoting Jesus]], 166&lt;/ref&gt;, but no manuscript evidence for this assertion has been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;
Felix Just, 'Combining Key Methodologies in Johannine Studies', in Tom Thatcher (ed), ''What We Have Heard from the Beginning: The Past, Present, and Future of Johannine Studies'', ([[Baylor University|Baylor University Press]], 2007), p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

All major modern Christian communions accept a uniform canon of 27 books, although a few small and isolated communities have either fewer or more. Nevertheless, the idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from [[Apostolic Age|Apostolic times]] has no foundation in history, and the [[canon of the New Testament]], like that of the Old, is the [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|result of a historical process]]. The very idea of a closed canon did not exist prior to the 2nd century, when it became necessary to counter movements such as [[Marcionism]]. By the end of the 4th century unanimity had been achieved in the West concerning the New Testament canon as it is today, and by the 5th century most of the East had come into harmony by accepting the Book of Revelation. Nonetheless, a full dogmatic articulation of the canon for Roman Catholicism was not made until the [[Council of Trent]] of 1546, as until then the authority of the Scriptures was not considered higher than that of Sacred Tradition, papal bulls, and ecumenical councils. Martin Luther revived the [[antilegomena]] dispute by suggesting the removal of Jude, James, Hebrews, and Revelation; this was not generally accepted by his followers, but these books are still ordered last in the German-language Luther Bible. The canons of other important communions were defined in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Presbyterianism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for the [[Greek Orthodox]].

====Internal consistency====
Biblical scholar [[Bruce M. Metzger]] mentions several internal inconsistencies in the New Testament in earlier manuscripts that later scribes attempted to correct:&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, The Text of the New Testament. Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration, pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
In the earlier manuscripts of Mark 1:2, the composite quotation from Malachi 3:1 and Isaiah 40:3 is introduced by the formula "As it is written in Isaiah the Prophet". Later scribes, sensing this involves a difficulty replaced "As it is written in Isaiah the Prophet" with the general statement "As it is written in the prophets". Since the quotation Matthew(27:9) attributes to the prophet Jeremiah actually comes from Zechariah(11:12f), it is not surprising that some scribes sought to mend the error either by substituting the correct name or by omitting the name altogether. A few scribes attempted to harmonize the Johannine account of the chronology of the Passion with that in Mark by changing ’sixth hour’ of John 19:14 to ‘third hour’ (which appears in Mark 15:25). At John 1:28, [[Origen]] altered [[Bethany (Jerusalem)|Bethany]] to [[Bethabara]] in order to remove what he regarded as a geographical difficulty, and this reading is extant today in [[Manuscripts|MSS]]. 33 69 and many others, including those behind the [[King James version]]. The statement in Mark 8:31, that ‘the Son of man must suffer many things…and be killed and after three days rise again’, seems to involve a chronological difficulty, and some copyists changed the phrase to the more familiar expression, ‘on the third day’. The author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] places the golden [[altar of incense]] in the [[Holy of Holies]] (Heb. 9:4), which is contrary to the Old Testament description of the [[Tabernacle]] (Exod. 30:1-6). The scribe of [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and the translator of the Ethiopic version correct the account by transferring the words to 9:2, where the furniture of the [[Hekhal|Holy Place]] is itemized.}}

In the 2nd century CE, [[Tatian]] produced a gospel text called [[Diatessaron]] by weaving together all four gospels into one. The gospel compilation eliminated all the discrepancies that exist between the four gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Encountering the Manuscripts By Philip Wesley Comfort, Philip Comfort&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it omits the [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogies of Jesus]] in Matthew and Luke. To fit in all canonical material, Tatian created his own narrative sequence, which is different from both the synoptic sequence and John's sequence.

====The Gospels====
{{See also|Historicity of the canonical Gospels}}
The problem of there being possible contradictions in the Gospels is of importance to Christians. As [[Francis Watson (priest)|Francis Watson]] writes: "The problem cannot be resolved by observing that the alleged contradictions are trivial ... [They] are far from trivial [and] there are very many of them, and they often relate to issues at the heart of the Christian faith and life."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, F., ''Gospel Writing: A Canonical Perspective'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2013, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Origen]] (184/185 – 253/254 [[Common Era|CE]]&lt;ref&gt;''The New Catholic Encyclopedia'' (Detroit: Gale, 2003). {{ISBN|978-0-7876-4004-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) replied to the writer [[Celsus]], a critic of Christianity, who had complained that some Christians had remodelled the [[Gospel]] to answer objections, agreeing that some had done so.&lt;ref name=Origen /&gt;  However, he stated that he did not believe the problem was widespread, nor did he approve of the practice, further stating that he believed that those making the alternations introduced "heresies opposed to the meaning of the doctrine of Jesus".&lt;ref name=Origen&gt;{{cite web|author=Origen|title = Contra Celsus, Book II, Chapter XXVII|url = http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen162.html|accessdate = 2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Harmony of the Gospels (Augustine)|Harmony of the Gospels]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo]] produced a 5th-century attempt to explain away all of the apparent contradictions he was aware of.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, A. and Cavadini, JC., ''Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999, p. 132 {{ISBN|0-8028-3843-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that because there are those who would "rob [the Evangelists] of their credit as veracious historians", "we must prove that the writers in question do not stand in any antagonism to each other."&lt;ref&gt;

St. Augustine of Hippo, in ''The Harmony Of The Gospels (Extended Annotated Edition)'', Jazzybee Verlag, 2012, Chapter VII.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas more modern apologists, such as [[Gleason Archer]], in producing a book that provides explanations for many Bible difficulties, writes: "Be fully persuaded in your own mind that an adequate explanation exists, even though you have not yet found it."&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Gleason L., "Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of those who accept that there are inconsistencies, scholars such as [[Raymond E. Brown|Raymond Brown]] have examined contradictions in the Gospels, particularly in the [[infancy narrative]]s of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Brown | first=Raymond Edward | authorlink=Raymond E.

P. Sanders, 'Jesus from the Jewish point of view', in ''The Cambridge History of Judaism'' ed William Horbury, vol 3: the Early Roman Period, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; More critical scholars see the nativity stories either as completely fictional accounts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Sanders | first=Ed Parish | authorlink=E.

As a further example, the "[[Markan Appendix]]" "is universally accepted to have not been written by the author",&lt;ref&gt;Nave, DN., ''The Role and Function of Repentance in Luke-Acts'',BRILL, 2002 p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Mark 16:9-20 was added later so that the Gospel of Mark originally ended at [[Mark 16#Mark 16:9–20 in the manuscript tradition|Mark 16:8]].&lt;ref&gt;The role and function of repentance in Luke-Acts, by Guy D.

[[Historical-grammatical method|Grammatico-historical]] [[exegesis]] is determining the meaning of scripture by understanding the author's environment outside the Bible, as well as the scripture itself.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=France/&gt; --&gt; [[R.T. France|R. T. France]] states this form of exegesis involves the "fullest possible use of linguistic, literary, historical, archaeological, and other data bearing on that author's environment".&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=France/&gt; --&gt;

France, regarding the "distinctive contribution" of each of the four gospels, commented, "In accepting that God intended his church to have four Gospels, not just one, Christians have also recognized that each has something different to say about Jesus. It is only after we have listened to each in its individuality that we can hope to gain the full richness which comes from the 'stereoscopic' vision of Jesus as seen through four different pairs of eyes!"&lt;ref name=France2&gt;France, R.T., [[Tyndale New Testament Commentaries]]: Matthew, Inter-Varsity Press, Leicester, England (1985), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[two-source hypothesis]] remains the most popular explanation for the origins of the synoptic gospels: according to this, there are two sources, the Gospel of Mark and a lost, hypothetical sayings collection called [[Q Document|Q]] (''see also, [[Two-source hypothesis#Other hypotheses|other hypotheses]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, RL., ''Three Views on the Origins of the Synoptic Gospels'',Kregel Academic, 2002, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Two-source Hypothesis is not without [[Two-source hypothesis#Problems with the hypothesis|its problems]].

====Examples====
A wide variety of inconsistencies have been suggested both within the New Testament and between the New Testament and the Hebrew scriptures. These fall into a number of broad categories. The more prominent are identified and discussed below, with examples.

=====Gospels=====
{{see also|Historical reliability of the Gospels|Gospel harmony}}
Internal consistency within the [[synoptic gospels]] has been analysed by many scholars. A well-known example is the nativity narratives found in the Gospel of Matthew ({{bibleverse|Matthew|1:1-6|NASB}}) and the Gospel of Luke ({{bibleverse|Luke|3:32-34|NASB}}). Each gives a [[genealogy of Jesus]], but the names, and even the number of generations, differ between the two. &lt;!--refs should not be needed because it's wikilinked!--&gt;Apologists have suggested that the differences are the result of two different lineages, Matthew's from King David's son, Solomon, to Jacob, father of Joseph, and Luke's from King David's other son, Nathan, to [[Heli (Bible)|Heli]], father of Mary and father-in-law of Joseph.&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;Warren, Tony. [http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/faq/birth2.html "Is there a Contradiction in the Genealogies of Luke and Matthew?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114001045/http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/faq/birth2.html |date=2012-11-14 }} Created 2/2/95 / Last Modified 24 January 2000. Accessed 4 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scholar [[Geza Vermes]] points out that Luke makes no mention of Mary, and questions what purpose a maternal genealogy would serve in a Jewish setting.&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''The Nativity: History and Legend'', (Penguin, 2006), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'', [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] pointed out another conflict, between {{bibleverse|Matthew|12:30|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|11:23|NASB}}("[[You're either with us, or against us|He who is not with Me is against Me]]; and he who does not gather with Me scatters") and {{bibleverse|Mark|9:40|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|9:50|NASB}}("For he who is not against us [''you''] is for us [''you'']"). Bonhoeffer called these two sayings "the claim to exclusiveness and the claim to totality".  He argued that both are necessary and that "The cross of Christ makes both sayings true."&lt;ref name=Bonhoeffer&gt;[[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], "''Ethics''", p. 60–61, Touchstone; (September 1, 1995, reprint of his 1943 book) {{ISBN|0-684-81501-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.A. Carson]] commented similarly, adding he thought there are two different contexts where {{bibleverse|Mark|9:40|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|9:50|NASB}}describe the attitude listeners are to have to other possible disciples: when in doubt, be inclusive, while {{bibleverse|Matthew|12:30|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|11:23|NASB}}describe the standard listeners should apply to themselves: be in no doubt of one's own standing.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Carson, Commentary on Matthew, Expositor's Bible Commentary CDROM, [[Zondervan]], 1989–97&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentaries argue that, juxtaposed, the sayings declare the impossibility of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;See the commentaries by [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/mcgarvey/gospels.viii.xiii.html?scrBook=Mark&amp;scrCh=9-9&amp;scrV=40-40#viii.xiii-p0.1 McGarvey] on Mk 9:40, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/johnson_bw/pnt.pnt0112.html Johnson] on Mt 12:30, and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/jamieson/jfb.xi.i.xiv.html?scrBook=Matt&amp;scrCh=12-12&amp;scrV=30-30#xi.i.xiv-p55.1 Brown] on Lk 11:23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern New Testament scholarship tends to view these not as separate statements, but rather one statement that has either been preserved in two different forms, or has been altered by the Gospel writers to present a point of view that expresses the needs of the Christian community at the time.&lt;ref name=Culpepper&gt;R. Alan Culpepper, John, the Son of Zebedee: The Life of a Legend, Continuum International Publishing (2000), pp. 41–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of Mark, generally considered the earliest of the Gospels, presents the 'inclusive' formulation, in association with an account of Jesus rebuking his followers for stopping someone from carrying out [[exorcisms]] in his name. The Gospel of Matthew has the other, 'exclusive' version, preceded by a [[Parable of the strong man|story about a strong man]]; the Gospel of Mark also includes this story, but without the concluding observation. The Luke version presents both versions. There is still lively discussion about which version is the more authentic,&lt;ref name=Culpepper /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian H.

Allison, ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew'', Continuum International Publishing (2004), pp. 333–334.&lt;/ref&gt; see also the [[Jesus Seminar]].

Barton and Muddiman cite inconsistencies between the gospel writers about what happened at Christ's tomb. They note that "In Mk 16:1 there are three women at the tomb, in Mt 28:1 two, and in Lk 23:55-24:10 more than three. In Mark and Luke they come with spices to anoint Jesus, but in the Fourth Gospel this has already been done.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond E. Brown]] notes the apparent disagreements between the New Testament books in reporting the words of Jesus concerning his prediction of the destruction of the Temple. In Mark 13:2 it is reported as a direct statement: "And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down." However, in Mark 14:57-58, the event becomes words from people who "bare false witness against him"; in Mark 15:29, Jesus' words are used to blaspheme him; and in Acts 6:13-14, similar words are again said to be from those bearing false witness. Furthermore, Matthew 26:60-61 and 27:39-40 has people accusing Jesus and blaspheming him as someone who had said such words, while John 2:19-21 reports Jesus saying directly that the sanctuary would be destroyed, but actually speaking "of the sanctuary of his body". Brown suggests that the various accounts show that Jesus did not have God's detailed foreknowledge of what was to happen to the Temple. In evidence for this lack of detailed prescience, he points out that there are many stones left upon other stones in the remains of Herod's temple, for instance in the [[Wailing Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, RE., ''An Introduction to New Testament Christology'', Paulist Press, 1994, pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ehrman, a more important difference among the Gospels is with the book of John. He argues that the concept that Jesus existed before his birth, was a divine being, and became human is only claimed in the Gospel of John.&lt;ref name=Ehrmanr&gt;Bart D. Ehrman, Jesus, Interrupted, Harper Collins Publishing (2009), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars disagree, locating pre-existent and divine Christology within the Pauline epistles and synoptic gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Douglad McCready, ''He Came Down from Heaven: The Preexistence of Christ And the Christian Faith.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon J. Gathercole]], ''The Preexistent Son: Recovering the Christologies of Matthew, Mark and Luke.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Acts of the Apostles=====
{{Main article|Conversion of Paul}}
{{See also|Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles}}
In the "''Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties''", [[Gleason Archer|Archer]] examines two verses in Acts describing the [[Conversion of Paul]] which are sometimes perceived as a contradiction:&lt;ref name=ArcherBD&gt;Archer, Gleason L., "Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties", p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"''The men who travelled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one''" {{bibleverse|Acts|9:7|NASB}}
:"''And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me''" {{bibleverse|Acts|22:9|NASB}}
Archer claims that the original Greek shows "there is no real contradiction between these two statements" because "Greek makes a distinction between hearing a sound as a noise (in which case the object to the verb "to hear" takes the genitive case) and hearing a voice as a thought-conveying message (in which case it takes the accusative)" and "in neither account is it stated that his companions ever heard that Voice in the accusative case".&lt;ref name=ArcherBD /&gt;  Archer points to similar circumstances where "the crowd who heard the sound of the Father talking to the Son in John 12:28 ... perceived it only as thunder".&lt;ref name=ArcherBD /&gt;

{{bibleverse|Acts|17:15-16}} is another troublesome part:

:"''So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.''"

The verse appear to place Jacob's burial in [[Shechem]], contradicting verses in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] which places the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] tomb in [[Hebron]]. [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] writes "the text now stands, it is an evident error."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biblehub.com/commentaries/acts/7-15.htm|title=Acts 7:15 Commentaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Gospel and Acts=====
{{See also|Judas Iscariot}}
In {{bibleverse|Matthew|27:3-8|NASB}}, Judas returns the bribe Christians believe he had immorally accepted for handing over Jesus, throwing the money into the temple before hanging himself. The temple priests, unwilling to return the defiled money to the treasury,&lt;ref&gt;"It was not lawful to take into the Temple-treasury, for the purchase of sacred things, money that had been unlawfully gained." [[Alfred Edersheim]] [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/edersheim/lifetimes.x.xiv.html Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, 5.xiv], 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; used it instead to buy a field known as the Potter's Field, as a plot in which to bury strangers. In {{bibleverse|Acts|1:18|NASB}}, on the other hand, Judas, having not committed suicide out of guilt, used the bribe money to buy the field himself, and his death in the field is attributed thus: "falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out."

[[Raymond E. Brown]] points to the obvious contradiction: "Luke's account of the death of Judas in Acts 1:18 is scarcely reconcilable with Matt 27:3-10."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''An Introduction to the New Testament'', p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel harmony|Harmonization]] of the two accounts has been tried since ancient times&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Alfred Edersheim]] concluded, "there is no real divergence". [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/edersheim/lifetimes.x.xiv.html Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, 5.xiv], 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;  and occasionally still today.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Dr C Gempt suggests: "The details that seem at variance can be reconciled...after refusing the money the priests bought the field in Judas' name..and it was there that he hanged himself." His body was no longer hanging by the time it was discovered, but had fallen ... to the ground where it had split open.'Inter-Varsity Press New Bible Commentary 21st Century edition p1071&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern scholars tend to find these unconvincing,&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Talbert, ''Reading Acts: A Literary and Theological Commentary'', Smyth &amp; Helwys (2005) p. 15. {{ISBN|1-57312-277-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out, for instance, the absence of any indication of suicide in the story in Acts.&lt;ref&gt;Mikeal C. Parsons, ''Acts'' (Baker Academic, 2008) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Epistles=====
{{Main article|Antinomianism}}
The [[Tübingen school]] of historians founded by [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|F. C. Baur]] believes that in [[Early Christianity]], there was conflict between [[Pauline Christianity]] and the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem Church]] led by [[James the Just]], [[Simon Peter]], and [[John the Apostle]], the so-called "[[Jewish Christians]]" or "Pillars of the Church".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08280a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: St. James the Less]: "Then we lose sight of James till St. Paul, three years after his conversion (A.D. 37), went up to Jerusalem. ... On the same occasion, the "pillars" of the Church, James, Peter, and John "gave to me (Paul) and Barnabas the [[Right hand of Christian fellowship|right hands of fellowship]]; that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision" (Galatians 2:9)."&lt;/ref&gt; Paul believed that the [[gentiles]] and Jewish Christians were no longer obligated to keep the Mosaic law ({{bibleref2|Gal|2:21}}). The Jewish Christians disagreed, believing that everyone, including the gentiles, must keep the Mosaic law. In {{bibleref2|Galatians|2:14}}, part of the "[[Incident at Antioch]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Judaizers] see section titled: "THE INCIDENT AT ANTIOCH"&lt;/ref&gt; Paul publicly rebuked Peter for [[judaize|judaizing]].

[[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] claims several times that believers are saved by [[Divine grace]], and that believers are therefore ''"not under law, but under [[Grace in Christianity|grace]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Rom|6:14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Epistle of James, in contrast, claims that Christians are to obey the ''"whole law"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|James|2:10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ''"a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone"'', and that ''"faith without works is dead"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|James|2:14–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants, with their belief in [[Sola Fide|salvation by faith alone]], have had difficulty reconciling these contradictory views. [[Martin Luther]], for example, asserted that the [[Epistle of James]] might be a forgery, and relegated it to an appendix in his Bible (although he later accepted its canonicity - see [[Antilegomena]]).

Some scholars{{who|date=December 2013}} believe that Paul and James do not contradict each other but speak about different questions.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Douglas J. Moo]] writes that ''"if a sinner can get into relationship with God only by faith (Paul), the ultimate validation of that relationship takes into account the works that true faith must inevitably produce (James)."''Douglas J. Moo, ''The Letter of James'', Erdmans Publishing, 2000, p. 141 - [https://books.google.com/books?id=LQJgtkaIUTIC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=the+letter+of+james+douglas+j.+moo#PPA141,M1 The Letter of James]&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that the perspective of Paul is different from, and complementary to, that of James - ''"When Paul claims that one is justified by faith alone, apart from works, he is referring to works that precede salvation. Conversely, when James insists on works as necessary to justification, he has in view works that follow and validate salvation."''&lt;ref&gt;Dr. R. Bruce Compton: [http://www.dbts.edu/journals/1997/Jas2.pdf James 2:21-24 and the justification of Abraham, p. 44] - many scholars are referred to in the footnotes!&lt;/ref&gt; Paul states in various passages that works have to follow faith ({{bibleref2|Titus|2:11-12}}, {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:10}}, {{bibleref2|Romans|6:13}}, {{bibleref2|Galatians|5:13}}, etc.).

In [[I Corinthians]]: "Inconsistencies have been found within later chapters, for instance between an apparently softer stance on sacrificial food in 8:1-13 and 10:22-11:1, and a harder line in 10:1-22."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 1108.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the letter "seems to place a total ban on women's speech in church, which is strangely inconsistent with Paul's permission in 11:2-16 that (veiled) women could pray and prophesy."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 1130.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Old Testament versus New Testament=====
{{Main article|Christian views on the Old Covenant|Christianity and Judaism|New Covenant|Antinomianism|Ethics in the Bible}}
In the 2nd century CE, the Christian theologian [[Marcion]] composed a work (now lost) entitled ''Antithesis''. In the Antithesis, [[Marcion]] set out in detail and discussed at length the contradictions between the Old Testament and New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcionite-scripture.info/CB-The-Antithesis.pdf The Antithesis], Dr. Carroll Bierbower&lt;/ref&gt; The Old and New Testaments, Marcion argued, cannot be reconciled to each other. The code of conduct advocated by Moses was "[[an eye for an eye]]", but [[Matthew 5:39|Jesus set this precept aside]]. Marcion pointed to Isaiah 45:7 "''I make peace and create evil, I the Lord do all these things''. He contrasted this with Jesus' saying that "''a tree was known by its fruit, a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit''" and then pointed to several injunctions and lessons in the Old Testament that the New Testament contradicts. For example, [[Elisha]] had children eaten by bears; Jesus said, "''Let the little children come to me''". [[Joshua]] had the sun stopped in order to prolong the slaughter of his enemies. [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] quoted Jesus as commanding "''Let not the sun go down on your wrath''"(Eph 4:26). In the Old Testament, [[divorce]] was permitted and so was [[polygamy]]; in the New Testament, neither is allowed. [[Moses]] enforced the [[Jewish Sabbath]] and [[Jewish Law]]; Jesus has [[Christian liberty|de-institutionalised]] both. Even within the Old Testament, Marcion found contradictions. For example,  God commanded that no work should be done on the Sabbath, yet he told the Israelites to carry the [[ark of the covenant|ark]] around Jericho seven times on the Sabbath. No graven image was to be made, yet Moses was directed to fashion a [[Nehushtan|bronze serpent]]. Marcion therefore rejected the entire Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZiX5d09931UC&amp;pg=PA92 The canon of the New Testament: its origin, development, and significance], [[Bruce Manning Metzger]], p. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The early church, [[W. H. C. Frend]], p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcion: The Gospel of the Alien God, [[Adolf Von Harnack]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One Christian view is that [[Jesus]] mediates a [[New Covenant]] relationship between God and his followers and [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abolished the Mosaic Laws]], according to the [[New Testament]] ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|10:15-18}}; {{bibleverse||Gal|3:23-25}}; {{bibleverse|2|Cor|3:7-17}}; {{bibleverse||Eph|2:15}}; {{bibleverse||Heb|8:13}}, {{bibleverse||Rom|7:6}} etc.) From a [[Jewish]] perspective however, the [[Torah]] was given to the Jewish people and [[B'nei Noah]] as an eternal covenant (for example {{bibleverse||Exod|31:16-17}}, {{bibleverse||Exod|12:14-17}}, {{bibleverse||Mal|3:6-7}}) and will never be replaced or added to (for example {{bibleverse||Deut|4:2}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|13:1|HE}}). There are differences of opinion as to how the new covenant affects the validity of biblical law. The differences are mainly as a result of attempts to harmonize biblical statements that the biblical law is eternal ({{bibleverse||Exodus|31:16-17}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exod|12:14-17}}) with New Testament statements that suggest that it [[Antinomianism#Antinomianism in the New Testament|does not now apply at all]], or at least [[Cafeteria Christianity|does not fully apply]]. Most biblical scholars admit the issue of the Law can be confusing and the topic of [[Paul the Apostle#Relationship with Judaism|Paul and the Law]] is still frequently debated among New Testament scholars&lt;ref&gt;Gundry, ed., ''Five Views on Law and Gospel''. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, see [[New Perspective on Paul]], [[Pauline Christianity]]); hence the various views.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">The '''International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures''' is a campaign group, which joins together various organizations around the world whose primary aim is to bring about the reunification of all the surviving [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Sculptures]] to [[Athens]], Greece.

The Association was founded in November 2005 at a meeting in Athens of twelve national reunification organisations organised by the Greek government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elginism.com/20051124/382/ Meeting in Athens of committees for the return of the Parthenon Sculptures]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elginism.com/20051126/383/ An international reunification committee]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elginism.com/20051127/283/ New initiatives in support of the reunification of the Parthenon Marbles]&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder and current chair of the campaign, [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]], is also involved with some of the member organizations. At the founding meeting a declaration was released&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parthenoninternational.org/declaration Declaration on the Parthenon Sculptures]&lt;/ref&gt; which encapsulated the common goals of all the members.

The original twelve members of the Association were:
* [[Australians for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]] ('''Australia''')
* [[Belgium Committee for the Return of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Belgium''')
* [[Cyprus Committee for the Return of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''[[Cyprus]]''')
* [[German Committee for the Return of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Germany''')
* [[British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''[[Great Britain]]''')
* [[Italian Committee for the Return of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Italy''')
* [[International Organizing Committee - New Zealand - for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''New Zealand''')
* [[Russia Committee for the Return of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Russia''')
* [[Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures, Serbia]] ('''[[Serbia]]''')
* [[Spain Committee for the Return of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Spain''')
* [[Swedish Parthenon Committee]] ('''Sweden''')
* [[The American Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures, Inc]] ('''United States''')

Other organisations joined later, bringing the total number of members to seventeen:
* [[Brazilian Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]] ('''[[Brazil]]''')
* [[Canadian Committee for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Canada''')
* [[Finnish Committee the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''[[Finland]]''')
* [[Marbles Reunited]] ('''[[Great Britain]]''')
* [[Swiss Committee the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Switzerland''')

The International Association of the Parthenon Sculptures is governed by a charter and only acts based on the unanimous agreement of its members. Each member organisation appoints a delegate from among their members to represent them on the committee.

The ''' International Centre for Black Sea Studies ''' (Greek: Διεθνές Κέντρο Μελετών Ευξείνου Πόντου, English Acronym: ICBSS, Greek Acronym: ΔΙΚΕΜΕΠ) is a think-tank based in Athens, Greece, committed to promoting multilateral cooperation between the countries of the Black Sea region and with their international partners.

== History and Identity ==

The ICBSS was established in 1998 as a private non-profit organisation under Greek law (art. 50 paragraph 2 of L. 2594/1998, Government Gazette 62-A’, as modified by Presidential Decrees No 137 &amp; 138, Government Gazette No.119, 1st issue, April 2000). The Centre is a de facto related body of the intergovernmental [[BSEC|Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC)]] and forms part of the so-called “BSEC family” of institutions.&lt;ref name="related bodies"&gt;[http://www.bsec-organization.org/Relatedbodies/Pages/icbss.aspx Related Bodies/Affiliated Centers of the BSEC]. Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation. Retrieved 18 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICBSS was created originally to contribute through policy-oriented research and advocacy work to the realisation of the goals of the BSEC and continues to act as the BSEC’s acknowledged think-tank.&lt;ref name="charter"&gt;[http://www.bsec-organization.org/documents/LegalDocuments/statutory/charter/Download/CHARTER%20web%20080630.pdf Charter of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation], New Article 24. Retrieved 18 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the mandates received from the BSEC the Centre also carries out a range of projects and activities on its own initiative, aiming to foster multilateral cooperation in and with the wider Black Sea region. A special focus lies on relations with the [[European Union]].

== Objectives ==

Through its activities, the ICBSS aims to foster multilateral cooperation among the BSEC member states as well as with their international partners.&lt;ref name="ISN"&gt;[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Communities-and-Partners/Partners/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=102262 ISN Partners]. International Relations and Security Network. Retrieved 18 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an independent research and training centre the ICBSS strives “to pursue applied, policy-oriented research, build capacity and promote knowledge on the Black Sea region both within and outside its boundaries”.&lt;ref name="About us"&gt;[http://icbss.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=33  About the ICBSS - Who We Are]. International Centre for Black Sea Studies. Retrieved 19 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a related body of the BSEC its goal is "to fulfil in the best possible way its institutional role and the assignments received by carrying out studies, offering policy advice and coordinating activities”.&lt;ref name="About us" /&gt;

In 2008, undergoing a review of its image on the occasion of its 10th anniversary, the Centre coined the motto: “Promoting Synergies Across Regions”.

== Activities ==

To fulfil its mission the Centre carries out applied, policy-oriented research either independently or in its capacity as a related body of the BSEC. While it is not restricted in its thematic scope the ICBSS has so far focused on the following thematic areas:&lt;ref name="Brochure"&gt;[http://icbss.org/images/icbss%20brochure.pdf ICBSS Brochure]. Pages 5-6. Retrieved 19 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

*BSEC-[[European Union|EU]] interaction
*security/stability
*energy
*[[good governance]] and institutional renewal
*comparative studies in regional cooperation
*cooperation in science and technology
*[[economic development]]

Research supporting on these topics is pursued in-house, through external experts and/or in collaboration with other institutions. It feeds into the Centre's projects, publications, events, and advocacy activities.

'''Istres-Le Tubé Air Base''' ({{lang-fr|Base Aérienne 125}} or '''BA&amp;nbsp;125''') is a large multi-role tasked [[French Air Force]] base located near [[Istres]], northwest of [[Marseille]], France. The airport facilities are also known as '''Istres - Le Tubé''' ([[ICAO airport code]]: LFMI).

==Operational units and uses==

===French Air Force===

The user of the base is the [[French Air Force]] with several operational units on the base, including:&lt;ref name="senat"&gt;{{cite web

* [[Escadron de Chasse 2/4 La Fayette|Fighter squadron 2/4 La Fayette]] equipped with [[Dassault Mirage 2000N/2000D|Mirage 2000N]].
* Tanker squadron 00.093 Bretagne equipped with [[KC-135 Stratotanker]].
* DAMS 11.004 (''Dépôt atelier de munitions spéciales'') or [[Special ammunition storage]], responsible for the hardened storage of the nuclear mid-range [[Air-Sol Moyenne Portée]] ASMP-A missiles to be used by fighter squadron 2/4 in its deterrent role.
* Air defence squadron 01.950 responsible for the base air defense.
* 25th air engineer regiment, a technical unit.
* Guard detachment ([[Fusiliers Commandos de l'Air]]) responsible for the base security and ground defences.

===Other uses===
The base also hosts a helicopter squadron and a large repair and training facility. In addition, it also includes [[EPNER]] (École du Personnel Navigant d’Essais et de Réception); test facilities for [[Délégation Générale pour l'Armement|DGA]] Essais en vol, [[Dassault Aviation]], [[SNECMA]], [[Thales Group|Thales]] and some aeronautical units of the [[French Navy]]. More than 5,000 personnel work on the base.

Secondary users occasionally include the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), during Allied operations engaging United States and France. During [[Operation Allied Force]], USAF KC-135s and U-2s operated out of the base. Istres was the home of U-2 detachment OL-FR (Operating Location-FRance).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-769655.html, Washington Post, January 6, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Istres was also designated by [[NASA]] as a contingency landing site for the [[Space Shuttle]] in the case of a [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Intact abort modes|Transoceanic Abort Landing]] (TAL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=17044|title=France to assist NASA with the future launches of the Space Shuttle|accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base's runway is {{convert|3750|m|ft}} long and {{convert|60|m|ft}} wide. An additional overrun area {{convert|1200|m|ft}} long was built for Airbus Industries in 1992. It has the same characteristics as the runway, making it the longest runway in Western Europe and thus suited to Shuttle landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ba125.air.defense.gouv.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=164&amp;Itemid=211 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723222555/http://www.ba125.air.defense.gouv.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=164&amp;Itemid=211 |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==

On 31 March 1992, a [[Boeing 707]] of [[Kabo Air]], a [[Nigeria]]n company, made an [[emergency landing]] at Istres after engines 3 and 4 had separated from the wing in [[turbulence]] at 35,000 feet. The aircraft performed a [[Flap (aeronautics)|flapless]], [[downwind]] landing with a touch-down speed of nearly 200 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] and the right wing on fire from the pouring fuel. The gear failed and the aircraft slid off the far end of the [[runway]], but the crew of five survived and the cargo was saved. The incident brought to light severe deficiencies in Kabo Air's operations — the aircraft had passed mandatory maintenance and was overloaded.

==World War II==
Built prior to [[World War II]], Istres Air Base was first used by the French Air Force during the early part of the war, and after the 1940 [[Battle of France]] and the June Armistice with Nazi Germany, became part of the limited ({{lang-fr|Armée de l'Air de Vichy}}) air force of the Vichy Government. It was attacked on several missions by Allied bombers based in [[England]] while under German control after November 1942. It was seized by Allied forces during [[Operation Dragoon]], the Invasion of Southern France in August 1944 and was repaired and placed into operational use by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] XII Engineer Command, being turned over to [[Twelfth Air Force]] on 27 August 1944.

The airfield was designated by the Americans as '''Istres/Le Tubé Airfield''' or '''[[Advanced Landing Ground]] Y-17'''. It was also given the AAF designation of '''USAAF Station 196'''. Twelfth Air Force initially assigned the [[324th Fighter Group]] to the airfield on 2 September, with [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s. However the 324th only remained a few days before moving forward to [[Ambérieu-en-Bugey Air Base|Amberieu]] on 6 September.

The main USAAF use of Istres was by the [[64th Troop Carrier Group]], which operated [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] transports from the airfield from September to November 1944. When the combat units moved north into eastern France, Istres was used by [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] as a transshipment point for supplies and Allied personnel, being administratively controlled by the 1411th Army Air Force Base Unit.

With the end of the war, the Americans used Istres as a staging point between Occupied Germany and [[Morocco]] for air transport of personnel back to the United States. It was returned to full French control in October 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Air Force Historical Research Agency}}

Sometime after World War II, until May 1958 Base Aérienne 125 was host to the [[Royal Air Force]] Liaison Party, that serviced transient British and Commonwealth military aircraft staging to and from the United Kingdom. In May 1958 the [[Royal Air Force]] Liaison Party, moved to Base Aérienne 115 Orange-Caritat where it continued into the early 1960s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7762">'''Khutu''' was the name given to a material used by [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval]] [[Islam]]ic [[Bladesmith|cutlers]] for knife handles. The ultimate source of the material has been a matter of conjecture for more than a thousand years; Islamic [[polymath]] [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|al-Biruni]] was among the first to investigate it and debate about the material—especially its source—continues to this day. The hypothesized sources for the material have included [[narwhal]], [[Walrus ivory|walrus]], and [[mammoth]] ivory, the [[frontal bone]]s of bulls, goats, and birds, the teeth of snakes, fish, and [[hippopotamus]]es, and the root of a tree.&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; The most recent investigation, by [[natural history|natural historian]] Chris Lavers, has pointed to the frontal [[wikt:boss#Noun|boss]] of the horns of the [[muskox]].

Khutu has been ascribed properties other than those of a work material.  It was, for example, described as an [[wikt:alexipharmic|alexipharmic]]—a property that eventually was attached to [[Unicorn#Alicorn|alicorn]], the supposed horn of the [[unicorn]].

==Medieval scholarship==

===Abu Rayhan Biruni===
Islamic polymath [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|al-Biruni]] (973–1048) was among the first to investigate khutu, which he referred to as ''al-chutww''. He described it as being from the land of the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirgiz]] in the northern part of the Turkish territory and mentioned that it was in great demand in Egypt. He noted that the material came in a variety of colours, with yellowish-green being best, followed by those coloured [[camphor]], [[white]], "like the sun", and dark grey.&lt;ref name="Laufer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laufer |first1=Berthold |last2=Pelliot |first2=Paul |year=1913 |title=Arabic and Chinese Trade in Walrus and Narwhal Ivory |journal=T'oung Pao (second series) |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=315–370 |doi=10.1163/156853213x00213}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned the beliefs that the material came from the forehead of the [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] (an enormous bird from Arabic and Persian myths which was said to carry off and eat elephants) or the forehead of a hippopotamus, but did not seem to attach much weight to these ideas, noting that it was much more similar to the frontal bone of a bull or goat.&lt;ref name="Lavers"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Natural History of Unicorns |last=Lavers |first=Chris |year=2009 |publisher=William Morris |location=USA |isbn=978-0-06-087414-8 |pages=112–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "It originates from an animal; it is much in demand, and preserved in the treasuries among the Chinese who assert that it is a desirable article because the approach of poison causes it to exude."&lt;ref name="Laufer"/&gt;

In another work he described it as "bigger than the hand in size"&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; and "thicker than two fingers"&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; and mentioned that "Amir Abu Ja'far bin Banu has a large box-like case made of long and broad khutu planks."&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; Because the material gave off a fishy smell when burned, he felt that it was probably a marine creature of some kind, but he specifically noted an instance where someone was able to pass off walrus ivory for proper khutu, strongly implying that the two materials were distinct – at least to him.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Lavers: "A Khwarazmian happened to find a tooth which was very white on the sides... the natural patterns described upon it were very thin, white and pale. It resembled the down of a cucumber if peeled in such a manner that the seed grains are also cut off. This Khwarazmain carried it to [Mecca], passed it off as the khutu and sold it at a high price to the Egyptians." As Lavers points out, this description could only refer to the osteodentine portion of walrus ivory.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ibn al-Husayn Kashgari===
Writing shortly after al-Biruni, [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Kashgari]] mentioned khutu in his work ''Diwan Lughat at-Turk'' (c. 1075): 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Horn of a sea fish imported from China. It is (also) said that it is the root of a tree. It is used for knife handles. The presence of poison in food is put to the test by it because when broth or other dishes in the bowl are stirred with it the food cooks without fire (if poison is present in it), or if the horn is placed on a bowl it (the horn) sweats without steam."&lt;ref name="Dankoff"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dankoff |first1=Robert |year=1973 |title=A Note on khutu and chatuq |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=542–543 |url= |doi=10.2307/600173}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ibn al-Akfani===
The next investigation of khutu was by [[Ibn al-Akfani]] (1286–ca. 1348-49&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4274/ |title = The Selection of Treasures Regarding Precious Stones |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1700–1800 |accessdate = 2013-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), who called the material ''chartut''. Although he cited al-Biruni's earlier work, he disagreed with a number of Al-Biruni's conclusions. For example, he favoured the theory that khutu came from the forehead of a large bird. He also offered a slightly different spectrum of possible colours for khutu (yellow, red, [[apricot (color)|apricot]], dust, black), though he did agree that the quality of the material varied with the colour.&lt;ref name="Laufer"/&gt;

==Modern scholarship==

===Berthold Laufer===
The era of modern scholarship on the identity of khutu began with the work of the [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Berthold Laufer]]. The first paper was titled "Arabic and Chinese Trade in Walrus and Narwhal Ivory" and published in the journal ''T'oung Pao'' in 1913. Laufer provided a brief overview of the medieval scholarship and provided detailed information regarding the trade of narwhal and walrus ivory on the basis that khutu referred to one or both of those items. A second paper, titled "Supplementary Notes on Walrus and Narwhal Ivory" was published in 1916 in the same journal and provided some corrections and clarifications of his earlier work.

===Richard Ettinghausen===
While Laufer had detailed the Chinese end of the narwhal and walrus [[ivory trade]], Richard Ettinghausen focused on the Arabic side. Like Laufer, he felt that khutu was probably walrus ivory, with perhaps some samples being narwhal ivory.&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt;

===Chris Lavers===
The most recent work on khutu has been done by [[Chris Lavers]]. In contrast to the early 20th century scholars, Lavers does not believe khutu to have been either walrus or narwhal ivory, but rather the frontal bone and associated horn material of the [[muskox]], with some specimens perhaps coming from mammoth ivory. His primary evidence for this was the work of al-Biruni, particularly where he mentions that knowledgeable people could differentiate walrus ivory from proper khutu (a fact that Laufer could not have known in his earlier work, as the al-Biruni text mentioning it had not yet been translated).&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; In ''The Natural History of Unicorns'' he acknowledges that Asian muskoxen were supposed to have become extinct about a thousand years before al-Biruni's investigations (see [[Muskox#Habitat and range|muskox]] for information regarding their extinction and reintroduction), but points out that there could well have been an isolated [[Refugium (population biology)|refugium]] of muskoxen existing in Asia until more modern times, that it was possible that there was trade in material goods between Asian arctic and North American arctic peoples, and also that frozen or fossilized muskoxen material could have been harvested in the same way that mammoth ivory was.

'''Mail art''' (also known as '''postal art''' and '''correspondence art''') is a populist artistic movement centered on sending small scale works through the [[mail|postal service]].  It initially developed out of what eventually became [[Ray Johnson]]'s New York Correspondence School in the 1950s and the [[Fluxus]] movement in the 1960s, though it has since developed into a global movement that continues to the present.

==Characteristics==

Media commonly used in mail art include postcards, paper, a collage of found or recycled images and objects, rubber stamps, artist-created stamps (called [[artistamps]]), and paint, but can also include music, sound art, poetry, or anything that can be put in an envelope and sent via post.  Mail art is considered art once it is dispatched.  Mail artists regularly call for thematic or topical mail art for use in (often [[unjuried]]) exhibition.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;&lt;ref name=UB&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art|url=http://digital.lib.buffalo.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/LIB-PC001|work=Digital Collections, UB Libraries|publisher=University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mail artists appreciate interconnection with other artists.  The artform promotes an egalitarian way of creating that frequently circumvents official art distribution and approval systems such as the art market, museums, and galleries.  Mail artists rely on their alternative "outsider" network as the primary way of sharing their work, rather than being dependent on the ability to locate and secure exhibition space.&lt;ref name=Oberlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art @ Oberlin|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/|work=Oberlin College Art Library|publisher=Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403130316/http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/|archivedate=3 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KostelanetzBrittain2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Kostelanetz|author2=H. R. Brittain|title=A Dictionary of the Avant-gardes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZX85xdr6boC|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93764-1|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mail art can be seen as anticipating the cyber communities founded on the Internet.&lt;ref name=Spark /&gt;

==History==

[[File:RayJohnson invite1970.jpg|right|thumb|Ray Johnson's invitation to the first mail art show, 1970]]
Artist Edward M. Plunkett has argued that communication-as-art-form is an ancient tradition; he posits (tongue in cheek) that mail art began when Cleopatra had herself delivered to Julius Caesar in a rolled-up carpet.&lt;ref name=Plunkett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Edward M.|title=The New York Correspondence School|journal=Art Journal|year=1977|issue=Spring|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Ray/Publications/Plunkett.html|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ray Johnson, the New York Correspondance School, and Fluxus===
The American artist [[Ray Johnson]] is considered to be the first mail artist.&lt;ref name=MOCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art|url=http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=22|work=Collection: MOCA's First Thirty Years|publisher=MOCA: The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phillpot&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillpot|first=Clive|title=Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology|year=1995|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Canada|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Ray/Publications/Phillpot.html|editor=Chuck Welch|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson's experiments with art in the mail began in 1943, while the posting of instructions and soliciting of activity from his recipients began in the mid-1950s with the mailing of his "moticos", and thus provided mail art with a blueprint for the free exchange of art via post.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Vincitorio, "Informalista o videoartista? Le tendenze artistiche dagli anni '40 ad oggi", L'Espresso n.44, 7 November 1982{{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "mail art" was coined in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt; In 1962, Plunkett coined the term "New York Correspondence School" to refer to Johnson's activities; Johnson adopted this moniker but sometimes intentionally misspelled it as "correspondance."&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt; The deliberate misspelling was characteristic of the playful spirit of the Correspondance School and its actions.&lt;ref name=Danto&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danto|first=Arthur C.|journal=The Nation|date=March 29, 1999|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/correspondance-school-art#|title=Correspondance School Art|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Correspondance School members are fairly obscure, and the letters they sent, often featuring simple drawings or stickers, often instructed the recipient to perform some fairly simple action. Johnson's work consists primarily of letters, often with the addition of doodles and rubber stamped messages, which he mailed to friends and acquaintances. The Correspondance School was a network of individuals who were artists by virtue of their willingness to play along and appreciate Johnson's sense of humor.  One example of the activities of the Correspondance School consisted in calling meetings of fan clubs, such as one devoted to the actress [[Anna May Wong]].  Many of Johnson's missives to his network featured a hand drawn version of what became a personal logo or alter-ego, a bunny head.&lt;ref name=Danto /&gt;

In a 1968 interview, Johnson explained that he found mailed correspondence interesting because of the limits it puts on the usual back and forth interaction and negotiation that comprises communication between individuals.  Correspondence is  "a way to convey a message or a kind of idea to someone which is not verbal; it is not a confrontation of two people. It's an object which is opened in privacy, probably, and the message is looked at&amp;nbsp;... You look at the object and, depending on your degree of interest, it very directly gets across to you what is there&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=AAAOH&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral history interview with Ray Johnson, 1968 Apr. 17|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-ray-johnson-13236|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Johnson and Marcia Tucker organized The New York Correspondence School Exhibition at the [[Whitney Museum]] in New York, which was the first significant public exhibition of the mail art genre.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;

On April 5, 1973, Johnson declared the "death" of the New York Correspondance School in an unpublished letter to the Obituary Department of ''The New York Times'' and in copies that he circulated to his network.   However, he continued to practice mail art even after this.&lt;ref name=AAALippardLetter&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Johnson mail art to Lucy R.

===1970s and 1980s===
In the 1970s, the practice of mail art grew considerably, providing a cheap and flexible channel of expression for cultural outsiders.  It was particularly widespread where state censorship prevented a free circulation of alternative ideas, as in certain countries behind the Iron Curtain or in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=John|title=East/West: Mail Art &amp; Censorship|journal=PostHype|year=1985|volume=4|issue=1|issn=0743-6025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of a sizable mail art community, with friendships born out of personal correspondence and, increasingly, mutual visits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Ginny|title=The Mail Art Community in Europe|journal=Umbrella Magazine|year=1981|volume=5|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; led in the 1980s to the organization of several festivals, meetings and conventions where networkers could meet, socialize, perform, exhibit and plan further collaborations.  Among these events were the Inter Dada Festivals organized in California in the early 1980s&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Janice|title=A gleefully rebellious festival of dada|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__IZN7YDU3d4/S_aip9CJ4WI/AAAAAAAAAmU/gS467sN7lZQ/s1600/reibunedada.jpg|accessdate=11 April 2013|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=August 26, 1984|location=Art: The Tribune Calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decentralized Mail Art Congress of 1986.&lt;ref name=HRFrickerOberlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans-Reudi Fricker|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/bios/fricker.html|work=Mail Art @ Oberlin|publisher=Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903031741/http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/bios/fricker.html|archivedate=3 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 curator Ronny Cohen organized an exhibition for the [[Franklin Furnace]], New York, called "Mail Art Then and Now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art From 1984 Franklin Furnace Exhibition|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/research/projects/flow/mailart/mailartf.html|publisher=Franklin Furnace|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was to have an historical aspect as well as showing new mail art, and to mediate the two aspects Cohen edited the material sent to Franklin Furnace, breaking an unwritten but commonly accepted custom that all works submitted must be shown. The intent to edit, interpreted as censorship, resulted in a two-part panel discussion sponsored by Artists Talk on Art (organized by mail artist Carlo Pittore and moderated by art critic [[Robert C. Morgan]]) in February of that year, where Cohen and the mail artists were to debate the issues.

The night preceding the second panel on February 24, [[Carlo Pittore]], John P. Jacob, Chuck Welch a.k.a. CrackerJack Kid, David Cole and John Held, Jr. crafted a statement asking Dr. Cohen to step down as the panel moderator. Welch delivered the statement whereby Dr. Cohen was asked to remain on the panel but forfeit her right to serve as moderator. Instead of remaining, Cohen chose to leave the event. After some give and take with both panelists and audience, Dr. Cohen left, saying, "Have fun boys." Her entourage walked out with her during the ensuing melee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International MailArt--Part II: The New Cultural Strategy|last=Heisler|first=Faith|year=1984|issue=4|volume=9|page=18|journal=Women Artists News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The excluded works were ultimately added to the exhibition by the staff of the Franklin Furnace, but the events surrounding it and the panels revealed ideological rifts within the mail art community. Simultaneously fanning the flames and documenting the extent to which it was already dominated by a small, mostly male, coterie of artists, the discussions were transcribed and published by panelist [[John P. Jacob]] in his short-lived mail art [[zine]] [[PostHype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=John|title=Mailart: A Partial Anatomy|journal=PostHype|year=1984|volume=3|issue=1|issn=0743-6025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to panelist [[Mark Bloch]], [[Ray Johnson]] (who was not a panelist) commented on the reverse-censorship and sexism of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Bloch|title=Ray Johnson's letter to me after the event, questioning the issue of sexism.|url=http://www.panmodern.com/ray-atoa-letter.jpg|publisher=panmodern.com|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of mail art meetings and congresses during the late 80s, and the articulation of various "isms" proclaimed by their founders as movements within mail art, were in part a response to fractures made visible by the events surrounding the Franklin Furnace exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=John|title=The Coffee Table Book of Mail Art: The Intimate Letters of J.P. Jacob, 1981 - 1987|year=1987|publisher=Riding Beggar Press|location=New York|url=http://arcade.nyarc.org:80/record=b569546~S8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if "tourism" was proposed satirically as a new movement by H.R. Fricker, a Swiss mail artist who was one of the organizers of the 1986 Mail Art Congress, nevertheless mail art in its pure form would continue to function without the personal meeting between so-called networkers.&lt;ref name=HRFrickerOberlin /&gt;

In the mid-1980s, Fricker and Bloch, in a bilingual "Open Letter To Everybody in the Network" &lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Mark and Fricker, Hans Ruedi."Phantastische Gebete Revisited" in Panmag International Magazine 6, ISSN 0738-4777, February 1984. pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; stated, "1) An important function of he exhibitions and other group projects in the network is: to open channels to other human beings. 2) After your exhibition is shown and the documentation sent, or after you have received such a documentation with a list of addresses, ''use the channels''! 3) Create person-to-person correspondence... 4) You have your own unique energy which you can give to others through your work: visual audio, verbal, etc.  5) This energy is best used when it is exchanged for energy from another person with the same intentions. 6) the power of the network is in the quality of the direct correspondence, not the quantity." The manifesto concludes, "We have learned this from our own mistakes." &lt;ref&gt;Röder, Kornelia "H. R. Fricker, Mail Art and Social Networks," HR Fricker: Conquer the Living Rooms of the World, Kunstmuseum Thurgau, Warth, Switzerland: Edition Fink, 2014, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s and the impact of the Internet era===
[[File:Paulo bruscky and david horvitz.JPG|thumb|American mail-artist [[David Horvitz]] (active since the 2000s) meets Brazilian mail artist Paulo Bruscky (active since the 1970s) in Berlin, Germany in November 2015.]]

In 1994, Dutch mail artist [[Ruud Janssen]] began a series of [[mail-interviews]] which became an influential contribution in the field of mail art.&lt;ref&gt;
Ruud Janssen, ''Mail-Interviews'', Tilburg 1994–2001
&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, mail art's peak in terms of global postal activities had been reached, and mail artists, aware of increasing postal rates, were beginning the gradual migration of collective art projects towards the web and new, cheaper forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Bleus]] (Ed.), ''Re: The E-Mail-Art &amp; Internet-Art Manifesto'', in: ''E-Pêle-Mêle: Electronic Mail-Art Netzine'', Vol.III, n° 1, T.A.C.-42.292, Hasselt, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet facilitated faster dissemination of mail art calls (invitations) and precipitated the involvement of a large number of newcomers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Mail art blogs and websites became ever more frequently used to display contributions and online documentation,{{original research inline|date=January 2013}} even if many{{who|date=January 2013}} mail artists still preferred the surprise of a catalogue found in their mailbox.{{original research inline|date=January 2013}}

==Philosophy and norms of the mail artist network==
In spite of the many links and similarities between historical avant-garde, alternative art practices ([[visual poetry]], [[Xerox art|copy art]], [[artist's book]]s) and mail art, one aspect that distinguishes the creative postal network from other artistic movements, schools or groups (including Fluxus) is the way it disregards and circumvents for the commercial art market.&lt;ref name=Spark&gt;{{cite web|title=About John Held Jr. in the Spark episode "The Fine Art of Collecting"|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/spark/profile.jsp?essid=4489|work=Spark|publisher=KQED|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any person with access to a mailbox can participate in the postal network and exchange free artworks, and each mail artist is free to decide how and when to answer (or not answer) a piece of incoming mail. Participants are invited by network members to take part in collective projects or unjuried exhibitions in which entries are not selected or judged.  While contributions may be solicited around a particular theme, work to a required size, or sent in by a deadline, mail art generally operates within a spirit of "anything goes."&lt;ref name="Phillpot" /&gt;

The mail art philosophy of openness and inclusion is exemplified by the "rules" included in invitations (calls) to postal projects: a mail art show has no jury, no entry fee, there is no censorship, and all works are exhibited.&lt;ref name="Phillpot" /&gt; The original contributions are not to be returned and remain the property of the organizers, but a catalogue or documentation is sent free to all the participants in exchange for their works. Although these rules are sometimes stretched, they have generally held up for four decades, with only minor dissimilarities and adjustments, like the occasional requests to avoid works of explicit sexual nature, calls for projects with specific participants, or the recent trend to display digital documentation on blogs and websites instead of personally sending printed paper to contributors.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:BananaPost'89 AnnaBanana.jpg|right|thumb|BananaPost '89 artistamps by Anna Banana, 1989]]
Mail art has been exhibited in alternative spaces such as private apartments, municipal buildings, and shop windows, as well as in galleries and museums worldwide.&lt;ref name=Oberlin /&gt;   Mail art shows, periodicals, and projects represent the "public" side of postal networking, a practice that has at its core the direct and private interaction between the individual participants. Mail artists value the process of exchanging ideas and the sense of belonging to a global community that is able to maintain a peaceful collaboration beyond differences of language, religion and ideology; this is one aspect that differentiates the mail art network from the world of commercial picture postcards and of simply "mailed art."&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology"&gt;Welch, C. (1995). ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/231651233 Eternal network: A mail art anthology]''. Calgary, Alta: Univ. of Calgary Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mail artist may have hundreds of correspondents from many different countries, or build a smaller core circle of favorite contacts. Mail art is widely practiced in Europe, North and South America, Russia, Australia and Japan, with smaller numbers of participants also in Africa, and China.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  In addition to being kept by the recipient, mail art archives have attracted the interest of libraries, archives, museums, and private collectors.&lt;ref name=Spark /&gt;  Or, the works may be 'worked into' and recycled back to the sender or to another networker.

[[File:Envelope HRFricker(1990).jpg|right|thumb|Mail art envelope from H.R. Fricker, 1990]]
Ray Johnson suggested (with a pun) that "mail art has no history, only a present", and mail artists have followed his playful attitude in creating their own mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43915838|title=Ray Johnson : correspondences|last=M.|first=De Salvo, Donna|last2=Catherine.|first2=Gudis,|date=1999|publisher=Wexner Center for the Arts|year=|isbn=2080136631|location=|pages=81|oclc=43915838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parody art movements like [[neoism]] and plagiarism have challenged notions of originality, as have the shared pseudonymous names [[Monty Cantsin]] and [[Karen Eliot]], which were proposed for serial use by anyone.&lt;ref name="Carr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

Various essays, graduate theses, guides and anthologies of mail art writings have appeared in print and on the Internet, often written by veteran networkers.&lt;ref name=WelchAnthology /&gt;
A sub-group of envelope art has its genesis in the Grateful Dead Ticket Service. Looking to help their fans avoid  the high fees that are generated by national ticket services the Grateful Dead started their own service, commonly referred to as mail order. At some point fans started decorating their envelopes with art. Some for art's sake, others to grab the attention of the people that dole out tickets in hope of better seats.http://www.gdtstoo.com/

==Media and artistic practices in the creation of mail artworks==
{{see also|Postage stamp}}
Because the democratic ethos of mail art is one of inclusion, both in terms of participants ('anyone who can afford the postage') and in the scope of art forms, a broad range of media are employed in creation of mail artworks. Certain materials and techniques are commonly used and frequently favored by mail artists due to their availability, convenience, and ability to produce copies.

===Rubberstamps and artistamps===
[[File:Rubberstamps Klafki Pawson(1980s).jpg|right|thumb|Mail art rubber stamps by Jo Klafki (left) and Mark Pawson (right), 1980s]]
Mail art has adopted and appropriated several of graphic forms already associated with the postal system. The rubber stamp officially used for franking mail, already utilized by [[Dada]] and Fluxus artists, has been embraced by mail artists who, in addition to reusing ready-made rubber stamps, have them professionally made to their own designs. They also carve into erasers with linocut tools to create handmade ones. These unofficial rubber stamps, whether disseminating mail artists' messages or simply announcing the identity of the sender, help to transform regular postcards into artworks and make envelopes an important part of the mail art experience.&lt;ref name=WelchAnthology /&gt;

[[File:CarvedEraser ArtNahpro(c.1990).jpg|right|thumb|Carved eraser print by Paul Jackson, aka Art Nahpro, c. 1990]]
Mail art has also appropriated the postage stamp as a format for individual expression. Inspired by the example of Cinderella stamps and Fluxus faux-stamps, the [[artistamp]] has spawned a vibrant sub-network of artists dedicated to creating and exchanging their own stamps and stamp sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/particuliers/timbres-poste/philat%C3%A9lie/timbres/2003/emission-sp%C3%A9ciale-09-du-19-mai |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526171811/http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/particuliers/timbres-poste/philat%C3%A9lie/timbres/2003/emission-sp%C3%A9ciale-09-du-19-mai |archivedate=2015-05-26 |df= }} Belgian Postal Service, Guy Bleus &amp; Jean Spiroux, ''Journée du Timbre: Mail-Art'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Jerry Dreva]] of the conceptual art group Les Petits Bonbons created a set of stamps and sent them to David Bowie who then used them as the inspiration for the cover of the single "Ashes to Ashes" released in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Roger|title=Scary Monsters|url=http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/scarymonsters.html|website=Bowie Golden Years}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistamps and rubber stamps, have become important staples of mail artworks, particularly in the enhancement of postcards and envelopes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Frank, Peter, E.F. Higgins III, Rudolf Ungváry. "[http://www.artpool.hu/Artistamp/PFranke.html Postal Modernism: Artists' Stamps and Stamp Images]." ''World Art Post'', Artpool Archive, Museum of Fine Arts Budapest, April 1982 (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–4)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important anthology of rubberstamp art was published by the artist Hervé Fischer in his book ''Art and Marginal Communication'', Balland, Paris, 1974 - in French, English and German, to note also the catalog of the exhibition "Timbres d'artistes", Published of Musée de la Poste, Paris, 1993, organized by the french artist Jean-Noël Laszlo - in French, English.

===Envelopes===
Some mail artists lavish more attention on the envelopes than the contents within. Painted envelopes are one-of-a-kind artworks with the handwritten address becoming part of the work. Stitching, embossing and an array of drawing materials can all be found on postcards, envelopes and on the contents inside.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;

===Printing and copying===
Printing is suited to mail artists who distribute their work widely. Various printmaking techniques, in addition to rubber stamping, are used to create multiples. Copy art (xerography, photocopy) is a common practice, with both mono and color copying being extensively used within the network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;  Ubiquitous 'add &amp; pass' sheets that are designed to be circulated through the network with each artist adding and copying, chain-letter fashion, have also received some unfavorable criticism.{{according to whom|date=January 2013}} However, Xerography has been a key technology in the creation of many short-run periodicals and [[zines]] about mail art, and for the printed documentation that has been the traditional project culmination sent to participants. Inkjet and laserprint computer printouts are also used, both to disseminate artwork and for reproducing zines and documentation, and PDF copies of paperless periodicals and unprinted documentation are circulated by email. Photography is widely used as an art form, to provide images for artistamps and rubber stamps, and within printed and digital magazines and documentation,&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology" /&gt; while some projects have focused on the intersection of mail art with the medium itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=John|title=[[The International Portfolio of Artists Photography]]|year=1984|publisher=Riding Beggar Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lettering and language===
Lettering, whether handwritten or printed, is integral to mail art. The written word is used as a literary art form, as well as for personal letters and notes sent with artwork and recordings of the spoken word, both of poetry and prose, are also a part of the network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt; Although English has been the de facto language, because of the movement's inception in America, an increasing number of mail artists, and mail artist groups on the Internet, now communicate in Breton, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Russian.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Other media===
In addition to appropriating the postage stamp model, mail artists have assimilated other design formats for printed artworks. Artists' books, decobooks and [[friendship book]]s, banknotes, stickers, tickets, artist trading cards (ATCs), badges, food packaging, diagrams and maps have all been used.

[[File:Kairan MAZine(2007).jpg|right|thumb|Cover of ''Kairan'' mail art zine, edited by Gianni Simone, aka Johnnyboy, 2007]]
Mail artists routinely mix media; [[collage]] and [[photomontage]] are popular, affording some mail art the stylistic qualities of [[pop art]] or Dada. Mail artists often use collage techniques to produce original postcards, envelopes and work that may be transformed using copy art techniques or computer software, then photocopied or printed out in limited editions.

[[Printed matter]] and [[ephemera]] are often circulated among mail artists, and after artistic treatment, these common items enter into the mail art network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;  Small assemblages, sculptural forms or found objects of irregular shapes and sizes are parceled up or sent unwrapped to deliberately tease and test the efficiency of the postal service. Mailable fake fur ("Hairmail") and [[Astroturf]] postcards were circulated in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news |

Having borrowed the notion of [[intermedia]] from Fluxus, mail artists are often active simultaneously in several different fields of expression. Music and [[sound art]] have long been celebrated aspects of mail art, at first using cassette tape, then on CD and as sound files sent via the Internet.&lt;ref name="CoxWarner2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Cox|author2=Daniel Warner|title=Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgDgCOSHPysC&amp;pg=PA60|date=1 September 2004|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-1615-5|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Performance art]] has also been a prominent facet, particularly since the advent of mail art meetings and congresses. Performances recorded on film or video are communicated via DVD and movie files over the internet. Video is also increasingly being employed to document mail art shows of all kinds.&lt;ref name=mailartforum&gt;{{cite web|title=The Techniques|url=http://www.mail-art.de/frame.php?dir=about:about_techniques&amp;doc=start.htm|work=Mail-Art:The Forum|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Correspondence art is an elusive art form, far more variegated by its very nature than, say, painting. Where a painting always involves paint and a support surface, correspondence art can appear as any one of dozens of media transmitted through the mail. While the vast majority of correspondence art or mail art activities take place in the mail, today's new forms of electronic communication blur the edges of that forum. In the 1960s, when correspondence art first began to blossom, most artists found the postal service to be the most readily available - and least expensive - medium of exchange. Today's micro-computers with modern facilities offer anyone computing and communicating power that two decades ago were available only to the largest institutions and corporations, and only a few decades previous weren't available to anyone at any price." - [[Ken Friedman]]&lt;ref name=FriedmanFlue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Ken|title=Mail art history: the Fluxus factor|journal=FLUE - Special Issue: Mail Art|year=1984|volume=4|issue=3–4|editor1-first=Martha|editor1-last=Wilson|publisher=Franklin Furnace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Cultural exchange is a radical act. It can create paradigms for the reverential sharing and preservation of the earth's water, soil, forests, plants and animals. The ethereal networker aesthetic calls for guiding that dream through action. Cooperation and participation, and the celebration of art as a birthing of life, vision, and spirit are first steps. The artists who meet each other in the Eternal Network have taken these steps. Their shared enterprise is a contribution to our common future." - [[Chuck Welch]]&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The purpose of mail art, an activity shared by many artists throughout the world, is to establish an aesthetical communication between artists and common people in every corner of the globe, to divulge their work outside the structures of the art market and outside the traditional venues and institutions: a free communication in which words and signs, texts and colours act like instruments for a direct and immediate interaction." - Loredana Parmesani&lt;ref&gt;Loredana Parmesani, text under the entry "Poesia visiva", in ''L'arte del secolo - Movimenti, teorie, scuole e tendenze 1900–2000'', Giò Marconi - Skira, Milan 1997 {{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11464">Neuroscientists have learned a lot about the role of the brain in numerous [[Cognition|cognitive mechanisms]] by understanding corresponding disorders. Similarly, neuroscientists have come to learn a lot about [[music cognition]] by studying '''music-specific disorders'''. Even though [[music]] is most often viewed from a "historical perspective rather than a biological one"&lt;ref name="Zatorre, R. 2005"&gt;Zatorre, R., &amp; McGill, J. (2005). Music, the food of neuroscience [Article]. Nature, 434(7031), 312-315&lt;/ref&gt; music has significantly gained the attention of [[neuroscientist]]s all around the world. For many centuries music has been strongly associated with [[art]] and [[culture]]. The reason for this increased interest in music is because it "provides a tool to study numerous aspects of [[neuroscience]], from [[motor skill]] learning to [[emotion]]".&lt;ref name="Zatorre, R. 2005"/&gt;

==Overview==
An important technique that is used by neuroscientists in understanding the cognition of music involves understanding musical disorders. This article describes some of the disorders that have been identified by neuroscientists. They range from disorders involving pitch, rhythm and melody, playing instruments and creating music. This article explores two of the most commonly found music related disorders—(1)

==Definitions: basic musical concepts==
Before delving into the disorders related to music, it is important to have a basic understanding of the following terms:

===Pitch===
In the physical sense of the term, the word "[[pitch (music)|pitch]]" refers to the frequency of a sound. Another term that is frequently used by music neuroscientists is "fine-grained pitch processing" which refers to the ability of a person to distinguish minor changes or fluctuations in pitch. Processing pitch is an extremely integral part of music cognition. Recent developments in brain scanning techniques have shown neuroscientists that the posterior secondary cortex plays an extremely important part in the processing of pitch in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Peretz, I. Zatorre, R., &amp; McGill, J. (2005). Brain Organization for Music Processing [Article]. Annual Review of Psychology, 56, 89-114&lt;/ref&gt; In music, "pitch relation" is more important than pitch itself. A subset of five to seven pitches creates a scale. The scale tones are "not equivalent and are organized around a central tone, called the tonic" (Peretz 2005).

===Time relations===
Temporal organization of music is commonly referred to as "[[rhythm]]". In 1982 the neuroscientist Fraisse claimed that there are mainly two types of time relations that are fundamental to musical temporal organization: (1) "the segmentation of an ongoing sequence into temporal groups" based on the duration values (in musical terms a whole, half, quarter, eighth or sixteenth note), and (2) "extraction of an underlying temporal regularity or beat".&lt;ref&gt;Fraisse P (1982) Rhythm and tempo. See Deutsch 1999, pp. 149–80&lt;/ref&gt;

In the brain, it is believed that the right hemisphere better handles meter, while the left hemisphere better handles rhythm. Scientists have studied patients with brain lesions in their right temporal auditory cortex and realized that they were unable to "tap a beat or generate a steady pulse".&lt;ref&gt;Ibbotson NR, Morton J (1981) Rhythm and dominance. Cognition 9:125–38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timbre===
"[[Timbre]]" refers to the quality of a musical note that enables us to distinguish between different kinds of sound production. It is the characteristic of music that helps us recognize an instrument or source of a particular sound—such as a piano, saxophone, or a flute.

===Memory===
It is important to note that music unfolds over time, thus the "auditory cognitive system must depend to a large degree on mechanisms that allow a stimulus to be maintained on-line to be able to relate one element in a sequence to another that occurs later" (Peretz 2005). Research has shown that working memory mechanisms for pitch information over a short period of time may be different from those involved in speech. In addition to the role that auditory cortices play in working memory for music, neuroimaging and lesion studies prove that frontal cortical areas also play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;Gaab N, Gaser C, Zaehle T, J¨ancke L, Schlaug G (2003) Functional anatomy of pitch memory—an fMRI study with sparse temporal sampling. NeuroImage 19:1417–26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotion===
Music is not merely "limited to perception and memory", but is also closely related to emotion. The mode of music (major or minor), and the tempo of a song (fast or slow) can invoke joy or sorrow in the listener.&lt;ref&gt;Peretz I, Gagnon L, Bouchard B (1998) Music and emotion: perceptual determinants, immediacy, and isolation after brain damage. Cognition 68:111–41&lt;/ref&gt; In the brain, emotional analysis is carried out by "a common cortical relay, suggesting no direct access to subcortical, limbic structures".&lt;ref&gt;Peretz I, Blood AJ, Penhune V, Zatorre R (2001) Cortical deafness to dissonance. Brain 124:928–40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical disorders==
[[Image:Music Disorders.jpg|thumb|right|Music-specific disorders may be acquired or congenital]]
With a growing interest in music cognition amongst neuroscientists, music-specific disorders are becoming more relevant in research and in understanding music processing in the brain. In the past decade, myriad music-specific disorders have been identified, causes ranging from congenital to acquired (specific lesions in the brain).

===Amusia===
{{Main|Amusia}}

====Definition and history====
[[Amusia]] refers to the inability of certain individuals to recognize simple tunes.&lt;ref&gt;"Zatorre, Robert, [[University of Montreal]] Dept of [[Psychology]], interviewed by Christa Caesar, Oct 28,2009"&lt;/ref&gt; Amusia is commonly referred to as [[tone deafness|tone-deafness]], [[tune deaf|tune-deafness]], [[dysmelodia]], or [[dysmusia]]. The first documented case of [[congenital amusia]] was reported in 2002 by leading music neuroscientists from the Department of Psychology at the University of Montreal, [[Canada]]. The case followed the case of a middle-aged woman who "lacks most basic musical abilities".&lt;ref&gt;Peretz I, Ayotte J, Zatorre RJ, Mehler J, Ahad P, Penhune VB, Jutras B (2002) Congenital Amusia: a disorder of fine-grained pitch discrimination. Neuron 17;33(2): 185-91&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the techniques that are used in studying this disorder are [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[positron emission tomography]] or PET scans, and anatomical [[MRI]].

====Symptoms and causes====
Amusia may be congenital or acquired. Congenital amusia, as the term suggests, is acquired as a result of birth or one's genes; while acquired amusia occurs as a result of accidental brain damage, stress, or [[Cognitive disorder|cognitive deficits]]. Symptoms of this disease vary from lack of basic melodic discrimination, recognition despite normal audiometry, above average intellectual, memory, as well as language skills (Peretz 2002). Another conspicuous symptom of amusia is the ability of the affected individual to carry out normal speech, however, he or she is unable to sing. Amusic individuals "show a particular deficit in discriminating musical pitch variations and in recognizing familiar melodies".&lt;ref&gt;Ayotte J, Peretz I, Hyde K (2002) Congenital Amusia: A group study of adults afflicted with a music specific disorder. Brain 125: 238-251&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientists are now classifying congenital amusia as a "new class of learning disabilities that affect musical abilities" (Ayotte 2002).

===Acquired music agnosia===
====Definition====
The term "agnosia" refers to a loss of knowledge. Acquired music agnosia is the "inability to recognize music in the absence of sensory, intellectual, verbal, and mnesic impairments".&lt;ref&gt;Peretz I, Can we lose memory for music? A case of music agnosia in a nonmusician (1996). J Cogn Neuroscience 8:481-96&lt;/ref&gt; Music agnosia is most commonly acquired; in most cases it is a result of bilateral infarction of the right temporal lobes.&lt;ref&gt;Satoh M. A case of auditory agnosia with impairment of perception and expression of music: cognitive processing of tonality (2007) European Neurology 58(2) 70-77&lt;/ref&gt; In his article, Satoh states "when pure word deafness, auditory sound agnosia, and receptive amusia occur simultaneously, the state is called [[auditory agnosia]]" (Satoh 2007). However, one must understand the subtle difference between auditory and music agnosia; the former refers to the inability to recognize environmental sounds while the latter refers to the inability to recognize music.&lt;ref&gt;Vignolo L. Music agnosia and auditory agnosia (2003) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 999:50-57&lt;/ref&gt;

====Symptoms and causes====
The main symptoms of music agnosia range from the inability to recognize pitch, rhythm, chords, and notes to the inability to discriminate and recognize familiar songs, and judge tonality, and reproduce musical phrases. As was previously mentioned the main causes for music agnosia are lesions in the right or bilateral temporal lobes (Satoh 2007) or unilateral strokes.

===Musical hallucinations===
{{Main|Musical hallucinations}}
====Definition====
Musical hallucinations (MH) can be described as perceptions of musical sounds in the absence of external auditory stimuli. Although imagined sounds can be non-musical; such as bells, whistles and sirens, case studies indicate that music “[takes] precedence over all other auditory hallucinations” (Sacks, 2006). Furthermore, MH may often take the form of songs from childhood and may be connected with strong childhood emotions.

====Symptoms and causes====
In a literature review by Evers and Ellger (2004), manifestations of MH can also be attributed to: a) psychiatric disorder, b) brain lesion, c) epilepsy and d) intoxication. Of great interest to researchers are individuals who experience MH with focal lesions and epileptic brain activity. Until recently, neurologists believed in a hemispheric dominance theory of music. Brain scans of subjects with lesions seem to refute this notion. Evers and Ellger (2004) found no significant difference in the hemisphere associated with the lesion as the major cause of MH.

==Summary==
There are a range of music-specific disorders that afflict many individuals in any given population. However, since music cognition is a newly developing area of interest in the neuroscientific community, a lot more research is yet to be done and the knowledge that currently exists is vague and indefinitive. The inability to recognize or reproduce music is a major psychological disorder, as it incapacitates an individual to appreciate music and experience its therapeutic powers. Music is known for its healing and relaxing properties, therefore it is even more important that more robust experiments and research be performed in this relatively new area of neuroscience.

'''National Institute of Biomedical Genomics''' ('''NIBMG''') is a national level research institute for [[genomic medicine]]. It is located at [[Kalyani, West Bengal|Kalyani]] [[West Bengal]]—50&amp;nbsp;km from [[Kolkata]].&lt;ref name="AIIMSKalyani"&gt;{{cite news|title=Land inspection for AIIMS Kalyani soon |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Land-inspection-for-AIIMS-Kalyani-soon/articleshow/41722766.cms |date=5 September 2014 |work=[[Times of India]] |location=Kolkata |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been established as an autonomous institution under the [[Department of Biotechnology]], [[Government of India]]. This is the first institution in India explicitly devoted to research, training, translation and service and capacity-building in biomedical genomics.

The Institute is now functioning from its permanent campus constructed on a 30-acre plot of land near Bidhanpally, Kalyani.

This is the first institution in India explicitly devoted to research, training, translation &amp; service and capacity-building in Biomedical Genomics. One of the objectives of NIBMG is to create necessary physical infrastructure to serve as the expert base for the principles and practise of Biomedical Genomics. The Institute has, already created a formidable capacity for ultra-fast DNA and RNA sequencing, the largest in any academic institution in India; created two global records of sequence data generation in a single experiment within a short period of time, breaking the previous records held by an American Genomics Company; generated data equivalent to about 10,000 human genomes in the last five years, cutting costs of sequencing using various innovative experimental approaches; formed a research platform to facilitate pursuit of Biomedical Genomics at the national level by opening up its core facilities to universities and other national labs. Another major objective of the Institute is to conduct and promote cutting-edge research in Biomedical Genomics, for impactful translation of genomics-driven approach to public health improvement.

NIBMG has embarked on identifying genomic underpinnings of two cancer types, oral and cervical, that are most common among males and females, respectively, of our country. The Institute is the co-ordinating centre and the genomics experimental laboratory for the India component of the International Cancer Genome Consortium. The Institute has also made significant contributions to genomics of chronic and infectious diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic pancreatitis, sepsis, latency in tuberculosis, etc. Promoting life-course epidemiology and population awareness is a major programme of the Institute. To identify how genes and environmental factors interact in precipitating diseases, the Institute has formed a population cohort of 50,000 individuals, who are being followed up regularly, with blood and clinical profiling being done. This understanding will help prevent diseases by controlling relevant environmental factors. Awareness camps to prevent diseases are being regularly organized in the cohort.

The Institute has taken genomic laboratories and genetic testing to the doorsteps of clinicians by establishing a unit in the largest tertiary care government hospital in Kolkata, the SSKM Hospital. The Institute has collaborative projects with many national institutions, such as, Translational Health Science &amp; Technology Institute (THSTI), Center for Cell &amp; Molecular Biology (CCMB) etc. and with global biotech institutions and industry, such as, European Bioinformatics Institute, University of Chicago, Genentech, Unilever, etc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbtindia.nic.in/inauguration-of-the-new-campus-of-nibmg/ |title=Inauguration of the New Campus of NIBMG at Kalyani, West Bengal |date=7 May 2018 |access-date=20 October 2018 |website=www.dbtindia.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14594">The '''new town movement''' refers to towns that were built after [[World War II]] and that have been purposefully planned, developed and built as a remedy to overcrowding and congestion in some instances, and to scattered ad hoc settlements in others.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for it was to decongest larger industrialized cities, rehousing people in freshly built, new and fully planned towns that were completely self-sufficient and provided for the community.

==Background and context: ‘The Urban Disease’==
In 1918, writing at a time when nineteenth century sanitary advances had revealed how badly off people in urban environments were and, owing to pioneers such as [[Patrick Geddes]], the relationship between social issues and town planning was slowly being realised, Frederick Osborn refers to urban problems collectively as the ‘urban disease’ &lt;ref name="Osborn"&gt;Osborn, F. 1942. ‘New Towns After the War’. Second Ed. J. M. Dent and Sons ltd, London. First Pub 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;
The urban disease, a by-product of the [[industrial revolution]], was brought on by a vicious cycle whereby industry chose to set up near population bases to ensure labour demands could be met which in turn attracted rural migrants seeking work to move into the city prompting further industry and so on. This resulted in greater pollution in the city, higher populations, and denser living conditions. Moreover, rural areas declining rapidly due to loss of population were left to decay.

Furthermore, there were no powers in place to stop prosperous families moving to open spaces or from industry growing in the centres. Fringe growth was vigorous and existing centres were left to deteriorate. Accordingly, those who moved to new fringe suburbs to escape the congestion were in fact “bolstering the very process that caused them to move away.” &lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"&gt;Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspirations for Change ==
Although aspirations of dispersing great cities are as old as the industrial revolution itself, it was not until 1817 that the first model communities were proposed by social reformer [[Robert Owen]] to address overcrowded towns. Inspired by [[John Bellers]]’s 1695 proposal for a College of Industry, a colony for the poor enabling disadvantaged people to work and their children to be educated, Owen proposed small, self-contained communities of about twelve hundred people reliant on agriculture but with some other industry. However, his plans “foundered under the heavy weight of revolutionary ideas” &lt;ref&gt;Osborn, F. 1942. ‘New Towns After the War’. Second Ed. J. M. Dent and Sons ltd, London. First Pub 1918. Pp 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further model community ideas continued to arise but were each dismissed owing to the perception that they were unconvincing as business ventures.&lt;ref name="Osborn"/&gt; Enter [[Ebenezer Howard]], creator of the [[Garden City Movement]], who successfully founded [[Letchworth]] Garden City (1903) and proved that new towns could be economically viable. This was affirmed by [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], co-founder of the London School of Economics, who referred to his investments in the garden city movement as “entirely satisfactory, both economically and morally.” &lt;ref name="Osborn"/&gt;

== Garden Cities and New Towns ==

The New Town Movement was derived from the [[Garden City Movement]], founded by [[Ebenezer Howard]] in the late 1800s, as an alternative to the overcrowded, polluted, chaotic and miserable industrial cities that had appeared in Britain.  Towards the end of [[World War One]] a group developed – the ‘New Townsmen’ – whose members were Howard, F.J. Osborn, C.B. Purdom and W.G. Taylor. They began advocating the development of 100 new cities to be built by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Ward, 1998, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

== F.J. Osborn ==

If Howard is the ‘father’ of Garden Cities, then Frederick J. Osborn is certainly his ‘son’ – predecessor and champion of the New Towns. Osborn was born in 1885 and spent the majority of his life arguing the case for New Towns. Like Howard, he had quite a modest education, having never attended a university. But what he lacked in formal education, he made up for with ambition and wise career choices. In his early 30s, after meeting Howard through his job at the Howard Cottage Society, he took to the campaign for Garden Cities, though they were now referred to as New Towns.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Ward, 1998, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The initial campaigns for the establishment of New Towns failed. Although housing was built, it was often in the form of a ‘garden suburb’, or located on the edge of the existing cities – the antithesis of the Garden City idea.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Ward, 1998, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; With an increasing lack of faith in the government to take up the flag for public housing and new towns, Howard suggested to Osborn that he was wasting his time lobbying government, and that he would be ‘as old as [[Methuselah]]’ waiting for action.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 1996, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Beginnings of Reform==
In 1909 a greater understanding of the ‘urban disease’ saw Britain’s first town planning legislation created. Although technically opposed to [[wikt:fringe|fringe]] development, the [[Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1909]] did not prevent it. Instead, in light of recent success with the development of [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]], the Act, realising that suburbs were easier to develop than towns, held the ethos that good suburbs were better than bad ones. Although planners of the day wanted new towns they were busy dealing with the demand for suburbs: “it is difficult for a technician to earn a living in an ivory tower” &lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963. pp 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, new towns required government direction which was beyond the scope of municipal powers alone.

Towards the end of the First World War the Garden City principles were reasserted by the ‘New Townsmen’ (Howard, Osborn, Purdon, and Tayler), who, referring to the success of Letchworth, proposed 100 government-supported new towns to address post-war rebuilding. However, the need for post-war housing resulted in new suburbs being prioritised over towns for the next two decades with some four million high standard houses built in between the wars albeit in the wrong places &lt;ref name="Osborn"/&gt; Conversely, some attempts were made at designing rebuilding efforts as satellite towns such as Manchester’s [[Wythenshawe]] and Liverpool’s [[Speke]] and Knowsley which also included provisions for industry. Nonetheless, these were still extensions of existing cities and not true New Towns.&lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"/&gt; Furthermore, three-quarters of all the new housing was built privately meaning a default bottom-line approach was adopted into the inter-war development efforts.

During the inter-war years Government committees studied the problem of urban concentration with the Committee on Unhealthy Areas, chaired by [[Neville Chamberlain]] (1919-1921), recommending the restriction of further industry in London and the relocation of some of the city’s existing industry to garden cities. Although nothing came of these studies they became the origin of Chamberlain’s urban decentralisation interests which led to his setting up of the Barlow Commission once Prime Minister. Further important advances included a 1935 Departmental Committee recommendation for the building of new towns in line with garden city principles and a 1936 Special Areas Report reiterating the idea that no new industry should be allowed in London which gained public and political interest &lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"/&gt;

== The Barlow Royal Commission ==
In 1938 Chamberlain, as the new Prime Minister, assigned a Royal Commission chaired by [[Sir Anderson Barlow]] into the urban concentration of population and industry. The resulting report raised the problem of large towns as a public issue for the first time and concluded that ‘planned decentralisation’ was favourable. However, owing to the outbreak of war in 1939 the Barlow Report, published in 1940, was initially ignored due to more immediate priorities although it eventually became a turning point for New Towns policy.&lt;ref&gt;Gibberd, F. 1980. ‘Harlow: the story of a new town’. Publications for Companies. Stevenage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage brought on by the [[Second World War]] provoked significant public interest in what post-war Britain would be like which was encouraged by the Government who facilitated talk about a ‘[[Better Britain]]’ to boost morale. Furthermore, the [[Ministry of Works and Building]] was commissioned to draft ideas. Ironically, the Barlow Report was quickly turned to as a best practice document.&lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"/&gt;

In 1942, following the Report’s recommendation, the Government chose to create a central planning authority in the form of the [[Ministry of Works and Planning]]. More importantly the Government also announced that the Report’s decentralisation and relocation of population and industry initiatives would be followed.

==Plans and Legislation ==
Post-war rebuilding initiatives saw new plans drafted for London which for the first time addressed the issue of decentralisation. Firstly, the [[County of London Plan]] 1943 recognised that displacement of population and employment was necessary if the city was to be rebuilt at a desirable density. Moreover, the [[Greater London Plan]] of 1944 went further by suggesting that over one million people would need to be displaced into a mixture of satellite suburbs, existing rural towns, and new towns.&lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"/&gt; 
	
In 1945 the New Towns Committee was formed to consider the “establishment, development, organisation, and administration” &lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.pp 55&lt;/ref&gt; of new towns. Within eight months the committee had completed a highly comprehensive study into these issues resulting in positive recommendations for the construction of new towns. Accordingly, the [[New Towns Act 1946]] was passed which, coupled with the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]], created a revolutionary “machinery for positive town construction”.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.pp56.&lt;/ref&gt; These innovative Acts resulted in a total of 28 New Towns being constructed in Britain over the following half-century &lt;ref&gt;Hall, P and Ward, C. 1998. ‘Sociable Cities: the Legacy of Ebenezer Howard’. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester pp. 41-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Towns in Britain ==
{{Main|New towns in the United Kingdom}}
It was in 1946 that the hard work of the ‘New Townsmen’ finally paid off with the passing of the [[New Towns Act 1946]]. Swayed by the need for post-war reconstruction, more housing, and a call to halt any further expansion of London’s girth, authorities saw that there was no alternative to the New Town solution.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Ward, 1998, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 27 [[New Towns]] were built after 1946. These were: [[Stevenage]], [[Crawley]], [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Harlow]], [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], [[Basildon]], [[Bracknell]] and [[Milton Keynes]] outside [[London]]; [[Newton Aycliffe]], [[Peterlee]] and [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]] in the [[North East England|North East]]; [[Skelmersdale]] and [[Runcorn]] in the [[North West England|North West]]; [[Corby]], [[Telford]] and [[Redditch]] in the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]]; [[Cwmbran]] and [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] in [[Wales]]; and in [[Scotland]], [[East Kilbride]], [[Glenrothes]], [[Cumbernauld]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]] and [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]]. Towns that were expanded under the new towns act were [[Peterborough]], [[Northampton]], [[Warrington]], [[Ipswich]] and [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]-[[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]]-[[Chorley]].&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

== The New Towns Movement around the world ==

There were similar problems for New Towns advocates in other areas of the world. In Hong Kong, the [[new towns of Hong Kong|new towns]] were developed as an initiative from the British colonial government.  In other areas although they understood the concept and approved in large numbers, planners had trouble convincing their own governments or agencies of the merits of the proposal. In the United States, it was not until the 1960s that New Towns policies were put in place, although after World War Two grants had been extended for such things as [[slum clearance]], improved and increased housing, and road construction, and in the 1950s, to ‘comprehensive renewal projects’.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In the former USSR, more than 800 New Towns were founded after the 1917 Revolution, but their growth was not constrained by specific limits.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason it could be argued that these towns did not meet the criteria for New Towns since planned population and size limitations were an important part of the New Town idea. Other European countries such as France, Germany, Italy and Sweden also had some successes with new towns, especially as part of post-war reconstruction efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969, p. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable new towns in the United States include [[Reston, Virginia|Reston, VA]]; [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia, MD]]; [[Jonathan, Minnesota|Jonathan, MN;]] [[Peachtree City, Georgia|Peachtree City, GA]]; the "new town in town" of [[Riverside Plaza]] in Minneapolis.

{{one source|date=June 2009}}
A '''privilege''' is a certain entitlement to [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]] granted by the state or another authority to a restricted group, either by birth or on a conditional basis. Land-titles and taxi medallions are pronounced examples of transferable privilege. These can be revoked in certain circumstances. In modern democratic states, a ''privilege'' is conditional and granted only after birth.  By contrast, a ''[[right]]'' is an inherent, irrevocable entitlement held by all citizens or all human beings from the moment of birth. Various examples of old [[common law]] privilege still exist, to title deeds, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanna McNichol, ''The Law of Privilege'' (1st ed., 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Etymologically, a privilege (''privilegium'') means a "private law", or rule relating to a specific individual or institution.

Note that the principles of conduct that members of the legal profession observe in their practice are called Legal ethics. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/legal-ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boniface]]'s [[Fulda monastery|abbey of Fulda]], to cite an early and prominent example, was granted ''[[privilege (canon law)|privilegium]]'', setting the abbot in direct contact with the pope, bypassing the jurisdiction of the local bishop.

One of the objectives of the [[French Revolution]] was the abolition of privilege. This meant the removal of separate laws for different [[social class]]es ([[nobility]], [[clergy]], and ordinary people), instead subjecting everyone to the same common law. Privileges were abolished by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] on August 4, 1789.

==Protection from subpoena== 
One common legal privilege in the United States and Commonwealth countries is protection from the requirement to testify or provide documents in certain situations (see [[privilege (evidence)]]). This is granted to people based on a professional or personal relationship (such as being the lawyer, doctor, or spouse of the accused) and not based on circumstances of birth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4319">{{about|the literary term|the album by Deep Purple|Purple Passages}}

In [[literary criticism]], '''purple prose''' is [[prose]] text that is so extravagant, ornate, or flowery as to break the flow and draw excessive attention to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Word a Day – purple prose |url=http://www.wordsmith.org/words/purple_prose.html |website=Wordsmith.org |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purple prose is characterized by the excessive use of adjectives, adverbs, and [[metaphor]]s. When it is limited to certain passages, they may be termed '''purple patches''' or '''purple passages''', standing out from the rest of the work.

Purple prose is criticized for desaturating the meaning in an author's text by overusing melodramatic and fanciful descriptions. As there is no precise rule or absolute definition of what constitutes purple prose, deciding if a text, passage, or complete work has fallen victim is a somewhat subjective decision. According to [[Paul West (writer)|Paul West]], "It takes a certain amount of sass to speak up for prose that's rich, succulent and full of novelty. Purple is immoral, undemocratic and insincere; at best artsy, at worst the exterminating angel of depravity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=Paul|title=IN DEFENSE OF PURPLE PROSE|journal=New York Times|date=15 December 1985|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/books/in-defense-of-purple-prose.html?pagewanted=2|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term ''purple prose'' is derived from a reference by the Roman poet [[Horace]]&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nixon |first=Cheryl |title=Novel Definitions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XTY6q_hIa90C&amp;pg=PA194|accessdate=19 May 2013 |publisher=Broadview Press |isbn=9781770482074 |pages=194– |date=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macrone1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macrone|first=Michael|title=It's Greek to Me |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ohlxXHpEK8C&amp;pg=PA147 |accessdate=19 May 2013 |date=1994-05-18 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=9780062720443 |pages=147–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Quintus Horatius Flaccus, 65–8 BC) who wrote in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (lines 14–21):&lt;ref name="horace"&gt;Horace (18 BC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3113">[[File:Släpljus - Ystad-2015.jpg|thumb|Raking light across a wall, gives a [[relief]] like impression.]]
'''Raking light''', the illumination of objects from a [[Light_source#Light_sources|light source]] at an [[Angle#Types_of_angles|oblique angle]] or almost [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the surface, provides information on the [[Topography|surface topography]] and relief of the artefact thus lit. It is widely used in the examination of works of art.

==Examination of paintings==
Using raking light, the effects of [[impasto]] and the surface texture of a [[painting]] are accentuated by the increased illumination of surfaces facing the light source and the exaggeration of [[shadows]] on surfaces facing away from the light source.&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/raking-light |title=Glossary - raking light |publisher=[[The National Gallery]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances raking light may help reveal [[pentimenti]] (changes in an artist's intention).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/ophelia/conservation-ophelia/raking-light-and-relief |title=Raking light and relief |publisher=[[Tate]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[murals|wall paintings]], raking light helps show preparatory techniques such as [[Fresco|incisions]] in the plaster support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/wall_paintings.pdf |title=The Conservation of Wall Paintings |page=25 |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
[[Conservation-restoration|Conservators]] examine objects under raking light during [[visual inspection]] and for [[condition recording]].&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt; In the examination of [[Easel|easel paintings]], raking light may help document [[craquelure]], paint [[wikt:cupping|cupping]], uneven [[Tension (physics)|tension]] in a [[canvas]], or [[Wood warping|warp]] in a [[Panel painting|panel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-hki.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/services/photo_lighting.html |title=Lighting techniques - raking light |publisher=[[Hamilton Kerr Institute]] |date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the examination of [[Murals|wall paintings]], raking light can help document surface deterioration phenomena such as the [[efflorescence]] of [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] and micro-[[delamination]], and may be used for monitoring the effects of conservation interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/wall_paintings.pdf |title=The Conservation of Wall Paintings |pages=49, 145f |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7684">'''Randall Herbert Balmer''' (born October 22, 1954) is an American author and a historian of American religion. He taught at [[Barnard College]] and [[Columbia University]] for twenty-seven years before moving to Dartmouth College in 2012, where he was named the Mandel Family Professor in the Arts &amp; Sciences. He is also an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal priest]]. He earned his Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]] in 1985. He has been a visiting professor at [[Dartmouth College]] and at [[Rutgers]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Drew University]], [[Emory University]], [[Yale]] and [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]] universities and at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]], where he was also adjunct professor of church history. He has also taught in the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]].&lt;ref name="barnard.columbia.edu"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~religion/faculty/balmer-bio.html# |title=Dartmouth College Dept. of Religion bio |access-date=2013-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909072917/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~religion/faculty/balmer-bio.html# |archive-date=2013-09-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was visiting professor at Yale Divinity School from 2004 until 2008.

Following his ordination in 2006 and concurrent with his academic responsibilities, Balmer served as part-time rector of two Episcopal parishes in Connecticut: St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington (2008-2009) and Christ Episcopal Church in Middle Haddam (2010-2012). In addition to his academic writing, Balmer has published commentaries in newspapers across the country, including the ''[[Des Moines Register]],'' the ''Philadelphia Inquirer,'' the ''Dallas Morning News,'' the ''Omaha World Herald,'' the ''Los Angeles Times,'' the ''Anchorage Daily News,'' the ''Hartford Courant,'' the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch,'' ''New York Newsday,'' the ''Minneapolis Star Tribune,'' and the ''New York Times,'' among others. His work has also appeared in the ''Nation'', the ''New Republic'', the ''Washington Post Book World'', and the ''New York Times Book Review''.

Balmer was nominated for an [[Emmy]] for script-writing and hosting the three-part [[Public Broadcasting Services|PBS]] documentary "Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory," based on his book with the same title.&lt;ref name="barnard.columbia.edu"/&gt;  He also wrote and hosted two other PBS documentaries: "Crusade: The Life of Billy Graham" and "In the Beginning: The Creationist Controversy."

==Balmer's criticisms of the Religious Right==
In various books and articles, Balmer has criticized the politicization of the American Christian [[christian right|evangelical movement]].  In an article titled "Jesus is not a Republican" in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', Balmer writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Indeed, the most effective and vigorous religious movements in American history have identified with the downtrodden and have positioned themselves on the fringes of society rather than at the centers of power. The [[Methodist]]s of the 19th century come to mind, as do the [[Mormon]]s. In the 20th century, [[Pentecostal]]ism, which initially appealed to the lower classes and made room for women and people of color, became perhaps the most significant religious movement of the century.

The leaders of the religious right have led their sheep astray from the gospel of [[Jesus Christ]] to the false gospel of [[neoconservative]] ideology and into the maw of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. And yet my regard for the flock and my respect for their integrity is undiminished. Ultimately it is they who must reclaim the gospel and rescue us from the distortions of the religious right.

The [[Bible]] I read tells of freedom for captives and deliverance from oppression. It teaches that those who refuse to act with justice or who neglect the plight of those less fortunate have some explaining to do. But the Bible is also about good news. It promises redemption and forgiveness, a chance to start anew and, with divine help, to get it right. My evangelical theology assures me that no one, not even [[Karl Rove]] or [[James Dobson]], lies beyond the reach of redemption, and that even a people led astray can find their way home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/free/v52/i42/42b00601.htm "Jesus Is Not a Republican"] The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Political career ==
In 2003, Balmer ran for a seat on his local school board and lost by four votes.&lt;ref name="columbiaspectator.com"&gt;http://columbiaspectator.com/2004/10/06/popular-barnard-professor-looks-politics-0&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Balmer won the Democratic nomination for a seat representing the 111th District in the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]]. Balmer ran in the general election against incumbent Republican [[John H. Frey]], despite the fact that Balmer had lived in the district for less than three years, Frey had never drawn an opponent, and the town of Ridgefield (which the 111th District represents) was "two-to-one Republican."&lt;ref name="columbiaspectator.com"/&gt; Ultimately, Balmer was defeated in the election. Frey won 8,824 votes, and Balmer won 4,478 votes; Frey won more votes than anyone else in the Connecticut House that year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&amp;q=392548&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sensus plenior''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase that means "fuller sense" or "fuller meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reclaimingthemind.org/wordoftheday/sensus-plenior/|publisher=''reclaimingthemind.org''|date=21 July 2012|accessdate=12 October 2012|title=Sensus plenior|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415161338/http://www.reclaimingthemind.org/wordoftheday/sensus-plenior/|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/onsite/qna/plenior.html|publisher=''monergism.com''|year=2008 |accessdate=12 October 2012|title=What does the term ''sensus plenior'' mean?}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in Biblical [[exegesis]] to describe the supposed deeper meaning intended by [[God]] but not by the human author. [[Walter C. Kaiser]] notes that the term was coined by F. Andre Fernandez in 1927 but was popularized by [[Raymond E. Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter C. Kaiser, Jr.]], "Single Meaning, Unified Referents: Accurate and Authoritative Citations of the Old Testament by the New Testament," in Kenneth Berding and Jonathan Lunde, ed., ''Three Views on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2007), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown defines ''sensus plenior'' as
{{quote|That additional, deeper meaning, intended by God but not clearly intended by the human author, which is seen to exist in the words of a biblical text (or group of texts, or even a whole book) when they are studied in the light of further revelation or development in the understanding of revelation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond E. Brown]], ''The ''Sensus Plenior'' of Sacred Scripture'' (Baltimore: St. Mary's University, 1955), 92.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

That implies that more meaning can be found within scripture than the original human authors intended and so the study of scripture that isolates a particular book and concerns itself only with the details of the author's time and situation can be incomplete.

''Sensus plenior'' corresponds to [[pardes (Jewish exegesis)|rabbinical interpretations]] of the [[Hebrew Scriptures]], ''remez'' ("hint"), ''drash'' ("search"), and/or ''sod'' ("secret"), by which deeper meaning is drawn out or  from the text.

[[John Goldingay]] suggests that the citation of [[Isaiah 7:14]] in [[Matthew 1:23]] is a "stock example" of ''sensus plenior''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldingay|first=John|author-link=John Goldingay|title=Approaches to Old Testament Interpretation|year=2002|publisher=Clements Publishing Group|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x0crJtG57M4C&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative Christians have used the term to mean the larger or whole teaching of scripture.

The snowball-Earth episodes are proposed to have occurred before the sudden radiation of multicellular bioforms, known as the [[Cambrian explosion]]. The most recent snowball episode may have triggered the evolution of multicellularity. Another, much earlier and longer snowball episode, the [[Huronian glaciation]], which would have occurred 2400 to 2100&amp;nbsp;Mya, may have been triggered by the first appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere, the "[[Great Oxygenation Event]]".

===Evidence for ancient glaciation mounts===
Long before the idea of a global glaciation was established, a series of discoveries began to accumulate evidence for ancient Precambrian glaciations. The first of these discoveries was published in 1871 by J. Thomson who found ancient glacier-reworked material ([[tillite]]) in [[Islay]], Scotland. Similar findings followed in Australia (1884) and India (1887). A fourth and very illustrative finding that came to be known as "[[Reusch's Moraine]]" was reported by [[Hans Reusch]] in northern Norway in 1891. Many other findings followed, but their understanding was hampered by the rejection of [[continental drift]].&lt;ref name=Hoffman2011&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hoffman |first1=Paul F.|author-link=Paul F.

===Global glaciation proposed===
Sir [[Douglas Mawson]] (1882–1958), an Australian geologist and Antarctic explorer, spent much of his career studying the [[Neoproterozoic]] [[stratigraphy]] of South Australia, where he identified thick and extensive glacial sediments and late in his career speculated about the possibility of global glaciation.&lt;ref name="Mawson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alderman | first1 = A.

E. | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1960.0011 | title = [[Douglas Mawson]] 1882-1958 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 5 | pages = 119–127 | year = 1960 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mawson's ideas of global glaciation, however, were based on the mistaken assumption that the geographic position of Australia, and that of other continents where low-latitude glacial deposits are found, has remained constant through time. With the advancement of the [[continental drift]] hypothesis, and eventually [[plate tectonic]] theory, came an easier explanation for the glaciogenic sediments—they were deposited at a point in time when the continents were at higher latitudes.

In 1964, the idea of global-scale glaciation reemerged when [[W. Brian Harland]] published a paper in which he presented [[palaeomagnetic]] data showing that glacial [[till]]ites in [[Svalbard]] and [[Greenland]] were deposited at tropical latitudes.&lt;ref name="Harland"&gt;{{cite journal

| doi=10.1007/BF01821169}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this palaeomagnetic data, and the sedimentological evidence that the glacial sediments interrupt successions of rocks commonly associated with tropical to temperate latitudes, he argued for an [[ice age]] that was so extreme that it resulted in the deposition of marine glacial rocks in the tropics.

In the 1960s, [[Mikhail Budyko]], a Russian climatologist, developed a simple energy-balance climate model to investigate the effect of ice cover on global [[climate]]. Using this model, Budyko found that if ice sheets advanced far enough out of the polar regions, a feedback loop ensued where the increased reflectiveness ([[albedo]]) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the entire Earth was covered in ice and stabilized in a new ice-covered equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Budyko"&gt;{{cite journal

While Budyko's model showed that this ice-albedo stability could happen, he concluded that it had in fact never happened, because his model offered no way to escape from such a feedback loop. In 1971, Aron Faegre, an American physicist, showed that a similar energy-balance model predicted three stable global climates, one of which was snowball earth.&lt;ref name="Faegre"&gt;{{cite journal

This model introduced [[Edward Norton Lorenz]]'s concept of intransitivity indicating that there could be a major jump from one climate to another, including to snowball earth.

The term "snowball Earth" was coined by [[Joseph Kirschvink]] in a short paper published in 1992 within a lengthy volume concerning the biology of the [[Proterozoic]] eon.&lt;ref name="Kirschvink" /&gt; The major contributions from this work were: (1) the recognition that the presence of [[banded iron formation]]s is consistent with such a global glacial episode, and (2) the introduction of a mechanism by which to escape from a completely ice-covered Earth—specifically, the accumulation of {{co2}} from volcanic outgassing leading to an ultra-[[greenhouse effect]].

[[Franklyn Van Houten]]'s discovery of a consistent geological pattern in which lake levels rose and fell is now known as the "Van Houten cycle". His studies of phosphorus deposits and [[banded iron formations]] in sedimentary rocks made him an early adherent of the "snowball Earth" hypothesis postulating that the planet's surface froze more than 650 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S28/44/69O99/index.xml?section=topstories Princeton University - Franklyn Van Houten, expert on sedimentary rocks, dies at 96&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in the notion of a snowball Earth increased dramatically after [[Paul F. Hoffman]] and his co-workers applied Kirschvink's ideas to a succession of Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in [[Namibia]] and elaborated upon the hypothesis in the journal ''Science'' in 1998 by incorporating such observations as the occurrence of [[cap carbonate]]s.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the equator. Therefore, the presence of glacial deposits within the [[tropics]] suggests global ice cover.

Critical to an assessment of the validity of the theory, therefore, is an understanding of the reliability and significance of the evidence that led to the belief that ice ever reached the tropics. This evidence must prove two things:
# that a bed contains sedimentary structures that could have been created only by glacial activity;
# that the bed lay within the tropics when it was deposited.

During a period of global glaciation, it must also be demonstrated that glaciers were active at different global locations at the same time, and that no other deposits of the same age are in existence.

This last point is very difficult to prove. Before the [[Ediacaran]], the [[biostratigraphy|biostratigraphic]] markers usually used to correlate rocks are absent; therefore there is no way to prove that rocks in different places across the globe were deposited at precisely the same time. The best that can be done is to estimate the age of the rocks using [[radiometry|radiometric]] methods, which are rarely accurate to better than a million years or so.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004/&gt;

The first two points are often the source of contention on a case-to-case basis. Many glacial features can also be created by non-glacial means, and estimating the approximate latitudes of landmasses even as recently as {{Ma|200}} can be riddled with difficulties.&lt;ref name=Briden1971&gt;{{cite journal

===Palaeomagnetism===
The snowball Earth hypothesis was first posited to explain what were then considered to be glacial deposits near the equator. Since tectonic plates move slowly over time, ascertaining their position at a given point in Earth's long history is not easy. In addition to considerations of how the recognizable landmasses could have fit together, the latitude at which a rock was deposited can be constrained by palaeomagnetism.

When [[sedimentary rock]]s form, magnetic minerals within them tend to align themselves with the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Through the precise measurement of this [[palaeomagnetism]], it is possible to estimate the [[latitude]] (but not the [[longitude]]) where the rock matrix was formed. Palaeomagnetic measurements have indicated that some sediments of glacial origin in the [[Neoproterozoic]] rock record were deposited within 10 degrees of the equator,&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the accuracy of this reconstruction is in question.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt; This palaeomagnetic location of apparently glacial sediments (such as [[dropstone]]s) has been taken to suggest that glaciers extended from land to sea level in tropical latitudes at the time the sediments were deposited.

Skeptics suggest that the palaeomagnetic data could be corrupted if Earth's ancient magnetic field was substantially different from today's. Depending on the rate of cooling of Earth's core, it is possible that during the Proterozoic, the [[magnetic field]] did not approximate a simple [[dipole|dipolar]] distribution, with north and south magnetic poles roughly aligning with the planet's axis as they do today. Instead, a hotter core may have circulated more vigorously and given rise to 4, 8 or more poles. Palaeomagnetic data would then have to be re-interpreted, as the sedimentary minerals could have aligned pointing to a 'West Pole' rather than the North Pole. Alternatively, Earth's dipolar field could have been oriented such that the poles were close to the equator. This hypothesis has been posited to explain the extraordinarily rapid motion of the magnetic poles implied by the Ediacaran palaeomagnetic record; the alleged motion of the north pole would occur around the same time as the Gaskiers glaciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2010.02.038| title = Incompatible Ediacaran paleomagnetic directions suggest an equatorial geomagnetic dipole hypothesis| year = 2010| last1 = Abrajevitch | first1 = A.| last2 = Van Der Voo | first2 = R.| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume = 293| issue = 1–2| pages = 164–170| bibcode=2010E&amp;PSL.293..164A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another weakness of reliance on palaeomagnetic data is the difficulty in determining whether the magnetic signal recorded is original, or whether it has been reset by later activity. For example, a mountain-building [[orogeny]] releases hot water as a by-product of metamorphic reactions; this water can circulate to rocks thousands of kilometers away and reset their magnetic signature. This makes the authenticity of rocks older than a few million years difficult to determine without painstaking mineralogical observations.&lt;ref

Sedimentary rocks that are deposited by glaciers have distinctive features that enable their identification. Long before the advent of the ''snowball Earth'' hypothesis many [[Neoproterozoic]] sediments had been interpreted as having a glacial origin, including some apparently at tropical latitudes at the time of their deposition. However, it is worth remembering that many sedimentary features traditionally associated with glaciers can also be formed by other means.&lt;ref name=Arnaud2002&gt;{{cite journal

===Open-water deposits===
It appears that some deposits formed during the snowball period could only have formed in the presence of an active hydrological cycle. Bands of glacial deposits up to 5,500 meters thick, separated by small (meters) bands of non-glacial sediments, demonstrate that glaciers melted and re-formed repeatedly for tens of millions of years; solid oceans would not permit this scale of deposition.&lt;ref name=Condon2002&gt;{{cite journal

===Carbon isotope ratios===
There are two stable [[isotope]]s of carbon in [[sea water]]: [[carbon-12]] (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C) and the rare [[carbon-13]] (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C), which makes up about 1.109 percent of carbon atoms.

Biochemical processes, of which [[photosynthesis]] is one, tend to preferentially incorporate the lighter &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope. Thus ocean-dwelling photosynthesizers, both [[protist]]s and [[algae]], tend to be very slightly depleted in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, relative to the abundance found in the primary [[volcanic]] sources of Earth's carbon. Therefore, an ocean with photosynthetic life will have a lower &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratio within organic remains, and a higher ratio in corresponding ocean water. The organic component of the lithified sediments will remain very slightly, but measurably, depleted in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C.

During the proposed episode of snowball Earth, there are rapid and extreme negative excursions in the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.&lt;ref name=Rothman2003&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D.H.

===Banded iron formations===
[[Image:Black-band ironstone (aka).jpg|thumb|2.1 billion-year-old rock with black-band ironstone]]
[[Banded iron formations]] (BIF) are sedimentary rocks of layered [[iron oxide]] and iron-poor [[chert]]. In the presence of oxygen, [[iron]] naturally rusts and becomes insoluble in water. The banded iron formations are commonly very old and their deposition is often related to the oxidation of the Earth's atmosphere during the [[Palaeoproterozoic]] era, when dissolved iron in the ocean came in contact with photosynthetically produced oxygen and precipitated out as iron oxide.

The bands were produced at the [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]] between an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] and an oxygenated ocean. Since today's atmosphere is [[oxygen]]-rich (nearly 21% by volume) and in contact with the oceans, it is not possible to accumulate enough iron oxide to deposit a banded formation. The only extensive iron formations that were deposited after the Palaeoproterozoic (after 1.8 billion years ago) are associated with [[Cryogenian]] glacial deposits.

For such iron-rich rocks to be deposited there would have to be anoxia in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as [[ferrous oxide]]) could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as [[ferric]] oxide. For the ocean to become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that the reappearance of BIF in the sedimentary record is a result of limited oxygen levels in an ocean sealed by sea-ice,&lt;ref name="Kirschvink"&gt;{{cite book

Being isolated from the oceans, such lakes could have been stagnant and anoxic at depth, much like today's [[Black Sea]]; a sufficient input of iron could provide the necessary conditions for BIF formation.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt; A further difficulty in suggesting that BIFs marked the end of the glaciation is that they are found interbedded with glacial sediments.&lt;ref name=Young1995/&gt; BIFs are also strikingly absent during the [[Marinoan glaciation]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

=== Cap carbonate rocks ===
[[Image:Grosser Aletschgletscher 3178.JPG|thumb|left|A present-day glacier]]

The formation of such sedimentary rocks could be caused by a large influx of positively charged [[ions]], as would be produced by rapid weathering during the extreme greenhouse following a snowball Earth event. The {{delta|13|C|link}} isotopic signature of the cap carbonates is near −5&amp;nbsp;‰, consistent with the value of the mantle—such a low value is usually/could be taken to signify an absence of life, since photosynthesis usually acts to raise the value; alternatively the release of methane deposits could have lowered it from a higher value, and counterbalance the effects of photosynthesis.

The precise mechanism involved in the formation of cap carbonates is not clear, but the most cited explanation suggests that at the melting of a snowball Earth, water would dissolve the abundant {{co2}} from the [[atmosphere]] to form [[carbonic acid]], which would fall as [[acid rain]]. This would weather exposed [[silicate]] and [[carbonate]] [[rock (geology)|rock]] (including readily attacked glacial debris), releasing large amounts of [[calcium]], which when washed into the ocean would form distinctively textured layers of carbonate sedimentary rock. Such an [[abiotic]] "[[cap carbonate]]" sediment can be found on top of the glacial till that gave rise to the snowball Earth hypothesis.

However, there are some problems with the designation of a glacial origin to cap carbonates. Firstly, the high carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere would cause the oceans to become acidic, and dissolve any carbonates contained within—starkly at odds with the deposition of cap carbonates. Further, the thickness of some cap carbonates is far above what could reasonably be produced in the relatively quick deglaciations. The cause is further weakened by the lack of cap carbonates above many sequences of clear glacial origin at a similar time and the occurrence of similar carbonates within the sequences of proposed glacial origin.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt; An alternative mechanism, which may have produced the [[Doushantuo]] cap carbonate at least, is the rapid, widespread release of methane. This accounts for incredibly low—as low as −48&amp;nbsp;‰—{{delta|13|C|}} values—as well as unusual sedimentary features which appear to have been formed by the flow of gas through the sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Changing acidity===
Isotopes of the element [[boron]] suggest that the [[pH]] of the oceans dropped dramatically before and after the [[Marinoan]] glaciation.&lt;ref name=Kasemann2005&gt;δ&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B, in {{cite journal

This may indicate a buildup of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere, some of which would dissolve into the oceans to form [[carbonic acid]]. Although the boron variations may be evidence of extreme [[climate change]], they need not imply a global glaciation.

===Space dust===
Earth's surface is very depleted in the element [[iridium]], which primarily resides in the [[Inner core|Earth's core]]. The only significant source of the element at the surface is [[cosmogenic|cosmic particles]] that reach Earth. During a snowball Earth, iridium would accumulate on the ice sheets, and when the ice melted the resulting layer of sediment would be rich in iridium. An [[iridium anomaly]] has been discovered at the base of the cap carbonate formations, and has been used to suggest that the glacial episode lasted for at least 3 million years,&lt;ref name=Bodiselitsch&gt;{{cite journal

===Cyclic climate fluctuations===
Using the ratio of mobile [[cation]]s to those that remain in soils during [[chemical weathering]] (the chemical index of alteration), it has been shown that chemical weathering varied in a cyclic fashion within a glacial succession, increasing during interglacial periods and decreasing during cold and arid glacial periods.&lt;ref name="Rieu"&gt;{{cite journal

In addition, glacial sediments of the [[Port Askaig Tillite Formation]] in Scotland clearly show interbedded cycles of glacial and shallow marine sediments.&lt;ref name=Young1999&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of these deposits is highly reliant upon their dating. Glacial sediments are difficult to date, and the closest dated bed to the Portaskaig group is 8&amp;nbsp;km stratigraphically above the beds of interest. Its dating to 600&amp;nbsp;Ma means the beds can be tentatively correlated to the Sturtian glaciation, but they may represent the advance or retreat of a snowball Earth.

==Mechanisms==
[[Image:SnowballSimulations.jpg|350px|thumb|right|One computer simulation of conditions during a snowball Earth period&lt;ref name=NatureAttrib&gt;Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd.: Nature 405:425-429, copyright 2000. See Hyde ''et al.'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The initiation of a snowball Earth event would involve some initial cooling mechanism, which would result in an increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice. The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase Earth's [[albedo]], which would result in [[positive feedback]] for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, run-away cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where [[solar radiation]] is most direct.

Many possible triggering mechanisms could account for the beginning of a snowball Earth, such as the eruption of a [[supervolcano]], a reduction in the atmospheric concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[methane]] and/or [[carbon dioxide]], changes in [[solar variation|Solar energy output]], or perturbations of [[Earth's orbit]]. Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, and the additional ice and snow reflects more Solar energy back to space, further cooling Earth and further increasing the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow. This positive feedback loop could eventually produce a frozen [[equator]] as cold as modern [[Antarctica]].

[[Global warming]] associated with large accumulations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over millions of years, emitted primarily by volcanic activity, is the proposed trigger for melting a snowball Earth. Due to positive feedback for melting, the eventual melting of the snow and ice covering most of Earth's surface would require as little as a millennium.

===Continental distribution===
A tropical distribution of the continents is, perhaps counter-intuitively, necessary to allow the initiation of a snowball Earth.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2005/&gt;
Firstly, tropical continents are more reflective than open ocean, and so absorb less of the Sun's heat: most absorption of Solar energy on Earth today occurs in tropical oceans.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen2001&gt;{{cite journal

|format=PDF| accessdate =21 May 2007
| pmid = 11507621
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, tropical continents are subject to more rainfall, which leads to increased river discharge—and erosion.
When exposed to air, [[silicate]] rocks undergo weathering reactions which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These reactions proceed in the general form: Rock-forming mineral + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → cations + bicarbonate + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. An example of such a reaction is the weathering of [[wollastonite]]:
: CaSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The released [[calcium]] cations react with the dissolved [[bicarbonate]] in the ocean to form [[calcium carbonate]] as a chemically precipitated [[sedimentary rock]]. This transfers [[carbon dioxide]], a greenhouse gas, from the air into the [[geosphere]], and, in steady-state on geologic time scales, offsets the carbon dioxide emitted from [[volcano]]es into the atmosphere.

A paucity of suitable sediments for analysis makes precise continental distribution during the Neoproterozoic difficult to establish.&lt;ref name=Meert2004&gt;{{cite journal

Additional factors that may have contributed to the onset of the Neoproterozoic snowball include the introduction of atmospheric free oxygen, which may have reached sufficient quantities to react with [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]], oxidizing it to carbon dioxide, a much weaker greenhouse gas,&lt;ref name=Kerr1999&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a younger—thus fainter—Sun, which would have emitted 6 percent less radiation in the Neoproterozoic.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt;

Normally, as Earth gets colder due to natural climatic fluctuations and changes in incoming solar radiation, the cooling slows these weathering reactions. As a result, less carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and Earth warms as this greenhouse gas accumulates—this '[[negative feedback]]' process limits the magnitude of cooling. During the [[Cryogenian]] period, however, Earth's continents were all at [[Tropics|tropical]] latitudes, which made this moderating process less effective, as high weathering rates continued on land even as Earth cooled. This let ice advance beyond the polar regions. Once ice advanced to within 30° of the equator,&lt;ref name=Kirschvink2002&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a positive feedback could ensue such that the increased reflectiveness ([[albedo]]) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the whole Earth is ice-covered.

Polar continents, due to low rates of [[evaporation]], are too dry to allow substantial carbon deposition—restricting the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide that can be removed from the [[carbon cycle]]. A gradual rise of the proportion of the [[isotope]] carbon-13 relative to carbon-12 in sediments pre-dating "global" glaciation indicates that {{co2}} draw-down before snowball Earths was a slow and continuous process.&lt;ref name=Schrag2002&gt;{{cite journal

In January 2016, Gernon et al. proposed a "shallow-ridge hypothesis" involving the breakup of the [[supercontinent]] [[Rodinia]], linking the eruption and rapid alteration of [[hyaloclastite]]s along shallow ridges to massive increases in alkalinity in an ocean with thick ice cover. Gernon et al. demonstrated that the increase in alkalinity over the course of glaciation is sufficient to explain the thickness of cap carbonates formed in the aftermath of Snowball Earth events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2632.epdf Snowball Earth ocean chemistry driven by extensive ridge volcanism during Rodinia breakup], T.M.

On the continents, the melting of [[glacier]]s would release massive amounts of glacial deposit, which would erode and weather. The resulting sediments supplied to the ocean would be high in nutrients such as [[phosphorus]], which combined with the abundance of {{co2}} would trigger a [[cyanobacteria]] population explosion, which would cause a relatively rapid reoxygenation of the atmosphere, which may have contributed to the rise of the [[Ediacaran biota]] and the subsequent [[Cambrian explosion]]—a higher oxygen concentration allowing large multicellular lifeforms to develop. Although the [[positive feedback]] loop would melt the ice in geological short order, perhaps less than 1,000 years, replenishment of atmospheric oxygen and depletion of the {{co2}} levels would take further [[millennium|millennia]].

It is possible that carbon dioxide levels fell enough for Earth to freeze again; this cycle may have repeated until the [[continental drift|continents had drifted]] to more polar latitudes.&lt;ref name=Hoffman1999&gt;{{cite journal

More recent evidence suggests that with colder oceanic temperatures, the resulting higher ability of the oceans to dissolve gases led to the carbon content of sea water being more quickly oxidized to carbon dioxide. This leads directly to an increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, enhanced greenhouse warming of Earth's surface, and the prevention of a total snowball state.&lt;ref&gt;Peltier, W. Richard, Yonggang Liu &amp; John W. Crowley, (2007), "Snowball Earth prevention by dissolved organic carbon remineralization" (Nature 450, 813-818 (6 December 2007) | {{doi|10.1038/nature06354}})&lt;/ref&gt;

During millions of years, [[cryoconite]] would have accumulated on and inside the ice. [[Psychrophile|Psychrophilic]] microorganisms, volcanic ash and dust from ice-free locations would settle on ice covering several million square kilometers. Once the ice started to melt, these layers would become visible and coloring the icy surfaces dark, helping to accelerate the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=27422766 | doi=10.1111/gbi.12191 | volume=14 | title=Cryoconite pans on Snowball Earth: supraglacial oases for Cryogenian eukaryotes? | year=2016 | journal=Geobiology | pages=531–542 | author=Hoffman PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultraviolet light from the Sun would also produce hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) when it hits water molecules. Normally hydrogen peroxide is broken down by sunlight, but some would have been trapped inside the ice. When the glaciers started to melt, it would have been released in both the ocean and the atmosphere, where it was split into water and oxygen molecules, leading to an increase in atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10662-did-snowball-earths-melting-let-oxygen-fuel-life/ Did snowball Earth’s melting let oxygen fuel life?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slushball Earth hypothesis===
While the presence of glaciers is not disputed, the idea that the entire planet was covered in ice is more contentious, leading some scientists to posit a "slushball Earth", in which a band of ice-free, or ice-thin, waters remains around the [[equator]], allowing for a continued [[hydrologic cycle]].

This hypothesis appeals to scientists who observe certain features of the sedimentary record that can only be formed under open water, or rapidly moving ice (which would require somewhere ice-free to move to). Recent research observed geochemical cyclicity in [[clastic rocks]], showing that the "snowball" periods were punctuated by warm spells, similar to [[ice age]] cycles in recent Earth history. Attempts to construct computer models of a snowball Earth have also struggled to accommodate global ice cover without fundamental changes in the laws and constants which govern the planet.

A less extreme snowball Earth hypothesis involves continually evolving continental configurations and changes in ocean circulation.&lt;ref name=Harland2007&gt;{{cite journal

There have been difficulties in recreating a snowball Earth with [[global climate model]]s.

==="Zipper rift" hypothesis===
&lt;!-- I don't feel I've done this paper justice here; it may be because I've not grasped it fully, but may also be that their model's not quite as awe-inspiring as it's made out to be. Please do feel free to have a look at the paper—message Verisimilus if you can't find it online—and improve this section if you feel you can! --&gt;
Nick Eyles suggest that the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth was in fact no different from any other glaciation in Earth's history, and that efforts to find a single cause are likely to end in failure.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt; The "Zipper rift" hypothesis proposes two pulses of continental "unzipping"—first, the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia, forming the proto-Pacific Ocean; then the splitting of the continent [[Baltica]] from [[Laurentia]], forming the proto-Atlantic—coincided with the glaciated periods.
The associated tectonic uplift would form high plateaus, just as the [[East African Rift]] is responsible for high topography; this high ground could then host glaciers.

Banded iron formations have been taken as unavoidable evidence for global ice cover, since they require dissolved iron ions and anoxic waters to form; however, the limited extent of the Neoproterozoic banded iron deposits means that they may not have formed in frozen oceans, but instead in inland seas. Such seas can experience a wide range of chemistries; high rates of evaporation could concentrate iron ions, and a periodic lack of circulation could allow anoxic bottom water to form.

Continental rifting, with associated subsidence, tends to produce such landlocked water bodies. This rifting, and associated subsidence, would produce the space for the fast deposition of sediments, negating the need for an immense and rapid melting to raise the global sea levels.

===High-obliquity hypothesis===
A competing hypothesis to explain the presence of ice on the equatorial continents was that Earth's [[axial tilt]] was quite high, in the vicinity of 60°, which would place Earth's land in high "latitudes", although supporting evidence is scarce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url= http://www.livescience.com/7105-day-earth-fell.html
| title= LiveScience.com: The Day The Earth Fell Over}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less extreme possibility would be that it was merely Earth's [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic pole]] that wandered to this inclination, as the magnetic readings which suggested ice-filled continents depends on the magnetic and rotational poles being relatively similar. In either of these two situations, the freeze would be limited to relatively small areas, as is the case today; severe changes to Earth's climate are not necessary.

This hypothesis, created to explain palaeomagnetic data, suggests that Earth's axis of rotation shifted one or more times during the general time-frame attributed to snowball Earth.

Several alternative explanations for the evidence have been proposed.

==Survival of life through frozen periods==
[[Image:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|right|A [[black smoker]], a type of hydrothermal vent]]
A tremendous glaciation would curtail photosynthetic life on Earth, thus depleting atmospheric oxygen, and thereby allowing non-oxidized iron-rich rocks to form.

Detractors argue that this kind of glaciation would have made life extinct entirely. However, microfossils such as [[stromatolite]]s and [[oncolite]]s prove that, in shallow marine environments at least, life did not suffer any perturbation. Instead life developed a trophic complexity and survived the cold period unscathed.&lt;ref name=Corsetti2003&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in fact, the organisms which should be most susceptible to climatic variation emerge unscathed from the snowball Earth.&lt;ref name=Grey2003 /&gt;

==Implications==
A snowball Earth has profound implications in the history of [[life]] on Earth. While many [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] have been postulated, global ice cover would certainly have ravaged [[ecosystem]]s dependent on sunlight. Geochemical evidence from rocks associated with low-latitude glacial deposits have been interpreted to show a crash in oceanic life during the glacials.

Because about half of the oceans' water was frozen solid as ice, the remaining water would be twice as salty as it is today, lowering its freezing point. When the ice sheet melted, it would cover the oceans with a layer of hot freshwater up to 2 kilometres thick. Only after the hot surface water mixed with the colder and deeper saltwater did the sea return to a warmer and less salty state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130525-snowball-earth-melting-led-to-freshwater-ocean-2-kilometres-deep/ Snowball Earth melting led to freshwater ocean 2 kilometres deep]&lt;/ref&gt;

The melting of the ice may have presented many new opportunities for diversification, and may indeed have driven the rapid evolution which took place at the end of the [[Cryogenian]] period.

===Effect on early evolution===
[[Image:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|right|222px|''[[Dickinsonia]] costata'', an [[Ediacaran]] organism of unknown affinity, with a quilted appearance]]
The [[Neoproterozoic]] was a time of remarkable diversification of multicellular organisms, including animals. Organism size and complexity increased considerably after the end of the snowball glaciations. This development of multicellular organisms may have been the result of increased evolutionary pressures resulting from multiple [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|icehouse-hothouse]] cycles; in this sense, snowball Earth episodes may have "pumped" evolution. Alternatively, fluctuating nutrient levels and rising oxygen may have played a part. Another major glacial episode may have ended just a few million years before the [[Cambrian explosion]].

Mechanistically, the effect of snowball Earth (in particular the later glaciations) on complex life is likely to have occurred through the process of [[kin selection]]. Organ-scale differentiation, in particular the terminal (irreversible) differentiation present in animals, requires the individual cell (and the genes contained within it) to "sacrifice" their ability to reproduce, so that the colony is not disrupted. From the short-term perspective of the gene, more offspring will be gained by causing the cell in which it is contained to ignore any signals received from the colony, and to reproduce at the maximum rate, regardless of the implications for the wider group. Today, this incentive explains the formation of tumours in animals and plants.

It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1472-4669.2007.00115.x|url=http://researchpages.net/media/resources/2007/06/21/richtimhywelfinal.pdf|title=Neoproterozoic 'snowball Earth' glaciations and the evolution of altruism|vauthors=Boyle RA, Lenton TM, ((Williams HTP)) |journal=Geobiology|year=2007|accessdate=17 June 2011|volume=5|issue=4|pages=337–349}}&lt;/ref&gt; that because snowball Earth would undoubtedly have decimated the population size of any given species, the extremely small populations that resulted would all have been descended from a small number of individuals (see [[founder effect]]), and consequently the average relatedness between any two individuals (in this case individual cells) would have been exceptionally high as a result of glaciations. Altruism is known to increase from rarity when relatedness (R) exceeds the ratio of the cost (C) to the altruist (in this case, the cell giving up its own reproduction by differentiating), to the benefit (B) to the recipient of altruism (the germ line of the colony, that reproduces as a result of the differentiation), i.e. R &gt; C/B (see [[Hamilton's rule]]). The evolutionary pressure of the high relatedness in the context of a post-glaciation population boom may have been sufficient to overcome the reproductive cost of forming a complex animal, for the first time in Earth's history.

There is also a rival hypothesis which has been gaining currency in recent years: that early snowball Earths did not so much ''affect'' the evolution of life on Earth as result from it. In fact the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The idea is that Earth's life forms affect the global carbon cycle and so major evolutionary events alter the carbon cycle, redistributing carbon within various reservoirs within the biosphere system and in the process temporarily lowering the atmospheric (greenhouse) carbon reservoir until the revised biosphere system settled into a new state. The Snowball I episode (of the [[Huronian glaciation]] 2.4 to 2.1 billion years) and Snowball II (of the Precambrian's [[Cryogenian]] between 580–850 million years and which itself had a number of distinct episodes) are respectively thought to be caused by the evolution of [[Carbon fixation#Oxygenic photosynthesis|oxygenic photosynthesis]] and then the rise of more advanced multicellular animal life and life's colonization of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, J., (2007) ''Climate Change: Biological and Human Aspects''.

=== Effects on ocean circulation ===
Global ice cover, if it existed, may—in concert with geothermal heating—have led to a lively, well mixed ocean with great vertical convective circulation.&lt;ref name="Ashkenazy2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ashkenazy | first1 = Y. | last2 = Gildor | first2 = H. | last3 = Losch | first3 = M. | last4 = MacDonald | first4 = F.

==Occurrence and timing==

===Neoproterozoic===
There were three or four significant ice ages during the late [[Neoproterozoic]]. Of these, the [[Marinoan glaciation|Marinoan]] was the most significant, and the [[Sturtian glaciation|Sturtian]] glaciations were also truly widespread.&lt;ref name=Stern2006&gt;{{cite journal

The status of the [[Kaigas]] "glaciation" or "cooling event" is currently unclear; some scientists do not recognise it as a glacial, others suspect that it may reflect poorly dated strata of Sturtian association, and others believe it may indeed be a third ice age.&lt;ref name=Smith2008&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = A.

Emerging evidence suggests that the Earth underwent a number of glaciations during the Neoproterozoic, which would stand strongly at odds with the snowball hypothesis.&lt;ref name=nature_geo/&gt;

In the absence of this methane greenhouse, temperatures plunged and a snowball event could have occurred.&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite journal

===Karoo Ice Age===
Before the theory of continental drift, glacial deposits in [[Carboniferous]] strata in tropical continents areas such as India and South America led to speculation that the [[Karoo Ice Age]] glaciation reached into the tropics. However, a continental reconstruction shows that ice was in fact constrained to the polar parts of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]].

{{Sociology}}
In [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[linguistics]], '''structuralism''' is the methodology that implies elements of human culture must be understood by way of their relationship to a broader, overarching system or structure. It works to uncover the structures that underlie all the things that humans do, think, perceive, and feel. Alternatively, as summarized by philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]], structuralism is "the belief of alien life that is not intelligible except through their interrelations. These relations constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract culture".&lt;ref name="Blackburn"&gt;Blackburn, Simon (2008). ''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy'', second edition revised. Oxford: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954143-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structuralism in Europe developed in the early 1900s, in the [[structural linguistics]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the subsequent [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague]],&lt;ref name=d170&gt;Deleuze, Gilles. 2002. "How Do We Recognise Structuralism?" In ''Desert Islands and Other Texts 1953-1974.'' Trans. David Lapoujade. Ed. Michael Taormina. Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents ser. Los Angeles and New York: Semiotext(e), 2004. 170–192. {{ISBN|1-58435-018-0}}: p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moscow linguistic circle|Moscow]]&lt;ref name="d170" /&gt; and [[The Copenhagen school (linguistics)|Copenhagen]] schools of linguistics. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, when structural linguistics was facing serious challenges from the likes of [[Noam Chomsky]] and thus fading in importance, an array of scholars in the [[humanities]] borrowed Saussure's concepts for use in their respective fields of study. French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] was arguably the first such scholar, sparking a widespread interest in structuralism.&lt;ref name="Blackburn"/&gt;

The structuralist mode of reasoning has been applied in a diverse range of fields, including [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[literary criticism]], [[structuralist economics|economics]] and [[structuralism (architecture)|architecture]]. The most prominent thinkers associated with structuralism include [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], linguist [[Roman Jakobson]], and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]]. As an intellectual movement, structuralism was initially presumed to be the heir apparent to [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://literariness.wordpress.com/2016/03/20/structuralism/|title=Structuralism|last=Mambrol|first=Nasrullah|date=2016-03-20|website=Literary Theory and Criticism Notes|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the late 1960s, many of structuralism's basic tenets came under attack from a new wave of predominantly French intellectuals such as the philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]], the philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]], the [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]] [[Louis Althusser]], and the literary critic [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name="d170"/&gt; Though elements of their work necessarily relate to structuralism and are informed by it, these theorists have generally been referred to as [[post-structuralists]]. In the 1970s, structuralism was criticized for its rigidity and [[ahistoricism]]. Despite this, many of structuralism's proponents, such as Lacan, continue to assert an influence on [[continental philosophy]] and many of the fundamental assumptions of some of structuralism's post-structuralist critics are a continuation of structuralism.&lt;ref name="Sturrock"&gt;John Sturrock (1979), ''Structuralism and since: from Lévi Strauss to Derrida'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The term "structuralism" is a related term that describes a particular philosophical/literary movement or moment. The term appeared in the works of [[French people|French]] [[anthropologist]] [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and gave rise in [[France]] to the "structuralist movement," which influenced the thinking of other writers such as [[Louis Althusser]], the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]], as well as the [[structural Marxism]] of [[Nicos Poulantzas]], most of whom disavowed themselves as being a part of this movement.
 
The origins of structuralism connect with the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] on [[linguistics]], along with the linguistics of the [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague]] and [[Moscow linguistic circle|Moscow]] schools. In brief, Saussure's structural linguistics propounded three related concepts.&lt;ref name="Blackburn"/&gt;
 
# Saussure argued for a distinction between ''langue'' (an idealized abstraction of language) and ''parole'' (language as actually used in daily life). He argued that the "sign" was composed of both a ''signified'', an abstract concept or idea, and a "signifier", the perceived sound/visual image.
# Because different languages have different words to describe the same objects or concepts, there is no intrinsic reason why a specific sign is used to express a given signifier. It is thus "arbitrary".
# Signs thus gain their meaning from their relationships and contrasts with other signs. As he wrote, "in language, there are only differences 'without positive terms.'"&lt;ref&gt;F. de Saussure, ''[[Course in General Linguistics|Cours de linguistique generale]]'', published by [[Charles Bally|C. Bally]] and [[Albert Sechehaye|A. Sechehaye]] (Paris: Payot, 1916); English translation by Wade Baskin, Course in General Linguistics (New York: Philosophical Library, 1959), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of structuralism would argue that a specific domain of culture may be understood by means of a structure—modelled on language—that is distinct both from the organizations of reality and those of ideas or the imagination—the "third order".&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, Gilles. 2002. "How Do We Recognise Structuralism?" In ''Desert Islands and Other Texts 1953-1974.'' Trans. David Lapoujade. Ed. Michael Taormina. Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents ser. Los Angeles and New York: Semiotext(e), 2004. 170–192. {{ISBN|1-58435-018-0}}: p. 171–173.&lt;/ref&gt; In Lacan's [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory, for example, the structural order of "[[the Symbolic]]" is distinguished both from "[[the Real]]" and "[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]]"; similarly, in Althusser's [[Structural Marxism|Marxist]] theory, the structural order of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is distinct both from the actual, real agents involved in its relations and from the [[Ideology|ideological]] forms in which those relations are understood.

Blending Freud and Saussure, the French (post)structuralist [[Jacques Lacan]] applied structuralism to [[psychoanalysis]] and, in a different way, [[Jean Piaget]] applied structuralism to the study of [[psychology]]. But Jean Piaget, who would better define himself as [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]], considers structuralism as "a method and not a doctrine" because for him "there exists no structure without a construction, abstract or genetic".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Piaget, ''Le structuralisme'', ed. PUF, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the French theorist [[Louis Althusser]] is often associated with a brand of structural [[Social theory|social analysis]] which helped give rise to "[[structural Marxism]]", such association was contested by Althusser himself in the Italian foreword to the second edition of ''[[Reading Capital]]''. In this foreword Althusser states the following:   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite the precautions we took to distinguish ourselves from the 'structuralist' ideology ..., despite the decisive intervention of categories foreign to 'structuralism' ..., the terminology we employed was too close in many respects to the 'structuralist' terminology not to give rise to an ambiguity. With a very few exceptions ... our interpretation of Marx has generally been recognized and judged, in homage to the current fashion, as 'structuralist'... We believe that despite the terminological ambiguity, the profound tendency of our texts was not attached to the 'structuralist' ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Althusser and [[Étienne Balibar]]. ''Reading Capital'' trans. Ben Brewster. London: NLB, 1970. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a later development, [[Feminist theory|feminist theorist]] [[Alison Assiter]] enumerated four ideas that she says are common to the various forms of structuralism. First, that a structure determines the position of each element of a whole. Second, that every system has a structure. Third, structural laws deal with co-existence rather than change. Fourth, structures are the "real things" that lie beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Assiter | first = Alison | title = Althusser and structuralism | journal = British Journal of Sociology | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 272–296 | date = June 1984  | url = http://www.lse.ac.uk/BJS/pastVolumes/vol35/index284.aspx | ref = harv | doi = 10.2307/590235| jstor = 590235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' the analysis focuses not on the ''use'' of language (called "''[[Langue and parole|parole]]''", or speech), but rather on the underlying [[system]] of language (called "''[[Langue and parole|langue]]''"). This approach examines how the elements of language relate to each other in the present, [[synchronic analysis|synchronically]] rather than [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]. Saussure argued that [[Sign (linguistics)|linguistic signs]] were composed of two parts:

# a "signifier" (the "sound pattern" of a word, either in mental projection—as when one silently recites lines from signage, a poem to one's self—or in actual, any kind of text, physical realization as part of a [[speech act]])
# a "signified" (the concept or meaning of the word)

This was quite different from previous approaches that focused on the relationship between words and the things in the world that they designate.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Suryo and Talbot Roosevelt, ''Landmarks in Linguistic Thought'', 1st ed. [1989], pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Other key notions in structural linguistics include [[paradigm]], syntagm, and value (though these notions were not fully developed in Saussure's thought). A structural "idealism" is a class of linguistic units ([[lexemes]], [[morphemes]] or even [[Pattern language|constructions]]) that are possible in a certain position in a given linguistic environment (such as a given sentence), which is called the "syntagm". The different functional role of each of these members of the paradigm is called "value" (''{{lang|fr|valeur}}'' in [[French language|French]]).

Saussure's ''Course'' influenced many linguists between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In the United States, for instance, [[Leonard Bloomfield]] developed his own version of structural linguistics, as did [[Louis Hjelmslev]] in Denmark and [[Alf Sommerfelt]] in Norway. In France [[Antoine Meillet]] and [[Émile Benveniste]] continued Saussure's project, and members of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague school]] of linguistics such as [[Roman Jakobson]] and [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] conducted research that would be greatly influential. However, by the 1950s Saussure's linguistic concepts were under heavy criticism and were soon largely abandoned by practicing linguists: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Saussure's views are not held, so far as I know, by modern linguists, only by literary critics and the occasional philosopher. [Strict adherence to Saussure] has elicited wrong film and literary theory on a grand scale. One can find dozens of books of literary theory bogged down in signifiers and signifieds, but only a handful that refer to [[Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Norman N. (1992) The Critical I, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-07650-9}}, p.&amp;nbsp;140.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The clearest and most important example of Prague school structuralism lies in [[phonemics]]. Rather than simply compiling a list of which sounds occur in a language, the Prague school sought to examine how they were related. They determined that the inventory of sounds in a language could be analysed in terms of a series of contrasts. Thus in English the sounds /p/ and /b/ represent distinct [[phonemes]] because there are cases ([[minimal pair]]s) where the contrast between the two is the only difference between two distinct words (e.g. 'pat' and 'bat'). Analyzing sounds in terms of [[Contrastive distribution|contrastive features]] also opens up comparative scope—it makes clear, for instance, that the difficulty [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speakers have differentiating /r/ and /l/ in [[English language|English]] is because these sounds are not contrastive in Japanese. [[Phonology]] would become the paradigmatic basis for structuralism in a number of different fields.

==In anthropology==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Social anthropology]] --&gt;
{{Main|Structural anthropology}}

According to structural theory in anthropology and social anthropology, [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] is produced and reproduced within a culture through various practices, phenomena and activities that serve as systems of signification. A structuralist approach may study activities as diverse as food-preparation and serving rituals, religious rites, games, literary and non-literary texts, and other forms of entertainment to discover the deep structures by which meaning is produced and reproduced within the culture. For example, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] analysed in the 1950s cultural phenomena including mythology, kinship (the [[alliance theory]] and the [[incest taboo]]), and food preparation. In addition to these studies, he produced more linguistically focused writings in which he applied Saussure's distinction between [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] in his search for the fundamental structures of the human mind, arguing that the structures that form the "deep grammar" of society originate in the mind and operate in people unconsciously. Lévi-Strauss took inspiration from [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;François Dosse, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UoXZ8aIeZpgC&amp;dq= ''History of Structuralism: Volume 1: The Rising Sign, 1945-1966''], University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concept used in structural anthropology came from the [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague school of linguistics]], where [[Roman Jakobson]] and others analysed sounds based on the presence or absence of certain features (such as voiceless vs. voiced). Lévi-Strauss included this in his conceptualization of the universal structures of the mind, which he held to operate based on pairs of [[binary opposition]]s such as hot-cold, male-female, culture-nature, cooked-raw, or marriageable vs. tabooed women.

A third influence came from [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872–1950), who had written on gift-exchange systems. Based on Mauss, for instance, Lévi-Strauss argued that kinship systems are based on the exchange of women between groups (a position known as 'alliance theory') as opposed to the 'descent'-based theory described by [[Edward Evans-Pritchard]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]. While replacing Marcel Mauss at his ''[[Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes]]'' chair, Lévi-Strauss' writing became widely popular in the 1960s and 1970s and gave rise to the term "structuralism" itself.

In Britain, authors such as [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]] were highly influenced by structuralism. Authors such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Emmanuel Terray]] combined [[Marxism]] with structural anthropology in France. In the United States, authors such as [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[James Boon]] built on structuralism to provide their own analysis of human society. Structural anthropology fell out of favour in the early 1980s for a number of reasons. D'Andrade suggests that this was because it made unverifiable assumptions about the universal structures of the human mind. Authors such as [[Eric Wolf]] argued that [[political economy]] and [[colonialism]] should be at the forefront of anthropology. More generally, criticisms of structuralism by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] led to a concern with how cultural and social structures were changed by human agency and practice, a trend which [[Sherry Ortner]] has referred to as '[[practice theory]]'.

Some anthropological theorists, however, while finding considerable fault with Lévi-Strauss's version of structuralism, did not turn away from a fundamental structural basis for human culture. The [[Biogenetic Structuralism]] group for instance argued that some kind of structural foundation for culture must exist because all humans inherit the same system of brain structures. They proposed a kind of [[neuroanthropology]] which would lay the foundations for a more complete scientific account of cultural similarity and variation by requiring an integration of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[neuroscience]]—a program that theorists such as [[Victor Turner]] also embraced.

== In literary theory and criticism ==
{{Main|Semiotic literary criticism}}
In [[literary theory]], structuralist criticism relates literary texts to a larger structure, which may be a particular [[genre]], a range of [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] connections, a model of a universal [[narrative structure]], or a system of recurrent patterns or motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, P. (2002), 'Structuralism', Beginning theory: an introduction to literary and cultural theory, Manchester University Press, Manchester, pp. 39–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evgeny Slavutin, [[Vladimir Pimonov]]: ‘Plot Structure’. Flinta - Nauka, Moscow 2018&lt;/ref&gt;Structuralism argues that there must be a structure in every text, which explains why it is easier for experienced readers than for non-experienced readers to interpret a text. Hence, everything that is written seems to be governed by specific rules, or a "grammar of literature", that one learns in educational institutions and that are to be unmasked.&lt;ref&gt;Selden, Raman / Widdowson, Peter / Brooker, Peter: ''A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Literary Theory'' Fifth Edition. Harlow: 2005. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential problem of structuralist interpretation is that it can be highly reductive, as scholar [[Catherine Belsey]] puts it: "the structuralist danger of collapsing all difference."&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey|Belsey, Catherine]]. "Literature, History, Politics". Literature and History 9 (1983): 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a reading might be if a student concludes the authors of ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' did not write anything "really" new, because their work has the same structure as Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. In both texts a girl and a boy fall in love (a "formula" with a symbolic operator between them would be "Boy '''+''' Girl") despite the fact that they belong to two groups that hate each other ("Boy's Group '''-''' Girl's Group" or "Opposing forces") and conflict is resolved by their death. Structuralist readings focus on how the structures of the single text resolve inherent narrative tensions. If a structuralist reading focuses on multiple texts, there must be some way in which those texts unify themselves into a coherent system. The versatility of structuralism is such that a literary critic could make the same claim about a story of two ''friendly'' families ("Boy's Family '''+''' Girl's Family") that arrange a marriage between their children despite the fact that the children hate each other ("Boy '''-''' Girl") and then the children commit suicide to escape the arranged marriage; the justification is that the second story's structure is an 'inversion' of the first story's structure: the relationship between the values of love and the two pairs of parties involved have been reversed.

Structuralistic literary criticism argues that the "literary banter of a text" can lie only in new structure, rather than in the specifics of character development and voice in which that structure is expressed. Literary structuralism often follows the lead of [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] in seeking out basic deep elements in stories, [[Mythology|myths]], and more recently, anecdotes, which are combined in various ways to produce the many versions of the ur-story or ur-myth.

There is considerable similarity between structural literary theory and [[Northrop Frye]]'s archetypal criticism, which is also indebted to the anthropological study of myths. Some critics have also tried to apply the theory to individual works, but the effort to find unique structures in individual literary works runs counter to the structuralist program and has an affinity with [[New Criticism]].

== History and background ==
Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, [[existentialism]], such as that propounded by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], was the dominant European intellectual movement. Structuralism rose to prominence in France in the wake of existentialism, particularly in the 1960s. The initial popularity of structuralism in France led to its spread across the globe.

Structuralism rejected the concept of human freedom and choice and focused instead on the way that human experience and thus, behaviour, is determined by various structures. The most important initial work on this score was [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s 1949 volume ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship''. Lévi-Strauss had known Jakobson during their time together at the [[The New School|New School]] in [[New York City|New York]] during [[World War II|WWII]] and was influenced by both Jakobson's structuralism as well as the American [[anthropology|anthropological]] tradition. In ''Elementary Structures'' he examined [[kinship]] systems from a structural point of view and demonstrated how apparently different social organizations were in fact different permutations of a few basic kinship structures. In the late 1950s he published ''[[Structural Anthropology]]'', a collection of essays outlining his program for structuralism.

By the early 1960s structuralism as a movement was coming into its own and some believed that it offered a single unified approach to human life that would embrace all disciplines. [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] focused on how structuralism could be applied to [[literature]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}{{Dubious|date=March 2011}}

The so-called "Gang of Four" of structuralism was Lévi-Strauss, Lacan, Barthes, and Foucault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthumref.libguides.com/content.php?pid=111224&amp;sid=837742 Post-Structuralism – LibGuides]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=March 2011}}

== Interpretations and general criticisms ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Philip Pettit]], [[Paul Ricœur]] and [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] --&gt;
Structuralism is less popular today than other approaches, such as [[post-structuralism]] and [[deconstruction]]. Structuralism has often been criticized for being ahistorical and for favouring deterministic structural forces over the ability of people to act. As the political turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s (and particularly the student uprisings of May 1968) began affecting academia, issues of power and political struggle moved to the center of people's attention.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Marshall (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rwDR3oSoWWAC&amp;dq= ''Poststructuralism, Philosophy, Pedagogy''], Springer, 2004, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, [[deconstruction]]—and its emphasis on the fundamental ambiguity of language rather than its crystalline logical structure—became popular. By the end of the century structuralism was seen as an historically important school of thought, but the movements that it spawned, rather than structuralism itself, commanded attention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Finlayson]] and Jeremy Valentine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dQMQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q= ''Politics and post-structuralism: an introduction''], Edinburgh University Press, 2002, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several social thinkers and academics have strongly criticized structuralism or even dismissed it ''in toto''. The French [[hermeneutic]] philosopher [[Paul Ricœur]] (1969) criticized Lévi-Strauss for constantly overstepping the limits of validity of the structuralist approach, ending up in what Ricœur described as "a [[Kantianism]] without a [[transcendental subject]]".&lt;ref&gt;P. Ricœur. (2004), ''The Conflict of Interpretations: Essays in Hermeneutics'' (originally published in French in 1969 as ''Le conflit des interprétations: Essais d’herméneutique''). Continuum, pp. 49, 78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[Adam Kuper]] (1973) argued that "'Structuralism' came to have something of the momentum of a millennial movement and some of its adherents felt that they formed a [[secret society]] of the seeing in a world of the blind. Conversion was not just a matter of accepting a new paradigm. It was, almost, a question of salvation."&lt;ref&gt;Kuper, Adam (1973), ''Anthropologists and Anthropology: The British School 1922–72'', Penguin, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Noel Pettit]] (1975) called for an abandoning of "the [[Positivism|positivist]] dream which Lévi-Strauss dreamed for [[semiology]]" arguing that semiology is not to be placed among the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, Philip (1975), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lQ5n3czwdZQC&amp;dq= ''The Concept of Structuralism: A Critical Analysis''], University of California Press, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] (1975) criticized structuralism as failing to explain [[Symbolic system|symbolic mediation]] in the social world;&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (1987), ''The Imaginary Institution of Society'' (originally published in French in 1975 as ''L'institution imaginaire de la société''). Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt; he viewed structuralism as a variation on the "[[Rationalism|logicist]]"&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; theme, and he argued that, contrary to what structuralists advocate, language—and symbolic systems in general—cannot be reduced to logical organizations on the basis of the [[Two-valued logic|binary logic]] of [[Square of opposition|oppositions]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (1997), ''The Imaginary: Creation in the Social-Historical Domain''. In: ''World in Fragments''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Critical theorist]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] (1985) accused structuralists, such as Foucault, of being positivists; he remarked that while Foucault is not an ordinary positivist, he nevertheless paradoxically uses the tools of science to criticize science&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, J. (1990), ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'' (originally published in German in 1985 as ''Der Philosophische Diskurs der Moderne''), MIT Press, 1990, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Performative contradiction#Usage in philosophy|Performative contradiction]]'' and ''[[Foucault–Habermas debate]]''). Sociologist [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]] (1993) is another notable critic; while Giddens draws on a range of structuralist themes in his theorizing, he dismisses the structuralist view that the reproduction of [[social system]]s is merely "a mechanical outcome".&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1993), ''New rules of sociological method: A positive critique of interpretative sociologies.'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Text linguistics''' is a branch of [[linguistics]] that deals with [[Textuality|text]]s as [[communication system]]s. Its original aims lay in uncovering and describing text [[grammar]]s. The application of text linguistics has, however, evolved from this approach to a point in which text is viewed in much broader terms that go beyond a mere extension of traditional grammar towards an entire text. Text linguistics takes into account the form of a text, but also its setting, i. e. the way in which it is situated in an interactional, communicative context. Both the author of a (written or spoken) text as well as its [[addressee]] are taken into consideration in their respective (social and/or institutional) roles in the specific communicative context. In general it is an application of [[discourse analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Trappes-Lomax, Hugh (2004) "Discourse analysis", in ''The Handbook of Applied Linguistics'' ed. by A. Davies &amp; C. Elder. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 133–64.&lt;/ref&gt; at the much broader level of text, rather than just a sentence or word.

==Introduction==
===Reasons for text linguistics===
Much attention has been given to the [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] as a self-contained unit, and not enough has been given to studying how sentences may be used in connected stretches of language. It is essentially the presentation of language as sets of sentences.

Text is extremely significant in [[human communication|communication]] because people communicate not by means of individual words or fragments of sentences in languages, but by means of texts. It is also the basis of various disciplines such as law, religion, medicine, science, politics, et cetera.&lt;ref name="sauduniversity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Al-Amri|first=K. H.|title=Text-linguistics for students of translation|url=http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/kamri/Pages/Text-linguistics.aspx|publisher=King Saud University|year=2007|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions===
"A text is an extended structure of [[syntactic unit]]s [i. e. text as super-sentence] such as words, groups, and clauses and textual units that is marked by both [[Coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] among the elements and completion ... [Whereas] a non-text consists of random sequences of linguistic units such as sentences, paragraphs, or sections in any temporal and/or spatial extension." (Werlich, 1976: 23)&lt;ref&gt;Werlich, E. (1976), ''A text grammar of English.'' Heidelberg: Quelle &amp; Meyer.&lt;/ref&gt;

"A naturally occurring manifestation of language, i. e. as a communicative language event in a context. The ''surface text'' is the set of expressions actually used; these expressions make some knowledge ''[[explicit knowledge|explicit]]'', while other knowledge remains ''[[implicit knowledge|implicit]]'', though still applied during processing." (Beaugrande and Dressler, 1981: 63)&lt;ref name='introtext'&gt; De Beaugrande, R., &amp; Dressler, W. U. (1981) ''Introduction to text linguistics'' / Robert-Alain De Beaugrande, Wolfgang Ulrich Dressler. London ; New York : Longman, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[A term] used in linguistics to refer to any passage- spoken or written, of whatever length, that does form a unified whole [….] A text is a unit of language in use. It is not a grammatical unit, like a [[clause]] or a sentence; and it is not defined by its size [….] A text is best regarded as a ''semantic'' unit; a unit not of form but of meaning." (Halliday and Hasan, 1976: 1–2)&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Hasan, R. (1976)  "'Cohesion in English London: Longman'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

"A text is made up of sentences, but there exist separate principles of text-construction, beyond the rules for making sentences." (Fowler, 1991: 59)&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fowler. (1991) ''Language in the News: Discourse and Ideology in the Press.'' London/ New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[Text is] a set of mutually relevant communicative functions, structured in such a way as to achieve an overall [[rhetorical]] purpose." (Hatim and Mason, 1990)&lt;ref&gt;Hatim, Basil &amp; Ian Mason. (1990) ''Discourse and the Translator''. London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

Text linguists generally agree that text is the natural domain of language, but they still differ in their perspectives of what constitutes a text. This variance is mainly due to the different methods of observations of different linguists, and as such, the definition of text is not yet concrete.&lt;ref name="sauduniversity" /&gt;

===Significance of contexts===
There is a text and there is other text that accompanies it: text that is 'with', namely the [[context (language use)|con-text]]. This notion of what is 'with the text', however, goes beyond what is said and written: it includes other non-verbal signs-on-the total environment in which a text unfolds. (Halliday and Hasan, 1985: 5)&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK and R Hasan. (1985) ''Language, Context, and Text: Aspects of Language in a Social-Semiotic Perspective''. Geelong: Deakin University.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Halliday, text is a sign representation of a socio-cultural event embedded in a context of situation. Context of situation is the [[semiotics|semio]]-socio-cultural environment in which the text unfolds. Text and context are so intimately related that neither concept can be comprehended in the absence of the other.

===Three features of context of situation===

====The field of discourse – experiential meaning====
This is the meaning that the social actions and the engagements of the participants are giving to the understanding of the text.&lt;ref name=kavcic&gt;Kavcic, A. (2008) ''Text linguistics''. Informally published manuscript, English and German Studies, Retrieved from www.englistika.info/podatki/3_letnik/besediloslovje-I-izpiski.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

====The tenor of discourse – interpersonal meaning====
This is the meaning that the roles of and relationships among participants give to the understanding of the text. These relationships may be permanent or temporary. The contribution to meaning by social statuses of the participants also fall within this feature.&lt;ref name=kavcic /&gt;

====The mode of discourse – logical meaning====
This is the meaning that the language, written or spoken, gives to the understanding of the text. This includes the symbolic organization of the text, as well as its intended function within the context.&lt;ref name=kavcic /&gt;

===Texture ===
Texture is the basis for unity and semantic interdependence within text. Any text that lacks texture would simply be a bunch of isolated sentences that have no relationship to each other. (Crane, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=A. Crane|first=Paul|title=Texture in Text: A Discourse Analysis  of a News Article Using  Halliday and Hasan’s Model of Cohesion|url=http://library.nakanishi.ac.jp/kiyou/gaidai(30)/08.pdf|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature of texture is "sequential implicativeness", as suggested by Schegloff and Sacks (1974). This refers to the property of language such that each line in a text is linked from or linked to the previous line. As such, language contains a linear sequence and this linear progression of text creates a context of meaning.&lt;ref name='ss'&gt;Schegloff, E.A. and Sacks, H. (1974) "Opening up Closings", ''Semiotica'' 7(4): 289–327 (reprinted in Turner, R 1974 "'Ethnomethodology: selected readings,'" Harmondsworth: Penguin)&lt;/ref&gt; This contextual meaning, at the paragraph level is referred to as "coherence", while the internal properties of meaning are referred to as "cohesion". (Eggins, 1994: 85)&lt;ref name='eggins'&gt;Eggins, S. (1994) ''An Introduction to Systemic Functional Linguistics'' London: Pinter&lt;/ref&gt; There are two aspects of coherence, namely, "situational" coherence and "generic" coherence. There is situational coherence when field, tenor, and mode can be identified for a certain group of clauses. On the other hand, there is generic coherence when the text can be recognized as belonging to a certain genre. Thereby, cohesion is the result of "semantic ties", which refers to the dependent links between items within a text. These ties come together to create meaning. Texture is, therefore, created within text when the properties of coherence and cohesion are present.

===Text types===
Most linguists agree on the classification into five text-types: narrative, descriptive, argumentative, instructive, and comparison/contrast (also called expositive). Some classifications divide the types of texts according to their function. Others differ because they take into consideration the topic of the texts, the producer and the addressee, or the style. Adam and Petitjean, (1989) proposed analyzing of overlaps of different text types with text sequences. Virtanen (1992) establishes a double classification (discourse type and text type) to be used when the Identification text-text type is not straightforward.&lt;ref name="lopezmedina"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medina|first=Beatriz López|title=The role of text linguistics in the foreign language class|journal=Encuentro Revista de investigación e innovación en la clase de idiomas|year=2002/2003|pages=148–156|url=http://www.encuentrojournal.org/textos/13.14.pdf|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
As a science of text, text linguistics describes or explains among different types of text the:
* Shared features
* Distinct features
Text linguistics is the study of how texts function in human interaction. Beaugrande and Dressler define a text as a “communicative occurrence which meets seven standards of textuality” – Cohesion, Coherence, Intentionality, Acceptability, Informativity, Situationality and Intertextuality, without any of which the text will not be communicative. Non-communicative texts are treated as non-texts.&lt;ref name=introtext /&gt;

===Cohesion===
Surface texts are the exact words that people see or hear. [[Cohesion (linguistics)|Cohesion]] concerns the ways in which the components of the surface text are connected within a sequence. Grammatical forms and conventions are adhered to by surface components and therefore cohesion rests upon grammatical dependencies. The grammatical dependencies in surface texts are major signals for sorting out meanings and uses. Cohesion encompasses all of the functions that can be used to signal relations among surface elements.
{{cquote| SLOW &lt;br&gt;
CARS &lt;br&gt;
HELD UP}}
Such a text can be divided up into various dependencies. Someone might construe it as a notice about "slow cars" that are "held up", so that conclusions could be drawn about the need to drive fast to avoid being held up. However, it is more likely for one to divide the text into "slow" and "cars held up', so that drivers will drive slowly to avoid accidents or take alternative routes to avoid being caught in the slow traffic. A science of text should explain how [[ambiguities]] such as this are possible, as well as how they are precluded or resolved without much difficulty. For efficient communication to take place there must be interaction between cohesion and other standards of textuality because the surface alone is not decisive.

===Coherence===
[[Coherence (linguistics)|Coherence]] concerns the ways in which concepts and relations, which underlie the surface text, are linked, relevant and used, to achieve efficient communication.
* A concept is a cognitive content which can be retrieved or triggered with a high degree of [[consistency]] in the mind
* Relations are the links between concepts within a text, with each link identified with the concept that it connects to
Surface texts may not always express relations explicitly therefore people supply as many relations as are needed to make sense out of any particular text. In the example of the road sign "SLOW CARS HELD UP', "cars" is an object concept and "held up" an action concept, and the "cars" are the link to "held up'. Therefore, "slow" is more likely to be interpreted as a motion than as the speed at which cars are travelling.
Types of relations include:

;I. [[Causality]]: {{quote|"Itsy Bitsy spider climbing up the spout. Down came the rain and washed the spider out."}} The event of "raining" causes the event of "washing the spider out" because it creates the necessary conditions for the latter; without the rain, the spider will not be washed out.

;II. Enablement: {{quote|"Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall."}} The action of sitting on the wall created the necessary but not sufficient conditions for the action of falling down. Sitting on a wall makes it possible but not obligatory for falling down to occur.

;III. Reason: {{quote|"Jack shall have but a penny a day because he can't work any faster."}} In contrast to the rain which causes Itsy Bitsy spider to be washed out, the slow working does not actually cause or enable the low wage. Instead, the low wage is a reasonable outcome; "reason" is used to term actions that occur as a rational response to a previous event.

;IV. Purpose: {{quote|"Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard to get her poor dog a bone."}} In contrast to Humpty Dumpty's action of sitting on the wall which enables the action of falling down, there is a plan involved here; Humpty Dumpty did not sit on the wall so that it could fall down but Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard so that she could get a bone. "Purpose" is used to term events that are planned to be made possible via a previous event.

;V. Time: 
"Cause", "enablement" and "reason" have forward directionality with the earlier event causing, enabling or providing reason for the later event. "Purpose', however, has a backward directionality as the later event provides the purpose for the earlier event.

More than just a feature of texts, coherence is also the outcome of cognitive processes among text users. The nearness and proximity of events in a text will trigger operations which recover or create coherence relations.
:{{quote|"The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts;&lt;br&gt;The Knave of Hearts, he stole the tarts; &lt;br&gt;The King of Hearts, called for the tarts."}}

In the explicit text, there is a set of actions (making, stealing and calling); the only relations presented are the agent and the affected entity of each action. However, a text receiver is likely to assume that the locations of all three events are close to one another as well as occur in a continuous and relatively short time frame. One might also assume that the actions are meant to signal the attributes of the agents; the Queen is skilled in cooking, the Knave is dishonest and the King is authoritative. As such, coherence encompasses inferencing based on one's knowledge.

For a text to make sense, there has to be interaction between one's accumulated knowledge and the text-presented knowledge. Therefore, a science of texts is probabilistic instead of deterministic, that is, inferences by users of any particular text will be similar most of the time instead of all of the time. Most text users have a common core of cognitive composition, engagement and process such that their interpretations of texts through "sensing" are similar to what text senders intend them to be. Without cohesion and coherence, communication would be slowed down and could break down altogether. Cohesion and coherence are text-centred notions, designating operations directed at the text materials.

===Intentionality===
Intentionality concerns the text producer's attitude and intentions as the text producer uses cohesion and coherence to attain a goal specified in a plan. Without cohesion and coherence, intended goals may not be achieved due to a breakdown of communication. However, depending on the conditions and situations in which the text is used, the goal may still be attained even when cohesion and coherence are not upheld.
{{cquote| "'Want I carry you on my back?'" }}
Even though cohesion is not maintained in this example, the text producer still succeeds in achieving the goal of finding out if the text receiver wanted a piggyback.

===Acceptability===
Acceptability concerns the text receiver's attitude that the text should constitute useful or relevant details or information such that it is worth accepting. Text type, the desirability of goals and the political and sociocultural setting, as well as cohesion and coherence are important in influencing the acceptability of a text.

Text producers often speculate on the receiver's attitude of acceptability and present texts that maximizes the probability that the receivers will respond as desired by the producers. For example, texts that are open to a wide range of interpretations, such as "Call us before you dig. You may not be able to afterwards," require more inferences about the related consequences. This is more effective than an explicit version of the message that informs receivers the full consequences of digging without calling because receivers are left with a large amount of uncertainty as to the consequences that could result; this plays to the risk averseness of people.

===Informativity===
[[Informativity]] concerns the extent to which the contents of a text are already known or expected as compared to unknown or unexpected. No matter how expected or predictable content may be, a text will always be informative at least to a certain degree due to unforeseen variability. The processing of highly informative text demands greater cognitive ability but at the same time is more interesting. The level of informativity should not exceed a point such that the text becomes too complicated and communication is endangered. Conversely, the level of informativity should also not be so low that it results in boredom and the rejection of the text.

===Situationality===
[[Situationality]] concerns the factors which make a text relevant to a situation of occurrence. The situation in which a text is exchanged influences the comprehension of the text. There may be different interpretations with the road sign
{{cquote|SLOW &lt;br&gt;
CARS&lt;br&gt;
HELD UP}}
However, the most likely interpretation of the text is obvious because the situation in which the text is presented provides the context which influences how text receivers interpret the text. The group of receivers (motorists) who are required to provide a particular action will find it more reasonable to assume that "slow" requires them to slow down rather than referring to the speed of the cars that are ahead. Pedestrians can tell easily that the text is not directed towards them because varying their speeds is inconsequential and irrelevant to the situation. In this way, the situation decides the sense and use of the text.

Situationality can affect the means of cohesion; less cohesive text may be more appropriate than more cohesive text depending on the situation. If the road sign was "Motorists should reduce their speed and proceed slowly because the vehicles ahead are held up by road works, therefore proceeding at too high a speed may result in an accident', every possible doubt of intended receivers and intention would be removed. However, motorists only have a very short amount of time and attention to focus on and react to road signs. Therefore, in such a case, economical use of text is much more effective and appropriate than a fully cohesive text.

===Intertextuality===
[[Intertextuality]] concerns the factors which make the utilization of one text dependent upon knowledge of one or more previously encountered text. If a text receiver does not have prior knowledge of a relevant text, communication may break down because the understanding of the current text is obscured. Texts such as parodies, rebuttals, forums and classes in school, the text producer has to refer to prior texts while the text receivers have to have knowledge of the prior texts for communication to be efficient or even occur. In other text types such as puns, for example "Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana', there is no need to refer to any other text.

===Robert-Alain de Beaugrande===
[[Robert-Alain de Beaugrande]] was a text linguist and a discourse analyst, one of the leading figures of the Continental tradition in the discipline. He was one of the developers of the Vienna School of Textlinguistik (Department of Linguistics at the University of Vienna), and published the seminal ''Introduction to Text Linguistics'' in 1981, with [[Wolfgang U. Dressler]]. He was also a major figure in the consolidation of critical discourse analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beaugrande|first=Robert de|title=Robert de Beaugrande Homepage|url=http://www.beaugrande.com/|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to language learning==

Text linguistics stimulates reading by arousing interest in texts or novels. Increases background knowledge on literature and on different kinds of publications. Writing skills can be improved by familiarizing and duplicating specific text structures and the use of specialized vocabulary.&lt;ref name="lopezmedina" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6915">'''The Global Media Monitoring Project''' (GMMP) is the largest international study of gender in the news media. It is also an advocacy organization that aims to change the representation of women in the news media. Every five years since 1995 the GMMP collects data on indicators of gender in the news, such as: the presence of women, gender bias, and stereotyping. The most recent study, conducted in 2015, encompassed 114 countries.&lt;ref name=Who_makes&gt;{{cite web | title = Who makes the news? | url = http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp | publisher = [[World Association for Christian Communication]] | accessdate = 23 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea for a media monitoring project was created at the Women Empowering Communication international conference in Bangkok in 1994. The [[World Association for Christian Communication|World Association for Christian Communication (WACC)]] along with MediaWatch (Canada) took up the project. They had several key goals:
*To map the representation and portrayal of women in the world’s mainstream news media
*To develop a grassroots research instrument
*To build solidarity among gender and communication groups worldwide
*To create media awareness
*To develop media monitoring skills on an international level&lt;ref name=Who_makes2&gt;{{cite web | title = Who makes the news?: Beginnings, GMMP 1995 | url = http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp | publisher = [[World Association for Christian Communication]] | accessdate = 18 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coverage'''

The 1995 Report covered 71 countries, and was conducted by volunteers over the span of one day. Consequent studies took place in 2000 and covered 70 countries, in 2005 covering 76 countries, in 2010 in 108 countries and in 2015 in 114 countries. All of the monitoring and compiling of reports is carried out by volunteers. GMMP reports have been presented at the Women’s NGO Forum in Beijing (1995), the UN Beijing + 5 (2000), a parallel-session at the Commission on the Status of Women 2010 session, and in 100 Women BBC series 2015 "Is News Failing Women?".&lt;ref name=Who_makes2 /&gt;

==2015 Report==

The 2015 Project covered 22,136 news items, 26,010 news personnel, and 45,402 total news subjects in newspaper, radio, television, internet news and news media tweets.  The research discussed news subjects, personnel and content through the framework of media accountability to women .&lt;ref name=Exec&gt;{{citation | last = Macharia | first = Sarah | title = Who makes the news? Global media monitoring project (GMMP) 2015 | page = 12 | publisher = [[World Association for Christian Communication]] | location = Toronto | year = 2015 | url = http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp/gmmp-reports/gmmp-2015-reports | ref = harv | postscript = . |oclc=833313633}} [http://cdn.agilitycms.com/who-makes-the-news/Imported/reports_2015/global/gmmp_global_report_en.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''News Subjects'''

The report discovered that progress towards gender parity in the news has almost ground to a halt over the period 2010 to 2015: Women make up only 24% of the persons heard, read about or seen in newspaper, television and radio news, exactly as they did in 2010. Over the past two decades, the gender gap in people in the news has narrowed most dramatically in Latin America by 13 percent.  Women are three percent less visible in political news stories now than five years ago. They comprise 38% of people interviewed on the basis of personal experience compared to 31% in 2005. North America has the highest percentage of women experts in the news (32%), followed by the Caribbean (29%) and Latin America (29%). In 2015, progress towards news representation that acknowledges women's participation in economic life remain elusive: While women in the real world hold at least 40% of paid employment globally, in the news world only 20% of the workers in the formal labor force are women, while 67% of the news world unemployed and stay-at-home parents are women. Portrayals of women as survivors of domestic violence have risen by more than four times across the period 2005 to 2015.&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt;

'''Reporters and Presenters'''

The 2015 GMMP detected what appears to be a global glass ceiling for female news reporters as far as they are visible in newspaper bylines and newscast reports. Women have consistently reported only 37% of the news over the past decade from 2005 to 2015. Women as news reporters are most present on radio, at 41%, and least in print news, at 35%. Younger presenters on screen are predominantly female, but the scales tip dramatically at 50 years old when men begin to dominate the news-anchoring scene. At 65 years and older, women disappear from the screen as reporters and presenters.&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt;

'''News Content'''

9% of stories overall contain reference to legal, rights or policy frameworks, with social and legal stories making the highest contribution to the global average. A rights angle is barely present is political and economic stories. 97% of political stories in Asia, 98% of economic stories in the Pacific region and the Middle East perform poorly on the rights-focus yardstick. 14% of stories by female reporters focus centrally on women, in contrast to 9% of stories by their male counterparts. 9% of stories evoke gender equality or inequality issues, more than double the percentage documented in 2005. Only 4% of stories clearly challenge gender stereotypes, a one percent change since 2005.&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt;

'''Digital News'''

Women's relative invisibility in traditional news media has crossed over into digital news delivery platforms: Only 26% of the people in internet news stories and media news tweets combined are women. Women report five percent more stories online than in the traditional mediums combined: 42% of online news are reported by women. Gender difference in source selection by female and male reporters becomes starker in online news: Women are 33% of sources in stories by online news female reporters, compared to 23% in stories by men. Only 4% of news media tweets clearly challenge gender stereotypes, exactly similar to the overall percentage of print, radio and television stories that challenge such stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt;

==Implications==

The GMMP 1995 - 2015 findings paint a picture in which unequal gender power relations are entrenched and validated, and in which gender stereotypes are replicated and reinforced by the world's news media.

That the patterns of underrepresentation, misrepresentation and invisibilization of women have continued into the digital news world show that the problem is deeply entrenched in the mainstream news media system irrespective of the platform through which news are channeled.

[[File:Zenodo logo.jpg|thumb|]]
'''Siddham''' or the '''Asia Inscriptions Database''' is an open-access resource for the study of inscriptions from South, Central and South East Asia. Siddham was established by the [[European Research Council]] with start-up funding from the project [[Beyond Boundaries: Religion, Region, Language and the State]].  The first focus of Siddham is [[Sanskrit]] [[epigraphy]], mainly of the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries CE, but the platform is designed to accommodate inscriptions from all periods. In South Asia alone, the estimated number of historic inscriptions is 90,000.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, Richard. ''Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In its next phases, Siddham will expand to include inscriptions in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]], [[Prakrit]], [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]] and [[Mon language|Mon]]. 

==Etymology==
In [[Sanskrit]] ''siddhaṃ'' means "success, accomplished, perfected." It was also symbolism and substitution for an "auspicious sign" found in the oldest inscriptions of the South Asia. In some cases, siddham is not spelled out, but indicated with a sign such as ''[[Om]]'' or a ''srivasta'', and various scholars consider ''siddham'' in inscriptions to be equivalent to these signs.&lt;ref name="Salomon1998p67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lore Sander (1986), ''Om or Siddham–Remarks on Openings of Buddhist Manuscripts and Inscriptions from Gilgit and Central Asia'', in Deyadharma: Studies in Memory of Dr. DC Sircar, pages 251-261&lt;/ref&gt;

This word, written out in characters (such as those shown in the Siddham logo) or represented by a symbol, often stands at the beginning of inscriptions in Indic languages.&lt;ref name="Salomon1998p67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Salomon|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA67 |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-535666-3|pages=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Siddham'' is also used as a short name for the Indian script known as [[Siddhaṃ_script|siddhamātṛkā]].

==Technical background==
The records in Siddham have been prepared in [[EpiDoc]], a tool for structured [[markup language|markup]] of [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] documents in [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] [[XML]]. 

==Numbering system==
Within Siddham, each item is listed firstly as an object -- such as a pillar, sculpture, copper-plate, stone slab and so forth. Each object may carry one or more inscriptions, thus each inscription has been assigned a separate Siddham number. A good example is the [[Allahabad pillar]] -- a single object -- which carries many inscriptions, among them those of Aśoka, [[Samudragupta]] and Jahāngīr.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Harry. ''Aśokan Sites and Artefacts: A Source-Book with Bibliography''. Mainz am Rhein: Ph. von Zabern, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription of Samdragupta appears in Siddham as IN00001.&lt;ref&gt;See: http://siddham.uk/object/ob00001&lt;/ref&gt; All material generated for SIDDHAṂ is archived in [[Zenodo]].

The further example illustrated here is from [[Salihundam]], Gara Mandal, Srikakulam district, [[Andhra Pradesh]], India, a Buddhist place located approximately at 18°20'7"N 84°2'28"E. At this site, a series of five votive inscriptions are engraved on the semi-circular threshold of a ruined shrine. In Siddham, the semi-circular stone will carry an object number and each votive record an independent inscription number. The photograph of the inscriptions is archived as Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.557032.
[[File:Salihundam votive inscriptions.jpg|thumb|Salihundam, Andhra Pradesh. Votive inscriptions. In SIDDHAṂ the semi-circular threshold will have an object number, and each votive record an inscription number.]]

[[File:Erc-logo.jpg|thumb|]]
==Translations==
Translations of inscription texts into western languages appear separately in the community called '''SIDDHAṂ traductions''' in [[Zenodo]]. Each translation is numbered according to the inscription number assigned in Siddham.

Epigraphic documentation involves mapping sites of key dynasties and their inscriptions, especially land-charters recording gifts of land. The mapping undertaken to date can be explored through these links:

The '''University of Helsinki''' ({{lang-fi|Helsingin yliopisto}}, {{lang-sv|Helsingfors universitet}}, {{lang-la|Universitas Helsingiensis}}, abbreviated '''UH''') is a university located in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] since 1829, but was founded in the city of [[Turku]] (in Swedish ''Åbo'') in 1640 as the ''[[Royal Academy of Åbo]]'', at that time part of the [[Swedish Empire]]. It is the oldest and largest university in Finland with the widest range of disciplines available. Around 36,500 students are currently enrolled in the degree programs of the university spread across 11 faculties and 11 research institutes.

As of 1 August 2005, the university complies with the harmonized structure of the Europe-wide [[Bologna Process]] and offers Bachelor, Master, [[Licenciate]], and [[Doctorate|Doctoral degrees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/tutkinnonuudistus/materiaalit/raportit/Bologna_review_20041122.pdf|title=Bologna Process at the University of Helsinki|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172641/http://www.helsinki.fi/tutkinnonuudistus/materiaalit/raportit/Bologna_review_20041122.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to degree programmes is usually determined by entrance examinations, in the case of bachelor's degrees, and by prior degree results, in the case of master and postgraduate degrees.  Entrance is particularly selective (circa 15% of the yearly applicants are admitted). It has been ranked a top 100 university in the world according to the 2016 ARWU, QS and THE rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/Institution.jsp?param=University%20of%20Helsinki |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118045130/http://www.shanghairanking.com/Institution.jsp?param=University%20of%20Helsinki |archive-date=18 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings|title=World University Rankings|work=Top Universities|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-of-helsinki?ranking-dataset=133819|title=World University Rankings 2016|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is bilingual, with teaching by law provided both in Finnish and Swedish. Since Swedish, albeit an official language of Finland, is a minority language, Finnish is by far the dominating language at the university. Teaching in English is extensive throughout the university at Master, Licentiate, and Doctoral levels, making it a ''de facto'' third language of instruction.

Remaining true to its traditionally strong [[Humboldtian model of higher education|Humboldtian]] ethos, the University of Helsinki places heavy emphasis on high-quality teaching and research of a top international standard.&lt;ref&gt;''Helsingin Sanomat'', International Edition – Metro, 2.3.2006. "Assay finds research at University of Helsinki is of high international standard".[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Assay+finds+research+at+University+of+Helsinki+is+of+high+international+standard/1135218988844]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of various prominent international university networks, such as [[Europaeum]], [[Institutional Network of the Universities from the Capitals of Europe|UNICA]],&lt;ref&gt;UNICA = "Institutional Network of the Universities from the Capitals of Europe".&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Utrecht Network]], and is a founding member of the [[League of European Research Universities]].

==History==

[[File:Unioninkatu 34.jpg|thumb|330px|University of Helsinki (Main Building)|right]]
{{For|the early history (1640-1809)|Royal Academy of Turku}}

===Royal Academy of Åbo 1640–1828===
{{main|Royal Academy of Turku}}
The first predecessor of the university, [[Katedralskolan i Åbo|The Cathedral School of Åbo]], was presumably founded in 1276 for education of boys to become servants of the Church. As the university was founded in 1640 by [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] (1626–1689) in [[Turku]] (Sw. Åbo), as the [[Royal Academy of Turku|Åbo Kungliga Akademi]] ({{lang-la|Regia Academia Aboensis}}), the senior part of the school formed the core of the new university, while the junior year courses formed a grammar school. It was the third [[university]] founded in the [[Swedish Empire]], following [[Uppsala University]] and the [[Academia Gustaviana]] in [[Tartu|Dorpat]] (predecessor to the [[University of Tartu]] in [[Estonia]]).

===Imperial Alexander University in Finland 1828–1919===
The second period of the university's history covers the period when Finland was a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire, from 1809 to 1917. As Finland became part of the Russian Empire in 1809, [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I]] expanded the university and allocated substantial funds to it. Following the [[Great Fire of Turku]] in 1827, higher education within the country was moved to Helsinki, the new administrative heart of the Grand Duchy, in 1828, and renamed the ''Imperial Alexander University in Finland'' in honour of the late benefactor of the university. In the capital the primary task of the university was to educate the Grand Duchy’s civil servants.

The university became a community subscribing to the new [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldtian]] ideals of science and culture, studying humanity and its living environment by means of scientific methods. The new statutes of the university enacted in 1828 defined the task of the university as promoting the development of “the Sciences and Humanities within Finland and, furthermore, educating the youth for the service of the Emperor and the Fatherland”.

The Alexander University was a centre of national life that promoted the birth of an independent Finnish State and the development of Finnish identity. The great men of 19th century Finland, [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]], [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]], [[Elias Lönnrot]] and [[Zachris Topelius]], were all involved in the activities of the university. The university became a major center of Finnish cultural, political, and legal life in 19th century Finland, and became a remarkable ''primum mobile'' of the nationalist and liberal cultural movements, political parties, and student organisations.

In the 19th century university research changed from being collection-centred to being experimental, empirical, and analytical. The more scientific approach of the university led to specialisation and created new disciplines. As the scientific disciplines developed, Finland received ever more scholarly knowledge and highly educated people, some of whom entered rapidly evolving industry or the government.

===University of Helsinki 1919–present===
The third period of the university's history began with the creation of the independent Republic of Finland in 1917, and with the renaming of the university as the ''University of Helsinki''. Once Finland gained her independence in 1917 the university was given a crucial role in building the nation state and, after [[World War II]], the welfare state. Members of the academic community promoted the international relations of the new state and the development of its economic life. Furthermore, they were actively involved in national politics and the struggle for equality.

In the [[interwar period]] the university was the scene of a conflict between those who wanted to advance the usage of Finnish language in the university, to the detriment of Swedish and those who opposed such move.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-Universitetsadresserna |title=Universitetsadresserna |last=Sundman |first=Lasse  |date=24 April 2011 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=30 November 2017 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographer [[Väinö Tanner (geographer)|Väinö Tanner]] was one of the most vocal defenders of Swedish language usage.&lt;ref name=UppslagsverketFi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-TannerVaeinoe |title=Tanner, Väinö |last=Lindberg |first=Johan  |date=5 August 2011 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=30 November 2017 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]] initiated a campaign collecting 153 914 signatures in defense of the Swedish language that were handed to the parliament and government in October 1934.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv/&gt; On an international front academics from Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland sent letters to the diplomatic representations of Finland in their respective countries warning about a weakening of the Nordic unity that would result from diminishing the role of Swedish in the University of Helsinki.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv/&gt;

In the 20th century, scholarly research at the University of Helsinki reached the level of the European elite in many disciplines. This was manifested, among other things, by international recognitions granted to its professors, such as the [[Fields Medal]] received by the mathematician [[Lars Ahlfors]] (1936), the Nobel Prize in Chemistry granted to Professor [[A.I. Virtanen]] (1945) and the Nobel Prize in Medicine shared by Professor [[Ragnar Granit]] (1967).

After World War II, University research focused on improving Finnish living conditions and supporting major changes in the structure of society and business. The university also contributed to the breakthrough of modern technology.{{vague|date=December 2011}}{{examples|date=December 2011}}

The progress of scientific development created many new disciplines and faculties at the University of Helsinki. At present the university comprises 11 faculties, 500 professors and almost 40,000 students. The university has established as its goal to further its position as one of Europe’s top multidisciplinary research universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/yliopistonhistoria/english/imperal.htm|title=University of Helsinki|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==

[[File:Main Auditorium, Helsinki University.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Main Auditorium, University of Helsinki]]
The university is located on four main [[campus]]es. Originally, the entire university was located in the very centre of Helsinki, but due to the rapid growth of the university since the 1930s, premises have been built and acquired in other areas.

===City Centre Campus===
The historical [[City Centre Campus]] has been the hub of activity ever since the university moved from Turku to Helsinki in the early 19th century. The campus has a central location and reflects the architectural style of this part of the city. The university buildings in the city center house the Faculties of Theology, Law, Arts, Behavioural Sciences and Social Sciences plus administrative functions. Most of the buildings on the campus have a major architectural significance ranging from the dominating Neo-Classical, through the Jugendstil, to 20th century Modernism.
[[File:Helsinki--Psyc Department.jpg|thumb|Minerva, Department of Teacher Education]]
The City Centre Campus, extending around the historical centre of Helsinki, Senate Square, and Kruununhaka city district, is the administrative heart of the University of Helsinki and has the largest concentration of faculties in Helsinki.

After the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, Emperor Nicholas I ordered the Royal Academy of Turku be moved to the new capital city of the Grand Duchy of Finland, Helsinki, where the Imperial Alexander University in Finland began to operate the next year. Helsinki was to become Finland's window to the world; a European city to which the university belonged as an integral part. [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], architect, was given the assignment of designing an Empire-style main building next to Senate Square, facing the Imperial Senate. The main building was completed in 1832. Thanks to the lessons learnt from the fire of Turku, the library was built separate from other premises. The library and several faculty buildings in the campus were also designed by Engel.

[[File:HU-main-building-1944b.jpg|thumb|University Main Building on fire after Soviet bombings in 1944.]]
The main building as well as other buildings of the campus were badly damaged during the [[Bombing of Helsinki in World War II|Soviet bombings in World War II]] but rebuilt after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museo.helsinki.fi/yliopiston_historia/pommitus.htm|title=Helsingin suurpommitukset ja yliopisto|author=Kati Heinämies|language=fi|publisher=Helsinki University Museum Arppeanum|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan concerning the concentration of university facilities dating back to the 1980s, aimed to achieve a closer unity between facilities. The City Centre Campus does not stand out from the rest of the urban environment but is a part of the city, in line with the old university tradition. The university facilities still form a functional and coherent whole, consisting not only of historically valuable buildings, but also of facilities for 20,000 students and 3,000 teachers and other staff.

===Kumpula Campus===
The [[Kumpula Campus]], housing the Faculty of Science, is located four kilometers north from the centre of Helsinki near tram lines 6 and 8. The campus houses the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, Computer Science, and Geosciences and Geography.

The university departments were located in Kumpula for the first time in 1978 when the City of Helsinki leased the area for the university. A planning competition for the city plan for the area was held a year earlier. In the 1980s, the Accelerator Laboratory of the Department of Physics was quarried into Kumpula rock and the construction of Kumpula Botanical Garden began in 1987. It was not, however, until the 1990s when the construction work proper began, transforming the area into a significant campus.
[[File:Kumpula Campus Physicum.jpg|thumb|Kumpula Campus Physicum]]
The Chemicum, the building housing the Department of Chemistry and VERIFIN (Finnish Institute for Verification of the Chemical Weapons Convention), and the Physicum, which provides facilities for physics, geology and geography are located on Kumpula campus surrounding a square named after the Finnish Nobel prize winner, A. I. Virtanen. Kumpula Campus Library is also located in the Physicum. The Kumpula Sports Centre is planned for the recreational use of both university staff and students and citizens of Helsinki alike. Completed in 2004, the Exactum provides facilities for seismology, computer science and mathematical subjects, as well as administrative services.

The campus comprises two main parts: the Botanical Garden, surrounding the old building stock of Kumpula manor and the modern new building stock located a couple of hundred metres north of the manor. The greenness of the area makes the dynamic campus stand out as a unique, distinctive complex. The campus offers study and research facilities for 6,000 students and 1,000 teachers. The Finnish Meteorological Institute moved to the area in 2005. That building is known as Dynamicum.

===Meilahti Campus===
[[File:Kaisaniemi Botanical Garden Water lily room 2011-08-05 1.jpg|thumb|Kaisaniemi Botanical Garden Water lily room 2011-08-05 1]]
The [[Meilahti Campus]], with the Faculty of Medicine, is a part of the [[Meilahti]] Hospital District on the edge of the city centre. Just a few kilometres from the City Centre Campus, the Meilahti area has been transformed into a cradle of top research on medicine, 'Medilahti'. Established in the 1930s, the Women's Clinic was accompanied by Finland's leading hospital, Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH) in 1966. The same year saw the completion of facilities for theoretical subject departments on Haartmaninkatu street. The building is now being renovated and extended. The latest completed facilities in the campus include the National Library of Health Sciences Terkko and the research and teaching centre Biomedicum, which accommodates 1,200 researchers.

The Ruskeasuo premises, including the Department of Dentistry, Institute for Oral Health, Department of Public Health and Department of Forensic Medicine, also belong to the Meilahti campus. The Meilahti and Ruskeasuo areas form a close-knit complex providing a meeting place for medical education, international top-level research and nursing. The campus is a workplace for 2,000 students and 1,500 teachers.

Thanks to the years-long project to combine the teaching facilities of the Faculty of Medicine, Meilahti is now a functional unity of medicine and health care. The atmosphere in the campus inspires people in their studies, research and international co-operation.

Although the Meilahti campus is intertwined with the rest of Meilahti district, it succeeds in forming a clear-cut campus area with its hospital-type building stock.

===Viikki Campus===
The [[Viikki Campus]] is located in the semi-suburban greenspace of the [[Viikki]] area, some 8 kilometres north-east of the city centre. It houses the Faculties of Agriculture and Forestry, Biosciences, Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy. It is an important concentration in the field of biosciences, even by European standards. Indeed, it is often called the bioscience campus or the “green campus”.

In addition to biosciences, the campus is home to a wide range of other life science researchers and students in such fields as environmental science, veterinary medicine, food research and economics. Numerous international research groups also work on the Viikki Campus. The Viikki Campus is the location of four faculties, two independent institutes and the Viikki Science Library.

It also attracts an increasing number of businesses to the Helsinki Business and Science Park. The Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute and the Finnish Food Safety Authority, Evira, have also moved to Viikki and negotiations are under way to relocate MTT Agrifood Research Finland to Viikki to complement the Department of Economics and Management.

The Viikki Campus unites a multidisciplinary science community of more than 6,500 students and 1,600 teachers, a residential area emphasising ecological values and the natural surroundings, including recreational areas and nature reserves, and forms a unique whole. The campus also has the Viikinlahti conservation area, which is particularly popular among bird watchers.

==Libraries and museums==

===The National Library of Finland===
The [[National Library of Finland]] is the foremost research library in Finland and the main branch of the University of Helsinki's library system. The National Library of Finland is the oldest and largest scholarly library in Finland as well as one of the largest independent institutes at the University of Helsinki. It is responsible for the collection, description, preservation and accessibility of Finland’s printed national heritage and the unique collections under its care. The National Library also serves as a national service and development centre for the library sector and promotes national and international cooperation in the field.

===The Helsinki University Main Library===
[[File:Kaisa-talo3.jpg|thumb|150px|The new Main Library in Kaisa House.|right]]
The Main Library of the university is used by students for research and studying. Located a few blocks down the street from the university's main building in the city center, the new Main Library was opened in 2012 in the Kaisa House. The new library merged the undergraduate library and four dispersed faculty libraries of the city center campus to a collection of approximately 1.5 million books.&lt;ref name="ht-kaisa-library"/&gt; The architecture of the new building, designed by Anttinen Oiva Architects, has been praised&lt;ref name="ht-kaisa-library"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/4356-new-university-library-a-wonder-of-design-and-learning-2.html|title=New university library a wonder of design and learning|work=Helsinki Times|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/16082012/kaupunki/Valo+tulvii+Kaisa-kirjastoon/a1345006266956|title=Valo tulvii Kaisa-kirjastoon|last=Salmela|first=Marja|work=Helsingin Sanomat|language=fi|trans-title=Light floods Kaisa Library|date=16 August 2012|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/library/contact-us/for-media/main-library-in-kaisa-house/|title=Pääkirjasto Kaisa-talossa|publisher=Helsinki University Library|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Helsinki University Museum===
The [[Helsinki University Museum]] is the museum of the University of Helsinki and was located until June 2014 on ''Snellmanninkatu'' off the north-east corner of Senate Square. Museums main exhibition moved to the University Main Building in 2015.

Helsinki University Museum was established in 2003 by merging the former University Museum specialising in the history of the University of Helsinki, the Museum of Medical History, the Museum of the History of Veterinary Medicine, the Museum of the History of Dentistry and the Collections of Craft Science. To complement the new conglomeration of museums, the Mineral Cabinet, which today belongs to the Finnish Museum of Natural History, returned to its original location in the Arppeanum building. Each year the museum also holds one or two temporary exhibitions in a specially designed area. Museums exhibition in Arppeanum Building was closed in June 2014. New main exhibition was opened in the Main Building in March 2015.

The University Museum is in charge of the preservation and conservation of the university’s valuable museum collections and property: old tuition and research equipment, furniture and works of art. The museum maintains an index register of all valuables that are kept in the facilities of the university. The museum also provides library, archive and photographic services pertaining to the history of the university and the history of medical science.

===Finnish Museum of Natural History===
[[File:Helsingin Luonnontieteellinen museo.JPG|thumb|200px|Museum of Natural History.|right]]
The [[Finnish Museum of Natural History]] is a research institution under the University of Helsinki. It is responsible for the national botanical, zoological, geological and paleontological collections consisting of samples from around the world. The collections serve scientific, public informational and educational purposes.

[[File:Helsinki Old Student House.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Vanha Ylioppilastalo|The Old Student House]] (Student Union), Aleksanterinkatu.]]
The [[Student Union of the University of Helsinki]] (''Helsingin yliopiston ylioppilaskunta'', HYY) was founded in 1868. It currently has 32,000 members and is one of the world's wealthiest student organizations, with assets of several hundred million [[euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/25/business/worldbusiness/25iht-small.t.html |title=HYY of Helsinki Runs a $200 Million Enterprise : University Student Union Plays Business Tycoon |first=Barry |last=James |date=25 May 1998 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, it owns a good deal of property in the city centre of Helsinki. The union has been at the centre of student politics from the 19th Century nationalist movements, through the actions of the New Left in the 1960s, up to the present. Its governing assembly consists of parties which are connected to faculty organisations, the [[Nations at Finnish universities#Student nations at Helsinki University|Student Nations]], and the mainstream [[List of political parties in Finland|political parties]].

===Student nations===
The [[Nations in Finnish universities#Student nations at Helsinki University|student nations]] are student organisations that provide extra-curricular activities to students. Along with the faculty-based organisations, the nations provide one of the main nodes of student social life. The nations at University of Helsinki have a special legal status in the Universities Act. There are 15 nations at the university, each one representing a historic region or province of Finland, with four of these representing [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] regions.  Membership is optional.

'''VIVO''' is a web-based, [[open-source software|open-source]] suite of computer software for managing data about researchers, scientists, and faculty members. VIVO uses [[Semantic Web]] techniques to represent people and their work. As of 2017, it is used by several universities and the [[United States Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VIVO|url=http://www.vivoweb.org/|website=vivoweb.org|accessdate=23 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Cornell University]] Library originally created VIVO in 2003 as a "virtual [[List of life sciences|life sciences]] community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Devare|first1=Medha|last2=Corson-Rikert|first2=Jon|last3=Caruso|first3=Brian|last4=Lowe|first4=Brian|last5=Chiang|first5=Kathy|last6=McCue|first6=Janet|title=VIVO: Connecting People, Creating a Virtual Life Sciences Community|journal=D-Lib|date=2007|volume=13|issue=7/8|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july07/devare/07devare.html|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the National Institutes of Health awarded a $12.2 million grant to Cornell, [[University of Florida]], [[Indiana University]], [[Ponce Health Sciences University|Ponce School of Medicine]], [[Scripps Research Institute|The Scripps Research Institute]], [[Washington University]], and [[Weill Cornell Medicine|Weill Cornell Medical College]] to expand the tool for use outside of Cornell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=García-Milian|first1=Rolando|last2=Norton|first2=Hannah F.|last3=Auten|first3=Beth|last4=Davis|first4=Valrie I.|last5=Holmes|first5=Kristi L.|last6=Johnson|first6=Margeaux|last7=Tennant|first7=Michele R.|title=Librarians as Part of Cross-Disciplinary, Multi-institutional Team Projects: Experiences from the VIVO Collaboration|journal=Science &amp; Technology Libraries|date=April 2013|volume=32|issue=2|pages=160–175|doi=10.1080/0194262X.2013.791183|pmc=3700548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data ingest==
VIVO can harvest publication data from [[PubMed]], CSV files, relational databases, or [[OAI-PMH]] harvest.  It then uses a semi-automated process to match publications to researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Chris|last2=Williams|first2=Stephen|last3=Sposato|first3=Vincent|last4=Skaggs|first4=Nicholas|last5=Raum|first5=Narayan|last6=Corson-Rikert|first6=Jon|last7=Caruso|first7=Brian|last8=Blake|first8=Jim|editor1-last=Börner|editor1-first=Katy|editor2-last=Conlon|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Corson-Rikert|editor3-first=Jon|editor4-last=Ding|editor4-first=Ying|title=VIVO : a semantic approach to scholarly networking and discovery|date=2012|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool|location=[San Rafael, Calif.]|isbn=9781608459933|chapter=Extending VIVO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also harvests information about researchers from Human Resources systems and [[Student information system|student information systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About VIVO|url=http://vivoweb.org/info/about-vivo|website=vivoweb.org|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ontology==
The VIVO ontology incorporates elements of several established ontologies, including [[Dublin Core]], [[Bibliographic Ontology]], [[FOAF (ontology)|FOAF]], and [[Simple Knowledge Organization System|SKOS]]. The ontology can be used to describe several [[Professor#Tasks|roles of faculty members]], including research, teaching, and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Ding|first1=Ying|last2=Mitchell|first2=Stella|last3=Corson-Rikert|first3=Jon|last4=Lowe|first4=Brian|last5=He|first5=Bing|title=The VIVO Ontology: Enabling Networking of Scientists|date=2011|url=http://www.websci11.org/fileadmin/websci/Posters/170_paper.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch [[Data Archiving and Networked Services]] and [[Indiana University]] worked to develop the ontology to enable bilingual modeling of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambers|first1=Tamy|last2=Shah|first2=Sahil|last3=Urankar|first3=Ashish|last4=Kalyan|first4=Venkat|last5=Scharnhorst|first5=Andrea|last6=Reijnhoudt|first6=Linda|last7=Rideour|first7=Laura|last8=Guéret|first8=Christophe|last9=Ding|first9=Ying|title=Bilingual researcher profiles: Modeling Dutch researchers in both English and Dutch using the VIVO ontology|journal=Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=2013|volume=50|issue=1|pages=1–4|doi=10.1002/meet.14505001137}}&lt;/ref&gt;
