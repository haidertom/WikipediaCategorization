      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3924">'''AIDS fatigue''' is a phenomenon wherein individuals or societies who had been concerned about the impact of [[HIV]] or [[AIDS]] become [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitized]] to the having a strong emotional response to HIV issues after receiving continual messages about the danger over a long period of time.

==Causes==
[[Anthony Fauci]], director of the United States' [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) said that one of the causes of AIDS fatigue are huge successes in treatment which subsequently have made some people perceive the disease as less concerning.  Fauci noted that whereas in the 1980s in America "we had 30-40 percent of the hospital wards in inner-city hospitals occupied by people with advanced HIV disease, now because of the success of the therapies - which is great news - we don't have that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-11-30/health/aids.day.fauci_1_hiv-and-aids-new-infections-world-aids-day?_s=PM:HEALTH |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707200846/http://articles.cnn.com/2007-11-30/health/aids.day.fauci_1_hiv-and-aids-new-infections-world-aids-day?_s=PM:HEALTH |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2012 |title=Fauci: Despite 'AIDS fatigue,' Americans should care |author=[[Anthony Fauci]] |work=cnn.com |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

The increase may also be because of new treatments.&lt;ref name=HIVrising /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">The '''Biomedical Sciences Research Center "Alexander Fleming"''' is a non-profit research organisation based in [[Vari, Athens]], [[Greece]]. The Center is named after the scientist [[Alexander Fleming]].

Since the beginning of its operations in 1998, the Center develops basic as well as translational and applied research programs at the cutting edge of modern biomedical sciences.  Currently the Center hosts 14 research groups distributed in 4 Institutes (Immunology, Molecular Oncology, Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology). Over the short period since its establishment, BSRC Al. Fleming has gained extensive visibility in the European science arena.

Fleming researchers have established transgenic animal models for rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis and these models have served as a basis for multiple collaborations with the international biopharmaceutical industry in the evaluation of novel therapeutic compounds, or as tools for collaborative R&amp;D.

The Center is equipped with state-of-the-art Core Units which include: an Expression Profiling Facility, a Flow Cytometry Facility, a Protein Chemistry Lab, a Transgenics and gene targeting Unit, and a BioIT Unit, all of which serve internal collaborations, as well as external partners in academia and industry. The Center also runs an Innovation and Enterprise Unit that facilitates the protection and exploitation of the Center’s research and technologies.

Fleming operates its own Animal House, which can house up to 20,000 mice and has its own complete mouse histopathology unit. Fleming’s Animal house (certified with ISO 9001) provides husbandry of animals and services to the biomedical research community since 2001. It covers an area of approximately 600 m2 within the Center and is equipped with highly automated systems that provide the best possible conditions for mouse reproduction and maintenance. Its main activity is the reproduction and maintenance of mice stocks either of inbred strains or genetically engineered mice, such as transgenic and knockout mouse lines, as well as chemically induced mutants developed by Fleming researchers. The Animal House has a capacity to house more than 20,000 mice and is currently the largest Mouse Unit in Greece in terms of number and variety of mice. The Facility became a full member of EMMA in 2009.

{{Anthropology |theories}}

The '''alliance theory''', also known as the '''general theory of exchanges''', is a [[Structuralism|structuralist]] method of studying [[kinship]] relations. It finds its origins in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1949) and is in opposition to the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] theory of [[Radcliffe-Brown]]. Alliance theory has oriented most [[Anthropology|anthropological]] French works until the 1980s; its influences were felt in various fields, including [[psychoanalysis]]&lt;!-- (who shared the belief in a universal [[incest taboo]])--&gt;, [[philosophy]] and [[political philosophy]].

The hypothesis of a "marriage-alliance" emerged in this frame, pointing out towards the necessary interdependence of various families and lineages. Marriages themselves are thus seen as a form of [[communication]] that anthropologists such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]], [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] or [[Rodney Needham]] have described. Alliance theory hence tries to understand the basic questions about inter-individual relations, or what constitutes [[human society|society]].

Alliance theory is based on the [[incest taboo]]: according to it, only this [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] prohibition of incest pushes human groups towards [[exogamy]]. Thus, inside a given society, certain categories of kin are forbidden to inter-marry. The incest taboo is thus a negative prescription; without it, nothing would push men to go searching for women outside their inner kinship circle, or vice versa. This theory echoes with [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913). But the incest taboo of alliance theory, in which one's daughter or sister is offered to someone outside a family circle, starts a circle of exchange of women: in return, the giver is entitled to a woman from the other's intimate kinship group. Thus the negative prescriptions of the prohibition have positive counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], ''Les structures élémentaires de la parenté'', Paris, Mouton, 1967, 2ème édition, p.60''&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the alliance theory is thus of a reciprocal or a generalized exchange which founds [[Affinity (law)|affinity]]. This global phenomenon takes the form of a "circulation of women" which links together the various social groups in one whole: society.

== Elementary structures and complex structures ==

According to Lévi-Strauss's alliance theory, there are two different structural "models" of marriage exchange. Either the women of ego's group are offered to another group "explicitly defined" by social institutions: these are the "elementary structures of kinship". Or the group of possible spouses for the women in ego's group is "indetermined and always open", to the exclusion, however, of certain kin-people ([[nuclear family]], aunts, uncles...), as in the [[Western world]]. Lévi-Strauss call these latter "complex structures of kinship".

Levi-Strauss' model attempted to offer a single explanation for [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross-cousin]] marriage, sister-exchange, dual organisation and rules of [[exogamy]]. Marriage rules over time create social structures, as marriages are primarily forged between groups and not just between the two individuals involved. When groups exchange women on a regular basis they marry together, with each marriage creating a debtor/creditor relationship which must be balanced through the "repayment" of wives, either directly or in the next generation. Levi-Strauss proposed that the initial motivation for the exchange of women was the incest taboo, which he deemed to be the beginning and essence of culture, as it was the first rule to check natural impulses; and secondarily the sexual division of labour. The former, by prescribing exogamy, creates a distinction between marriageable and tabooed women and thus necessitates a search for women outside one's own kin group ("marry out or die out"), which fosters exchange relationships with other groups; the latter creates a need for women to do "women's tasks". By necessitating wife-exchange arrangements, exogamy therefore promotes inter-group alliances and serves to form structures of social networks.

Levi-Strauss also discovered that a wide range of historically unrelated cultures had the rule that individuals should marry their cross-cousin, meaning children of siblings of the opposite sex - from a male perspective that is either the FZD (father's sister's daughter in kinship abbreviation) or the MBD (mother's brother's daughter in kinship abbreviation). Accordingly, he grouped all possible kinship systems into a scheme containing three basic kinship structures, constructed out of two types of exchange. He called the three kinship structures elementary, semi-complex and complex.

Elementary structures are based on positive marriage rules that specify whom a person must marry, while complex systems specify negative marriage rules (whom one must not marry), thus leaving a certain amount of room for choice based on preference. Elementary structures can operate based on two forms of exchange: restricted (or direct) exchange, a symmetric form of exchange between two groups (also called moieties) of wife-givers and wife-takers; in an initial restricted exchange FZ marries MB, with all children then being bilateral cross-cousins (the daughter is both MBD and FZD). Continued restricted exchange means that the two lineages marry together. Restricted exchange structures are generally quite uncommon.

The second form of exchange within elementary structures is called generalised exchange, meaning that a man can only marry either his MBD ([[matrilateral]] cross-cousin marriage) or his FZD ([[patrilateral]] cross-cousin marriage). This involves an asymmetric exchange between at least three groups. Matrilateral cross-cousin marriage arrangements where the marriage of the parents is repeated by successive generations are very common in parts of Asia (e.g. amongst the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]]). Levi-Strauss considered generalised exchange to be superior to restricted exchange because it allows the integration of indefinite numbers of groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Barnard and Good, 1984:96&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of restricted exchange are found in some tribes residing in the [[Amazon basin]]. These tribal societies are made up of multiple moieties which often split up, thus rendering them comparatively unstable. Generalised exchange is more integrative but contains an implicit hierarchy, for instance amongst the Kachin where wife-givers are superior to wife-takers. Consequently, the last wife-taking group in the chain is significantly inferior to the first wife-giving group to which it is supposed to give its wives. These status inequalities can destabilise the entire system or can at least lead to an accumulation of wives (and in the case of the Kachin also of bridewealth) at one end of the chain.

From a structural perspective, matrilateral cross-cousin marriage is superior to its patrilateral counterpart; the latter has less potential to produce social cohesion since its exchange cycles are shorter (the direction of wife exchange is reversed in each successive generation). Levi-Strauss' theory is supported by fact that patrilateral cross-cousin marriage is in fact the rarest of three types. However, matrilateral generalised exchange poses a risk, as group A depends on being given a woman from a group that it has not itself given a woman to, meaning that there is a less immediate obligation to reciprocate compared to a restricted exchange system. The risk created by such a delayed return is obviously lowest in restricted exchange systems.

Levi-Strauss proposed a third structure between elementary and complex structures, called the semi-complex structure, or the Crow-Omaha system. Semi-complex structures contain so many negative marriage rules that they effectively come close to prescribing marriage to certain parties, thus somewhat resembling elementary structures. These structures are found amongst societies such as the [[Crow tribe|Crow]] and [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]] native [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in [[North America]].

In Levi-Strauss' order of things, the basic building block of kinship is not just the nuclear family, as in structural-functionalism, but the so-called kinship atom: the nuclear family together with the wife's brother. This "mother's brother" (from the perspective of the wife-seeking son) plays a crucial role in alliance theory, as he is the one who ultimately decides whom his daughter will marry. Moreover, it is not just the nuclear family as such but alliances between families that matter in regard to the creation of social structures, reflecting the typical structuralist argument that the position of an element in the structure is more significant than the element itself. Descent theory and alliance theory therefore look at two different sides of the same coin: the former emphasising bonds of consanguinity (kinship by blood), the latter stressing bonds of affinity (kinship by law or choice).

'''''American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America''''' is a 1997 book by [[art critic]] [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]].

==Reception==
''[[BookList]]'' called ''American Visions'' a "sensational history of American art." and wrote "The contrast between the influence of nature and of the city on American art is the fulcrum of Hughes' entire narrative ..."&lt;ref name=buffalo/&gt; and ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice Reviews]]'' stated "The book bears the stamp of the author's aesthetic sensibilities (which value works of art for their technical competence as well as visual and intellectual qualities), his critical acuity, and his accomplished writing."&lt;ref name=buffalo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/900642/Reviews |title=American visions : the epic history of art in America |website=www.buffalolib.org |publisher=Buffalo and Erie County Public Library |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' gave a starred review and described it as an "eminently readable handbook on American art.", writing "His readings of three centuries of both art works and trends are lively, detailed, and persuasive (though perhaps a bit too harsh regarding recent art), and his ultimately pessimistic take is expressed with great clarity. A meaty and illuminating excavation, full of vigor and punch..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-hughes-6/american-visions-the-epic-history-of-an-in-amer/ |title=AMERICAN VISIONS: The Epic History of An in America |date=1 March 1997 |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly]] noted "this is no bland, dumbed-down survey intended to flatter its subject or its audience. Hughes writes with an aesthete's disdain for political posturing, a traditionalist's belief in the importance of technical skills (painters are frequently taken to task for their shoddy draftsmanship) and a pragmatist's contempt for mystagogical bunk.", found "his account of the contemporary scene is disappointingly brief." and concluded "This slashingly witty, briskly paced, ferociously opinionated tour of the American visual landscape is a book that even the most un-likeminded readers will love to hate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-679-42627-1 |title=American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America |date=31 March 1997 |website=www.publishersweekly.com |publisher=PWxyz LLC|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New York Times]]'' review calls it a "witty and impassioned history of American art from its beginnings to the present day", "beautiful and essential", notes that "Mr. Hughes fortunately remains the critic throughout his historical canvassing, making distinctions and judgments without taking sides." and concludes "With it, Mr. Hughes has made American art safe for the receptive alien deep inside us all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lee Siegel |date=27 April 1997 |title=A critic interprets American art as a perpetual beginning  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/27/reviews/970427.27siegelt.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Visions'' has also been reviewed by the ''[[London Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=30 October 1997 |title=Big Daddy |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v19/n21/linda-nochlin/big-daddy |journal=London Review of Books |publisher=LRB Limited |volume=19 |number=21 |pages=10,11 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Journal of American History]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1998 |title=American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America.

==Using artificial intelligence for Wikimedia projects==
Various projects seek to improve Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects by using artificial intelligence tools.

===ORES===
The Objective Revision Evaluation Service (ORES) project is an artificial intelligence service for grading the quality of Wikipedia edits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Simonite |first1=Tom |title=Software That Can Spot Rookie Mistakes Could Make Wikipedia More Welcoming |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/544036/artificial-intelligence-aims-to-make-wikipedia-friendlier-and-better/ |website=MIT Technology Review |language=en |date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Metz |first1=Cade |title=Wikipedia Deploys AI to Expand Its Ranks of Human Editors |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/12/wikipedia-is-using-ai-to-expand-the-ranks-of-human-editors/ |journal=Wired |date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wikimedia Foundation presented the ORES project in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Halfaker |first1=Aaron |last2=Taraborelli |first2=Dario |title=Artificial intelligence service "ORES" gives Wikipedians X-ray specs to see through bad edits |url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/2015/11/30/artificial-intelligence-x-ray-specs/ |website=Wikimedia Foundation |date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detox===
Detox is a project to prevent users from posting unkind comments in Wikimedia community discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Research:Detox - Meta |url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Detox |website=meta.wikimedia.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other parts of the Detox project, the Wikimedia Foundation and [[Jigsaw (company)|Jigsaw]] collaborated to use artificial intelligence for basic research and to develop technical solutions to address the problem. In October 2016 those organizations published "Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale" describing their findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale |pages=1391–1399 |doi=10.1145/3038912.3052591 |arxiv=1610.08914|chapter=Ex Machina |year=2017 |last1=Wulczyn |first1=Ellery |last2=Thain |first2=Nithum |last3=Dixon |first3=Lucas |isbn=9781450349130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jigsaw |title=Algorithms And Insults: Scaling Up Our Understanding Of Harassment On Wikipedia |url=https://medium.com/jigsaw/algorithms-and-insults-scaling-up-our-understanding-of-harassment-on-wikipedia-6cc417b9f7ff |website=Medium |date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various popular media outlets reported on the publication of this paper and described the social context of the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |last1=Wakabayashi |first1=Daisuke |title=Google Cousin Develops Technology to Flag Toxic Online Comments |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/technology/google-jigsaw-monitor-toxic-online-comments.html |journal=The New York Times |language=en |date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smellie |first1=Sarah |title=Inside Wikipedia's Attempt to Use Artificial Intelligence to Combat Harassment |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/aeyvxz/wikipedia-jigsaw-google-artificial-intelligence |website=Motherboard |publisher=[[Vice Media]] |language=en-us |date=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gershgorn |first1=Dave |title=Alphabet's hate-fighting AI doesn't understand hate yet |url=https://qz.com/918640/alphabets-hate-fighting-ai-doesnt-understand-hate-yet/ |website=Quartz |date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018 a company called Primer reported attempting to use artificial intelligence to create Wikipedia articles about women as a way to address [[gender bias on Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Simonite |first1=Tom |title=Using Artificial Intelligence to Fix Wikipedia's Gender Problem |url=https://www.wired.com/story/using-artificial-intelligence-to-fix-wikipedias-gender-problem/ |journal=Wired |date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Verger |first1=Rob |title=Artificial intelligence can now help write Wikipedia pages for overlooked scientists |url=https://www.popsci.com/artificial-intelligence-scientists-wikipedia |website=Popular Science |language=en |date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using Wikimedia projects for artificial intelligence==
Content in Wikimedia projects is useful as a dataset in advancing artificial intelligence research and applications. For instance, in the development of the Google's [[Perspective API]] that identifies toxic comments in online forums, a dataset containing hundreds of thousands of Wikipedia talk page comments with human-labelled toxicity levels was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/01/google-perspective-comment-ranking-system/|title=Google’s comment-ranking system will be a hit with the alt-right|work=Engadget|date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 paper reported that more than 1000 academic articles, including those using artificial intelligence, examine Wikipedia, reuse information from Wikipedia, use technical extensions linked to Wikipedia, or research communication about Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nielsen |first1=Finn Årup |title=Wikipedia Research and Tools: Review and Comments |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2012 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2129874 |language=en |issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 paper described Wikipedia as the [[mother lode]] for human-generated text available for machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mehdi |first1=Mohamad |last2=Okoli |first2=Chitu |last3=Mesgari |first3=Mostafa |last4=Nielsen |first4=Finn Årup |last5=Lanamäki |first5=Arto |title=Excavating the mother lode of human-generated text: A systematic review of research that uses the wikipedia corpus |journal=Information Processing &amp; Management |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=505–529 |doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2016.07.003 |date=March 2017|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/excavating-the-mother-lode-of-humangenerated-text-a-systematic-review-of-research-that-uses-the-wikipedia-corpus(506cdbd1-1783-47dd-b77a-30e44072d6b1).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 research project called "One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence" named Wikipedia as a key early project for understanding the interplay between artificial intelligence applications and human engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AI Research Trends - One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100) |url=https://ai100.stanford.edu/2016-report/section-i-what-artificial-intelligence/ai-research-trends |website=ai100.stanford.edu |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13125">'''Balancer chromosomes''' are special, modified [[chromosome]]s used for genetically screening a population of organisms to select for heterozygotes. '''Balancer chromosomes''' can be used as a genetic tool to prevent crossing over ([[genetic recombination]]) between [[homologous chromosome]]s during [[meiosis]]. Balancers are most often used in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' (fruit fly) genetics to allow populations of flies carrying [[heterozygous]] mutations to be maintained without constantly screening for the mutations but can also be used in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Binhai |author2=Marijke Sage |author3=Wei-Wen Cai |author4=Debrah M. Thompson |author5=Beril C. Tavsanli |author6=Yin-Chai Cheah |author7=Allan Bradley|title=Engineering a mouse balancer chromosome|journal=Nature Genetics|year=1998|volume=22|pages=375–378|url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v22/n4/full/ng0899_375.html|accessdate=2011-11-22|issue=4|doi=10.1038/11949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balancer chromosomes have three important properties: they suppress recombination with their homologs, carry dominant markers, and negatively affect reproductive fitness when carried homozygously.

== History of balancer chromosomes ==
Balancer chromosomes were first used by [[Hermann Joseph Muller|Hermann Muller]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://sandwalk.blogspot.ca/2008/10/hermann-muller-invented-balancer.html Hermann Muller Invented the Balancer Chromosome]&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern usage of balancer chromosomes, random mutations are first caused, usually by feeding the larva ethyl methane sulphonate.  When a phenotype of interest is observed, the line is crossed with another line containing balancer chromosomes to maintain their lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=E. B.|author2=F. Bacher|title=Methods of feeding ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) to Drosophila males|journal=Drosophila Information Service|year=1968|volume=43|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In one instance they were used to genetically screen a population of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''.  At this point in time scientists had already realized the benefits of being able to genetically screen populations of organisms for genetic study.  Equally as important, they also realized that they could limit [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]] in these populations as well give them a very consistent genetic population.&lt;ref&gt;

The use of balancer chromosomes has evolved into a well known and widely used method for [[genetic screen]]ing of model organisms.  They are even being used to investigate the role of heterochromatin packing and the effect it has on genes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bushy|first=Daniel|author2=John Locke|title=Mutations in Su(var)205 and Su(var)3-7 Suppress P-Element-Dependent Silencing in Drosophila melanogaster|journal=Genetics|date=November 1, 2004|volume=168|series=3|pages=1395–1411|doi=10.1534/genetics.104.026914|pmc=1448784}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 28, 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as studies on the effect telomeres have on gene silencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=James|author2=Random Joshua|author3=Konev Alexander|title=A Deficiency Screen for Dominant Suppressors of Telomeric Silencing in Drosophila|journal=Genetics|date=November 1, 2004|volume=168|series=3|pages=1353–1370|doi=10.1534/genetics.104.030676|pmid=15579690|pmc=1448782}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 28, 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== How balancer chromosomes work ==
To suppress [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]], balancer chromosomes are the products of multiple, nested [[chromosomal inversion]]s so that [[synapsis]] between homologous chromosomes is disrupted. This construct is called a '''crossover suppressor'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kile|first=Benjamin T. |author2=Kathryn E. Hentges |author3=Amander T. Clark |author4=Hisashi Nakamura |author5=Andrew P. Salinger |author6=Bin Liu |author7=Neil Box |author8=David W. Stockton |author9=Randy L. Johnson |author10=Richard R. Behringer |author11=Allan Bradley |author12=Monica J. Justice |title=Functional genetic analysis of mouse chromosome 11|journal=Nature|date=4 September 2003|volume=425|pages=81–86|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6953/full/nature01865.html?free=2|accessdate=2011-11-22|issue=6953|doi=10.1038/nature01865|pmid=12955145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If crossing over between a balancer chromosome and the balancer's homolog does occur during meiosis each [[chromatid]] ends up lacking some genes and carrying two copies of other genes. Recombination in inverted regions leads to dicentric or acentric chromosomes (chromosomes with two centromeres or no centromere). [[Offspring|Progeny]] carrying chromosomes that are the products of recombination between balancer and normal chromosomes are not viable (they die).

Dominant markers such as genes for [[green fluorescent protein]] or enzymes that make pigments allow researchers to easily recognize flies that carry the balancer chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casso|first=David |author2=Felipe-Andrés Ramírez-Weber |author3=Thomas B. Kornberg |title=GFP-tagged balancer chromosomes for Drosophila melanogaster|journal=Mechanisms of Development|date=March 2000|volume=91|issue=1–2|pages=451–454|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925477300002483|accessdate=2011-11-22|doi=10.1016/S0925-4773(00)00248-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By suppressing reproductive fitness when carried homozygously a balancer chromosome ensures that the population it is carried in does not become fixed for the balancer chromosome.

Balancer chromosomes always contain a lethal recessive allele.  This means that if an organism receives two copies of the balancer chromosome, one from the mother and one from the father, then the organism will not live.  So any organism that is [[homozygous]] for that chromosome will not live to pass on its genes.  However, offspring that only get one copy of one balancer chromosome and one copy of a wild type or mutant chromosome will live to pass on its genes.  After only a few generations the population will be entirely heterozygous so that you can be guaranteed of its genotype on at least those two chromosomes.

Balancer chromosomes also come with some sort of physical marker.  This marker can be actually associated with the [[DNA]] in the chromosome such as the Green Fluorescent Protein that fluoresces in ultraviolet light, or it can be an easily distinguishable physical characteristic.  These physical characteristics can be anything that is seen easily.  In ''Drosophila melanogaster'', for example, eye color and hair length are commonly used.  This physical marker serves as a double check that you indeed have the heterozygous balancer chromosomes in the organism.&lt;ref name="A Primer of Genome Science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson, Muse|first=Spencer, Greg|title=A Primer of Genome Science|year=2009|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|location=Sunderland, MA|isbn=978-0-87893-236-8|pages=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming convention ==
Balancer chromosomes are named for the chromosome they serve to stabilize and for the phenotypic or [[genetic marker]] the balancer carries.&lt;ref&gt;Fly Pushing: The Theory and Practice of Drosophila Genetics By Ralph J. Greenspan. Page 13&lt;/ref&gt; The naming of balancer chromosomes in ''D. melanogaster'' has been standardized as follows: the first letter of the chromosome's name represents the number of the chromosome it stabilizes. ''F'' stands for the first chromosome, ''S'' stands for second, and ''T'' stands for third (the small fourth chromosome does not undergo recombination and therefore does not require balancing.) This letter is then followed by an ''M'', for "multiply inverted." The ''M'' is followed by a number to distinguish balancers of the same chromosome. Additionally, the genetic marker or markers of the balancer are listed after the name and separated by a comma. Generally mutations with easily observable [[Dominance relationship#Dominant allele|dominant]] phenotypic traits that are often homozygous lethal are used to ensure that all progeny are heterozygous.  For example, the commonly used "''TM3, Sb''" balancer is a balancer chromosome that stabilizes the third chromosome and carries a mutant ''Sb'' ("stubble") gene as a marker. All flies containing the ''TM3, Sb'' balancer will have shortened (or stubbly) hairs on the back of the fly, which are easily seen when viewed through a microscope. The ''3'' is to distinguish this from other third chromosome balancers, such as "TM1" and "TM2".

A line is said to be "double-balanced" if it is heterozygous for two different balancer chromosomes (for example, ''TM6,Tb/TM3,Ser'') on a balancer chromosome and a homozygous lethal, heterozygous visible mutant on the other, [[wild-type]] chromosome (for example, D/TM3,Ser). Most balancer chromosomes also carry a recessive allele such as the "ebony" [[mutation]] that is only manifest in these stocks with two balancer chromosomes. These stocks are often used to provide sources of easily traceable traits when breeding two different lines together so that the correct progeny of each cross might be selected. Stocks double-balanced at both the second and third chromosomes in Drosophila are widely available.

== Important scientific contributions using balancer chromosomes ==

Balancer chromosomes already give geneticists a reliable method for genetically screening organisms for a mutation and keeping that line constant.  A new technique using balancer chromosomes is explored in the paper [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1207718/ "The Autosomal Flp-Dfs Technique for Generating Germline Mosaics in Drosophila Melanogaster."]  This paper showed for the first time that it is possible to screen for a recessive mutation that only shows phenotype when homozygous.  Using old balancer chromosome methods, genetic screening only allowed the picking  out of heterozygous dominant mutations.  This experiment uses clonal screening to detect homozygous individuals and keep them in a constant line.&lt;ref name="Chou 1996 1673–1679"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chou|first=T. B.|author2=[[N. Perrimon]] |title=The Autosomal Flp-Dfs Technique for Generating Germline Mosaics in Drosophila Melanogaster|journal=Genetics|date=December 1996|volume=144|pages=1673–1679|pmc=1207718|pmid=8978054|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They achieved this by using a gene isolated from yeast.  This gene is called [[FLP recombinase]] and causes large chromosomal inversions.  Through trial and error they found that the chromosomes could be recombined such that each had the recessive mutation while the other half contained half of a balancer chromosome with a physical marker and a lethal recessive.  The other homolog did not contain the lethal recessive in the lines that survived.  Figure one in the paper illustrates the screen.  This new technique allowed recessive screening in 95% of the Drosophila genome.  It also greatly improved yields in germ line mutations.&lt;ref name="Chou 1996 1673–1679"/&gt;

Another published paper that employed the use of balancer chromosomes is [http://www.genetics.org/content/188/4/823.full   "Inhibition of RNA Interference and Modulation of Transposable Element Expression by Cell Death in Drosophila."]  This paper demonstrates the power of balancer chromosomes and what can be accomplished with genetically stable lines.  A line was established that exhibited low levels of cell death and was named EGFPir hs-hid.  The RNAi levels were analyzed and they found interesting results in the cells undergoing low levels of cell death and the surrounding cells in the tissue.  They found that these cells would shut down their RNAi mechanism via maintaining RNA in a double stranded state.  If RNA remains in a double stranded state then the RNAi mechanism of gene silencing is shut down.

The authors speculated that this response was an evolutionary trend toward redundant immune response against RNA viruses.  If one cell is already undergoing cell death to attempt to stop spread of a virus, then the RNAi immune response has been ineffective.  This causes another immune response that attempts to stop the virus which is binding double stranded RNA and keeping double stranded so that it cannot be transcribed into virus proteins.  The mechanism of maintaining double stranded RNA is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xie|first=Weiwu|author2=Liang Chengzhi|author3=James Birchler|title=Inhibition of RNA Interference and Modulation of Transposable Element Expression by Cell Death in Drosophila|journal=Genetics|date=1 August 2011|volume=188|issue=4|pages=823–834|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/188/4/823.full|accessdate=2011-11-22|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.128470|pmid=21596898|pmc=3176087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''baluster'''—also called '''spindle''' or '''stair stick'''{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}—is a moulded shaft, square or of [[lathe]]-turned form, cut from a rectangular or square plank, one of various forms of [[spindle (furniture)|spindle in woodwork]], made of stone or wood, and sometimes of metal or plastic,&lt;ref&gt;Cast-stone balusters were a development of the 18th century in Great Britain (see [[Coade stone]]), [[cast iron]] balusters a development largely of the 1840s.&lt;/ref&gt; standing on a unifying footing, and supporting the [[coping (architecture)|coping]] of a [[parapet]] or the [[handrail]] of a [[stairway|staircase]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Baluster|volume=3|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiplied in this way, they form a '''balustrade'''.&lt;ref&gt;"A row of balusters surmounted by a rail or coping" 1644.

==Etymology==
According to ''[[OED]]'', "baluster" is derived through the {{lang-fr|balustre}}, from {{lang-it|balaustro}}, from ''balaustra'', "pomegranate flower" [from a resemblance to the swelling form of the half-open flower (''illustration, below left'')],&lt;ref&gt;The early sixteenth-century theoretical writer Diego da Sangredo (''Medidas del Romano'', 1526) detected this derivation, N. Llewellyn noted, in "Two notes on Diego da Sangredo: 2. The baluster and the pomegranate flower", in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''40''' (1977:240-300); Paul Davies and David Hemsoll's detailed history, "Renaissance Balusters and the Antique", in ''[[Architectural History (journal)|Architectural History]]'' '''26''' (1983:1–23, 117–122) p.8 notes uses of the word in fifteenth-century documents and explores its connotations for sixteenth-century designers, pp 12ff.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''balaustium'', from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] βαλαύστιον (''balaustion'').

== History ==
The earliest examples are those shown in the [[bas-relief]]s representing the [[Assyria]]n palaces, where they were employed as window balustrades and apparently had [[Ionic order|Ionic]] capitals.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; As an architectural element the balustrade did not seem to have been known to either the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] or the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]],&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower 1974&lt;/ref&gt; but baluster forms are familiar in the legs of chairs and tables represented in Roman bas-reliefs,&lt;ref&gt;Davies and Hemsoll 1983:2.&lt;/ref&gt; where the original legs or the models for cast bronze ones were shaped on the lathe, or in Antique marble candelabra, formed as a series of stacked bulbous and disc-shaped elements, both kinds of sources familiar to ''Quattrocento'' designers.

The application to architecture was a feature of the early Renaissance: late fifteenth-century examples are found in the balconies of palaces at [[Venice]] and [[Verona]]. These [[quattrocento]] balustrades are likely to be following yet-unidentified [[Gothic architecture|Gothic precedents]]. They form balustrades of colonnettes&lt;ref&gt;A ''colonnette'' is a miniature column, used decoratively.&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to miniature arcading.

[[Rudolf Wittkower]] withheld judgement as to the inventor of the baluster&lt;ref&gt;H. Siebenhüner, in tracing the baluster's career, found its origin in the profile of the round base of [[Donatello]]'s ''Judith and Holofernes'', c. 1460 (Siebenhüner, "Docke", in Reallexikon zur Deutsche Kunstgeschichte'' vol. 4 1988:102-107)&lt;/ref&gt; and credited [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] with using it consistently as early as the balustrade on the [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] and stairs at the [[Medici]] villa at [[Poggio a Caiano]] (c. 1480),&lt;ref&gt;Davies and Hemsol 1983 note the earliest uses of both types of baluster in fictive classicising thrones and architecture in paintings. They instance an earlier use in real architecture on the main façade of the [[Palazzo Ducale, Urbino]], where [[Luciano Laurana]] was employed (p. 6 and pl. 3j).&lt;/ref&gt; and used balustrades in his reconstructions of antique structures. Sangallo passed the motif to [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]] (his [[Tempietto]], 1502) and [[Michelangelo]], through whom balustrades gained wide currency in the 16th century.

Wittkower distinguished two types, one symmetrical in profile that inverted one bulbous vase-shape over another, separating them with a cushionlike [[torus]] or a concave ring, and the other a simple vase shape, whose employment by Michelangelo at the [[Campidoglio]] steps (c. 1546), noted by Wittkower, was preceded by very early vasiform balusters in a balustrade round the drum of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie]] (c. 1482), and railings in the cathedrals of [[Aquileia]] (c. 1495) and [[Parma]], in the cortile of San Damaso, Vatican, and [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Antonio da Sangallo]]'s crowning balustrade on the [[Santa Casa]] at Loreto installed in 1535, and liberally in his model for the [[Basilica of Saint Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;These earlier appearances were adduced by Davies and Hemsol 1983:7f.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its low [[center of gravity]], this "vase-baluster" may be given the modern term "dropped baluster".&lt;ref&gt;Davies and Hemsol 1983:1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profiles and style changes==
The baluster, being a [[Turning|turned structure]], tends to follow design precedents that were set in woodworking and ceramic practices, where the [[Lathe|turner's lathe]] and the [[potter's wheel]] are ancient tools. The profile a baluster takes is often diagnostic of a particular style of architecture or furniture, and may offer a rough guide to date of a design, though not of a particular example. 

Some complicated [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] baluster forms can be read as a vase set upon another vase. The high shoulders and bold, rhythmic shapes of the [[Baroque]] vase and baluster forms are distinctly different from the sober baluster forms of [[Neoclassicism]], which look to other precedents, like Greek [[amphora]]s. The distinctive twist-turned designs of balusters in oak and walnut English and Dutch&lt;ref&gt;Twist-turned legs on a backstool feature prominently in a conversation piece of a couple in an elaborately fashionable Dutch interior, painted by Eglon van der Neer (1678): [[:File:Elegant Couple in an Interior 1678 Eglon van der Neer.jpg|illustration]].&lt;/ref&gt; seventeenth-century furniture, which took as their prototype the [[Solomonic column]] that was given prominence by [[Bernini]], fell out of style after the 1710s.

Once it had been taken from the lathe, a turned wood baluster could be split and applied to an architectural surface, or to one in which architectonic themes were more freely treated, as on cabinets made in Italy, Spain and Northern Europe from the sixteenth through the seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The architectural invention of the applied half-baluster, with a caveat concerning "the fallacy of first recorded appearances", by [[Filippino Lippi]] in the painted architecture ''all'antica'' of his ''St. Philip revealing the Demon'' in the Strozzi Chapel, [[Santa Maria Novella]], Florence, and in Michelangelo's planned use in the Medici Chapel, is explored by Paul Joannides, "Michelangelo, Filippino Lippi and the Half-Baluster", ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''123''' No. 936 (March 1981:152–154).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern baluster design is also in use for example in designs influenced by the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in a 1905 row of houses in Etchingham Park Road Finchley London England.

Outside Europe, the baluster column appeared as a new motif in [[Mughal architecture]], introduced in [[Shah Jahan]]'s interventions in two of the three great fortress-palaces, the [[Red Fort of Agra]] and [[Delhi]],&lt;ref&gt;"There are no free-standing baluster columns of Shah Jahan's reign in the Fort at [[Lahore]]", according to [[Ebba Koch]] ("The Baluster Column: A European Motif in Mughal Architecture and Its Meaning", ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', '''45''' (1982:251–262) p. 252) but balustrades are a feature of all three.&lt;/ref&gt; in the early seventeenth century. Foliate baluster columns with naturalistic foliate capitals, unexampled in previous Indo-Islamic architecture according to [[Ebba Koch]], rapidly became one of the most widely used forms of supporting shaft in Northern and Central India in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ebba Koch 1982:251–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern term '''baluster shaft''' is applied to the shaft dividing a window in [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] architecture. In the south transept of [[St Albans Cathedral|the Abbey in St Albans]], England, are some of these shafts, supposed to have been taken from the old Saxon church. [[Norman architecture|Norman]] bases and capitals have been added, together with plain cylindrical Norman shafts.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Balusters are normally separated by at least the same measurement as the size of the square bottom section. Placing balusters too far apart (to save money) diminishes their aesthetic appeal. Balustrades normally terminate in columns, building walls or more properly in heavy [[newel]] posts because otherwise they will not be structurally strong enough.

Balusters may be formed in several ways. Wood and stone can be shaped on the lathe, wood can be cut from square or rectangular section boards, while concrete, plaster, iron, and plastics are usually formed by molding and casting. Turned patterns or old examples are used for the molds.

'''Bendor Gerard Robert Grosvenor''' (born 27 November 1977) is a British [[art dealer]], [[Art history|art historian]] and writer. He is known for discovering a number of important [[lost artworks]] by Old Master artists, including [[Sir Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Peter Brueghel the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/brueghels-return-to-fold-as-lost-sheep-are-found-k6qm3cdzm|title=Brueghels Return to the Fold|work=The Times|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a dealer he specialises in Old Masters, with a particular interest in [[Anthony van Dyck]].

During 2011 - 2016 he performed specialist research for, and appeared in, the [[BBC1]] art programme, ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mxxz6/profiles/bendor-grosvenor|title=Fake or Fortune?|work=BBC One|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then presented the [[BBC4]] series ''[[Britain's Lost Masterpieces]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07xjtbp|title=Britain's Lost Masterpieces|work=BBC One|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Jacky Klein and Emma Dabiri, which ran from 2016 - 2017.

==Life and work==
Grosvenor was educated at [[Harrow School]], [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]] and the [[University of East Anglia]] where he completed his PhD entitled ''"The Politics of Foreign Policy: Lord Derby and the Eastern Crisis, 1875-8"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philipmould.com/staff.php?id=2|title=Bendor Grosvenor|work=Philip Mould &amp; Company|accessdate=10 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924040923/http://www.philipmould.com/staff.php?id=2|archivedate=24 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming an art historian he worked in politics, first as an adviser to the Labour MP [[Tony Banks, Lord Stratford]], and then to the Conservative MP [[Hugo Swire]].

His first major art discovery was a mis-catalogued portrait by [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]] in 2003 that was being sold at a London auction as a work by Lawrence's pupil, [[George Henry Harlow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/417wnxhPlvxr5JxPGdKFJcT/bendor-grosvenor|title=Bendor Grosvenor}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 until 2014 he worked for [[Philip Mould]] Ltd{{fact|date=February 2017}}, where he made a number of significant art historical discoveries, including lost works by artists such as [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], [[Thomas Gainsborough]], and [[Sir Anthony Van Dyck]], on whom he is an acknowledged specialist.{{cn|date=September 2018}} He now has his own company, and specialises in establishing the authenticity of paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconografie.co.uk|title=Iconografie}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{nicg|date=February 2017}} He recently{{when|date=September 2018}} sold a newly identified portrait by [[Joan Carlile]], the first professional British female artist, to the [[Tate]] gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/21/typical-how-britains-first-professional-female-artist-was-mistak|title=Typical!|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017 he discovered the [[Lost portrait of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|"lost portrait" of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham ]] at [[Pollok House]], [[Glasgow]], Scotland. The painting was thought to be a copy of a painting by [[Flemish people|Flemish]] artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]] that had been lost for nearly 400 years, but after restoration was found to be the original by Rubens.&lt;ref name="graun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slawson|first1=Nicola|title=Lost Rubens portrait of James I's 'lover' is rediscovered in Glasgow|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/24/lost-rubens-portrait-james-i-lover-rediscovered-glasgow|accessdate=26 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grosvenor has been a member of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on National Records and Archives, and the Lord Chancellor's Forum for Historical Manuscripts and Academic Research.{{citation_needed|date=April 2018}} He also works as a journalist and writer, and presents programmes for BBC2's ''[[The Culture Show]]''.

==Jacobite portraiture==
Grosvenor has made a special study of Jacobite portraiture. In 2009 he proved that the Scottish National Portrait Gallery's iconic portrait of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] was in fact a portrait of Charles' brother, [[Henry Benedict Stuart]], Cardinal York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/gallery-admits-portrait-isn-t-bonnie-prince-charlie-1-782863|title=Gallery admits portrait isn't Bonnie Prince Charlie|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013 he discovered the [[lost portrait of Charles Edward Stuart]] by Scottish artist [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] at [[Gosford House]], the home of the [[Earl of Wemyss]] near [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=beeb&gt;{{cite news|title=Lost Bonnie Prince Charlie portrait found in Scotland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-26287887|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This portrait is now on display at the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]], and has taken the place of the La Tour pastel as the definitive portrait of Charles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14391862.Historic__lost__portrait_of_Bonnie_Prince_Charlie_secured_by_National_Galleries_of_Scotland|title=Historic lost portrait of Bonnie Prince Charlie secured by the National Portrait Gallery|work=The Herald|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestry==
The name ''Bendor'' is derived from the Grosvenor family's medieval heraldic shield, ''a bend or'', a golden [[Bend (heraldry)|bend]] (diagonal stripe), which they used until 1389 when it was claimed instead by the Scrope family, in the case [[Scrope v Grosvenor]]. [[Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster|The 2nd Duke of Westminster]] was nicknamed "Bendor". 

Bendor is the grandson of [[Robert Grosvenor, 5th Baron Ebury|The 5th Baron Ebury]], and the 4th cousin once removed of [[Hugh Grosvenor, 7th Duke of Westminster|The 7th Duke of Westminster]]. (He is fourth in line to the Marquessate of Westminster after [[Francis Grosvenor, 8th Earl of Wilton|The 8th Earl of Wilton]], Viscount Grey de Wilton, and his first cousin Alexander Grosvenor.) He is also of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] heritage.

'''Biofiltration''' is a [[pollution control]] technique using a [[bioreactor]] containing living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants.  Common uses include processing [[waste water]], capturing harmful chemicals or silt from [[surface runoff]], and [[Microbiology|microbiotic]] [[oxidation]] of contaminants in air.

==Examples of biofiltration==
Examples of biofiltration include:
* [[Bioswale]]s, [[biostrip]]s, [[biobags]], bioscrubbers, [[Vermifilter]]s and [[trickling filter]]s
* [[Constructed wetland]]s and [[Wetlands|natural wetlands]]
* [[Slow sand filter]]s
* [[Waste stabilization pond|Treatment pond]]s
* [[Green belt]]s
* [[Green wall]]s
* [[Riparian zone]]s, [[riparian forest]]s, [[bosque]]s

==Control of air pollution==
When applied to air filtration and purification, biofilters use microorganisms to remove [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Joseph S. Devinny, Marc A. Deshusses and Todd S. Webster|title=Biofiltration for Air Pollution Control|edition= |publisher=Lewis Publishers|year=1999|isbn=978-1-56670-289-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The air flows through a packed bed and the pollutant transfers into a thin [[biofilm]] on the surface of the packing material. [[Microorganism]]s, including [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are immobilized in the biofilm and degrade the pollutant. Trickling filters and bioscrubbers rely on a biofilm and the bacterial action in their recirculating waters.

The technology finds greatest application in treating malodorous compounds and water-soluble [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs). Industries employing the technology include food and animal products, off-gas from [[wastewater]] treatment facilities, [[pharmaceutical]]s, wood products manufacturing, [[paint]] and coatings application and manufacturing and resin manufacturing and application, etc. Compounds treated are typically mixed VOCs and various [[sulfur]] compounds, including [[hydrogen sulfide]]. Very large airflows may be treated and although a large area (footprint) has typically been required—a large biofilter (&gt;200,000 [[acfm]]) may occupy as much or more land than a football field—this has been one of the principal drawbacks of the technology. Engineered biofilters, designed and built since the early 1990s, have provided significant footprint reductions over the conventional flat-bed, organic media type.

[[Image:CVRD4chamber.air.jpg|thumb|right| Air cycle system at biosolids composting plant. Large duct in foreground is exhaust air into biofilter shown in previous photo]]

One of the main challenges to optimum biofilter operation is maintaining proper moisture throughout the system. The air is normally humidified before it enters the bed with a watering (spray) system, humidification chamber, bioscrubber, or biotrickling filter. Properly maintained, a natural, organic packing media like peat, vegetable mulch, bark or wood chips may last for several years but engineered, combined natural organic and synthetic component packing materials will generally last much longer, up to 10 years. A number of companies offer these types or proprietary packing materials and multi-year guarantees, not usually provided with a conventional compost or wood chip bed biofilter.

Although widely employed, the scientific community is still unsure of the physical phenomena underpinning biofilter operation, and information about the microorganisms involved continues to be developed. A biofilter/bio-oxidation system is a fairly simple device to construct and operate and offers a cost-effective solution provided the pollutant is biodegradable within a moderate time frame (increasing residence time = increased size and capital costs), at reasonable concentrations (and lb/hr loading rates) and that the airstream is at an organism-viable temperature.  For large volumes of air, a biofilter may be the only cost-effective solution. There is no secondary pollution (unlike the case of [[incineration]] where additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; are produced from burning fuels) and degradation products form additional biomass, carbon dioxide and water. Media irrigation water, although many systems recycle part of it to reduce operating costs, has a moderately high [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) and may require treatment before disposal. However, this "blowdown water", necessary for proper maintenance of any bio-oxidation system, is generally accepted by municipal [[publicly owned treatment works]] without any pretreatment.

Biofilters are being utilized in [[Columbia Falls, Montana]] at Plum Creek Timber Company's [[fiberboard]] plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Keriann|title='Bug farm' a breath of fresh air|work=Spokesman Review|date=2008-10-26|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/oct/26/bug-farm-a-breath-of-fresh-air}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biofilters decrease the pollution emitted by the manufacturing process and the exhaust emitted is 98% clean. The newest, and largest, biofilter addition to Plum Creek cost $9.5 million, yet even though this new technology is expensive, in the long run it will cost less overtime than the alternative exhaust-cleaning incinerators fueled by natural gas (which are not as environmentally friendly).  The biofilters use trillions of microscopic bacteria that cleanse the air being released from the plant.

Biofiltration was first introduced in England in 1893 as a trickling filter for wastewater treatment and has since been successfully used for the treatment of different types of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=D.S. Chaudhary, S. Vigneswara, H.-H. Ngo, W.G. Shim and H. Moon|title=Biofilter in water and wastewater treatment|edition= |publisher=The Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering Vol.20 No.6|year=2003|url=http://josiah.berkeley.edu/Papers/biofilterReview2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological treatment has been used in Europe to filter surface water for drinking purposes since the early 1900s and is now receiving more interest worldwide. Biofiltration is also common in [[wastewater treatment]], [[aquaculture]] and [[greywater]] recycling, as a way to minimize water replacement while increasing [[water quality]].

===Biofiltration process===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:biofilter.jpg|thumb|right|Biofilter installation at a commercial composting facility.]] --&gt;
A biofilter is a bed of media on which microorganisms attach and grow to form a biological layer called [[biofilm]]. Biofiltration is thus usually referred to as a fixed–film process. Generally, the biofilm is formed by a community of different microorganisms ([[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[yeast]], etc.), macro-organisms ([[protozoa]], worms, insect’s larvae, etc.) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Flemming and Wingender, 2010). The aspect of the [[biofilm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H.C. Flemming  |author2=J. Wingender |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The biofilm matrix|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=623–633 |edition= |year=2010|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2415 |pmid=20676145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is usually slimy and muddy.

Water to be treated can be applied intermittently or continuously over the media, via upflow or downflow. Typically, a biofilter has two or three phases, depending on the feeding strategy (percolating or submerged biofilter):

* a solid phase (media);
* a liquid phase (water);
* a gaseous phase (air).

Organic matter and other water components diffuse into the biofilm where the treatment occurs, mostly by [[biodegradation]]. Biofiltration processes are usually [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic]], which means that microorganisms require oxygen for their metabolism. Oxygen can be supplied to the biofilm, either concurrently or countercurrently with water flow. Aeration occurs passively by the natural flow of air through the process (three phase biofilter) or by forced air supplied by blowers.

Microorganisms' activity is a key-factor of the process performance. The main influencing factors are the water composition, the biofilter hydraulic loading, the type of media, the feeding strategy (percolation or submerged media), the age of the biofilm, temperature, aeration, etc.

===Types of filtering media===

Most biofilters use media such as sand, crushed rock, river gravel, or some form of plastic or ceramic material shaped as small beads and rings. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cals.arizona.edu/azaqua/ista/ISTA7/RecircWorkshop/Workshop%20PP%20%20&amp;%20Misc%20Papers%20Adobe%202006/7%20Biofiltration/Nitrification-Biofiltration/Biofiltration-Nitrification%20Design%20Overview.pdf|title=Biofiltration-Nitrification Design Overview|last=Ebeling|first=James|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===

Although biological filters have simple superficial structures, their internal hydrodynamics and the microorganisms' biology and ecology are complex and variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.R. Curds  |author2=H.A. Hawkes |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Ecological Aspects of Used-Water Treatment|edition= |publisher=The Processes and their Ecology Vol.3|year=1983|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D0FRAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780121995027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics confer robustness to the process. In other words, the process has the capacity to maintain its performance or rapidly return to initial levels following a period of no flow, of intense use, toxic shocks, media backwash (high rate biofiltration processes), etc.

The structure of the biofilm protects microorganisms from difficult environmental conditions and retains the biomass inside the process, even when conditions are not optimal for its growth. Biofiltration processes offer the following advantages: (Rittmann et al., 1988):

* Because microorganisms are retained within the biofilm, biofiltration allows the development of microorganisms with relatively low specific growth rates;
* Biofilters are less subject to variable or intermittent loading and to [[Water hammer|hydraulic shock]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=P.W. Westerman |author2=J.R. Bicudo |author3=A. Kantardjieff |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Aerobic fixed-media biofilter treatment of flushed swine manure|edition= |publisher=ASAE Annual International Meeting - Florida|year=1998|url=http://eurekamag.com/research/003/032/aerobic-fixed-media-biofilter-cure-flushed-pig-manure.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Operational costs are usually lower than for [[activated sludge]]; 
* Final treatment result is less influenced by biomass separation since the biomass concentration at the effluent is much lower than for suspended biomass processes;
* Attached biomass becomes more specialized (higher concentration of relevant organisms) at a given point in the process train because there is no [[biomass return]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H. Odegaard|title=Innovations in wastewater treatment: the moving bed biofilm process|edition= |publisher=Water Science Technology|year=2006|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/wst/05309/wst053090017.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawbacks===

Because filtration and growth of biomass leads to an accumulation of matter in the filtering media, this type of fixed-film process is subject to [[bioclogging]] and flow channeling. Depending on the type of application and on the media used for microbial growth, bioclogging can be controlled using physical and/or chemical methods. Whenever possible, backwash steps can be implemented using air and/or water to disrupt the biomat and recover flow. Chemicals such as oxidizing ([[peroxide]], [[ozone]]) or biocide agents can also be used.

==Drinking water==
For drinking water, biological water treatment involves the use of naturally occurring microorganisms in the surface water to improve water quality. Under optimum conditions, including relatively low turbidity and high oxygen content, the organisms break down material in the water and thus improve water quality. Slow sand filters or carbon filters are used to provide a support on which these microorganisms grow. These biological treatment systems effectively reduce water-borne diseases, dissolved organic carbon, turbidity and color in surface water, thus improving overall water quality.

==Wastewater==
Biofiltration is used to treat wastewater from a wide range of sources, with varying organic compositions and concentrations. Many examples of biofiltration applications are described in the literature. Bespoke biofilters have been developed and commercialized for the [[agricultural wastewater treatment|treatment of animal wastes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G. Buelna, R. Dubé  |author2=N.

==Use in aquaculture==
The use of biofilters is common in closed [[aquaculture]] systems, such as [[recirculating aquaculture systems]] (RAS).  Many designs are used, with different benefits and drawbacks, however the function is the same: reducing water exchanges by converting [[ammonia]] to [[nitrate]].  Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) originates from the brachial [[excretion]] from the [[gill]]s of [[aquatic animal]]s and from the [[decomposition]] of organic matter.  As ammonia-N is highly toxic, this is converted to a less toxic form of nitrite (by ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' sp.) and then to an even less toxic form of nitrate (by ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' sp.).  This "nitrification" process requires oxygen (aerobic conditions), without which the biofilter can crash.  Furthermore, as this nitrification cycle produces H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the pH can decrease which necessitates the use of buffers such as [[Lime (material)|lime]].

Biological aspects of fluorine describes the effects of fluorine-containing compounds with life.  Fluorine (F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) itself is very rare in everyday life, but hundreds of fluorine-containing compounds occur as minerals, medicines, pesticides, and materials.  Naturally occurring organofluorine compounds are extremely rare. Nonetheless, twenty percent of all commercialized pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, examples being [[Lipitor]] and [[Prozac]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;G. Siegemund, W. Schwertfeger, A. Feiring, B. Smart, F. Behr, H. Vogel, B. McKusick "Fluorine Compounds, Organic" in "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry" 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aigueperse&gt;{{citation | first1 = Jean | last1 = Aigueperse | first2 = Paul | last2 = Mollard | first3 = Didier | last3 = Devilliers | first4= Marius | last4 = Chemla | first5 =  Robert | last5 = Faron | first6 = Renée | last6 = Romano | first7 = Jean Pierre | last7 = Cuer | contribution = Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic | editor-last = Ullmann | title = Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2005 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | place = Weinheim|doi = 10.1002/14356007.a11_307| isbn = 3527306730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manmade fluorinated compounds have also played a role in several noteworthy environmental concerns. [[Chlorofluorocarbons]], once major components of numerous commercial aerosol products, have proven damaging to Earth's ozone layer and resulted in the wide-reaching [[Montreal Protocol]] (though in truth the [[chlorine]] in CFCs is the destructive actor, fluorine is an important part of these molecules because it makes them very stable and long-lived). Similarly, the stability of many organofluorine compounds has raised the issue of [[Persistent organic pollutant|biopersistence]]. Long-lived molecules from waterproofing sprays, for example [[PFOA]] and [[PFOS]], are found worldwide in the tissues of wildlife and humans, including newborn children.

Fluorine biology is also relevant to a number of cutting-edge technologies. PFCs ([[perfluorocarbons]]) are capable of holding enough oxygen to support human [[liquid breathing]]. Organofluorine in the form of its radioisotope [[Fluorine-18|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]] is also at the heart of a modern medical imaging technique known as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET). A PET scan produces three-dimensional colored images of parts of the body that use a lot of sugar, particularly the brain or tumors.

{{Main|Fluoride therapy|Water fluoridation}}

Since the mid-20th century, it has been discerned from population studies (though incompletely understood) that fluoride reduces tooth decay. Initially, researchers hypothesized that fluoride helped by converting tooth enamel from the more acid-soluble mineral [[hydroxyapatite]] to the less acid-soluble mineral fluorapatite. However, more recent studies showed no difference in the frequency of [[caries]] (cavities) amongst teeth that were pre-fluoridated to different degrees. Current thinking is that fluoride prevents cavities primarily by helping teeth that are in the very early stages of tooth decay.&lt;ref name=Pizzo/&gt;

[[File:US Navy 090526-F-1333S-023 A service member embarked aboard the Military Sealift Command hospital ship USNS Comfort (T-AH 20) gives a Fluoride treatment to a patient during a Continuing Promise 2009 medical civil service projec.jpg|thumb|alt=white man holding plastic tray with brown goop in it and sticking a small stick into a black boy's open mouth|Topical fluoride treatment in Panama]]

When teeth begin to decay from the acid of sugar-consuming bacteria, calcium is lost (''demineralization'').  However, teeth have a limited ability to recover calcium if decay is not too far advanced (''remineralization'').  Fluoride appears to reduce demineralization and increase remineralization.  Also, there is some evidence that fluoride interferes with the bacteria that consume sugars in the mouth and make tooth-destroying acids.&lt;ref name=Pizzo/&gt;  In any case, it is only the fluoride that is directly present in the mouth ([[topical medication|topical treatment]]) that prevents cavities.  Fluoride ions that are swallowed do not benefit the teeth.&lt;ref name=Pizzo&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pizzo G. |author2=Piscopo, M.

Water fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a [[public water supply]] to reduce tooth decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Recommendations for using fluoride to prevent and control dental caries in the United States |author= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |journal= MMWR Recommendations and Reports |volume=50 |issue=RR–14 |pages=1–42 |year=2001 |pmid=11521913 |url=http://cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use began in the 1940s, following studies of children in a region where water is naturally fluoridated.

Sodium fluoride, [[tin(II) fluoride|tin difluoride]], and, most commonly, [[sodium monofluorophosphate]], are used in [[toothpaste]]. In 1955, the first fluoride toothpaste was introduced in the United States. Now, almost all toothpaste in developed countries is fluoridated. For example, 95% of European toothpaste contains fluoride.&lt;ref name="Dental caries"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dental caries: The disease and its clinical management|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-3889-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZfXWhSmG1UC&amp;pg=PA518|author=Fejerskov, Ole|author2=Kidd, Edwina|page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gels and foams are often advised for special patient groups, particularly those undergoing radiation therapy to the head (cancer patients). The patient receives a four-minute application of a high amount of fluoride. Varnishes, which can be more quickly applied, exist and perform a similar function. Fluoride is also contained in prescription and non-prescription mouthwashes and is a trace component of foods manufactured using fluoridated water supplies.&lt;ref name="Crest continuing ed"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cracher |first=Connie Myers |title=Current concepts in preventive dentistry |url=http://www.dentalcare.com/media/en-US/education/ce334/ce334.pdf |publisher=dentalcare.com |accessdate=20 January 2012 |page=12 |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172105/http://www.dentalcare.com/media/en-US/education/ce334/ce334.pdf |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical applications==
===Pharmaceuticals===
[[File:Prozac pills.jpg|thumb|alt=large image of just a capsule with words Prozac and DISTA visible|Prozac: one of several notable fluorine-containing drugs]]

Of all commercialized pharmaceutical drugs, twenty percent contain fluorine, including important drugs in many different pharmaceutical classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's building blocks: An A–Z guide to the elements |edition=2nd |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-960563-7 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorine is often added to drug molecules as even a single atom can greatly change the chemical properties of the molecule in desirable ways.

Because of the considerable stability of the carbon-fluorine bond, many drugs are fluorinated to delay their [[drug metabolism|metabolism]], which is the chemical process in which the drugs are turned into compounds that allows them to be eliminated. This prolongs their [[half-life|half-lives]] and allows for longer times between dosing and activation. For example, an [[aromatic ring]] may prevent the metabolism of a drug, but this presents a safety problem, because some aromatic compounds are metabolized in the body into poisonous [[epoxide]]s by the organism's native [[enzyme]]s. Substituting a fluorine into a [[Arene substitution patterns|''para'']] position, however, protects the aromatic ring and prevents the epoxide from being produced.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Adding fluorine to biologically active organics increases their [[lipophilicity]] (ability to dissolve in fats), because the [[carbon–fluorine bond]] is even more hydrophobic than the [[carbon–hydrogen bond]]. This effect often increases a drug's [[bioavailability]] because of increased cell membrane penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Swinson |first=Joel |journal=PharmaChem |title = Fluorine – A vital element in the medicine chest |year=2005 |pages=26–27 |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url=http://www.halocarbon.com/halocarbon_media/swinson_109.pdf |publisher=Pharmaceutical Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the potential of fluorine being released in a fluoride [[leaving group]] depends on its position in the molecule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pet chemistry: The driving force in molecular imaging |page=144 |publisher=Springer |last=Schubiger |first=P. A. |isbn=9783540326236 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; organofluorides are generally very stable, since the carbon–fluorine bond is strong.

Fluorines also find their uses in common [[mineralocorticoid]]s, a class of drugs that increase the [[blood pressure]]. Adding a fluorine increases both its medical power and anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Glucocorticoids|author1=Goulding, Nicolas J. |author2=Flower, Rod J. |page=40|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=9783764360597}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorine-containing [[fludrocortisone]] is one of the most common of these drugs.&lt;ref name="dontburn"/&gt; [[Dexamethasone]] and [[triamcinolone]], which are among the most potent of the related synthetic [[corticosteroid]]s class of drugs, contain fluorine as well.&lt;ref name="dontburn"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pain-relieving procedures: The illustrated guide |page=58 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012 |last1=Raj |first1=P. Prithvi |last2=Erdine |first2=Serdar |isbn=9781118300459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several inhaled general [[anesthetic]] agents, including the most commonly used inhaled agents, also contain fluorine. The first fluorinated anesthetic agent, [[halothane]], proved to be much safer (neither explosive nor flammable) and longer-lasting than those previously used.

Prior to the 1980s, antidepressants altered not only [[serotonin]] uptake (lack of serotonin is a reason for a depression), but also the uptake of altered [[norepinephrine]]; the latter caused most of the side effects of antidepressants. The first drug to alter only the serotonin uptake was [[Prozac]]; it gave birth to the extensive [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) antidepressant class and is the best-selling antidepressant. Many other SSRI antidepressants are fluorinated organics, including [[citalopram|Celexa]], [[Fluvoxamine|Luvox]], and [[escitalopram|Lexapro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Antidepressants|year = 2004|pages=37–39|last1 = Mitchell|first1 = E.

Compounds containing fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that emits [[positron]]s, are often used in [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scanning, because the isotope's half-life of about 110 minutes is usefully long by positron-emitter standards. One such [[radiopharmaceutical]] is [[fluorodeoxyglucose|2-deoxy-2-(&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F)fluoro-D-glucose]] (generically referred to as fludeoxyglucose), commonly abbreviated as &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG, or simply FDG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1097/00002517-200012000-00016 |last1 = Schmitz |pmid = 11132989 |first1 = A. |year = 2000 |pages = 541–544 |issue = 6 |last2 = Kälicke |volume = 13 |journal= Journal of spinal disorders |first2 = T. |last3 = Willkomm |first3 = P. |last4 = Grünwald |first4 = F. |last5 = Kandyba |first5 = J. |last6 = Schmitt |first6 = O.|title=Use of fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography in assessing the process of tuberculous spondylitis|url=http://www.ecios.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/0157CIOS/cios-2-167.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In PET imaging, FDG can be used for assessing glucose metabolism in the brain and for imaging cancer tumors.

Natural fluorine is monoisotopic, consisting solely of [[fluorine-19]]. Fluorine compounds are highly amenable to [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), because fluorine-19 has a [[nuclear spin]] of {{frac|1|2}}, a high [[nuclear magnetic moment]], and a high [[magnetogyric ratio]]. Fluorine compounds typically have a fast NMR [[relaxation (NMR)|relaxation]], which enables the use of fast averaging to obtain a [[signal-to-noise ratio]] similar to [[hydrogen atom|hydrogen-1]] NMR spectra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|first = J.

===Oxygen transport research===
{{see also|Blood substitute|Liquid breathing}}

Liquid fluorocarbons have a very high capacity for holding gas in solution. They can hold more oxygen or carbon dioxide than blood does. For that reason, they have attracted ongoing interest related to the possibility of artificial blood or of liquid breathing.&lt;ref name="Gabrielet"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gabriel, J.

Blood substitutes are the subject of research because the demand for blood transfusions grows faster than donations. In some scenarios, artificial blood may be more convenient or safe. Because fluorocarbons do not normally mix with water, they must be mixed into emulsions (small droplets of perfluorocarbon suspended in water) in order to be used as blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sarkar | first1 = S. | title = Artificial Blood | doi = 10.4103/0972-5229.43685 | journal = Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 140–144 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19742251| pmc =2738310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schimmeyer"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schimmeyer, S.|year=2002|journal=Illumin|volume=5|issue=1|publisher=University of Southern Carolina|url=http://illumin.usc.edu/article.php?articleID=62|title=The search for a blood substitute|accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such product, [[Oxycyte]], has been through initial clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Tasker, Fred| date=2008-03-19| url=http://www.miamiherald.com/1057/story/459521.html |title=Miami Herald: Artificial blood goes from science fiction to science fact| archiveurl=http://www.noblood.org/news-hot-topics-such-hepatitis-c-sars-aids/4407-artificial-blood-goes-science-fiction-science-fact.html |archivedate=19 March 2008| publisher=Miami Herald (at noblood.org) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Nicole|last=Davis|year=2006|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2006-11/better-blood|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604181554/http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2006-11/better-blood|archivedate=2011-06-04| title=Better than blood|journal=[[Popular Science]]|accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible medical uses of liquid breathing (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid, not a water emulsion) involve assistance for premature babies or for burn victims (if normal lung function is compromised).

===Fluorine gas===
Elemental fluorine is highly toxic. Above a concentration of 25&amp;nbsp;ppm, it causes significant irritation while attacking the eyes, airways and lungs and affecting the liver and kidneys. At a concentration of 100&amp;nbsp;ppm, human eyes and noses are seriously damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keplinger|Suissa|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; People can be exposed to fluorine in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[Permissible exposure limit]]) for fluorine exposure in the workplace as 0.1 ppm (0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.1 ppm (0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 25 ppm, fluorine is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Fluorine|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0289.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrofluoric acid===
{{See also|Chemical burn}}

[[File:HF burned hands.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=left and right hands, two views, burned index fingers|Typical HF burns: the outward signs may not be evident for 24 hours, after which calcium treatments are less effective.&lt;ref name=Eaton&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Charles|title=Figure hfl|url=http://www.eatonhand.com/complic/figures/hfl.htm|work=E-Hand.com: the electronic textbook of hand surgery|publisher=The Hand Center (former practice of Dr. Eaton)|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Hydrofluoric acid, the water solution of hydrogen fluoride, is a contact poison.  Even though it is chemically only a weak acid, it is far more dangerous than conventional strong [[mineral acids]], such as nitric acid, sulfuric acid, or hydrochloric acid. Owing to its lesser chemical dissociation in water (remaining a neutral molecule), hydrogen fluoride penetrates tissue more quickly than typical acids. Poisoning can occur readily through the skin or eyes or when inhaled or swallowed.  From 1984 to 1994, at least nine U.S. workers died from accidents with HF.&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt;

Once in the blood, hydrogen fluoride reacts with calcium and magnesium, resulting in electrolyte imbalance (potentially [[hypocalcemia]]). The consequent effect on the heart ([[cardiac arrhythmia]]) may be fatal.&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;{{harvnb|Blodgett|Suruda|Crouch|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Formation of insoluble [[calcium fluoride]] also causes strong pain.&lt;ref name=Goldfrank&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoffman et al.|2007|p=1333}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Burns with areas larger than 160&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, about the size of a man's hand, can cause serious systemic toxicity.&lt;ref name='RMTHFE'&gt;{{Harvnb|HSM|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms of exposure to hydrofluoric acid may not be immediately evident, with an 8-hour delay for 50% HF and up to 24 hours for lower concentrations. Hydrogen fluoride interferes with nerve function, meaning that burns may not initially be painful.

If the burn has been initially noticed, then HF should be washed off with a forceful stream of water for ten to fifteen minutes to prevent its further penetration into the body. Clothing used by the person burned may also present a danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischman|2001|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PyUSgdZUGr4C&amp;pg=PA458 458–459]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrofluoric acid exposure is often treated with [[calcium gluconate]], a source of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that binds with the fluoride ions. Skin burns can be treated with a water wash and 2.5 percent calcium gluconate gel&lt;ref name="pmid2741315"&gt;{{harvnb|El Saadi et al.|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17091088"&gt;{{harvnb|Roblin et al.|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or special rinsing solutions.&lt;ref name="pmid15461243"&gt;{{harvnb|Hultén et al.|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because HF is absorbed, further medical treatment is necessary. Calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Use of calcium chloride is contraindicated and may lead to severe complications. Sometimes surgical excision of tissue or amputation is required.&lt;ref name="RMTHFE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zorich|1991|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sdB3KjhWzFQC&amp;pg=PA183 182–3]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluoride ion===
[[File:Fluworôze egzostozes1-800h.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=knobby hoofed leg|Moroccan cow with fluorosis, from industrial contamination]]

{{See also|Fluoride toxicity}}

Soluble fluorides are moderately toxic. For sodium fluoride, the lethal dose for adults is 5–10&amp;nbsp;g, which is equivalent to 32–64&amp;nbsp;mg of elemental fluoride per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref name="zzzzzzz23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Liteplo et al.|2002|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The dose that may lead to adverse health effects is about one fifth of the lethal dose.&lt;ref name="Nochimson"/&gt; Chronic excess fluoride consumption can lead to [[skeletal fluorosis]], a disease of the bones that affects millions in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name="Nochimson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19305069"&gt;{{harvnb|Reddy|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fluoride ion is readily absorbed by the stomach and intestines. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach. In this form, fluoride crosses cell membranes and then binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes. Fluoride is [[excretion|excreted]] through urine. Fluoride exposure limits are based on urine testing, which is used to determine the human body's capacity for ridding itself of fluoride.&lt;ref name="Nochimson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shin|Silverberg|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baez|Baez|Marthaler|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, most cases of fluoride poisoning have been caused by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluoride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Augenstein et al.|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste.&lt;ref name="Nochimson"/&gt; Malfunction of water fluoridation equipment has occurred several times, including an Alaskan incident that sickened nearly 300 people and killed one.&lt;ref name=Gessner94&gt;{{harvnb|Gessner et al.|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopersistence===
{{main|Perfluorinated compound}}
Because of the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond, organofluorines endure in the environment. [[Perfluorinated compound]]s (PFCs) have attracted particular attention as [[persistent organic pollutant|persistent global contaminants]].  These compounds can enter the environment from their direct uses in waterproofing treatments and firefighting foams or indirectly from leaks from fluoropolymer production plants (where they are intermediates). Because of the acid group, PFCs are water-soluble in low concentrations.&lt;ref name=Giesy&gt;John P. Giesy and Kurunthachalam Kannan [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es022253t Perfluorochemical Surfactants in the Environment], 1 April 2002, Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 147-152.&lt;/ref&gt;  While there are other PFAAs, the lion's share of environmental research has been done on the two most well-known: [[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]] (PFOS) and [[perfluorooctanoic acid]] (PFOA).  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies these materials as "emerging contaminants" based on the growing but still incomplete understanding of their environmental impact.&lt;ref name="PFOA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Steenland K, Fletcher T, Savitz DA |title=Epidemiologic evidence on the health effects of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. |volume=118 |issue=8 |pages=1100–8 |year=2010 |pmid=20423814 |pmc=2920088 |doi=10.1289/ehp.0901827 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/fedfac/pdf/emerging_contaminants_pfos_pfoa.pdf|title=Emerging Contaminants Fact Sheet- PFOS and PFOA|accessdate=November 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202537/http://www.epa.gov/fedfac/pdf/emerging_contaminants_pfos_pfoa.pdf |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trace quantities of PFCs have been detected worldwide, in organisms from polar bears in the Arctic to the global human population.  Both PFOS and PFOA have been detected in breast milk and the blood of newborns.  A 2013 review showed widely varying amounts of PFOS and PFOA in different soils and groundwater, with no clear pattern of one chemical dominating. PFC concentrations were generally higher in areas with more human population or industrial activity, and areas with more PFOS generally also had more PFOA.&lt;ref&gt;P. Zareitalabad, J. Siemens, M. Hamer, W. Amelung [http://safeguard.giqs.org/fileadmin/web_safeguard/content/Berichte_Protokolle2009/Schlussdokumente/CHEM13643.pdf Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) in surface waters, sediments, soils and wastewater – A review on concentrations and distribution coefficients] Chemosphere 91 (2013) 725–732. Review&lt;/ref&gt;  the two chemicals have been found at different concentrations in different populations; for example, one study showed more PFOS than PFOA in Germans, while another study showed the reverse for Americans. PFCs may be starting to decrease in the biosphere: one study indicated that PFOS levels in wildlife in Minnesota were decreasing, presumably because [[3M]] discontinued its production.&lt;ref name="PFOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"/&gt;

[[File:PFOS-3D-vdW.png|The PFOS molecule|thumb]]

In the body, PFCs bind to proteins such as [[serum albumin]]. Their tissue distribution in humans is unknown, but studies in rats suggest it is present mostly in the liver, kidney, and blood. They are not metabolized by the body but are excreted by the kidneys. Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species.  Rodents have half-lives of days, while in humans they remain for years. Many animals show sex differences in the ability to rid the body of PFAAs, but without a clear pattern. Gender differences of half lives vary by animal species.&lt;ref name="PFOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tox"&gt;Lau C, Anitole K, Hodes C, Lai D, Pfahles-Hutchens A, Seed J. [http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/2/366.full.pdf Perfluoroalkyl Acids: A Review of Monitoring and Toxicological Findings] Toxicol Sci. 99(2), 366–394 (2007) {{DOI|10.1093/toxsci/kfm128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential health impact of PFCs is unclear. Unlike chlorinated hydrocarbons, PFCs are not [[lipophilic]] (stored in fat), nor [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] (damaging genes). Both PFOA and PFOS in high doses cause cancer and the death of newborns in rodents. Studies on humans have not been able to prove an impact at current exposures. [[Bottlenose dolphin]]s have some of the highest PFOS concentrations of any wildlife studied; one study suggests an impact on their immune systems.&lt;ref name="PFOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"&gt;Kellyn Betts [http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072861/ PFOS and PFOA in Humans: New Study Links Prenatal Exposure to Lower Birth Weight]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Environ Health Perspect. 2007 Nov; 115(11): A550. {{PMC|2072861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tox"/&gt;

The biochemical causes of toxicity are also unclear and may differ by molecule, health effect, and even animal. [[PPAR-alpha]] is a protein that interacts with PFAAs and is commonly implicated in contaminant-caused rodent cancers.&lt;ref name="PFOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tox"/&gt;

Less fluorinated chemicals (i.e. not perfluorinated compounds) can also be detected in the environment. Because biological systems do not metabolize fluorinated molecules easily, fluorinated pharmaceuticals like antibiotics and antidepressants can be found in treated city sewage and wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lietz|Meyer|2006|pp=7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorine-containing agrichemicals are measurable in farmland [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and nearby rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahrens|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6140">The '''Centro de Arte y Comunicación''' (CAyC) was an arts organization based in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], that was instrumental in creating an international arts movement based on the ideas of systems art within [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name=CVAA-GrupoCAyC-2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarti|first1=Graciela|title=Grupo CAyC|date=March 2013|publisher=Centro Virtual de Arte Argentino|location=Buenos Aires|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ImageTextConceptualArt-2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalyva|first1=Eve|title=Image and Text in Conceptual Art: Critical Operations in Context|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Cham, Switzerland|isbn=978-3-319-45086-5|pages=80-102|language=en|chapter=Chapter 3.5: "Art and Violence in the Open Air: The Activities of CAYC"|oclc=996426645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In August 1968, CAyC was established as a multidisciplinary workshop by [[Víctor Grippo]], [[Jacques Bedel]], [[Luis Fernando Benedit]], [[Alfredo Portillos]], [[Clorindo Testa]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], and [[Jorge González (artist)|Jorge González]].&lt;ref name=VictoriaAlbertMuseum-CAyC-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ravilious|first1=Ella|title=Centro de Arte y Comunicación (CAyC)|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/factory-presents/centro-de-arte-y-comunicacion-cayc|work=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jorge Glusberg was the main leader associated with CAyC.&lt;ref name=ImageTextConceptualArt-2016 /&gt;

In 1971, the "Grupo de los Trece" was created by Polish theater director [[Jerzy Grotowski]]. There were 13 artists who made up the group: [[Jacques Bedel]], [[Luis Fernándo Benedit]], [[Gregorio Dujovny]], [[Carlos Ginsburg]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], [[Victor Grippo]], [[Jorge González Mir]], [[Vicente Lucas Marotta]], [[Luis Pazos]], [[Alfredo Portillos]], [[Juan Carlos Romero (artist)|Juan Carlos Romero]], [[Julio Teich]], and [[Horacio Zabala]]. Additional artists who later joined were [[Leopoldo Maler]] and [[Clorindo Testa]]. In 1975, the group were formally named the "Grupo CAyC."&lt;ref name=BuenosAiresHerald-GlusbergAffair-2003&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tortosa|first1=Alina|title=The Glusberg affair in focus|url=http://alinatortosa.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-glusberg-affair-in-focus-jorge_25.html|work=[[Buenos Aires Herald]]|date=14 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was centered around the concept of "Arte de Sistemas" or Systemic Art.&lt;ref name=BuenosAiresHerald-GlusbergAffair-2003 /&gt;

In 1972, the "Scuola de Altos Estudios del CAyC" aka "Escuela de Altos Estudios" / "Escuela de Altos Estudios del Centro de Arte y Comunicación" was founded.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In the seventies CAyC became an international center for the [[Pop art]]-culture and the famous Museo de Arquitectura.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Well-known teachers at CAyC have included [[Justus Dahinden]] and [[Mario Botta]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

From 1968 until his death in early 2012, [[Jorge Glusberg]] was the Director of CAyC.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

A '''circle of stars''' often represents [[wiktionary:unity|unity]], [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] and [[harmony]] in [[flag]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Woman of the Apocalypse==
[[Image:10 Inmaculada Concepción (National Gallery de Londres, c. 1618).jpg|thumb|Diego Velázquez's ''Immaculate Conception'' 1618.]]
The [[New Testament]]'s [[Book of Revelation]] (12:1, 2 &amp; 5) describes the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]]: ''And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.  And she being with child cried, travailing in birth .... And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron:and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title= New Testament Revelation 12:1, &amp; 5
  | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012:1&amp;version=31;
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] tradition she has been identified with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], especially in connection with the [[Immaculate Conception]].  Mary is often pictured with a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Revelation of St John|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/d/durer/2/12/2apocaly/00title2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Circle of Stars.

The doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]] was somewhat controversial in the medieval church, and the liturgical Office for the feast was only established in 1615.  In 1649, [[Francisco Pacheco]] (father-in-law of [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]) published his ''Art of Painting'' firmly establishing the detailed correct iconography for paintings of the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, which included the circle of stars (he also advised the [[inquisition]] in Seville on artistic matters).  This was followed by [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] and his school in very many paintings, and influenced non-Spanish depictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coleccionbbva.com/media/files/P02146_Detailed%20analysis.pdf|title=Circle of stars Detailed analysis|publisher=www.coleccionbbva.com|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eduqna.com/Other/1539-general-5.html|title=What do the 12 stars |publisher=www.eduqna.com|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Flag==
{{further|Flag of Europe}}
The European flag consists of 12 golden stars in a circle on a blue background. The stars symbolise the ideals of unity, solidarity and harmony among the peoples of Europe.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/flag/index_en.htm|title=The European Flag|publisher=The European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The number of stars has nothing to do with the number of member countries, though the circle is a symbol of unity.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;
The European flag, first adopted by the [[Council of Europe]] is the symbol of [[Europe]]'s unity and identity in a wider sense, as well as the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;

[[Arsène Heitz]], one of the flag designers, in 1987 revealed that his inspiration was the crown of twelve stars of the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], often found in modern [[Marian iconography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=3332056|title=Real politics, at last|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2004-10-28|accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not suggest that the finished design held a religious meaning.
[[Paul M. G. Lévy]], the official responsible the design process, denied any religious inspiration for the flag design.&lt;ref name="Gialdino"&gt;
Carlo Curti Gialdino, ''I Simboli dell'Unione europea, Bandiera - Inno - Motto - Moneta - Giornata''. Roma:
Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato S.p.A., 2005.   {{ISBN|88-240-2503-X}}, pp. 80-85.
Gialdino is here cited after a translation of the Italian text published by the ''Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe'' ([http://www.cvce.eu/obj/carlo_curti_gialdino_the_symbols_of_the_european_union_origin_of_the_design_for_the_european_flag-en-df9f9dde-98a3-461b-a8a8-8f9c13012343.html cvce.eu])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=European Union: Myths on the flag|origyear=1995|year=2002|publisher=[[Flags Of The World]]|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/eu!myt.html|accessdate=4 August 2007}}
"While Count Coudenhove-Kalergi in a personal statement maintained that three leading Catholics within the Council had subconciously chosen the twelve stars on the model of Apocalypse 12:1, Paul M.G. Lévy, Press Officer of the Council from 1949 to 1966, explained in 1989 that there was no religious intention whatsoever associated with the choice of the circle of twelve stars." Peter Diem, 11 June 2002
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the European Parliament adopted the flag. In 1985, it was adopted by all EU leaders as the official emblem of the European Communities, and in 1993 inherited by the successor organisation, the European Union. All European institutions now use an emblem of their own.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;

==Zodiac==
[[Image:Beit Alpha.jpg|thumb|6th century synagogue Zodiac, Beit Alpha, Israel]]
The [[Zodiac]] is an ancient ''circle of stars''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffreyarmstrong.com/starbasedastrology.htm Jeffrey Armstrong | A Western Master of Eastern Wisdom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608092248/http://www.jeffreyarmstrong.com/starbasedastrology.htm |date=2008-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where some stars are [[symbol]]ically combined into 12 [[Star signs]] also known as [[constellation]]s. The etymology of the term [[Zodiac]] comes from the Latin zōdiacus, from the Greek ζῳδιακός [κύκλος], meaning "[circle] of animals", derived from ζῴδιον, the diminutive of ζῷον "animal".

==Crown of Immortality==
The [[Crown of Immortality]] is a separate and earlier motif (and [[metaphor]]) which also uses a circle of stars.  It has been widely used since the Early Church as a metaphor for the reward awaiting martyrs, but they are not depicted in art wearing a circle of stars.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  In art the use is mainly in Baroque allegorical compositions, and those with [[Ariadne]].

{{Genetics sidebar}}
'''Conservation genetics''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] subfield of [[Population genetics|Population Genetics]] that aims to understand the dynamics of genes in populations principally to avoid extinction. Therefore, it applies [[genetics|genetic]] methods to the conservation and restoration of [[biodiversity]].  Researchers involved in conservation genetics come from a variety of fields including [[population genetics]], [[molecular ecology]], [[molecular biology|biology]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[systematics]]. [[Genetic diversity]] is one of the three fundamental levels of biodiversity, so it is directly important in conservation. Genetic variability influences both the health and long-term survival of populations because decreased genetic diversity has been associated with reduced [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], such as high juvenile mortality, diminished population growth,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leberg|first=P.

==Genetic diversity==
[[Genetic diversity]] is the variability of genes in a species. A number of means can express the level of genetic diversity: observed [[Zygosity#heterozygosity|heterozygosity]], expected heterozygosity, the mean number of [[alleles]] per [[Locus (genetics)|locus]], or the percentage of [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] loci.

==Importance of genetic diversity==
[[Genetic diversity]] determines the potential fitness of a population and ultimately its long-term persistence, because genes encode phenotypic information. Extinction risk has been associated with low genetic diversity because several researchers have documented reduced fitness in populations with low genetic diversity. For example, low genetic diversity as low heterozigosity has been associated with low juvenile survival, reduced population growth, low body size, diminished adult lifespan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanski|first=Ilkka|last2=Saccheri|first2=Ilik|date=2006-04-25|title=Molecular-Level Variation Affects Population Growth in a Butterfly Metapopulation|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040129|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=4|issue=5|pages=e129|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040129|issn=1545-7885|pmc=1440940|pmid=16620151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lande|first=R.|date=1988-09-16|title=Genetics and demography in biological conservation|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/241/4872/1455|journal=Science|language=en|volume=241|issue=4872|pages=1455–1460|doi=10.1126/science.3420403|issn=0036-8075|pmid=3420403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drayton|first=J.

The importance of genetic diversity has many reasons. For example, one can consider the probability of within any given population that at least one individual or a potential reproductive pair have the genetic composition encoding a phenotype capable of survival an environment event. If l the individuals are nearly identical, if new pressures (such as environmental disasters) occur, a population with high genetic diversity has a greater chance of having at least some individuals with a genetic makeup that allows them to survive, or if genetic diversity is very low, none of the individuals in a population may have the characteristics needed to cope with the new environmental conditions. Such a population could be suddenly wiped out.

The genetic diversity of a species is always open to change. No matter how many variants of a gene are present in a population today, only the variants that survive in the next generation can contribute to species diversity in the future. Once gene variants are lost, they cannot be recovered.

==Techniques==
Specific genetic techniques are used to assess the genomes of a species regarding specific conservation issues as well as general population structure.&lt;ref name=Haig&gt;Haig&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis can be done in two ways, with current DNA of individuals or historic DNA.&lt;ref name=Wayne&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wayne, Robert|author2=Morin, Phillip|title=Conservation genetics in the new molecular age|journal=Front Ecol Evol|volume=2|issue=2|year=2004|pages=89–97|publisher=The Ecological Society of America|doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0089:CGITNM]2.0.CO;2|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229422875_Conservation_Genetics_in_the_New_Molecular_Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques for analysing the differences between individuals and populations include

#[[Alloenzymes]]
#[[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|Random fragment length polymorphisms]]
#[[Amplified fragment length polymorphism]]s
#[[RAPD|Random amplification of polymorphic DNA]]
#[[Single strand conformation polymorphism]]
#[[Minisatellite]]s
#[[Microsatellite (genetics)|Microsatellite]]s
#[[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s
#Dna [[DNA sequencing|Sequence]]

These different techniques focus on different variable areas of the genomes within animals and plants. The specific information that is required determines which techniques are used and which parts of the genome are analysed. For example, [[mitochondrial DNA]] in animals has a high substitution rate, which makes it useful for identifying differences between individuals. However, it is only inherited in the female line, and the mitochondrial genome is relatively small. In plants, the mitochondrial DNA has very high rates of structural mutations, so is rarely used for genetic markers, as the [[chloroplast genome]] can be used instead. Other sites in the genome that are subject to high mutation rates such as the [[major histocompatibility complex]], and the [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]] and [[minisatellite]]s are also frequently used.

These techniques can provide information on long-term conservation of genetic diversity and expound demographic and ecological matters such as taxonomy.&lt;ref name=Haig/&gt;

Another technique is using historic DNA for genetic analysis.  Historic DNA is important because it allows geneticists to understand how species reacted to changes to conditions in the past.  This is a key to understanding the reactions of similar species in the future.&lt;ref name=Wayne/&gt;

Techniques using historic DNA include looking at preserved remains found in museums and caves.&lt;ref name="Robert, pp. 89–97"&gt;Robert, pp. 89–97&lt;/ref&gt; Museums are used because there is a wide range of species that are available to scientists all over the world.  The problem with museums is that, historical perspectives are important because understanding how species reacted to changes in conditions in the past is a key to understanding reactions of similar species in the future.&lt;ref name="Robert, pp. 89–97"/&gt;  Evidence found in caves provides a longer perspective and does not disturb the animals.&lt;ref name="Robert, pp. 89–97"/&gt;

Another technique that relies on specific genetics of an individual is noninvasive monitoring, which uses extracted DNA from organic material that an individual leaves behind, such as a feather.&lt;ref name="Robert, pp. 89–97"/&gt; This too avoids disrupting the animals and can provide information about the sex, movement, kinship and diet of an individual.&lt;ref name="Robert, pp. 89–97"/&gt;

Other more general techniques can be used to correct genetic factors that lead to extinction and risk of extinction.  For example, when minimizing inbreeding and increasing genetic variation multiple steps can be taken. Increasing [[heterozygosity]] through immigration, increasing the generational interval through [[cryopreservation]] or breeding from older animals, and increasing the [[effective population size]] through equalization of family size all helps minimize inbreeding and its effects.&lt;ref name="Franklin 1995"&gt;{{harv|Frankham|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deleterious alleles arise through mutation, however certain recessive ones can become more prevalent due to inbreeding.&lt;ref name="Franklin 1995"/&gt; Deleterious mutations that arise from inbreeding can be removed by [[genetic purging|purging]], or natural selection.&lt;ref name="Franklin 1995"/&gt;  Populations raised in captivity with the intent of being reintroduced in the wild suffer from adaptations to captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Woodworth, Lynn; Montgomery, Margaret; Briscoe, David; Frankham, Richard|title=Rapid genetic deterioration in captive populations: causes and conservation implications|journal=Conservation Genetics|volume=3|issue=3|year=2002|pages=277–88|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|doi=10.1023/A:1019954801089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inbreeding depression, loss of genetic diversity, and genetic adaptation to captivity are disadvantageous in the wild, and many of these issues can be dealt with through the aforementioned techniques aimed at increasing heterozygosity.  In addition  creating a captive environment that closely resembles the wild and fragmenting the populations so there is less response to selection also help reduce adaptation to captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery&lt;/ref&gt;

Solutions to minimize the factors that lead to extinction and risk of extinction often overlap because the factors themselves overlap. For example, deleterious mutations are added to populations through mutation, however the deleterious mutations conservation biologists are concerned with are ones that are brought about by inbreeding, because those are the ones that can be taken care of by reducing inbreeding. Here the techniques to reduce inbreeding also help decrease the accumulation of deleterious mutations.

==Applications==
These techniques have wide ranging applications. One application of these specific molecular techniques is in defining species and sub-species of salmonids.&lt;ref name=Haig/&gt; [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridization]] is an especially important issue in salmonids and this has wide ranging conservation, political, social and economic implications. In Cutthroat Trout mtDNA and alloenzyme analysis, hybridization between native and non-native species was shown to be one of the major factors contributing to the decline in their populations. This led to efforts to remove some hybridized populations so native populations could breed more readily.  Cases like these impact everything from the economy of local fishermen to larger companies, such as timber. Specific molecular techniques led to a closer analysis of taxonomic relationships, which is one factor that can lead to extinctions if unclear.

==Implications==
New technology in conservation genetics has many implications for the future of conservation biology. At the molecular level, new technologies are advancing. Some of these techniques include the analysis of [[minisatellite]]s and [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]].&lt;ref name=Haig/&gt; These molecular techniques have wider effects from clarifying taxonomic relationships, as in the previous example, to determining the best individuals to reintroduce to a population for recovery by determining kinship. These effects then have consequences that reach even further. Conservation of species has implications for humans in the economic, social, and political realms.&lt;ref name=Haig/&gt; In the biological realm increased genotypic diversity has been shown to help ecosystem recovery, as seen in a community of grasses which was able to resist disturbance to grazing geese through greater genotypic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frankham, Richard|title=Ecosystem recovery enhanced by genotypic diversity|journal=Heredity|volume=95|page=183|year=2005|url=http://izt.ciens.ucv.ve/ecologia/Archivos/ECO_POB_2005/ECOPO7_2005/Frankham%202005.pdf|doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800706}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because species diversity increases ecosystem function, increasing biodiversity through new conservation genetic techniques has wider reaching effects than before.

A short list of studies a conservation geneticist may research include:

# [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] classification of species, subspecies, geographic races, and populations, and measures of [[phylogenetic diversity]] and uniqueness.
# Identifying [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] species, hybridization in natural populations, and assessing the history and extent of introgression between species.
# Population genetic structure of natural and managed populations, including identification of [[Evolutionary Significant Unit]]s (ESUs) and management units for conservation.
# Assessing genetic variation within a species or population, including small or [[endangered]] populations, and estimates such as effective population size (Ne).
# Measuring the impact of [[inbreeding depression|inbreeding]] and [[outbreeding depression]], and the relationship between heterozygosity and measures of fitness (see [[Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection]]).
# Evidence of disrupted mate choice and [[Reproductive strategy#Reproductive strategies|reproductive strategy]] in disturbed populations.
# [[Forensic]] applications, especially for the control of trade in endangered species.
# Practical methods for monitoring and maximizing genetic diversity during captive breeding programs and re-introduction schemes, including mathematical models and case studies.
# Conservation issues related to the introduction of [[genetically modified organisms]].
# The interaction between environmental contaminants and the biology and health of an organism, including changes in mutation rates and [[adaptation]] to local changes in the environment (e.g. [[industrial melanism]]). 
#New techniques for [[noninvasive genotyping]].

==Building==

The Copernicus Science Centre building has been erected on the bank of the [[Vistula River]] in the very heart of [[Warsaw]] (the corner of Wybrzeże Kościuszkowskie and Zajęcza streets, above the Wisłostrada tunnel). The building design was developed by young Polish architects from the firm RAr-2 in Ruda Śląska, who won an architectural competition for the Copernicus Science Centre facility in December 2005, with engineers [[Buro Happold]].

The Centre complex comprises: 
* a two-storey building with total floor-space of 15,000 square metres housing permanent and temporary exhibitions, laboratories and workshops, a conference centre, cafes and restaurants, plus office space and a distinctive rooftop garden
* a garage and a workshop on a subterranean level
* a multimedia planetarium housed within an intriguing boulder-shaped building, including an observation deck
* a surrounding Discovery Park, including open-air experimentation stations, an outdoor art gallery, and an amphitheatre.

==Permanent Exhibition==

Permanent Exhibition in the Copernicus Science Centre consists of over 400 interactive exhibits. The exhibition is divided into six sections concerning various fields of knowledge:

* On the Move
* Humans and the Environment
* Buzzz! - gallery for preschool children
* Lightzone
* Roots of Civilization
* RE: generation - gallery for young adults

==Planetarium The Heavens of Copernicus==

The Heavens of Copernicus is a modern planetarium where you can see more than just images of the starry sky and related films. The shows concern a variety of popular science issues, including from the field of astronomy, natural science and ethnography.

The shows are displayed on a spherical screen surrounding the audience on all sides. Thanks to this solution, the audience experiences a feeling of immersion in the displayed world, which is strengthened by the high quality sound system deployed around the dome.

==The ''Experiment!'' Exhibition and other activities of the Centre==
''Experiment!'' is the first exhibition to be organized by the Copernicus Science Centre. It made its premiere appearance at the [[Warsaw]] [[Science Picnic]] in June 2006, where more than 10,000 individuals visited it in a single day. Since September 2006, it has been traveling around large cities and small towns to give their residents an opportunity to try out the hands-on experiments on their own.

The Copernicus Science Centre also organizes ''Family Workshops'', where children (5–8 years old) together with their parents or carers can carry out experiments to help them better understand everyday phenomena (e.g. ''where does the current in electrical outlets come from, how does a TV set work or why does yeast make dough rise''). The children can easily repeat the experiments themselves at home.

The Centre takes part in various events popularizing science: the ''Summer'' and ''Winter in the City'' events, ''Science Festivals'' and the ''Summer with Radio'' event. For teachers, the Copernicus Science Centre organizes trainings and competitions.

==Form of organization==
The Copernicus Science Centre is a cultural institution established and financed by the [[City of Warsaw]], the [[Ministry of Science and Higher Education (Poland)|Minister of Science and Higher Education]], and the [[Ministry of National Education (Poland)|Minister of National Education]].

The '''cosmic distance ladder''' (also known as the '''extragalactic distance scale''') is the succession of methods by which [[astronomy|astronomers]] determine the [[distance]]s to celestial objects. A real ''direct'' distance measurement of an astronomical object is possible only for those objects that are "close enough" (within about a thousand [[parsec]]s) to Earth. The techniques for determining distances to more distant objects are all based on various measured correlations between methods that work at close distances and methods that work at larger distances. Several methods rely on a '''standard candle''', which is an astronomical object that has a known [[luminosity]].

The ladder analogy arises because no single technique can measure distances at all ranges encountered in astronomy. Instead, one method can be used to measure nearby distances, a second can be used to measure nearby to intermediate distances, and so on. Each rung of the ladder provides information that can be used to determine the distances at the next higher rung.

== Direct measurement ==

[[File:The Astonomer.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Statue of an astronomer and the concept of the cosmic distance ladder by the parallax method, made from the azimuth ring and other parts of the Yale–Columbia Refractor (telescope) (c 1925) wrecked by the [[2003 Canberra bushfires]] which burned out the [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]]; at [[Questacon]], [[Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]].]]

At the base of the ladder are ''fundamental'' distance measurements, in which distances are determined directly, with no physical assumptions about the nature of the object in question. The precise measurement of stellar positions is part of the discipline of [[astrometry]].

=== Astronomical unit ===
{{main article|Astronomical unit}}

Direct distance measurements are based upon the [[astronomical unit]] (AU), which is the distance between the [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]].
[[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's laws]] provide precise [[ratio]]s of the sizes of the orbits of objects orbiting the Sun, but provides no measurement of the overall scale of the orbit system. [[Radar]] is used to measure the distance between the orbits of the Earth and of a second body. From that measurement and the ratio of the two orbit sizes, the size of Earth's orbit is calculated. The Earth's orbit is known with an absolute precision of a few meters and a relative precision of a few {{val|1|e=-11}}.

Historically, observations of [[Transit of Venus#Scientific interest in transits|transits of Venus]] were crucial in determining the AU; in the first half of the 20th century, observations of [[asteroids]] were also important. Presently the orbit of Earth is determined with high precision using [[radar]] measurements of distances to [[Venus]] and other nearby planets and asteroids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ash |first1=M. E. |last2=Shapiro |first2=I. I. |last3=Smith |first3=W.

=== Parallax ===
{{main article|Parallax}}
{{see also|Stellar Parallax|Parsec}}

[[File:ParallaxeV2.png|thumb|right|Stellar parallax motion from annual parallax. Half the apex angle is the parallax angle.]]

The most important fundamental distance measurements come from trigonometric [[parallax]]. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the position of nearby stars will appear to shift slightly against the more distant background. These shifts are angles in an isosceles [[triangle]], with 2 [[astronomical unit|AU]] (the distance between the extreme positions of Earth's orbit around the Sun) making the base leg of the triangle and the distance to the star being the long equal length legs. The amount of shift is quite small, measuring 1 [[Minute and second of arc|arcsecond]] for an object at 1&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]]'s distance (3.26 [[light-year]]s) of the nearest stars, and thereafter decreasing in angular amount as the distance increases. Astronomers usually express distances in units of parsecs (parallax arcseconds); light-years are used in popular media.

Because parallax becomes smaller for a greater stellar distance, useful distances can be measured only for stars which are near enough to have a parallax larger than a few times the [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] of the measurement. Parallax measurements typically have an accuracy measured in milliarcseconds.&lt;ref&gt;

Stars have a velocity relative to the Sun that causes [[proper motion]] (transverse across the sky) and [[radial velocity]] (motion toward or away from the Sun). The former is determined by plotting the changing position of the stars over many years, while the latter comes from measuring the [[Doppler shift]] of the star's spectrum caused by motion along the line of sight. For a group of stars with the same spectral class and a similar magnitude range, a mean parallax can be derived from [[statistical analysis]] of the proper motions relative to their radial velocities. This [[statistical parallax]] method is useful for measuring the distances of bright stars beyond 50&amp;nbsp;parsecs and giant [[variable star]]s, including [[Cepheid variable|Cepheids]] and the [[RR Lyrae variable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

The motion of the Sun through space provides a longer baseline that will increase the accuracy of parallax measurements, known as [[Stellar parallax|secular parallax]]. For stars in the Milky Way disk, this corresponds to a mean baseline of 4 [[astronomical unit|AU]] per year, while for halo stars the baseline is 40 AU per year. After several decades, the baseline can be orders of magnitude greater than the Earth–Sun baseline used for traditional parallax. However, secular parallax introduces a higher level of uncertainty because the relative velocity of observed stars is an additional unknown. When applied to samples of multiple stars, the uncertainty can be reduced; the uncertainty is inversely proportional to the [[square root]] of the sample size.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Parallax#Dynamic or moving-cluster parallax|Moving cluster parallax]] is a technique where the motions of individual stars in a nearby star cluster can be used to find the distance to the cluster. Only [[open cluster]]s are near enough for this technique to be useful. In particular the distance obtained for the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] has historically been an important step in the distance ladder.

Other individual objects can have fundamental distance estimates made for them under special circumstances. If the expansion of a gas cloud, like a [[supernova remnant]] or [[planetary nebula]], can be observed over time, then an ''expansion parallax'' distance to that cloud can be estimated. Those measurements however suffer from uncertainties in the deviation of the object from sphericity. [[Binary star]]s which are both [[Binary star#Visual binaries|visual]] and [[Binary star#Spectroscopic binaries|spectroscopic]] binaries also can have their distance estimated by similar means, and don't suffer from the above geometric uncertainty. The common characteristic to these methods is that a measurement of angular motion is combined with a measurement of the absolute [[velocity]] (usually obtained via the [[Doppler effect#Astronomy|Doppler effect]]). The distance estimate comes from computing how far the object must be to make its observed absolute velocity appear with the observed angular motion.

Expansion parallaxes in particular can give fundamental distance estimates for objects that are very far, because supernova ejecta have large expansion velocities and large sizes (compared to stars). Further, they can be observed with radio [[Interferometry|interferometers]] which can measure very small angular motions. These combine to provide fundamental distance estimates to supernovae in other galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though valuable, such cases are quite rare, so they serve as important consistency checks on the distance ladder rather than workhorse steps by themselves.

== Standard candles&lt;!--'Standard candle' and 'Standard candles' redirects here--&gt; ==
Almost all astronomical objects used as physical distance indicators belong to a class that has a known brightness. By comparing this known [[luminosity]] to an object's observed brightness, the distance to the object can be computed using the [[inverse-square law]]. These objects of known brightness are termed '''standard candles'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

The brightness of an object can be expressed in terms of its [[absolute magnitude]]. This quantity is derived from the logarithm of its luminosity as seen from a distance of 10 [[parsec]]s. The [[apparent magnitude]], the magnitude as seen by the observer (an instrument called a [[bolometer]] is used), can be measured and used with the absolute magnitude to calculate the distance ''D'' to the object in kiloparsecs (where 1&amp;nbsp;kpc equals 1000&amp;nbsp;parsecs) as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;5 \cdot \log_{10} D = m - M - 10,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; D = 10^{(m -M -10)/5}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the apparent magnitude and ''M'' the absolute magnitude. For this to be accurate, both magnitudes must be in the same frequency band and there can be no relative motion in the radial direction.

Some means of correcting for interstellar [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], which also makes objects appear fainter and more red, is needed, especially if the object lies within a dusty or gaseous region.&lt;ref name=ctypeia&gt;

 |accessdate=30 January 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between an object's absolute and apparent magnitudes is called its [[distance modulus]], and astronomical distances, especially intergalactic ones, are sometimes tabulated in this way.

=== Problems ===
Two problems exist for any class of standard candle. The principal one is [[calibration]], that is the determination of exactly what the absolute magnitude of the candle is. This includes defining the class well enough that members can be recognized, and finding enough members of that class with well-known distances to allow their true absolute magnitude to be determined with enough accuracy. The second problem lies in recognizing members of the class, and not mistakenly using a standard candle calibration on an object which does not belong to the class. At extreme distances, which is where one most wishes to use a distance indicator, this recognition problem can be quite serious.

A significant issue with standard candles is the recurring question of how standard they are. For example, all observations seem to indicate that [[Type Ia supernova]]e that are of known distance have the same brightness (corrected by the shape of the light curve). The basis for this closeness in brightness is discussed below; however, the possibility exists that the distant Type Ia supernovae have different properties than nearby Type Ia supernovae. The use of Type Ia supernovae is crucial in determining the correct [[Physical cosmology|cosmological model]]. If indeed the properties of Type Ia supernovae are different at large distances, i.e. if the extrapolation of their calibration to arbitrary distances is not valid, ignoring this variation can dangerously bias the reconstruction of the cosmological parameters, in particular the reconstruction of the matter [[Friedmann equations|density parameter]].&lt;ref name="Lindenetal2009"&gt;

That this is not merely a philosophical issue can be seen from the history of distance measurements using [[Cepheid variable]]s. In the 1950s, [[Walter Baade]] discovered that the nearby Cepheid variables used to calibrate the standard candle were of a different type than the ones used to measure distances to nearby galaxies. The nearby Cepheid variables were [[Stellar population|population I]] stars with much higher [[metallicity|metal]] content than the distant [[Stellar population|population II]] stars. As a result, the population II stars were actually much brighter than believed, and when corrected, this had the effect of doubling the distances to the globular clusters, the nearby galaxies, and the diameter of the [[Milky Way]].

== Standard siren ==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}

[[Gravitational wave]]s originating from the [[Orbital decay|inspiral phase]] of compact binary systems, such as [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s, have the useful property that both the amplitude and shape of the emitted gravitational radiation depend strongly on the [[chirp mass]] of the system. By observing the waveform, the chirp mass can be computed, and thus the amplitude. Further, gravitational waves are not subject to [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] due to an absorbing intervening medium. (They ''are'' subject to [[gravitational lens]]ing, however.) Thus, such a gravitational wave source is a "standard siren" of known loudness.&lt;ref name=HendryWoan2007&gt;{{Cite journal

The ratio of the source and received amplitudes allows the distance to be computed. Therefore, a standard siren can be used as a distance indicator on a cosmic scale. When the collision can be observed optically as well (in the case of a [[kilonova]] such as [[GW170817]]), the Doppler shift can be measured and the Hubble constant computed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Standard ruler ==

Another class of physical distance indicator is the [[standard ruler]]. In 2008, galaxy diameters have been proposed as a possible standard ruler for cosmological parameter determination.&lt;ref name="Marinonietal2009"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the physical scale imprinted by [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO) in the early universe has been used. 
In the early universe (before [[Recombination_(cosmology)|recombination]]) the baryons and photons scatter off each other, and form a tightly-coupled fluid that can support sound waves. The waves are sourced by primordial density perturbations, and travel at speed that can be predicted from the baryon density and other cosmological parameters. The total distance that these sound waves can travel before recombination determines a fixed scale, which simply expands with the universe after recombination. BAO therefore provide a standard ruler that can be measured in galaxy surveys from the effect of baryons on the clustering of galaxies. The method requires an extensive galaxy survey in order to make this scale visible, but has been measured with percent-level precision (see [[baryon acoustic oscillations]]). The scale does depend on cosmological parameters like the baryon and matter densities, and the number of neutrinos, so distances based on BAO are more dependent on cosmological model than those based on local measurements.

[[Light echo]]s can be also used as standard rulers,&lt;ref&gt;

== Galactic distance indicators ==
{{see also|distance measures (cosmology)}}

With few exceptions, distances based on direct measurements are available only out to about a thousand parsecs, which is a modest portion of our own Galaxy. For distances beyond that, measures depend upon physical assumptions, that is, the assertion that one recognizes the object in question, and the class of objects is homogeneous enough that its members can be used for meaningful estimation of distance.

Physical distance indicators, used on progressively larger distance scales, include:
* [[Dynamical parallax]], uses orbital parameters of [[visual binary|visual binaries]] to measure the mass of the system, and hence use the [[Mass–luminosity relation#In astronomy|mass–luminosity relation]] to determine the luminosity
**[[Binary star|Eclipsing binaries]] — In the last decade, measurement of eclipsing binaries' fundamental parameters has become possible with 8-meter class telescopes. This makes it feasible to use them as indicators of distance. Recently, they have been used to give direct distance estimates to the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC), [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] (SMC), [[Andromeda Galaxy]] and [[Triangulum Galaxy]]. Eclipsing binaries offer a direct method to gauge the distance to galaxies to a new improved 5% level of accuracy which is feasible with current technology to a distance of around 3 Mpc (3 million parsecs).&lt;ref name="Bonanos2006"&gt;

=== Main sequence fitting ===

When the absolute magnitude for a group of stars is plotted against the [[Stellar classification|spectral classification]] of the star, in a [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], evolutionary patterns are found that relate to the mass, age and composition of the star. In particular, during their hydrogen burning period, stars lie along a curve in the diagram called the [[main sequence]]. By measuring these properties from a star's spectrum, the position of a main sequence star on the H–R diagram can be determined, and thereby the star's absolute magnitude estimated. A comparison of this value with the apparent magnitude allows the approximate distance to be determined, after correcting for interstellar [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] of the luminosity because of gas and dust.

In a gravitationally-bound [[star cluster]] such as the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]], the stars formed at approximately the same age and lie at the same distance. This allows relatively accurate main sequence fitting, providing both age and distance determination.

The extragalactic distance scale is a series of techniques used today by astronomers to determine the distance of cosmological bodies beyond our own galaxy, which are not easily obtained with traditional methods. Some procedures utilize properties of these objects, such as [[star]]s, [[globular cluster]]s, [[nebula]]e, and galaxies as a whole. Other methods are based more on the statistics and probabilities of things such as entire [[galaxy cluster]]s.

=== Wilson–Bappu effect ===
{{main article|Wilson–Bappu effect}}
Discovered in 1956 by [[Olin Chaddock Wilson|Olin Wilson]] and [[Vainu Bappu|M.K. Vainu Bappu]], the [[Wilson–Bappu effect]] utilizes the effect known as [[spectroscopic parallax]]. Many stars have features in their [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectra]], such as the [[Fraunhofer lines|calcium K-line]], that indicate their [[absolute magnitude]]. The distance to the star can then be calculated from its [[apparent magnitude]] using the [[distance modulus]].

There are major limitations to this method for finding stellar distances. The calibration of the spectral line strengths has limited accuracy and it requires a correction for [[interstellar extinction]]. Though in theory this method has the ability to provide reliable distance calculations to stars up to 7 megaparsecs (Mpc), it is generally only used for stars at hundreds of kiloparsecs (kpc).

=== Classical Cepheids ===

Beyond the reach of the [[Wilson–Bappu effect]], the next method relies on the period-luminosity relation of classical [[Cepheid variable]] stars. The following relation can be used to calculate the distance to Galactic and extragalactic classical Cepheids:

: &lt;math&gt; 5\log_{10}{d}=V+ (3.34) \log_{10}{P} - (2.45) (V-I) + 7.52 \,. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=benedict2007&gt;Benedict, G. Fritz et al.

: &lt;math&gt; 5\log_{10}{d}=V+ (3.37) \log_{10}{P} - (2.55) (V-I) + 7.48 \,. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=majaess2011&gt;Majaess, Daniel; Turner, David; Moni Bidin, Christian; Mauro, Francesco; Geisler, Douglas; Gieren, Wolfgang; Minniti, Dante; Chené, André-Nicolas; Lucas, Philip; Borissova, Jura; Kurtev, Radostn; Dékány, Istvan; Saito, Roberto K.

L2 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several problems complicate the use of Cepheids as standard candles and are actively debated, chief among them are: the nature and linearity of the period-luminosity relation in various passbands and the impact of metallicity on both the zero-point and slope of those relations, and the effects of photometric contamination (blending) and a changing (typically unknown) extinction law on Cepheid distances.&lt;ref name="stanekudalski1999"&gt;

Cepheid variable stars were the key instrument in Edwin Hubble's 1923 conclusion that [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]] (Andromeda) was an external galaxy, as opposed to a smaller nebula within the [[Milky Way]]. He was able to calculate the distance of M31 to 285 Kpc, today's value being 770 Kpc.

As detected thus far, NGC 3370, a spiral galaxy in the constellation Leo, contains the farthest Cepheids yet found at a distance of 29 Mpc. Cepheid variable stars are in no way perfect distance markers: at nearby galaxies they have an error of about 7% and up to a 15% error for the most distant.

=== Supernovae ===
[[File:SN1994D.jpg|thumb|[[SN 1994D]] (bright spot on the lower left) in the [[NGC 4526]] galaxy. Image by [[NASA]], [[ESA]], The Hubble Key Project Team, and The High-Z Supernova Search Team]]

There are several different methods for which [[supernova]]e can be used to measure extragalactic distances.

==== Measuring a supernova's photosphere ====
We can assume that a supernova expands in a spherically symmetric manner. If the supernova is close enough such that we can measure the angular extent, ''θ''(''t''), of its [[photosphere]], we can use the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω'' is angular velocity, ''θ'' is angular extent. In order to get an accurate measurement, it is necessary to make two observations separated by time Δ''t''. Subsequently, we can use

:&lt;math&gt;\ d = \frac{V_{ej}}{\omega} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where d is the distance to the supernova, ''V&lt;sub&gt;ej&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the supernova's ejecta's radial velocity (it can be assumed that ''V&lt;sub&gt;ej&lt;/sub&gt;'' equals ''V&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;'' if spherically symmetric).

This method works only if the supernova is close enough to be able to measure accurately the photosphere. Similarly, the expanding shell of gas is in fact not perfectly spherical nor a perfect blackbody. Also interstellar extinction can hinder the accurate measurements of the photosphere. This problem is further exacerbated by core-collapse supernova. All of these factors contribute to the distance error of up to 25%.

==== Type Ia light curves ====

[[Type Ia supernovae]] are some of the best ways to determine extragalactic distances. Ia's occur when a binary white dwarf star begins to accrete matter from its companion star. As the white dwarf gains matter, eventually it reaches its [[Chandrasekhar limit]] of &lt;math&gt; 1.4 M_{\odot} &lt;/math&gt;.

Once reached, the star becomes unstable and undergoes a runaway nuclear fusion reaction. Because all Type Ia supernovae explode at about the same mass, their absolute magnitudes are all the same. This makes them very useful as standard candles. All Type Ia supernovae have a standard blue and visual magnitude of

:&lt;math&gt;\ M_B \approx M_V \approx -19.3 \pm 0.3 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, when observing a Type Ia supernova, if it is possible to determine what its peak magnitude was, then its distance can be calculated. It is not intrinsically necessary to capture the supernova directly at its peak magnitude; using the '''multicolor light curve shape''' method ('''MLCS'''), the shape of the light curve (taken at any reasonable time after the initial explosion) is compared to a family of parameterized curves that will determine the absolute magnitude at the maximum brightness. This method also takes into effect interstellar extinction/dimming from dust and gas.

Similarly, the '''stretch method''' fits the particular supernovae magnitude light curves to a template light curve. This template, as opposed to being several light curves at different wavelengths (MLCS) is just a single light curve that has been stretched (or compressed) in time. By using this ''Stretch Factor'', the peak magnitude can be determined.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Using Type Ia supernovae is one of the most accurate methods, particularly since supernova explosions can be visible at great distances (their luminosities rival that of the galaxy in which they are situated), much farther than Cepheid Variables (500 times farther). Much time has been devoted to the refining of this method. The current uncertainty approaches a mere 5%, corresponding to an uncertainty of just 0.1 magnitudes.

==== Novae in distance determinations ====

[[Nova]]e can be used in much the same way as supernovae to derive extragalactic distances. There is a direct relation between a nova's max magnitude and the time for its visible light to decline by two magnitudes. This relation is shown to be:

:&lt;math&gt;\ M^\max_V = -9.96 - 2.31 \log_{10} \dot{x} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the time derivative of the nova's mag, describing the average rate of decline over the first 2 magnitudes.

After novae fade, they are about as bright as the most luminous Cepheid variable stars, therefore both these techniques have about the same max distance: ~ 20 Mpc. The error in this method produces an uncertainty in magnitude of about&amp;nbsp;±0.4

=== Globular cluster luminosity function ===

Based on the method of comparing the luminosities of globular clusters (located in galactic halos) from distant galaxies to that of the [[Virgo Cluster]], the [[globular cluster luminosity function]] carries an uncertainty of distance of about 20% (or&amp;nbsp;0.4 magnitudes).

US astronomer William Alvin Baum first attempted to use globular clusters to measure distant elliptical galaxies. He compared the brightest globular clusters in Virgo A galaxy with those in Andromeda, assuming the luminosities of the clusters were the same in both. Knowing the distance to Andromeda, Baum has assumed a direct correlation and estimated Virgo A's distance.

Baum used just a single globular cluster, but individual formations are often poor standard candles. Canadian astronomer [[René Racine]] assumed the use of the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) would lead to a better approximation. The number of globular clusters as a function of magnitude is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \Phi (m) = A e^{(m-m_0)^2/2\sigma^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the turnover magnitude, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the magnitude of the Virgo cluster, and sigma is the dispersion&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;1.4 mag.

It is important to remember that it is assumed that globular clusters all have roughly the same luminosities within the [[universe]]. There is no universal globular cluster luminosity function that applies to all galaxies.

=== Planetary nebula luminosity function ===
Like the GCLF method, a similar numerical analysis can be used for [[planetary nebula]]e (note the use of more than one!) within far off galaxies. The [[planetary nebula luminosity function]] (PNLF) was first proposed in the late 1970s by Holland Cole and David Jenner. They suggested that all planetary nebulae might all have similar maximum intrinsic brightness, now calculated to be M = −4.53. This would therefore make them potential standard candles for determining extragalactic distances.

Astronomer George Howard Jacoby and his colleagues later proposed that the PNLF function equaled:

:&lt;math&gt;\ N (M) \propto e^{0.307 M} (1 - e^{3(M^{*} - M)} ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Where N(M) is number of planetary nebula, having absolute magnitude M. M* is equal to the nebula with the brightest magnitude.

=== Surface brightness fluctuation method ===
[[File:Galaxy cluster Abell 2218 gravitaitonal lens.jpg|thumb|right|Galaxy cluster]]

The following method deals with the overall inherent properties of galaxies. These methods, though with varying error percentages, have the ability to make distance estimates beyond 100 Mpc, though it is usually applied more locally.

The [[surface brightness fluctuation]] (SBF) method takes advantage of the use of [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] cameras on telescopes. Because of spatial fluctuations in a galaxy's surface brightness, some pixels on these cameras will pick up more stars than others. However, as distance increases the picture will become increasingly smoother. Analysis of this describes a magnitude of the pixel-to-pixel variation, which is directly related to a galaxy's distance.

=== D–σ relation ===

The [[Sigma-D relation|D–σ relation]], used in [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]], relates the angular diameter (D) of the galaxy to its [[velocity dispersion]]. It is important to describe exactly what D represents, in order to understand this method. It is, more precisely, the galaxy's angular diameter out to the [[surface brightness]] level of 20.75 B-mag arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. This surface brightness is independent of the galaxy's actual distance from us. Instead, D is inversely proportional to the galaxy's distance, represented as d. Thus, this relation does not employ standard candles. Rather, D provides a [[standard ruler]]. This relation between D and σ is

:&lt;math&gt; \log (D) = 1.333 \log (\sigma) + C \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Where C is a constant which depends on the distance to the galaxy clusters.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

This method has the potential to become one of the strongest methods of galactic distance calculators, perhaps exceeding the range of even the Tully–Fisher method. As of today, however, elliptical galaxies aren't bright enough to provide a calibration for this method through the use of techniques such as Cepheids. Instead, calibration is done using more crude methods.

== Overlap and scaling ==
A succession of distance indicators, which is the distance ladder, is needed for determining distances to other galaxies. The reason is that objects bright enough to be recognized and measured at such distances are so rare that few or none are present nearby, so there are too few examples close enough with reliable trigonometric parallax to calibrate the indicator. For example, Cepheid variables, one of the best indicators for nearby [[Spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], cannot yet be satisfactorily calibrated by parallax alone, though the Gaia space mission is expected to solve that specific problem. The situation is further complicated by the fact that different stellar populations generally do not have all types of stars in them. Cepheids in particular are massive stars, with short lifetimes, so they will only be found in places where stars have very recently been formed. Consequently, because [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] usually have long ceased to have large-scale star formation, they will not have Cepheids. Instead, distance indicators whose origins are in an older stellar population (like novae and RR Lyrae variables) must be used. However, RR Lyrae variables are less luminous than Cepheids, and novae are unpredictable and an intensive monitoring program—and luck during that program—is needed to gather enough novae in the target galaxy for a good distance estimate.

Because the more distant steps of the cosmic distance ladder depend upon the nearer ones, the more distant steps include the effects of [[error]]s in the nearer steps, both systematic and statistical ones. The result of these [[propagation of uncertainty|propagating errors]] means that distances in astronomy are rarely known to the same level of precision as measurements in the other sciences, and that the precision necessarily is poorer for more distant types of object.

Another concern, especially for the very brightest standard candles, is their "standardness": how homogeneous the objects are in their true absolute magnitude. For some of these different standard candles, the homogeneity is based on theories about the [[star formation|formation]] and [[stellar evolution|evolution]] of stars and galaxies, and is thus also subject to uncertainties in those aspects. For the most luminous of distance indicators, the Type Ia supernovae, this homogeneity is known to be poor&lt;ref name="Gilfanov2010"&gt;{{cite journal

The observational result of Hubble's Law, the [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] relationship between distance and the speed with which a galaxy is moving away from us (usually referred to as [[redshift]]) is a product of the cosmic distance ladder. [[Edwin Hubble]] observed that fainter galaxies are more redshifted. Finding the value of the Hubble constant was the result of decades of work by many astronomers, both in amassing the measurements of galaxy redshifts and in calibrating the steps of the distance ladder. Hubble's Law is the primary means we have for estimating the distances of [[quasar]]s and distant galaxies in which individual distance indicators cannot be seen.

'''Cultural relativism''' is the view that [[culture]]s are merely different, not deficient, and each culture’s norms and practices should be assessed only from the perspective of the culture itself, not by standards embraced by another culture.  It is the idea that one cannot make judgments about a culture just because they are not a part of [[one's own]].  Outsiders should be able to see the cultural from a neutral perspective and not judge the culture before understanding it.  Each culture should be viewed with [[respect]] and as an equal because no one culture is better than any other. They should be allowed to practice their own '''beliefs''', what a cultures believes to be true, and '''values''', a shared view about what is right.  Cultural relativism emphasizes that '''[[ethnocentrism]]''', which is the belief that one’s culture is superior to everyone else’s, should not be forced upon cultures, and cultures should remain unprejudiced toward each other.  Cultural relativism is the moral and ethical way to look at different cultures.

==Overview==
'''Intracultural miscommunication''' draws on the fact that all humans subconsciously reflect their cultural backgrounds in day to day [[communication]].  Culture does not just lie in the way one eats or dresses, but in the manner in which [[people]] present themselves as an entity to the outside world.  [[Language]] is a huge proponent of communication, as well as a large representation of one's cultural background.  '''Cultural [[miscommunication]]''' often stems from different and conflicting styles of speech and messages.  A perfectly normal intonation pattern for a native German speaker may seem angry and aggressive to a foreign listener.  Connotations of words, as well as meanings of [[slang]] phrases[[,]] vary greatly across cultural lines, and a lack of tolerance and understanding of this fact often results in misinterpretations.

[[Non-verbal communication]] greatly varies across cultural lines.  One must take the time to study different cultures so as to fully understand messages being transmitted.  There are many aspects of non-verbal communication, such as [[gesture]], [[facial expression]] and [[inter-personal]] space, that affect the way a message is construed.

'''High- and low-power distance:''' 
'''[[Power distance]]''' is the degree of equality, or inequality, between people in a particular society. The lower the power distance of a country, the more dominant individuality and individual rights are. When power distance is low, society does not emphasize people’s status, power, or wealth. In other words, individualistic cultures have low power distance and collectivist cultures have high power distance. Examples of countries with high power distance include [[Malaysia]], [[Russia]], and [[Romania]] while countries with low power distance include [[Austria]], [[Israel]], and [[Denmark]].

'''Individualism–collectivism (the Me–We dimension):'''The '''[[individualism]]-[[collectivism]] dimension''' is thought to be the most important of all value dimensions that distinguish cultures.
The '''individualist culture''' has a “me” consciousness.  Individuals are loosely linked to each other, but largely independent of group identification.  Emphasis is placed on the self; they are motivated by their own preferences, needs, and goals, and personal achievement and initiative are stressed.  Words such as “independence,” “self,” “privacy,” and “rights” are common in individualistic cultural conversations.  Examples of individualistic societies would be the [[United States]], or [[Western Europe]] countries.

The '''collectivist culture''' has a “we” consciousness.  Individuals are closely linked to one or more groups.  Commitment to these valued groups is a primary goal of collectivists, and they tend to look to the goals and successes of the group rather than to the individuals.  Words such as “loyalty,” “responsibility,” and “community” permeate collectivist cultural conversations.  Examples of collectivist societies are many [[Asia]]n, [[Africa]]n, and [[South America]]n cultures.

[[File:Jury international01.jpg|thumb{{largethumb}}|The same group will offer a majority vote for, as well as against, a plan depending on how the group is polled.]]

'''Discursive dilemma''' or '''doctrinal paradox''' is a [[paradox]] in [[social choice theory]]. The paradox is that aggregating judgments with [[majority voting]] can result in self-contradictory judgments.

Consider a community voting on a road repairs. The same group may return a "Yes" if asked three questions, but a "No" if asked one question. This paradox emerges because the community may vote 'Yes' - the roads are important, and 'Yes' - the weather is right for road repair, and 'Yes' - there are available funds for the repairs. However, due to complexity of individual opinion and disagreement, the majority may at the same time rule that "No, all three requirements for road repair are not present". Thus the road repair team gets different feedback depending on how they poll their community.

Philosopher Philip Pettit believes the discursive dilemma makes it impossible to make simple statements about the beliefs of a collective.

==Overview==
Princeton philosopher Philip Pettit says there are hidden challenges of describing the group as though it were a single individual - a metaphorical agent - the way the law sometimes talks about corporations. It is a mistake, he says, to think things can be that simple.

In reality, it can be quite difficult to construct a model of the "group mind" by merely asking for a majority opinion. This is because contradictory conceptions of a group can emerge depending on the type of questioning that is chosen.&lt;ref name=Pettit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophybites.com/2010/12/philip-pettit-on-group-agency.html|title=Philip Pettit on Group Agency|publisher=philosophybites.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To see how, imagine that a three-member court must decide whether someone is liable for a breach of contract. For example, a lawn caretaker is accused of violating a contract not to mow over the land-owner's roses. The judges have to decide which of the following propositions are true:
* ''P'': the defendant did a certain action (i.e. did the caretaker mow over the roses?);
* ''Q'': the defendant had a contractual obligation not to do that action (i.e. was there a contract not to mow over the roses?);
* ''C'': the defendant is liable.
Additionally, all judges accept the proposition &lt;math&gt;C \equiv P \land Q&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the judges agree that a defendant should be liable if and only if the two propositions, P and Q, are both true.

Each judge could make consistent (non-contradictory) judgments, and the paradox will still emerge. Most judges could think P is true, and most judges could think Q is true. In this example, that means they would vote that the caretaker probably mowed over the roses, and that the contract did indeed forbid that action. This suggests the caretaker is ''liable''. 

At the same time, most judges may think that P and Q are not both true at once. In this example, that means most judges conclude the caretaker is ''not liable''. The table above illustrates how majority decisions can contradict (because the judges vote in favor of the premises, and yet reject the conclusion). The paradox lies in choosing between two group liability opinions.

==Explanation==
This dilemma results because an actual decision-making procedure might be premise-based or conclusion-based. In a premise-based procedure, the judges decide by voting whether the conditions for liability are met. In a conclusion-based procedure, the judges decide directly whether the defendant should be liable. In the above formulation, the paradox is that the two procedures don't necessarily lead to the same result; the two procedures can even lead to opposite results.

Pettit believes that the lesson of this paradox is that there is no simple way to aggregate individual opinions into a single, coherent "group entity". These ideas are relevant to [[sociology]], which endeavors to understand and predict group behaviour. Petitt warns that we need to understand groups because they can be very powerful, can effect greater change, and yet the group as a whole may not have a strong conscience (see [[Diffusion of responsibility]]). He says we sometimes fail to hold groups (e.g. corporations) responsible because of the difficulties described above. [[Collective responsibility]] is important to sort out, and Petitt insists that groups should have limited rights, and various obligations and checks on their power.&lt;ref name=Pettit/&gt;

The discursive dilemma (which concerns general proposition sets) can be seen as a generalization of the [[Condorcet paradox]] (which concerns preference sets, a kind of proposition set). Furthermore, the Condorcet paradox can be generalized to [[Arrow's theorem]]. List and Pettit argue that the discursive dilemma can be likewise generalized to a sort of "List-Pettit theorem". Their theorem states that the inconsistencies remain for any aggregation method which meets a few natural conditions.

'''Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder''' (DSED) or '''Disinhibited Attachment Disorder of Childhood''' is an [[attachment disorder]] that consists of "a pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and interacts with unfamiliar adults." and which "...significantly impairs young children’s abilities to relate interpersonally to adults and peers."&lt;ref name="Theravive" &gt;''Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders'' (5th ed.). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing quoted in [http://www.theravive.com/therapedia/Disinhibited-Social-Engagement-Disorder-DSM--5-313.89-(F94.2) The Theravive website]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sitting on the lap of a stranger or peer, or leaving with a stranger. DSED is exclusively a childhood disorder and is not diagnosed before the age of nine months or if symptoms did not appear until after the age of five. Infants and very young children are at risk if they receive inconsistent or insufficient care from a primary caregiver.

==Symptoms==
The most obvious symptom is "...the absence of normal fear or discretion when approaching strangers. The child is unusually comfortable talking to, touching, and leaving a location with an adult stranger."&lt;ref name="Theravive"/&gt; DSED has some similar symptoms of [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]] (ADHD).
===Comorbidity===
Cognitive delay

Language delay

Speech delay&lt;ref name="ccpcchicago.org"/&gt;

==Risk factors==
DSED is a result of inconsistent or absent connection to a primary caregiver in the first years of life. Children who are institutionalized may receive inconsistent care, isolation during hospitalization, and parental problems such as mental health problems which interfere with attachment such as depression or a personality disorder, absence, poverty, teen parenting, or substance abuse. DSED "...may have a biological cause in some cases (e.g., [[Williams syndrome]])."

==Diagnosis==
The criteria for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder in the DSM-5:

A. A pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and interacts with unfamiliar adults and exhibits at least two of the following:

# Reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with unfamiliar adults.
# Overly familiar verbal or physical behavior (that is not consistent with culturally sanctioned and with age-appropriate social boundaries).
# Diminished or absent checking back with adult caregiver after venturing away, even in unfamiliar settings.
# Willingness to go off with an unfamiliar adult with little or no hesitation.

B. The behaviors in Criterion A are not limited to impulsivity (as in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) but include socially disinhibited behavior.

C.  The child has exhibited a pattern of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced by at least one of the following:

# Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of having basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation and affection met by caregiving adults.
# Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit ability to form stable attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care).
# Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to form selective attachments (e.g., institutions with high child to caregiver ratios).

D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed behavior in Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A began following the pathogenic care in Criterion C).

E. The child has a developmental age of at least nine months."&lt;ref&gt;[http://drgrcevich.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/disinhibited-social-engagement-disorder/ Steve Grcevich. "Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder". Church4EveryChild June 18, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Specifiers'''

It is considered persistent if the duration is more than 12 months.

It is considered severe if all the symptoms are present.&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2013"/&gt;

The ICD-10 definition is: "A particular pattern of abnormal social functioning that arises during the first five years of life and that tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances, e.g. diffuse, nonselectively focused attachment behaviour, attention-seeking and indiscriminately friendly behaviour, poorly modulated peer interactions; depending on circumstances there may also be associated emotional or behavioural disturbance."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ylb6Qw8PVEC ''International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems''. 10th revision. ed. Geneva: World Health Organization, 19921994. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Differential diagnosis===
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder&lt;ref name="ccpcchicago.org"&gt;https://www.ccpcchicago.org/xm_client/client_documents/Fostering%20Connections%20CCPC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Two effective treatment approaches are [[play therapy]] and [[expressive therapy]] help form attachment through multi-sensory means and some therapy can be non-verbal. {{&lt;ref&gt;Steffen, H. (2007). Integrative Expressive Therapy: A program development for children. The Chicago School of Professional Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Epidemiology==
The exact prevalence is unknown. In high risk individuals, the prevalence rate is 20%.&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2013"&gt;American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Arlington, VA, American Psychiatric Association, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSM-5 313.89 (F94.2)) is the 2013 [[DSM-5|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)]] name formerly listed as a subtype of [[reactive attachment disorder]] (RAD) called ''disinhibited attachment disorder'' (DAD). The corresponding disorder in [[ICD-10]] is Disinhibited Attachment Disorder of Childhood.

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] considers "...disinhibited social engagement disorder more closely resembles ADHD; it may occur in children who do not necessarily lack attachments and may have established or even secure attachments. The two disorders differ in other important ways, including correlates, course, and response to intervention, and for these reasons are considered separate disorders."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204551/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf |date=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecotoxicology''' is the study of the effects of [[toxic]] [[chemicals]] on [[biological]] [[organisms]], especially at the [[population biology|population]], [[biological community|community]], [[ecosystem]], and [[biosphere]] levels. Ecotoxicology is a multidisciplinary field, which integrates [[toxicology]] and [[ecology]].

The ultimate goal of this approach is to be able to reveal and to predict the effects of pollution within the context of all other environmental factors. Based on this knowledge the most efficient and effective action to prevent or remediate any detrimental effect can be identified. In those [[ecosystems]] that are already impacted by pollution ecotoxicological studies can inform as to the best course of action to restore [[ecosystem services]] and functions efficiently and effectively.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Ecotoxicology differs from [[environmental toxicology]] in that it integrates the effects of stressors across all levels of biological organisation from the molecular to whole communities and ecosystems, whereas environmental toxicology focuses upon effects at the level of the individual and below.&lt;ref&gt;Maltby &amp; Naylor, 1990: {{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The publication in 1962 of [[Rachel Carson]]'s seminal volume, [[Silent Spring]] catalysed the separation of environmental toxicology – and, subsequently, ecotoxicology – from classical toxicology.  The revolutionary element in Carson's work was her extrapolation from single-organism effects to effects at the whole ecosystem and the "balance of nature"&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman et al., 2006: {{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "ecotoxicology" was coined by [[René Truhaut]] in 1969 who defined it as "the branch of [[toxicology]] concerned with the study of toxic effects, caused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of [[ecosystems]], animal (including human), vegetable and microbial, in an integral context”&lt;ref&gt;Truhaut, 1977: {{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although initially devoted to the study of anthropogenic toxicants, the term is now used to describe research into the ecological effects of diverse abiotic and biotic stresses, thereby integrating secondary effects of anthropogenic activities such as [[ocean acidification]] resulting from increased dissolution of [[carbon dioxide]] into the surface waters of the oceans &lt;ref&gt;Harley et al., 2006: {{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that this broadening of focus from purely toxicological effects to the consideration of more general stressors moves beyond the definition of "ecotoxicology". Van Straalen (2003), in particular, argued that the field had diversified to become ''Stress Ecology'' and that, as the effects of anthropogenic toxicants compound existing, natural stressors, exclusive study of their effects in an ecological context was nonsensical. Whilst this proposal is well argued, it is odd of Van Straalen to have specified solely "ecology" as the field when the original field of ecotoxicology was intended to cover all levels of biological organisation from molecular-level causes to ecosystem-level effects. Therefore, the term ''Stress Biology'' would seem more appropriate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Common environmental toxicants==
* PCBs ([[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s) – found in coolant and insulating fluids, pesticide extenders, [[adhesive]]s, and [[hydraulic fluid]]s.
* [[Pesticides]] – used widely for preventing, destroying, or repelling any organism that may be considered harmful. Commonly found in commercially grown fruits, vegetables, and meats. [[Parathion#Parathion-methyl|Methyl parathion]] is a commonly used pesticide used for agricultural reasons.  Methyl parathion causes the formation of toxic mediums for humans, soil and water, fresh water fish, and other hydrophilous organisms in the ecosystem.  Methyl parathion proposes numerous health risk factors that are life-threatening.&lt;ref&gt;Erkan Kalipci&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mold]] and other [[mycotoxin]]s.
* [[Phthalate]]s are found in plastic wrap, [[plastic bottle]]s, and plastic food storage containers, all of which make up a considerable part of household [[plastic waste]].
* VOCs ([[volatile organic compounds]]) – such as [[formaldehyde]]; can be found in drinking water and sewage systems.
* [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|Dioxins]] are a class of chemical compounds that are formed as a result of combustion processes such as waste incineration and from burning fuels like wood, coal, and oil.
* [[Asbestos]] is found in the insulation of flows, ceilings, water pipes, and heating ducts.
* [[Heavy metals]] include arsenic, mercury, lead, aluminum, and cadmium, which are found in fish, and pesticides.
* [[Chloroform]] is used to make other chemicals.
* [[Chlorine]] is commonly found in [[household cleaner]]s.

==Exposure to toxic chemicals==
* Chemicals propose the risk of killing off another animal's food supply that changes the overall population of the prey
* Animals can go to the brink of extinction because of the food chain that exists through the different communities.  For example, bald eagles, ospreys, and peregrine falcons were facing extinction because their food sources(fish and other birds) were contaminated with toxins.
* We are all connected between the communities of living things.  Plants can absorb toxins through their roots and leaves.  Animals and humans are always exposed to chemicals by the air we breathe, things we touch, and what we put in our mouth.
* Animals and humans can also eat other animals or plants that are already poisoned, which will continue the spread of chemicals, which is referred to as secondary poisoning&lt;ref&gt;Oregon State University 2011, March&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on individuals and entire population==
* Direct effects – direct consumption of a toxin or something that has been contaminated with a toxin by breathing, eating, or drinking.
* Developmental and reproductive problems
* Indirect effects – organisms directly affected by the loss of food, which has declined due to toxins.
* Sub-lethal effects –  toxins that do not kill but make the organism sick or make it change its behavior;&lt;ref&gt;Relyea, R. and Hoverman, J. (2006),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tran, D. et al. (2010) Aquaculture 298: 338–345&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increased sensitivity to toxicants when additional environmental stressors are present&lt;ref&gt;Liess et al. (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;
* With chronic use of pesticides, this runs the risk of causing abnormalities in chromosome structure in humans, as well as affecting the reproduction, nervous and cardiovascular system of any animals exposed.
* The genetics can be affected by toxicant exposure, direct changes can occur to the DNA, and if not repaired, the changes can lead to the appearance mutations&lt;ref&gt;Newman, M. C., &amp; Jagoe, C. H.1996&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contaminants can modify the distribution of individuals in a population, effective population size, mutation rate and migration rate&lt;ref&gt;Newman, M. C., &amp; Clements, W. H.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of ecotoxicity on a community==
* Predator-prey relationships – either the predator is affected by the toxin resulting in a decline of predator population and thus increasing the prey population; or the prey population is affected by the toxin resulting in a decline in the prey population that, in essence, will cause a decline in the predator population due to lack of food resources&lt;ref&gt;Oregon State University.2011, March&lt;/ref&gt;
* Community ecotoxicology studies the effects of all contaminants on patterns and species abundance, diversity, community composition, and species interactions.  Communities that rely heavily on competition and predation will have a difficult time responding and thriving in disturbances from contaminants.  A community that is species-rich will have a better chance recovering from an exotoxin disturbance, rather than a community that is not species-rich.  A species could be easily wiped out to the expense of a contamination from foreign chemicals.  Protecting distinct community levels, such as species richness and diversity is essential for maintaining a healthy, well-balanced ecosystem&lt;ref&gt;Clements, William and Jason Rohr&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overall effects==
Chemicals are shown to prohibit the growth of seed germination of an arrangement of different plant species.  Plants are what make up the most vital trophic level of the biomass pyramids, known as the primary producers.  Because they are at the bottom of the pyramid, every other organism in an ecosystem relies on the health and abundance of the primary producers in order to survive.   If plants are battling problems with diseases relating to exposure to chemicals, other organisms will either die because of starvation or obtain the disease by eating the plants or animals already infected.  So ecotoxicology is an ongoing battle that stems from many sources and can affect everything and everyone in an ecosystem &lt;ref&gt;An J, Zhou Q, Sun Y, Xu Z&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ways of prevention==
Regulation:
* In the United States, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) reviews all pesticides before the products are registered for sale to ensure that the benefits will outweigh the risks.
* [[Food Quality Protection Act]] and the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] were passed in 1996, which required EPA to screen pesticide chemical for potential to produce harmful effects.
* Keep close track of the labeling when using a fertilizer, or pesticide.  Try to look for products that will have less of an impact on the environment &lt;ref&gt;Agency, United States Environmental Protection&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are many federal and state laws protecting birds, animals, and rare plants.  But the first order of protection comes from us taking steps to avoid harm since we are the main source of all the toxins.
*Proper waste disposal

==Ecotoxicity testing== 
* Acute and chronic toxicity tests are performed for terrestrial organisms including avian, mammalian, nontarget arthropods, and earthworms.
* The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) test guideline has developed specific tests to test toxicity level in organisms.  Ecotoxicological studies are generally performed in compliance with international guidelines, including EPA, OECD, EPPO, OPPTTS, SETAC, IOBC, and JMAFF.
* LC50 is the acute toxicity test that tests for the concentrate of tissue at which it is lethal to 50% within the test-specified time. The test may start with eggs, embryos, or juveniles and last from 7 to 200 days.
* EC50 is the concentration that causes adverse effects in 50% of the test organisms (for a binary yes/no effect such as mortality or a specified sublethal effect) or causes a 50% (usually) reduction in a non-binary parameter such as growth.
* Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP)
* Tier 1 screening battery
* Endangered species assessments.
* Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Inherently Toxic (PBiT) assessments using the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) to categorize regulated substances.
* [[Bioaccumulation]] in fish using the Bioconcentration Factor (BCF) methods.&lt;ref&gt;The Humane Society of the United States. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of ecotoxicity==
Total amount of acute toxicity is directly related to the classification of toxicity.

&lt; 1 part per million → Class I

1–10 parts per million → Class II

10–100 parts per million → Class III
&lt;ref&gt;The Humane Society of the United States. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6138">'''Elegiac comedy''' was a [[genre]] of [[medieval Latin]] [[Latin literature|literature]]—or [[Medieval theatre|drama]]—which survives as a collection of about twenty texts written in the 12th and 13th centuries in the liberal arts schools of west central France (roughly the [[Loire Valley]]). Though commonly identified in [[manuscript]]s as ''comoedia'', modern scholars often reject their status as [[comedy]]. Unlike [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] comedy, they were written in [[elegiac couplet]]s. Denying their true comedic nature, [[Edmond Faral]] called them '''Latin ''fabliaux''''', after the later [[Old French]] ''[[fabliaux]]'', and [[Ian Thomson (antiquary)|Ian Thomson]] labelled them '''Latin comic tales'''. Other scholars have invented terms like '''verse tales''', '''rhymed monologues''', '''epic comedies''', and '''Horatian comedies''' to describe them.&lt;ref&gt;Roy (1974), 258 n. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin "comedies", the dramatic nature of which varies greatly, may have been the direct ancestors of the ''fabliaux'' but more likely merely share similarities. Other interpretations have concluded that they are primitive [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]], student [[juvenilia]], didactic poems, or merely collections of elegies on related themes.

Some elegiac comedies were adapted into [[vernacular]] language in the later Middle Ages, and retold by major vernacular writers such as [[Boccaccio]], [[Chaucer]], and [[John Gower|Gower]]. The poem ''Pamphilus'' has [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Old French]] versions.

==Style==
These comedies were composed in a high style, but they were typically about low or unimportant subject matter; [[Lyric poetry|lyric complaints]] only sometimes mixed with amorous content. They combined the plot and character types of the [[New comedy|Greek "new comedy"]] practised by [[Terence]] and [[Plautus]], but the greatest influence on them was [[Ovid]]. His ''[[Ars amatoria]]'', ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'', and ''[[Heroides]]'' were highly influential. [[Plautus]], though less widely read in the Middle Ages, was also an influence, as were the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] debates concerning the nature of [[universals]] and other contemporary philosophical problems, with which the elegiac comedies often dealt, always humorously but no doubt sometimes to a serious end.

The elegiac dramatists delight in "showing off" their Latin skills. Their use of rhetoric, logic, and various grammatical constructions suggest that they may have been used in the schools as exercises in poetic composition and philosophical argument. The language of their "fools" can be deliberately outlandish, and their deft use of puns is frequently sexual in nature. [[Parody]] is another typical element of elegiac humour. Persons of low rank are often placed in positions unsuited to them. Their bumbling, as when a rustic attempts to speak philosophically or the commoner pretends he is a chivalrous gentleman, is portrayed for its [[Satire|satiric]] effect. Satire is often employed in long digressions criticizing the corruption of the times, specifically targeting the selling of church offices, political corruption at court, sycophants’ attempts to rise in society, and aristocrats’ attempts to philosophize. In the Middle Ages, satire was usually considered a breed of comedy.

==Dramatic features==
The comedies were often about a sexual conquest, in which the lover must use his guile to overcome obstacles such as guardians, rivals, and reluctance on the part of the woman. The setting is some unspecified time contemporary with the poet, and the characters are all typical and have names descriptive of their traits and function in the story. The lack of resources on the part of the hero forces him to resort to deception and to employ intermediaries (as Ovid did in his narratives) in order to win the object of his desire.

The elegiac comedies bear limited dramatic features. Thompson denies their theatricality, saying that "no ancient drama would ever have been written in elegiacs." A similar opinion is that the comedies are [[rhetoric]]al exercises. Medieval poetic theory, however, did not regard comedy and elegy as mutually exclusive, nor identical. [[John of Garland]] wrote "all comedy is elegy, but the reverse is not true." Other arguments raised against the dramatic performance of the comedies is, in general, their large number of narrative segments as opposed to dialogue. [[Arnulf of Orléans (commentator)|Arnulf of Orléans]], one of the elegiac writers, seems to have considered his work to have been made for the stage. These performances may have been narrated, mimed, or sung.

'''Flora Elizabeth Burchenal''' (October 18, 1875 – November 21, 1959) was an American [[folk dance]] educator. She was a teacher of dance in the New York state public school system as well as an inspector of athletics for the New York Department of Education. Burchenal influenced the cultural conduct of recreational life in the United States, Canada and Europe.

== Early life ==

Burchenal was born on October 18, 1875,{{efn|She subsequently shaved several years off her age, giving her birthdate in 1924 as October 18, 1880&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Burchenal, 53, born Richmond, Ind. 10/18/80. ''New York, Passenger Lists, 1820-1957''&lt;/ref&gt; and October 18, 1881 in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Burchenal, "I solemnly swear I was born at Richmond, in the State of Indiana, on or about the 18th day of October, 1881." ''U.S. Passport Applications, 1795-1925''&lt;/ref&gt; and year of birth as 1885 in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Burchenal; age 40, born Richmond, Indiana, 1885. ''New York, Passenger Lists, 1820-1957''&lt;/ref&gt;}} in [[Richmond, Indiana]] to Charles Henry Burchenal and his second wife, Mary Elizabeth Day.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}}  Her father was a [[Quaker]],&lt;ref&gt;Death of Chas H Burchenal; ''Quaker Meeting Records, 1681-1935''&lt;/ref&gt; and a prominent attorney born in Maryland.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Elizabeth Burchenal, Folk Dance Authority, Dead|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/249797119/?terms=Elizabeth%2BBurchenal|work=Palladium-Item Richmond|date=December 4, 1959|location=Richmond, Indiana|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first wife, Ellen, who was born in Ireland, died in 1864, around age 30.

Flora was her given name and later she took on the name Elizabeth (her middle name). Burchenal pronounced her family name "Burchenélle" as was the tradition.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}} "Burchenal" shows up as being anglicized to "Brockend" in the 1880 United States Census.&lt;ref name =1880_US_Census/&gt; Burchenal was the second oldest child in the family of four girls and one boy.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}} Her childhood folk dance career came from a "musically gifted family circle passing many an hour dancing and singing songs of the old country."{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}} She was influenced early in her life towards folk dance by her musician mother who took her on travels to remote mountain cabins by horseback, where she picked up folk dance techniques of the remote mountain village people.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}} Her father was especially interested in folklore.{{sfn|Ohles|1978|p=203}}

Burchenal attended [[Earlham College]] and graduated in 1896 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in English.{{sfn|Marquis|1999|p=1142}} She then went to [[Boston University College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (Sargent College)|Boston University Sargent College]], school of physical training. She graduated from Sargent College in 1898.{{sfn|Marquis|1999|p=1142}} Then after graduation she directed in the department of orthopedics the Medical Gymnasium, which later became [[Boston Children's Hospital|Boston Children's Hospital Medical Center]].{{sfn|Marquis|1999|p=1142}} She directed physical education programs from 1898 to 1902 in Boston as well as Chicago.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}}

Burchenal became interested in using dance in [[physical education]] and was influenced by the dance educator Melvin Gilbert.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}} She carried his philosophy of dance education to Columbia University. She thought that Gilbert's dance techniques should be taught at the University in their physical training classes.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}}

Burchenal became a teacher at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] from 1902 to 1905. Here she began her researching of folk dancing not only in the United States, but also the dancing techniques of Canadian and European folk dancers. Beginning in 1904 she traveled around the world gathering folk dance techniques of various countries. {{sfn|Ohles|1978|p=203}}

Burchenal was next persuaded by the director of New York physical education, [[Luther Gulick (physician)|Luther Gulick]], to become a teacher of dance in the state public school system. In this role she excelled and gained higher levels of authority. She became the executive secretary of the Girl's Branch of the New York Public Schools Athletic League from 1905 to 1916.{{sfn|Ohles|1978|p=203}} There she taught teachers folk dancing besides teaching her normal athletics. She then obtain an additional job as the inspector of athletics for the New York Department of Education from 1909 to 1916. She influenced the nation into introducing folk dancing into the public schools' physical education programs throughout the United States. In addition she organized large gatherings for folk dance festivals, one in particular being a celebration at a New York borough park which involved 10,000 schoolgirls.{{sfn|Read|Witlieb|1992|p=75}}&lt;ref name=schoolchildren&gt;

In 1913, [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]] was so impressed by seeing a group of 2000 Burchenal trained girls folk dancing in a Manhattan public school that she persuaded Burchenal to teach a collection of teachers in Ireland about folk dancing. Before the year was out, Irish national folk dances were a part of the standard physical educational school classes.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}}

Burchenal did traveling around the United States, Europe, and Canada to not only train teachers the techniques of folk dancing, but also took this traveling opportunity to learn more dances. Often she would take her younger sister who played the piano for the dancing. She influenced the social and cultural conduct of recreational life not only in the United States, but also in Canada and Europe. Burchenal described folk dancing as one of the few times that people of different nationalities and cultures can get together in a common event.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}}

The passenger list of the ship Minnetonka shows Burchenal traveling from London and arriving in New York City November 12, 1928. At that time she listed her address as 2700 Broadway in New York City. She was traveling with her older sister Ruth.&lt;ref&gt;AncestoryLibrary.com – New York Passenger Lists, 1820–1957. Roll T715, 1897–1957 &gt; 4001–5000 &gt; Roll 4382&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life and death ==
In 1929 she founded the National Committee of Folk Arts. The American Folk Dance Society, that she had previously founded, became a part of this larger organization. Burchenal directed the Folk Arts Center in New York City, which had a museum and a library on national dance information. {{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}} At various international folk dance festivals Burchenal represented the United States.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}} 
Oberlaender Trust of the Carl Schurs Memorial Foundation granted her a research fellowship for 1933 and 1934 to study folk dance techniques in Germany.{{sfn|Carkin|1952|p=206}} She was chairperson on several dance related national and international committees and organizations.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}}The 1940 U.S. Census shows her occupation as a writer and living in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;1940 United States Census Place: New York, Kings, New York; Roll: T627_2547; Page 2B; Enumeration District: 24-9&lt;/ref&gt; Burchenal's New York death record shows she died November 21, 1959.&lt;ref name=NYdept_of_health/&gt;

== Awards ==
Burchenal received many honors and awards.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}} Some of the notable ones are:

* 1943 – honorary degree by Boston University for Doctor of Science in Physical Education.
* 1950 – Luther Gulick Award for highly regarded service in physical education, the highest award in the field.{{sfn|Ohles|1978|p=204}}

== Legacy ==
Burchenal became known as America's leading authority on folk dancing.{{sfn|Ohles|1978|p=203}} She, along with her older sister Ruth, in 1916 were the organizers of the American Folk Dance Society.{{sfn|Ohles|1978|p=203}} She also founded the Archive of American Folk Dance.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}}

'''Entrepreneurship education''' seeks to provide [[student]]s with the knowledge, skills and motivation to encourage [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] success in a variety of settings.

Variations of entrepreneurship [[education]] are offered at all levels of schooling from [[primary education|primary]] or [[secondary education|secondary]] schools through graduate [[university]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/education_training_youth/general_framework/n26111_en.htm] European Union Commission analyses entrepreneurship education in all education levels in Europe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6735325.stm] United Kingdom governmental push towards entrepreneurship education in different education levels&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

Entrepreneurship education focuses on the development of skills or attributes that enable the realization of [[Wikt:opportunity|opportunity]], where [[management education]] is focused on the best way to operate existing hierarchies. Both approaches share an interest in achieving "profit" in some form (which in non-profit organizations or government can take the form of increased services or decreased cost or increased responsiveness to the customer/citizen/client).

Entrepreneurship education can be oriented towards different ways of realizing opportunities:

*The most popular one is regular [[entrepreneurship]]: ''opening a new organization'' (e.g. starting a new business).&lt;ref&gt;Miron-Shatz, T., Shatz, I., Becker, S., Patel, J., &amp; Eysenbach, G. (2014). [http://itamarshatz.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Promoting-Business-and-Entrepreneurial-Awareness-in-Health-Care-Professionals.pdf "Promoting business and entrepreneurial awareness in health care professionals: lessons from venture capital panels at medicine 2.0 conferences"]. Journal of Medical Internet Research, 16(8), e184.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of programs on university level teach entrepreneurship in a similar way to other business degrees. However, the UK Higher Education system makes distinction between the creativity and innovation aspects, which it sees as a precursor to new venture development. Here Enterprise is defined as an ability to develop multiple ideas and opportunities that can be made real, and entrepreneurship is defined as the development of business acumen that can realise the full potential. This enables any discipline that is subject to the UK Higher Education's  Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education's guidance, to offer subject-based entrepreneurial curriculum. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/enterprise-entrepreneurship-guidance.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission set out a series of learning outcomes that address the need for European-wide perspectives on how such learning should be evaluated, and highlight the need for teacher development at all levels. &lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/strategic-framework/archive/documents/entrepreneurship-report-2014_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Best practice guidance for schools and teachers is also available via the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry's Entrepreneurship 2020 Unit. &lt;ref&gt;Entrepreneurship Education: A Guide for Educators (2013) Brussels: European Commission — DG Enterprise and Industry&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in 2015 the OECD partnered the European Commission to produce guidance for the development of skills and competencies for entrepreneurship. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/cfe/leed/skills-for-entrepreneurship.htm&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative approach is action-based entrepreneurship education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Action-based entrepreneurship education|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166497205000994|journal = Technovation|date = 2006-02-01|pages = 185–194|volume = 26|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.technovation.2005.06.012|first = Einar A.|last = Rasmussen|first2 = Roger|last2 = Sørheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes also labelled as venture creation programs (VCP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Venture Creation Programs List {{!}} We List Venture Creation Programs|url = http://vcplist.com/|website = vcplist.com|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these programs the students launch a new business as an integral part of the learning process. The most comprehensive VCP programs therefore also run a [[business incubator]] on site and operate over a long time period (e.g. 1–2 years).
*Another approach is to promote innovation or introduce ''new products or services or markets in existing firms''. This approach is called corporate entrepreneurship or [[Intrapreneurship]], and was made popular by author [[Gifford Pinchot]] in his book of the same name. Newer research indicates that clustering is now a driving factor.  Clustering occurs when a group of employees breaks off from the parent company to found a new company but continues to do business with the parent.  [[Business cluster#The Silicon Valley case|Silicon Valley]] is one such cluster, grown very large.
*A recent approach involves ''creating charitable organizations'' (or portions of existing charities) which are designed to be self-supporting in addition to doing their good works. This is usually called [[social entrepreneurship]] or social venturing. Even a version of public sector entrepreneurship has come into being in governments, with an increased focus on innovation and customer service. This approach got its start in the policies of the United Kingdom's [[Thatcherism|Margaret Thatcher]] and the United States' [[Reaganomics|Ronald Reagan]].
* Entrepreneurship is also being developed as a way of developing skills such as risk-taking and problem solving that facilitate achievement of life goals and in education.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schools/can-instilling-a-sense-of-entrepreneurship-in-pupils-have-a-positive-effect-on-their-learning-9826864.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entrepreneurship For Kids:'''

To catch them early is the vision. Based on certain research in India &amp; Israel, Schools are now incorporating new course for young students. Founder of Leader To Creator Pradeep Mishra started this program in schools in India. The kids are taught about business and economics at a very young age. Students are exposed to a controlled economic environment for better learning outcomes.

{{Conservation status}}
{{Evolutionary biology}}
In [[biology]], '''extinction''' is the termination of an [[organism]] or of a group of organisms ([[taxon]]), normally a [[species]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the [[endling|last individual]] of the species, although the [[Functional extinction|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point. Because a species' potential [[Range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where a species presumed extinct abruptly "reappears" (typically in the [[fossil|fossil record]]) after a period of apparent absence.

More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species,&lt;ref name="Book-Biology"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Kunin, W.E. |editor2=Gaston, Kevin |title=The Biology of Rarity: Causes and consequences of rare—common differences

Through [[evolution]], species arise through the process of [[speciation]]—where new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]]—and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

A species is extinct when the last existing member dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation. A species may become [[functional extinction|functionally extinct]] when only a handful of individuals survive, which cannot reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] species), or other reasons.

Pinpointing the extinction (or [[pseudoextinction]]) of a species requires a [[Theory of species|clear definition of that species]]. If it is to be declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) plays a key role in the [[punctuated equilibrium]] hypothesis of [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Niles Eldredge, ''Time Frames: Rethinking of Darwinian Evolution and the Theory of Punctuated Equilibria'', 1986, Heinemann {{ISBN|0-434-22610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ecology]], ''extinction'' is often used informally to refer to [[local extinction]], in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study, but may still exist elsewhere. This phenomenon is also known as extirpation. Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations; [[wolf reintroduction]] is an example of this. Species which are not extinct are termed [[Extant taxon|extant]]. Those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as [[threatened]] or [[endangered species]].

[[File:Edwards' Dodo.jpg|thumb|The [[dodo]] of [[Mauritius]], shown here in a 1626 illustration by [[Roelant Savery]], is an often-cited example of [[Holocene extinction|modern extinction]]&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared Diamond | title = [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] | publisher = [[W.

Currently an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species. These are reflected by the creation of the [[conservation status]] [[extinct in the wild|"extinct in the wild" (EW)]]. Species listed under this status by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) are not known to have any living specimens in the wild, and are maintained only in [[zoo]]s or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct, as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild.&lt;ref name="Maas"&gt;Maas, Peter.

The extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects, causing further extinctions. These are also called "chains of extinction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf |title=Deleting species from model food webs |accessdate=2007-02-15 |format=PDF |work= |author=Quince, C. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925092540/http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-25|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially common with extinction of [[keystone species]].

=== Pseudoextinction ===
{{Main|Pseudoextinction}}

Extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction or phyletic extinction. Effectively, the old taxon vanishes, transformed ([[anagenesis]]) into a successor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Michael |last2=Mulligan |first2=Pamela |last3=Stansfield |first3=William |title=A Dictionary of Genetics |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; or split into more than one ([[cladogenesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leighton |first=Lindsey R. |title=Taxon Characteristics That Promote Survivorship Through the Permian-Triassic Interval: Transition from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic Brachiopod Fauna  |journal=Paleobiology |date=2009 |volume=34 |pages=65–79 |doi=10.1666/06082.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct ''[[Hyracotherium]]'', which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern [[horse]], is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because there are several extant species of ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'', including [[zebra]] and [[donkey]]. However, as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind, one cannot say whether ''Hyracotherium'' [[Evolution of the horse|evolved into more modern horse species]] or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses. Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups.

===Lazarus taxa===
{{Main|Lazarus taxa}}
The [[coelacanth]], a fish related to [[lungfish]] and [[tetrapod]]s, was considered to have been extinct since the end of the [[Cretaceous Period]] until 1938 when a specimen was found, off the [[Chalumna River]] (now Tyolomnqa) on the east coast of South Africa.&lt;ref name="dinofish"&gt;[http://www.dinofish.com/discoa.htm "Discovery" of the Coelacanth]&lt;/ref&gt; Museum curator [[Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer]] discovered the fish among the catch of a local angler, Captain Hendrick Goosen, on December 23, 1938.&lt;ref name="dinofish" /&gt; A local chemistry professor, [[James Leonard Brierley Smith|JLB Smith]], confirmed the fish's importance with a famous cable: "MOST IMPORTANT PRESERVE SKELETON AND GILLS = FISH DESCRIBED".&lt;ref name="dinofish" /&gt;

Far more recent possible or presumed extinctions of species which may turn out still to exist include the thylacine, or [[Tasmanian tiger]] (''Thylacinus cynocephalus''), the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936; the [[Honshū wolf|Japanese wolf]] (''Canis lupus hodophilax''), last sighted over 100 years ago; the [[ivory-billed woodpecker]] (''Campephilus principalis''), last sighted for certain in 1944; and the [[slender-billed curlew]] (''Numenius tenuirostris''), not seen since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/2013/02/21/4-extinct-species-hope-rediscover/ 4 Extinct species that people still hope to rediscover – John R.

As long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct. It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average lifespan of a species is 1–10 million years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Conservation of Wildlife Populations: Demography, Genetics and Management|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fVLEV64qYfcC|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|date = 2009-03-12|isbn = 9781444308938|language = en|first = L. Scott|last = Mills|page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this varies widely between taxa.
There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. "Just as each species is unique", write Beverly and [[Stephen C. Stearns]], "so is each extinction&amp;nbsp;... the causes for each are varied—some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple".&lt;ref name="Stearns"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stearns | first = Beverly Peterson and Stephen C. | title = Watching, from the Edge of Extinction | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-300-08469-2 | pages=x |chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most simply, any species that cannot [[Survival skills|survive]] and [[reproduction|reproduce]] in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when [[toxic]] [[pollution]] renders its entire [[habitat]] unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors. Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]].

Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on [[nature and nurture]].&lt;ref name="Raup"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raup |first=David M. |author2=J.

When concerns about [[human extinction]] have been raised, for example in Sir [[Martin Rees]]' 2003 book ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', those concerns lie with the effects of [[climate change]] or [[technology|technological]] disaster.

Currently, environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity, and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of [[conservation movement|conservation]] programs.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt; Humans can cause extinction of a species through [[overharvesting]], [[pollution]], [[habitat destruction]], introduction of [[invasive species]] (such as new [[predator]]s and food [[competitors]]), overhunting, and other influences.

''Scientific American''. August 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), 784 extinctions have been recorded since the year 1500, the arbitrary date selected to define "recent" extinctions, up to the year 2004; with many more likely to have gone unnoticed. Several species have also been listed as extinct since 2004.&lt;ref name="IUCNno"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[World Conservation Union]] | url = http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/red_list_2004/GSAexecsumm_EN.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20080113030317/http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/red_list_2004/GSAexecsumm_EN.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = January 13, 2008 | title = 2004 Red List | work = IUCN Red List of Threatened Species | accessdate = September 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetics and demographic phenomena ===
{{See also|Extinction vortex|Genetic erosion|Mutational meltdown}}
If [[adaptation]] increasing population [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] is slower than environmental degradation plus the accumulation of slightly deleterious [[mutation]]s, then a population will go extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertram|first1=J|last2=Gomez|first2=K|last3=Masel|first3=J|title=Predicting patterns of long-term adaptation and extinction with population genetics|journal=Evolution|date=February 2017|volume=71|issue=2|pages=204–214|doi=10.1111/evo.13116|arxiv=1605.08717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller populations have fewer beneficial mutations entering the population each generation, slowing adaptation. It is also easier for slightly deleterious mutations to [[fixation (population genetics)|fix]] in small populations; the resulting positive feedback loop between small population size and low fitness can cause [[mutational meltdown]].

Limited geographic range is the most important determinant of [[genus]] extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as [[#Mass extinctions|mass extinction]] arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Payne, J.L.  |author2=S. Finnegan | year=2007 | title=The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction | journal=[[PNAS|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.]] | volume=104 | issue=25 | pages=10506–11 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0701257104 | pmid=17563357| pmc=1890565|bibcode = 2007PNAS..10410506P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited geographic range is a cause both of small population size and of greater vulnerability to local environmental catastrophes.

Extinction rates can be affected not just by population size, but by any factor that affects [[evolvability]], including [[balancing selection]], [[cryptic genetic variation]], [[phenotypic plasticity]], and [[robustness (evolution)|robustness]]. A diverse or deep [[gene pool]] gives a population a higher chance in the short term of surviving an adverse change in conditions. Effects that cause or reward a loss in [[genetic diversity]] can increase the chances of extinction of a species. [[Population bottleneck]]s can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make [[inbreeding]] more frequent.

=== Habitat degradation ===
{{Main|Habitat destruction}}
Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] may alter the [[fitness landscape]] to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming [[toxicity|toxic]], or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.

Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through [[contamination]] or [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.

Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of [[tropical rainforest]]s and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a [[fern]] that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by [[bottom trawling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clover |first=Charles |year=2004 |title=The End of the Line: How overfishing is changing the world and what we eat |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=0-09-189780-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. [[Global warming]] has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing unwelcome{{according to whom|date=May 2016}} competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including [[water]] and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.

=== Predation, competition, and disease ===
{{See also|Island restoration}}
In the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by [[introduced species|transporting]] [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. [[livestock]] released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. [[rat]]s escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an [[Invasive species|invasive alien species]] does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect [[Endemic (ecology)|native]] species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing [[pathogen]]s or [[parasite]]s that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the "overkill hypothesis", the swift extinction of the [[megafauna]] in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] (12,000 years before present), [[Madagascar]], [[Hawaii]] (300–1000 CE), and New Zealand (1300–1500 CE), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, Anita.

=== Coextinction ===
{{Main|Coextinction}}
[[File:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|The large [[Haast's eagle]] and [[moa]] from New Zealand]]

Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of [[parasitism|parasitic]] insects following the loss of their hosts. Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its [[pollinator]], or to [[predator]]s in a [[food chain]] who lose their prey. "Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems&amp;nbsp;... While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one".&lt;ref name="Koh"&gt;Koh, Lian Pih. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Vol 305, Issue 5690, 1632–1634, 10 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coextinction is especially common when a [[keystone species]] goes extinct.
Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of [[biodiversity loss]]. There may be a cascade of coextinction across the [[trophic level]]s. Such effects are most severe in [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction is the [[Haast's eagle]] and the [[moa]]: the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct. The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast's eagle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Dunn | first = Robert |author2=Nyeema Harris|author3=Robert Colwell|author4=Lian Pin Koh|author5=Navjot Sodhi | title = Proceedings of the Royal Society | work = The sixth mass coextinction: are most endangered species parasites and mutualists? | publisher = [[The Royal Society]] | year = 2009 | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1670/3037.short | accessdate = April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been at least five mass extinctions in the history of life on earth, and four in the last 350 million years in which many species have disappeared in a relatively short period of geological time.

According to a 1998 survey&lt;!-- Needs updating. Survey is now 20+ years old.  --&gt; of 400 biologists conducted by [[New York City|New York]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]], nearly 70% believed that the Earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused mass extinction,&lt;ref name="AMNH"&gt;[[American Museum of Natural History]].

In that survey, the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20% of all living populations could become extinct within 30 years (by 2028). A 2014 special edition of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' declared there is widespread consensus on the issue of human-driven mass species extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 25 July 2014 | title = Vanishing fauna (Special issue)|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=345|issue=6195| pages = 392–412 | url =http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/vanishing/index.xhtml?_ga=1.172413478.429831163.1471029002 |doi=10.1126/science.345.6195.392| bibcode= | last1 = Vignieri | first1 = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[E. O.

For much of history, the modern understanding of extinction as the end of a [[species]] was incompatible with the prevailing worldview. Through the 18th century, much of Western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by God and as such was complete and perfect.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowland|first=Stephen|date=2009|title=Thomas Jefferson, extinction, and the evolving view of Earth history in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries|url=http://memoirs.gsapubs.org/content/203/225.abstract|journal=GSA Memoirs|volume=203|pages=225–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the [[Great chain of being|Great Chain of Being]], in which all life on earth, from the tiniest microorganism to God, is linked in a continuous chain.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33224/33224-h/33224-h.htm|title=The Principles of Geology or, The Modern Changes of the Earth and its Inhabitants Considered as Illustrative of Geology|last=Lyells|first=Charles|publisher=Appleton Co|year=1854|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extinction of a species was impossible under this model, as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] was a firm supporter of the [[Great Chain of Being]] and an opponent of extinction,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/history-of-geology/on-the-extinction-of-species/|title=On the Extinction of Species|last=Bressan|first=David|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; famously denying the extinction of the wooly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqHwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88&amp;lpg=PT88&amp;dq=%22Extinction,+diversity,+and+endangerment%22+david+sepkoski&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tpA16i2uMn&amp;sig=oH9FP_N1r2swggDmOvzLzg8LH10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitpMKv9NTTAhUh7oMKHUOaA2wQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Extinction,%20diversity,%20and%20endangerment%22%20david%20sepkoski&amp;f=false|title=Endangerment, Biodiversity and Culture|last=Vidal|first=Fernando|last2=Dias|first2=Nélia|date=2015-06-19|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317538073|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of fossils were discovered in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species. As a result, the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization, seeking to understand what had happened to these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction. In October 1686, [[Robert Hooke]] presented an impression of a [[nautilus]] to the [[Royal Society]] that was more than two feet in diameter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7LriV7aZpkC&amp;pg=PA403&amp;lpg=PA403&amp;dq=hooke+nautilus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DWXg0qsaJ8&amp;sig=vUkaTNuCy8Ud9RjliZubXBdD4bM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD6rGQptXTAhUF2IMKHfamAc8Q6AEIVjAL#v=onepage&amp;q=hooke%20nautilus&amp;f=false|title=The Forgotten Genius: The Biography of Robert Hooke, 1635–1703|last=Inwood|first=Stephen|date=2005-05-03|publisher=MacAdam/Cage Publishing|isbn=9781596921153|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and morphologically distinct from any known living species. [[Robert Hooke|Hooke]] theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean and no one had discovered them yet.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; While he contended that  it was possible a species could be "lost", he thought this highly unlikely.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Similarly, in 1695, [[Thomas Molyneux]] published an account of enormous antlers found in [[Ireland]] that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molyneux|first=Thomas|date=1695-01-01|title=A Discourse Concerning the Large Horns Frequently Found under Ground in Ireland, Concluding from Them That the Great American Deer, Call'd a Moose, Was Formerly Common in That Island: With Remarks on Some Other Things Natural to That Country.

When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted, scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply "hiding" in unexplored regions of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Watson2"&gt;''Ideas: A History from Fire to Freud'' ([[Peter Watson (business writer)|Peter Watson]] Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson {{ISBN|0-297-60726-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Cuvier]] is credited with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a 1796 lecture to the [[French Institute]],&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt; though he would spend most of his career trying to convince the wider scientific community of his theory.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912273245|title=Perilous planet earth : catastrophes and catastrophism through the ages|last=Trevor.|first=Palmer,|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521819288|oclc=912273245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier was a well-regarded geologist, lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; His primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found in the [[Paris Basin|Paris basin]].&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant, and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; In 1812, Cuvier, along with [[Alexandre Brongniart|Alexandre Bronigniart]] &amp; [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], mapped the [[Stratum|strata]] of the Paris basin.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits, as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; From these patterns, Cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding, extinction, and repopulation of the earth with new species.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

Cuvier's fossil evidence showed that very different life forms existed in the past than those that exist today, a fact that was accepted by most scientists.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The primary debate focused whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Cuvier understood extinction to be the result of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species, as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45730036|title=Georges Cuvier, fossil bones, and geological catastrophes : new translations &amp; interpretations of the primary texts|last=S.|first=Rudwick, M. J.|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226731063|oclc=45730036}}&lt;/ref&gt; His catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of [[uniformitarianism]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Jean-Baptist Lamarck]], a [[Gradualism|gradualist]] and colleague of Cuvier, saw the fossils of different life forms as evidence of the mutable character of species.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; While Lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction, he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Unlike Cuvier, Lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible. In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie, Lamarck instead argued that the surface of the earth was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water, and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898833548|title=The age of Lamarck : evolutionary theories in France, 1790–1830|last=Renato)|first=Mandelbaum, Jonathan (Jonathan|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520058309|oclc=898833548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]], a noted geologist and founder of [[uniformitarianism]], believed that past processes should be understood using present day processes. Like Lamarck, Lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur, noting the total extinction of the [[dodo]] and the extirpation of [[History of the horse in Britain|indigenous horses]] to the British Isles.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; He similarly argued against [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]], believing that any extinction must be a gradual process.&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Lyell also showed that Cuvier's original interpretation of the Parisian strata was incorrect. Instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by Cuvier, Lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]], like those seen in the [[Paris Basin|Paris basin]], could be formed by a slow rise and fall of [[sea level]]s.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The concept of extinction was integral to [[Charles Darwin]]’s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', with less fit lineages disappearing over time. For Darwin, extinction was a constant side effect of [[Competition (biology)|competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/16/the-lost-world-2|title=The Lost World|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the wide reach of ''On the Origin of Species'', it was widely accepted that extinction occurred gradually and evenly (a concept we now refer to as [[Background extinction rate|background extinction]]).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; It was not until 1982, when [[David M. Raup|David Raup]] and [[Jack Sepkoski]] published their seminal paper on mass extinctions, that Cuvier was vindicated and catastrophic extinction was accepted as an important mechanism. The current understanding of extinction is a synthesis of the cataclysmic extinction events proposed by Cuvier, and the background extinction events proposed by Lyell and Darwin.

== Human attitudes and interests ==
Extinction is an important research topic in the field of [[zoology]], and [[biology]] in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the [[WWF (conservation organization)|Worldwide Fund for Nature]], have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction. [[Government]]s have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and [[pollution]]. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous [[virus]]es, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested.  Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were "undesirable", or to push for other human agendas.  One example was the near extinction of the [[American bison]], which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, to force the removal of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], many of whom relied on the bison for food.&lt;ref name="Kotzman"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

Biologist Bruce Walsh of the [[University of Arizona]] states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species: genetic resources, ecosystem stability, and [[ethics]];&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt; and today the scientific community "stress[es] the importance" of maintaining biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh, Bruce.

In modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' can be devastating to wildlife (for example, [[DDT]]).&lt;ref name="INCHEM"&gt;International Programme on Chemical Safety (1989).

Governments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to [[ecotourism]],&lt;ref name="Drewry"&gt;Drewry, Rachel.

People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction [[risk]]s. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with [[human overpopulation]] in tropical [[developing country|developing countries]], there has been enormous pressure on forests due to [[subsistence agriculture]], including [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Anne | last1= Ehrlich | title = Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species | publisher= Random House, New York | year= 1981 | isbn= 0-394-51312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antinatalist]] philosopher [[David Benatar]] concludes that any popular concern about non-human species extinction usually arises out of concern about how the loss of a species will impact human wants and needs, that "we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal." He notes that typical concerns about possible human extinction, such as the loss of individual members, are not considered in regards to non-human species extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Benatar|first=David|date=2008 |title=Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence|url= |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=197 |isbn=978-0199549269|quote=It is noteworthy that human concern about human extinction takes a different form from human concern (where there is any) about the extinction of non-human species. Most humans who are concerned about the extinction of non-human species are not concerned about the individual animals whose lives are cut short in the passage to extinction, even though that is one of the best reasons to be concerned about extinction (at least in its killing form). The popular concern about animal extinction is usually concern for humans –- that we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal. In other words, none of the typical concerns about human extinction are applied to non-human species extinction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dracunculus medinensis]]'', a parasitic worm which causes the disease [[dracunculiasis]], is now close to eradication thanks to efforts led by the [[Carter Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3680439/guinea-worm-almost-extinct/ |title=This Species is Close to Extinction and That's a Good Thing |date=23 January 2015 |publisher=Time |accessdate=17 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Treponema pallidum|Treponema pallidum pertenue]]'', a bacterium which causes the disease [[yaws]], is in the process of being eradicated.

Biologist [[Olivia Judson]] has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying [[mosquito]] species. In a September 25, 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', she advocated "specicide" of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create [[recessive]] "[[Gene knockout|knockout genes]]".&lt;ref name="Judson"/&gt; She says that the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[malaria]]) and ''[[Aedes]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[dengue fever]], [[yellow fever]], [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]], and other diseases) represent only 30 species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum, at a cost of reducing the [[genetic diversity]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Culicidae]] by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct "all the time" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the [[ecosystem]]: "We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species—but different need not mean worse." In addition, anti-malarial and [[Mosquito#Control|mosquito control programs]] offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in [[developing nation]]s who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail: "We should consider the ultimate swatting."&lt;ref name="Judson"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/25/opinion/a-bug-s-death.html |title=A Bug's Death |date=September 25, 2003 |author=Olivia Judson |publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=17 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] has advocated the eradication of several species of mosquito, including malaria vector ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]''. Wilson stated, "I'm talking about a very small number of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans, so it would certainly be acceptable to remove them. I believe it's just common sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-04-04/why-famous-biologist-wants-eradicate-killer-mosquitoes| title=Why a famous biologist wants to eradicate killer mosquitoes|publisher=PRI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cloning ===
{{Main|De-extinction}}
Some, such as Harvard geneticist [[George M. Church]], believe that ongoing technological advances will let us "bring back to life" an extinct species by [[Cloning#Cloning extinct and endangered species|cloning]], using [[DNA]] from the remains of that species. Proposed targets for cloning include the [[mammoth]], the [[thylacine]], and the [[Pyrenean ibex]]. For this to succeed, enough individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though [[bioethics|bioethical]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] objections have been raised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/24/news/mn-4250/2 |title= Cloned Goat Would Revive Extinct Line |author= A. Zitner |date= 2000-12-24 |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]   |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cloning of extinct creatures seems theoretically possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/science/20mammoth.html?_r=1 |title= Regenerating a Mammoth for $10 Million |author= Nicholas wade |date= 2008-11-19  |accessdate=2010-05-17 | work=The New York Times}} ''The cell could be converted into an embryo and brought to term by an elephant, a project he estimated would cost some $10 million. "This is something that could work, though it will be tedious and expensive," ''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, scientists tried to clone the extinct Pyrenean ibex (''C. p. pyrenaica''). This attempt failed: of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 mountain goats and [[mountain goat]]-[[Goat|domestic goat]] hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they too died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/cloned-goat-dies-after-attempt-to-bring-species-back-from-extinction-1522974.html |title= Cloned goat dies after attempt to bring species back from extinction |author= Steve Connor |date= 2009-02-02 |work= [[The Independent]]   |accessdate=2010-05-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean ibex: one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=31 Jan 2009|location=London|first1=Richard|last1=Gray|first2=Roger|last2=Dobson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frotteurism''' is a [[paraphilia|paraphilic]] interest in rubbing, usually one's [[pelvic]] area or erect [[Human penis|penis]], against a non-consenting person for [[sexual pleasure]]. It may involve touching any part of the body, including the genital area. A person who practices frotteuristic acts is known as a ''frotteur''. '''Toucherism''' is [[sexual arousal]] based on grabbing or rubbing one's hands against an unexpecting (and non-consenting) person. It usually involves touching breasts, buttocks or genital areas, often while quickly walking across the victim's path.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, J. M., Blanchard, R., &amp; Barbaree, H. E. (2009). Sexual disorders. In P. H. Blaney &amp; T. Millon (Eds.), ''Oxford textbook of psychopathology'' (2nd ed.) (pp. 527–548). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists consider toucherism a manifestation of frotteurism, while others distinguish the two.&lt;ref name="lussier"&gt;{{cite book | author =  Lussier, Patrick and Piché, Lyne | date= 2008 | title = Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment, 2nd edition | publisher = The Guilford Press | pages = 131–132, 145 | chapter = Frotteurism: Psychopathology and Theory | editor1-last = Laws | editor1-first = D. Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In clinical medicine, treatment of frotteuristic disorder involves [[cognitive behavior therapy]] coupled with the administration of a [[SSRI]].

== Etymology and history ==
"Frottage" derives from the French verb ''frotter'', meaning "to rub". The term ''frotteur'', originally meaning "floor polisher", entered police jargon around 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last  = Janssen | first = D.F. | year = 2018 | title = “Frotteuristic Disorder”: Etymological and Historical Note | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | issn = 0004-0002 | doi=10.1007/s10508-018-1188-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frotteuristic acts were interpreted as signs of a psychological disorder in 1887 and in ensuing work by French psychiatrist [[Valentin Magnan]], who described three acts of "frottage" in an 1890 study. It was popularized by German sexologist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in his book ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'', borrowing from Magnan's French terminology. Clifford Allen later coined ''frotteurism'' in his 1969 textbook of sexual disorders.&lt;ref name="lussier" /&gt;

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' called this sexual disorder by the name ''frottage'' until the third edition (DSM III-R), but changed to ''frotteurism'' in the fourth edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| edition=2nd | title=Sexual Deviance, Second Edition: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment | publisher=Guilford Press | url=https://books.google.com/?id=g3TOLfeSlVkC&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate=July 25, 2013 | last1=Laws | first1=D. Richard | last2=O'Donohue |first2=William T.| isbn=9781462506699 | date=April 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and now uses ''frotteuristic disorder'' in the fifth edition.&lt;ref name="DSM 5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Frotteuristic Disorder 302.89 (F65.81) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pages = 691–694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the term ''frottage'' still remains in some law codes where it is synonymous with the term ''frotteurism''.

== Symptoms and classification ==
The professional handbook of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA), the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', fifth edition, lists the following diagnostic criteria for ''frotteuristic disorder''.

* Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
* The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

If the individual has not acted on their interest and experiences no distress or impairment, they are considered to have a frotteuristic sexual interest, but not frotteuristic disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM 5" /&gt; Some sexologists distinguish between frotteurism (as pelvic rubbing) and toucherism (as groping with hands), but the DSM does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McAnulty, Richard D. |author2=Adams, Henry E. |author3= Dillon, Joel |last-author-amp=yes |editor1=Sutker, Patricia B. |editor2=Adams, Henry E. | year = 2002 | chapter = Sexual disorders: The paraphilias | title = Comprehensive handbook of psychopathology | location = New York | publisher = Plenum Press | page = 761}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexologist]] [[Kurt Freund]] described frotteurism and toucherism as [[courtship disorder]]s that occur at the tactile stage of human courtship.&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K. (1990). Courtship disorders: Toward a biosocial understanding of voyeurism, exhibitionism, toucherism, and the preferential rape pattern. In. L. Ellis &amp; H. Hoffman (Eds.), ''Crime in biological, social, and moral contexts'' (pp. 100–114). NY: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K. (1990). Courtship disorders. In W. L. Marshall, D. R. Laws, &amp; H. E. Barbaree (Eds.), ''Handbook of sexual assault: Issues, theories, and treatment of the offender'' (pp. 195–207). NY: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence and legality==
The prevalence of frotteurism is unknown. The DSM estimates that 10%–14% of men seen in clinical settings for paraphilias or [[hypersexuality]] have frotteuristic disorder, indicating that the population prevalence is lower. However, frotteuristic acts, as opposed to frotteuristic disorder, may occur in up to 30% of men in the general population.&lt;ref name="DSM 5" /&gt; The majority of frotteurs are male and the majority of victims are female,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/frotteurism UCSB's SexInfo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; although female on male, female on female, and male on male frotteurs exist.  This activity is often done in circumstances where the victim cannot easily respond, in a [[Public space|public place]] such as a crowded train or concert.

Usually, such nonconsensual sexual contact is viewed as a [[Crime|criminal offense]]: a form of [[sexual assault]] albeit often classified as a [[misdemeanor]] with minor legal penalties. Conviction may result in a sentence or psychiatric treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026134154/http://geocities.com/openlcc/se601.html  frottophilia] at SEX ED 601 Advanced Topics in Human Sexuality.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors influencing extracellular enzyme activity==
Extracellular enzyme production supplements the direct uptake of nutrients by microorganisms and is linked to nutrient availability and environmental conditions.  The varied chemical structure of [[organic matter]] requires a suite of extracellular enzymes to access the carbon and nutrients embedded in [[detritus]].  Microorganisms differ in their ability to break down these different substrates and few organisms have the potential to degrade all the available plant cell wall materials.&lt;ref name="AllisonLeBauer2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allison|first1=Steven D.|last2=LeBauer|first2=David S.|last3=Ofrecio|first3=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4972">'''IP-XACT''' is an [[XML]] format that defines and describes individual, re-usable [[circuit design|electronic circuit design]]s (individual pieces of intellectual property, or IPs) to facilitate their use in creating [[integrated circuits]] (i.e. ''microchips''). IP-XACT was created by the [[SPIRIT Consortium]] as a standard to enable automated configuration and integration through tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://accellera.org/activities/working-groups/ip-xact/ IP-XACT Working Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of the standard are
* to ensure delivery of compatible component descriptions from multiple component vendors,
* to enable exchanging complex component libraries between [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) tools for [[System-on-a-chip|SoC]] design (design environments),
* to describe configurable components using [[metadata]], and
* to enable the provision of EDA vendor-neutral scripts for component creation and configuration (generators, configurators).

Approved as [[IEEE]] 1685-2009 on December 9, 2009, published on February 18, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 1685-2009, {{ISBN|978-0-7381-6160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Superseded by [[IEEE]] 1685-2014. IEEE 1685-2009 was adopted as IEC 62014-4:2015.

== Overview ==

All documents will have the following basic titular attributes spirit:vendor, spirit:library, spirit:name, spirit:version.

A document typically represents one of:
* bus specification, giving its signals and protocol etc.;
* leaf IP block data sheet;
* or a hierarchic component wiring diagram that describes a sub-system by connecting up or abstracting other components made up of spirit:componentInstance and spirit:interconnection elements.

For each port of a component there will be a spirit:busInterface element in the document.  This may have a spirit:signalMap
that gives the mapping of the formal net names in the interface to the names used in a corresponding formal specification of the port.
A simple wiring tool will use the signal map to know which net on one interface to connect to which net on another instance
of the same formal port on another component.

There may be various versions of a component referenced in the document, each as a spirit:view element, relating to different versions of a design: typical levels are gate-level, RTL and TLM.
Each view typically contains a list of filenames as a spirit:fileSet that implement the design at that level of abstraction in appropriate language, like Verilog,
C++ or PSL.

Non-functional data present includes the programmer's view with a list of spirit:register declarations inside a spirit:memoryMap or spirit:addressBlock.

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], '''inclusion''' is the process whereby two [[species]] that were believed to be distinct are found in fact to be the same and are thus combined as one species. Which name is kept for this unified species is sometimes a cause of debate, but generally it is the earlier-named one, and the other species is said to be "included" within this one.

Inclusion is far more common in [[paleontology]] than more recent [[biology]], although it is not unheard of in the latter. When it occurs with more recent or modern species, it is usually the result of a species with wide geographical dispersion.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Official logo of ICAR.png|left|100px]] --&gt;
{{Agriculture}}
The Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research (IISR) owes its origin to the recommendations of the erstwhile ''The'' ''Indian Central Sugarcane Committee'' for advanced research on all aspects of sugarcane cultivation except breeding and coordination of sugarcane researches across the country. The foundation stone of the institute was laid on 16 February 1952&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12355-009-0001-0# Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow: Envisioning improved sugarcane production technology for high yields and high sugar recovery in India - Springer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  under the administrative control of the Indian Central Sugarcane Committee. It was brought directly under the [[Government of India]] on 1 January 1954&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBjxRJ6VIvM Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research Lucknow at a glance - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and later on it was entrusted to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) on 1 April 1969 along with other agriculture based research institutions.

The Institute is an ISO 9001 accredited agency and has three regional stations for nationwide coverage of its activities.

'''IISR Regional Centre, [[Motipur, India|Motipur]], [[Muzaffarpur]], [[Bihar]]''':&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.icar.org.in/en/node/7121 Regional Centre, Motipur, Muzaffarpur (Bihar) of Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research celebrated Silver jubilee | Indian Council of Agricultural Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was the research station of the ''Sugarcane Breeding Institute'', [[Coimbatore]] when it was established in 1988 but was brought under IISR on 25 April 2004. The Centre focuses its attention on the development of sugarcane varieties, evaluation of waterlogging tolerance, [[red rot]] resistance and mechanization of sugarcane cultivation.

The Centre has developed several varieties of sugarcane for distribution and is involved in breeder seed development of improved varieties.

'''Sugarbeet Research and Development at the Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow''': This Institute is also specialized for [[sugarbeet]], which has wide tolerance levels and is cultivable for extended seasons. IISR has developed various agrotechniques for tropical and subtropical cultivation of sugarbeet, developed mechanized methods of sowing, crop raising and harvesting and standardised seed production technology. The centre also maintains training facilities on maintenance of germplasm, seed production, root crop production, plant protection and region-specific mechanization.

IISR has a Biological Control Centre,  at Pravaranagar in [[Maharashtra]].

===Division of Crop Improvement===

The Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research hosted a ''Botany and Breeding Unit'' for Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore during the sixties and, in 1969, the unit was transferred to IISR. In 1989, the unit was renamed the Division of Crop Improvement.

The Division focusses its attention on advanced research on sugar crops such as [[sugarcane]] and [[sugarbeet]] and has been successful in developing many improved varieties such as CoLk 8001, CoLk 8102, CoLk 94184 and CoLk 9709, which are known to have high cane yield, sugar content, [[red rot]] and top borer resistance and better water logging tolerance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; It also produces breeder seed and is also a DUS testing centre of sugarcane.

'''Mandate''': The Division has a set mandate to develop superior sugarcane varieties and breeding and genetic stocks, prescription of biotechnological techniques and documentation and evaluation sugarcane [[germplasm]].

'''Facilities''': The Division is equipped with a [[Molecular Biology]] and [[Biotechnology]] Lab, a [[Cytogenetics]] Lab, a DUS Testing Facility, a Glass house and a Poly house.

===Division of Crop Production===

Division of Crop Production, an original division since the inception of IISR 1952, is involved in developing modern technology for sugarcane production in the sub tropical regions. Efforts are on to marry [[agronomy]], [[soil science]] and [[microbiology]] for improving sugarcane processing including [[Jaggery|gur]] and [[jaggery]] production.

Major achievements of the Division include ring-pit method of sugarcane planting, skip-furrow method of irrigation, nutrient, water and weed management package in sugarcane production. It looks after the disciplines of Agronomy, Soil Science and [[Agricultural Chemistry]], Agricultural Microbiology and Extension and Training.

The Institute had four sections, ''[[Agronomy]]'', ''Sugarcane [[Mycology]]'', ''Sugarcane [[Entomology]]'' and ''[[Agricultural Engineering]]'', when it started in 1952. Four years later, two more sections, ''[[Soil Science]] and [[Agricultural Chemistry]]'' and ''[[Plant Physiology]]'', were added. One more section, ''Botany and Breeding'' came into existence in 1969. In 2001, two exiting divisions ''Plant Pathology and Entomology'' were merged to form the Division of Crop Protection.

The Basic objective of the Division is to conduct advanced research on diseases and pest management of sugarcane and other sugar crops. The Division concentrates on areas such as [[Plant Pathology]] with special emphasis on [[Colletotrichum falcatum]], techniques for inducing resistance for sugarcane, use of bio-agents against crop diseases such as ''yellow leaf virus disease'', pragmatic use of chemicals in disease management, variable analysis of [[pathogens]] such as [[Smut (fungus)|Smut]], GSD, ''Mosaic'', sugarcane borers, [[termite]] and [[white grub]], Entomology and introducing [[parasitoids]] in sugarcane agro-ecosystem to combat pests.

Coordinated research activity started in India in 1929 when the then Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, forerunner of the present [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]], recommended study on sugarcane and sugar industry. In 1971, ICAR set up an All India Coordinated Project for Research (AICRP) on sugarcane with IISR as the base.

Efforts at the ''All India Coordinated Project for Research on sugarcane'' is dedicated to the sugarcane cultivation in different parts of the country where the agro-climatic conditions differ from region to region. The project provides a strong infrastructure for the research activities through its various research centres at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research institutes, State Agricultural universities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/Chandra-Shekhar-Azad-University-signs-MoU-with-Indian-Institute-of-Sugarcane-Research/articleshow/12738109.cms Chandra Shekhar Azad University signs MoU with Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research - The Times of India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mewaruniversity.org/uploads/files/IISR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; State Departments of Agriculture&lt;ref&gt;[http://upcsr.org/CouncilS_Research_1.htm Welcome To - UPCSR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Non Government Organizations]], spread all over the country.

==Agricultural Knowledge Management Unit==
In 1995, IISR started an ''Agriculture Research Information System'' section under the National Agricultural Technology Project for augmenting the communication facilities of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agropedia.iitk.ac.in/content/national-agriculture-technology-project-natp National Agriculture Technology Project (NATP) | agropedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the section was renamed as ''Agricultural Knowledge Management Unit''.

Over the years, the section equipped the Institute with modern computing and communication infrastructure consisting of a network of 200 nodes and 120 computers, a Local Area Network based on optical fibre cabling, a series of servers such as Web Server, Mail Exchange, Internet Proxy and Application Server, 100 Mbit/s leased line and connectivity with National Knowledge Network project of Government of India, as a nodal centre.

AKMU is active in the research on designing and sampling sugarcane experiments, performance, production constraints and price policies of sugarcane cropping, statistical support to the scientists, in-house development of required computer software, network and system administration, MIS, gathering market intelligence and other activities related to the dynamics of sugarcane and sugar production.

==Krishi Vigyan Kendra==
The Krishi Vigyan Kendra is an ICAR initiative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icar.org.in/en/krishi-vigyan-kendra.htm Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) | Indian Council of Agricultural Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; for efforts to assist the farming community for the betterment of agricultural production and overall socio economic development of the community. Several KVK centres are functioning with their bases at various ICAR institutes and the KVK in IISR was established in 1999. The centre was formed with an aim to serve the farming community by delivering demand driven services with the assistance of qualified professionals. It was set with a mandate to assess, refine, demonstrate and introduce modern technologies and products to the farming community. The centre hosts a [[Vermicompost]] Unit, [[Bee keeping]] facility, a Technology Park, a Pashu Chokolate Production Unit and a Nutritional Kitchen Garden.

'''Jack Dangermond''' (born 1945) is an American [[billionaire]] businessman and [[environmental scientist]].   In 1969, he co-founded with his wife Laura the [[Environmental Systems Research Institute]] (ESRI), a privately held [[geographic information system]]s (GIS) software company.

Dangermond is the company's president, and works at its headquarters in [[Redlands, California]].  Dangermond founded ESRI to perform [[land use]] analysis; however, its focus evolved into GIS software development, highlighted by the release of [[ARC/INFO]] in the early 1980s; the development and marketing of [[ARC/INFO]] positioned ESRI with the dominant market share among GIS software developers.  Today ESRI is the largest GIS software developer in the world and its flagship product, [[ArcGIS]], traces its heritage to Dangermond's initial efforts in developing ARC/INFO.

==Early life and education==
Jack Dangermond was born in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ESRI.com/library/articles/mapping-the-future.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Redlands, California|Redlands]], California, the son of Dutch immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.nytimes.com/corner-office/interviews/teamwork/topic New York Times: "Corner Office – Conversations about leadership and management"] retrieved May 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  His parents owned a [[plant nursery]] in Redlands.&lt;ref name="howell"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=503454 |title=Jack Dangermond’s Digital Mapping Lays It All Out |last=Howell |first=Donna |work=Investor's Business Daily |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2009-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510064955/http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=503454 |archivedate=2010-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dangermond attended [[Redlands High School]].

Dangermond completed his undergraduate work at [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]] (Cal Poly Pomona), studying landscape architecture and environmental science.&lt;ref name="howell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alumnus Jack Dangermond to Earn Honorary Doctorate |url=http://polycentric.csupomona.edu/2005/02/alumnus_jack_dangermond_to_earn_honorary_doctorate |work=PolyCentric |accessdate=2008-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826211248/http://polycentric.csupomona.edu/2005/02/alumnus_jack_dangermond_to_earn_honorary_doctorate/ |archivedate=August 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then earned a Master of Architecture degree in Urban Planning from the [[University of Minnesota]], and a Master of Landscape Architecture degree from the [[Harvard University]] Graduate School of Design [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|GSD]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="howell"/&gt;  His early work in the school's Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis (LCGSA) led directly to the development of ESRI's [[ARC/INFO]] GIS software. He has been awarded 13 honorary doctoral degrees.

[[File:Jantar Mantar observatory in Delhi in 1858.jpg|thumb|250px|The Jantar Mantar in 1858, damaged by fighting during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].]]

'''Jantar Mantar'''  is located in the modern city of New Delhi. It consists of 13 architectural [[astronomical|astronomy]] instruments. The site is one of five built by [[Maharaja]] [[Jai Singh II]] of [[Jaipur]], from 1723 onwards, as he was given by [[Mughal emperor]] [[Muhammad Shah]] the task of revising the calendar and astronomical tables.  There is a plaque fixed on one of the structures in the [[Jantar Mantar]] observatory in [[New Delhi]] that was placed there in 1910 mistakenly dating the construction of the complex to the year 1710.  Later research, though, suggests 1724 as the actual year of construction.

The primary purpose of the observatory was to compile astronomical tables, and to predict the times and movements of the sun, moon and planets. Some of these purposes nowadays would be classified as [[astronomy]].

Completed in 1724, the Delhi Jantar Mantar had decayed considerably by 1867. The Ram Yantra, the Samrat Yantra, the Jayprakash Yantra and the Mishra Yantras are the distinct instruments of Jantar Mantar.

==Purpose of individual structures==

The 4 distinct instruments within the observatory of [[Jantar Mantar]] in [[New Delhi]]: the Samrat Yantra, the Jayaprakash, Rama Yantra and the [[Misra Yantra]].

* '''Samrat Yantra''': The Samrat Yantra, or Supreme Instrument, is a giant triangle that is basically an equal hour sundial.  It is 70 feet high, 114 feet long at the base, and 10 feet thick.  It has a {{convert|128|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} hypotenuse that is parallel to the Earth's axis and points toward the [[North Pole]].  On either side of the triangle is a quadrant with graduations indicating hours, minutes, and seconds.  At the time of the Samrat Yantra's construction, sundials already existed, but the Samrat Yantra turned the basic sundial into a precision tool for measuring declination and other related coordinates of various heavenly bodies.
* '''Jayaprakash Yantra''': The Jayaprakash consists of hollowed out hemispheres with markings on their concave surfaces. Crosswires were stretched between points on their rim.  From inside the [[Ram (building)|Ram]], an observer could align the position of a star with various markings or a window's edge.
*'''Rama Yantra''': Two large cylindrical structures with open top, used to measure the altitude of stars based on the latitude and the longitude on the earth.
* '''Misra Yantra''': The [[Misra Yantra]] (literally mixed instrument) is a composite of 5 instruments designed as a tool to determine the shortest and longest days of the year. It could also be used to indicate the exact moment of noon in various cities and locations regardless of their distance from Delhi. The Mishra yantras were able to indicate when it was noon in various cities all over the world and was the only structure in the observatory not invented by [[Jai Singh II]].

==Other observatories==
Between 1727 and 1734 [[Jai Singh II]] built five similar observatories in west-central India, all known by the name Jantar Mantar. They are located at
* [[Jantar Mantar (Jaipur)|Jaipur]], 
* [[Ujjain]], 
* [[Mathura]], and 
* [[Jantar Mantar, Varanasi|Varanasi]]. 
While the purpose of the Jantar Mantars was astronomy and astrology ([[Jyotish]]), they are also a major tourist attraction and a significant monument of the history of astronomy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28451">'''Jury sentencing''' is the practice, in some U.S. states, of having [[jury|juries]] decide what penalties to give those who have been convicted of criminal offenses. The practice of jury sentencing began in [[Virginia]] in the 18th century and spread westward to other states that were influenced by Virginia-trained lawyers.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; As of 2018, [[Arkansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.173.1272&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=59 ARK.CODE ANN. § 5-4-103|date=2010|quote=If a defendant is charged with a felony and is found guilty of an offense by a jury, the jury shall fix punishment . . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kentucky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2010|url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=39605|title=60 KY.REV.STAT.ANN. § 532.055|quote=Upon return of a verdict of guilty . . . the court shall conduct a sentencing hearing before the jury, if such case was tried before a jury.

CODE ANN. §§ 40-2704 to -2707 (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[West Virginia]] had jury sentencing in times past, but then abandoned it.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

Proponents of jury sentencing argue that since sentencing involves fact-finding (a task traditionally within the purview of juries), and since the [[original intent]] of the founders was to have juries check judges' power, it is the proper role of juries to participate in sentencing.&lt;ref name=booker/&gt; Opponents argue that judges' training and experience with the use of [[presentence report]]s and [[sentencing guidelines]], as well as the fact that [[jury control procedures]] typically deprive juries of the opportunity to hear information about the defendant's background during the trial, make it more practical to have judges sentence defendants.&lt;ref name=statutory/&gt;

==History==
===Rise of jury sentencing===
The impetus for introducing jury sentencing was that in the late 18th century, punishment options expanded beyond [[Public humiliation|shaming]] sanctions and the mandatory [[death penalty]] and came to include various ranges and modes of imprisonment, creating more room for case-by-case decisionmaking to which juries were thought to be well-suited.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Virginia was the first state to adopt jury sentencing. [[Constitution_of_Virginia#1776|The state's first constitution]] was enacted in 1776, and shortly thereafter, in 1779, [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] a revised criminal code that would have eliminated [[pardon]]s and [[benefit of clergy]], abolished capital punishment for most offenses, and allowed juries to decide punishments when the penalty was discretionary. This bill failed, however, both in 1779 and 1786, after [[James Madison]] had reintroduced it while [[Thomas_Jefferson#Minister_to_France|Jefferson was in France]].&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

Sentencing by jury was, however, successfully enacted in Virginia's 1796 penal code, which like the 1779 bill replaced capital punishment with terms of imprisonment for most felony offenses. Kentucky adopted a penal reform bill introduced by [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckenridge]] that implemented sentencing by jury in 1798. While in Virginia, magistrates continued to have misdemeanor sentencing power (possibly because of the political influence of magistrates who served in the General Assembly), in Kentucky, this power was given to juries. Kentucky juries tried and sentenced slaves and free blacks, and even decided cases involving [[prison discipline]], imposing punishments such as [[flagellation]] or [[solitary confinement]] for infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Any convict commencing a quarrel with another should "suffer such punishment (within the prison) as should be awarded by an impartial jury, but not over four lashes, or 10 hours of solitary confinement.|title=The development of American prisons and prison customs, 1776-1845|author=Lewis, O.F.|date=1922|publisher=Prison Association of New York|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentofame00lewirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia and Tennessee adopted sentencing by jury in 1816 and 1829, respectively.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In contrast, northern states such as [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] allowed judges to determine penalties, with Pennsylvania also allowing judges to pardon prisoners who, in their view, had evidenced sincere reformation. One hypothesis is that Virginia opted for jury sentencing because [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]s like [[George Keith Taylor]] distrusted the Republican district court judges; while in Pennsylvania, the Constitutionalists sought (over the objections of Republicans) to put sentencing power in the hands of the judges because the bench was populated by Constitutionalists. [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]], which did not establish penitentiaries until after the [[American Civil War]], also left sentencing to judges' discretion.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

The adoption of jury sentencing happened at the same time that the movement for an elective judiciary gathered speed, with at least four states, Alabama, Mississippi, Montana, and North Dakota switching to [[judicial election]]s around the same time that they adopted jury sentencing. Both reforms may have been due to a mistrust of unelected judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

During the ten years of the [[Republic of Texas]], judges determined sentences. The 
change to jury determination of the penalty was brought about by one of the first laws passed by the first legislature of the State of Texas in 1846, which empowered the jury to sentence the defendant in all criminal cases except capital cases and cases for which punishment was fixed by law.&lt;ref name=grab/&gt;

Indiana, Illinois, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and West Virginia adopted jury sentencing later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

===Decline of jury sentencing===
The 1895 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'' reflected growing concern that letting juries decide whether or how the law should be applied in particular cases could be detrimental to the [[rule of law]]. By 1910, the role of juries in determining penalties was being eroded by the professionalization of sentencing, as many states passed laws that created [[parole]] and [[probation]] systems.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

These systems were based on a [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] philosophy that it would be more useful for society to focus on finding ways to prevent future crime than on fixing blame for crime that had occurred in the past. Criminal behavior was viewed as the result of such factors as [[heredity]], social circumstances, random breeding, and [[Darwinian struggle]], rather than an abuse of divinely-granted [[free will]]. [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]] would determine the causes of crime and what social reforms and treatment programs would correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Probation officer]]s gathered and analyzed information about the defendant's character and prepared a presentence report that served as the basis for the ultimate sentence. Probation provided opportunities for treatment in the community for juveniles and adults. In the prison system, [[parole commission]]ers, trained in penology and insulated from political pressures, determined when prisoners had been rehabilitated and could be reintegrated into society.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

The process of preparing a presentence report, which takes weeks, only begins after the defendant is convicted, since if he/she were to be acquitted, the effort that went into preparing the report would be wasted. It would, therefore, not be possible for juries to sentence the defendant at the time of conviction, if the jury needed to rely on a presentence report in making its sentencing decision; rather, the jury would need to be broken up and reassembled later, which could be unworkable if the delay between verdict and sentencing is substantial.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

Furthermore, jury control procedures typically provide that during the trial, information about the defendant's background that is not relevant to the issue of guilt is not to be presented in the presence of the jury, lest it prejudice him. The assumptions that presentence reports would be more informative than presentence hearings, and that training and experience were required to intelligently consider the data and assess sanctions, militated in favor of having a judge rather than a jury do the sentencing.&lt;ref name=statutory&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statutory Structures for Sentencing Felons to Prison|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=1 December 1960|volume=60|number=8|pages=1134-1172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''[[McKeiver v Pennsylvania]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that alleged juvenile delinquents have no right to a jury trial, with [[Harry Blackmun]] and three other Justices opining that an adversarial system would put an end to the prospect of a intimate, informal protective proceeding focused on rehabilitation.

Georgia and Tennessee both had periods (from 1937-1939, and from 1913-1923, respectively) in which they briefly abandoned jury sentencing while experimenting with [[indeterminate sentencing]]. By 1919, fourteen states gave juries sentencing powers in non-capital cases, although by 1960, that number had dropped to thirteen.&lt;ref name=democratic&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing as Democratic Practice|author=Iontcheva, Jenia|journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=89|number=2|date=April 2003|pages=311-383|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3202435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s and 1980s, [[determinate sentencing]], a new intellectual current that repudiated the [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitative]] model with its focus on using mathematical models and grids to determine sentences, had made inroads, making jury sentencing seem like more of an anachronism.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Georgia permanently abandoned jury sentencing in 1974 and Tennessee did the same in 1982.&lt;ref name=origins&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, Nancy J.|title=The Origins of Felony Jury Sentencing in the United States|volume=78|journal=Chi.-Kent L. Rev.|number=937|date=2003|url=https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cklawreview/vol78/iss3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, and North Dakota had also abandoned jury sentencing, and Mississippi was using jury sentencing only in rape and statutory rape cases. Oklahoma abolished jury sentencing but reinstated it in 1999.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

===Possible revival of jury sentencing===
According to some commentators, the time is ripe for a revival of jury sentencing, because flaws in the determinate sentencing systems are becoming increasingly apparent. Lawmakers drafting legislation such as the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] have had difficulty mustering the political will to make clear choices among opposing moral and ideological viewpoints, instead delegating these decisions to agencies that lack the representativeness and democratic origin of legislatures. Prosecutors have routinely circumvented the sentencing guidelines through their charging and plea bargaining decisions, creating a new set of disparities, despite the intent of the guidelines to curtail disparities.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Determinate sentencing has also failed to reduce racial disparity in sentencing.&lt;ref name=idea&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing in Noncapital Cases: An Idea Whose Time Has Come (Again)?|author=Lanni, Adriaan|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1 May 1999|volume=108|number=7|pages=1775-1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, some juries have been acquitting guilty defendants to save them from what they regard as overly harsh [[mandatory minimum sentence]]s, such as those imposed by the [[Rockefeller Drug Laws]] and California's [[three-strikes law]]. There have been movements to abolish sentencing commissions and guideline systems and inform jurors of their right to nullify. Decisions like ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find any facts that would increase a defendant's maximum sentence) and ''[[Ring v. Arizona]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find whether there are aggravating factors justifying capital punishment) have also signaled a willingness by the judiciary to expand the role of the jury in the legal process.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Jury sentencing has been seen as a way to in many cases render moot the questions raised by ''Apprendi'' and related cases such as ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'' and ''[[United States v. Booker]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bibas, Stephanos and Klein, Susan R.|title=The Sixth Amendment and Criminal Sentencing|date=2008|journal=Faculty Scholarship|number=921|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/921}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the differences between [[Element (criminal law)|elements of an offense]] and sentencing factors by letting the jury decide all the facts.&lt;ref name=applying&gt;{{cite journal|title=Applying Apprendi to jury sentencing: why state felony jury sentencing threatens the right to a jury trial|author=Carrington, Melissa|journal=University of Illinois Law Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=2011|number=4|pages=1359-1385|url=http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/4/Carrington.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases such as ''[[Miller v. Alabama]]'' and ''[[Graham v. Florida]]'' (banning mandatory life imprisonment without parole, and life imprisonment without parole in non-homicide cases, respectively, for juveniles, as contrary to the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]'s prohibition of [[cruel and unusual punishment]]) also raise a question of whether the Supreme Court logically should allow only a jury, rather than a judge, to determine a juvenile should receive such a sentence, given the parallels between adult capital punishment case law and juvenile life imprisonment with parole case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Russell, Sarah F.|title=Jury Sentencing and Juveniles: Eighth Amendment Limits and Sixth Amendment Rights|volume=56|journal=B.C.L. Rev.|number=553|date=2015|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol56/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plea bargains, judicial override, and juror access to information==
In Virginia, under the 1796 act, capital punishment remained mandatory for [[first-degree murder]], but the penalty for [[second-degree murder]] was any term between five and eighteen years in the penitentiary. The 1796 act gave the court in murder cases the authority to "determine the degree of the crime, and to give sentence accordingly" when a defendant was "convicted by confession." The judge's discretion to set sentences in cases of confession did not exist in Kentucky.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In Missouri, informing juries of sentences of defendants in similar cases or the sentences of co-participants in the crime on trial is strictly prohibited under the rules of evidence." Similarly, the Kentucky [[truth in sentencing]] statute, which generally increases the information available to sentencing juries, does not provide for sentencing guidelines and statistics. Kentucky courts have also held parole eligibility statistics inadmissible. The military at one time provided [[United States military jury|jurors]] with sentencing statistics and guidelines was the military, but this practice ended in the late 1950s as the military's judicial philosophy shifted its emphasis away from sentencing uniformity and towards individualized judgments. The [[United States Court of Military Appeals]] held that jurors were not to consider sentences in similar cases or to consult the sentencing manual.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Under Virginia's current system, jurors are controversially not allowed access to the Commonwealth's [[sentencing guidelines]] or to information about whether sentences will run consecutively or concurrently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20120401-2012-04-01-dp-nws-crime-notebook-0401-20120331-story.html|date=1 April 2012|title=Virginia judges rarely question juries' sentencing recommendations|publisher=Daily Press|author=Kelly, Ashley and Dujardin, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 2000 were also not informed that parole had been abolished in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/va_md_dc/virginia-eyes-new-sentences-after-juries-didn-t-get-key/article_1008cc74-de6f-5b77-bdd0-61c099dd9400.html|title=Virginia eyes new sentences after juries didn't get key fact|author=Durkin, Alana|publisher=Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge must justify any departure from the jury's recommendation in writing to the [[Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission]]. Less than one-quarter of jury-recommended sentences are modified by judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Caleb R.|title=Sentencing Roulette: How Virginia’s Criminal Sentencing System is Imposing an Unconstitutional Trial Penalty That Suppresses the Rights of Criminal Defendants to a Jury Trial|volume=23|journal=Wm.&amp; Mary Bill Rts. J.|number=559|date=2014|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmborj/vol23/iss2/10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to concerns about juries' imposing higher sentences than what the sentencing guidelines would suggest, many defendants opt either for [[bench trial]]s or [[plea bargain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Number of juried trials slumps both in Va., nationwide |url=https://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/number-of-juried-trials-slumps-both-in-va-nationwide/article_d2dbfd5c-34cc-5d9c-b999-a9c6641783f9.html|author=Green, Frank|publisher=Daily Progress|date=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States with jury sentencing have often allowed judges to intervene in the sentencing process, e.g. by reducing the sentence imposed by the jury, imposing hard labor or solitary confinement in addition to the jury's assessment of fines, or determining the place of confinement imposed by the jury.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In Alabama, judges were allowed to override juries' recommendations of life imprisonment and impose capital punishment instead, until a 2017 law took that power away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2017/07/death_penalty_judicial_overrid.html|title=Did judicial override end in Alabama? Some say judges can still overrule jury over death penalty|date=21 July 2017|publisher=AL.com|author=Remkus, Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; All jury sentencing states except Texas allow the judge to fix the punishment in case the jury fails to agree on a sentence,&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; making it impossible for there to be a mistrial due to a [[hung jury]] at sentencing.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

==Arguments for and against jury sentencing==
Arguments that have been raised for sentencing by jury are that judges can be arbitrary (depending, e.g., on their mood at the time of sentencing) and partisan, and that putting the same person in charge of both deciding sentences and extending leniency (e.g. through pardons) centralizes too much power in one person. Also, different judges may be inconsistent in the judgments they render. Another argument in favor of jury sentencing is that the punishment equitably due is best determined by the particular circumstances of the case, rather than by legal technicalities; and that a jury is well-equipped for this purpose.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; Also, if juries have power to give a lenient sentence, they may be less likely to engage in [[jury nullification]] by acquitting a guilty defendant whom they believe is undeserving of severe punishment.&lt;ref name=idea/&gt;

An argument based on the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendments to the United States Constitution]] is that criminal and civil juries have similar societal functions, including checking the abuse of governmental power, injecting community values into legal decisions, and aiding public acceptance of legal determinations; and therefore the criminal system should have juries decide sentences much as the civil system has juries decide judgments.&lt;ref name=booker&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kirgis, Paul F.|title=The Right to a Jury Decision on Sentencing Facts after Booker: What the Seventh Amendment Can Teach the Sixth|volume=39|journal=Ga. L. Rev.|number=897|date=2005|url=http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/faculty_lawreviews/131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments that have been raised against sentencing by jury are that juries are not as accountable as judges; that putting them in charge of determining both guilt and the sentence concentrates too much power in one body; and that different juries may differ widely in the sentences they impose. Counterarguments are that the lack of accountability of jurors to a higher authority preserves their [[judicial independence]], and that judges are also capable of differing from other judges in the sentences they impose. Judges may even deviate from their own usual sentencing practices if the case is high-profile or a judicial election is coming up. Also, disparities are not always a sign of arbitrariness; sometimes they may reflect geographical differences in public attitudes toward a given crime, or a jury's taking proper account of the individual circumstances of each offender.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

It is sometimes argued that an unreasonable juror may force the rest of the jury into an undesirable compromise to find the defendant guilty but impose an overly light sentence. A counter-argument is that whether this is bad or good is a matter of perception since "one juror's principled holdout is another juror's irrational nullification. One jury's 'compromise' is another jury's perfectly appropriate give-and-take deliberations."&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1185&amp;context=dlj|title=The Case for Jury Sentencing|author=Hoffman, Morris B.|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=52|number=951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to University of Chicago Law School lecturer Jenia Iontcheva, sentencing decisions are well-suited to being made through a process of [[deliberative democracy]] rather than by experts such as judges, since they involve deeply contested moral and political issues rather than scientific or technical issues. She argues that since sentencing requires individualized, case-by-case assessments, sentences should be decided through small-scale deliberation by juries, as opposed to having lawmakers codify general policies for mechanical application by judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

An advantage Iontcheva cites of having juries come together to deliberate on sentences is that the jurors may alter their preferences in the light of new perspectives. She argues that the hearing and consideration of diverse opinions will give the sentencing decisions greater legitimacy, and that engaging ordinary citizens in government through this process of deliberative democracy will give these citizens confidence about their ability to influence political decisions and thus increase their willingness to participate in politics even after the end of their jury service. Racial and other minorities may also benefit from having greater representation among jurors than among judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

In jurisdictions that do not have any statutory provisions formally allowing jury sentencing, judges have sometimes consulted with the jury on sentencing anyway. At the federal level, the practice of polling the jury and using their input in sentencing was upheld on appeal by the [[6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/06/federal_appeals_court_upholds.html|title=Federal appeals court upholds judge's lowest possible sentence in child-porn case|author=Heisig, Eric|publisher=Cleveland.com|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentencing is said to be more time-consuming for jurors than the relatively easy task of ascertaining guilt or innocence,&lt;ref name=grab&gt;{{cite journal|author=Webster, Charles W.|title=Jury Sentencing - Grab-Bag Justice|volume=14|journal=Sw L.J.|number=221|date=1960|url=https://scholar.smu.edu/smulr/vol14/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means an increase in jury fees and in the amount of productivity lost to jury duty.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In [[New South Wales]], a 2007 proposal by Chief Justice [[Jim Spigelman]] to involve juries in sentencing was rejected after District Court Chief Judge [[Reg Blanch]] cited "an expected wide difference of views between jurors about questions relating to sentence". Concerns about [[jury tampering]] through intimidation by defendants were also raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/keep-juries-away-from-sentencing-say-judges-20070427-gdq067.html|title=Keep juries away from sentencing, say judges|author=Pearlman, Jonathan|date=27 April 2007|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] and many other [[continental Europe]]an countries have a system in which professional judges and [[Judiciary_of_Germany#Lay_judges|lay judges]] deliberate together at both the trial and sentencing stages; such systems have been praised as a superior alternative because the mixed court dispenses with most of the time‐consuming practices of jury control that characterize Anglo‐American trial procedure, yet serves the purposes of a jury trial better than plea bargaining and bench trials, which have displaced the jury from routine American practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mixed Court and Jury Court: Could the Continental Alternative Fill the American Need?|author=Langbein, John H.|date=January 1981|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-4469.1981.tb00426.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable jury sentences==
Civil rights leader [[James Bevel]] was sentenced to 15 years in prison pursuant to the recommendation of a Virginia jury that found him guilty of having sex with his teenage daughter in the 1990s when they lived in Leesburg. The sentencing range had been 5 to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=43768|title=Civil Rights Leader Convicted of Incest|author=Barakat, Matthew|publisher=Associated Press|date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drizzlecombe kist 5.JPG|thumb|right|'''Kistvaen''' showing [[Coping (architecture)|capstone]] and [[cist]] structure ([[Dartmoor]] in [[Drizzlecombe]])]]
[[File:Drizzlecombe kist 1.JPG|thumb|'''Kistvaen''' on the southern edge of Dartmoor in Drizzlecombe]]

A '''kistvaen''' or '''cistvaen''' is a [[tomb]] or [[burial chamber]] formed from flat stone slabs in a box-like shape. If set completely underground, it may be covered by a ''[[tumulus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril M. Harris, ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'' (Courier Dover Publications, 1983), p. 118 with illustration [https://books.google.com/books?id=6n4JLmyooTwC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=kistvaen&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1946&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=kistvaen&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from the [[Welsh Language|Welsh]] ''[[cist]]'' (chest) and ''maen'' (stone). The term originated in relation to [[Celts|Celtic]] structures, typically pre-[[Christian]], but in [[antiquarian]] scholarship of the 19th and early 20th centuries it was sometimes applied to similar structures outside the [[Celtic nations|Celtic world]].

[[File:Kist off merrivale row-4.jpg|thumb|Kistvaen to the south of the stone rows at [[Merrivale, Devon|Merrivale]] on [[Dartmoor]]]]

One of the most numerous kinds of kistvaen are the [[Dartmoor kistvaens]]. These often take the form of small rectangular pits about 3&amp;nbsp;ft. (0.9 m) long by 2 feet (0.6 m) wide. The kistvaens were usually covered with a mound of earth and surrounded by a circle of small stones. When a body was placed in the kistvaen, it was usually lain in a contracted position. Sometimes however the body was [[cremate]]d with the ashes placed in a [[cinerary urn]].

==Kistvaens and Celtic saints==
Kistvaens are also found associated with holy sites or burial places of early [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic saints]], who are often [[hagiography|semi-legendary]]. Saints associated with kistvaens include [[Callwen]] daughter of [[Brychan]], [[Gerent, Saint|Geraint]],&lt;ref&gt;S.

'''''Law and the Modern Mind''''' is a 1930 book by [[Jerome Frank]] which argued that [[judicial decision]]s were more influenced by psychological factors than by objective legal premises.

Frank, then a legal academic, published the book after having undergone six months of [[psychoanalysis]]. In it, he argued against the "basic legal myth" that judges never make law but simply deduce legal conclusions from premises that are clear, certain, and substantially unchanging. Drawing on psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jean Piaget]], Frank proposed that judicial decisions were motivated primarily by the influence of psychological factors on the individual judge.&lt;ref name="Volkomer"&gt;Walter E. Volkomer, "Frank, Jerome N.", in Roger K. Newman, ed., ''The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law'' (2009), p. 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his judicial hero, Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], Frank urged judges and legal scholars to acknowledge openly the gaps and uncertainties in the law, and to think of law pragmatically as a tool for human betterment.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Frank, ''Law and the Modern Mind''. New York: Anchor Books, 1963, pp. 270-77.&lt;/ref&gt; The book "dropped like a bombshell on the legal and academic world",&lt;ref name="Volkomer"/&gt; quickly becoming "a jurisprudential bestseller" which "was widely noticed as well as criticized".&lt;ref&gt;Lon Luvois Fuller, Thomas W. Bechtler, ''Law in a Social Context: Liber Amicorum Honouring Professor Lon L. Fuller'' (1978), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light pollution''', also known as '''photopollution''', is the presence of anthropogenic light in the night environment. It is exacerbated by excessive, misdirected or obtrusive uses of light, but even carefully used light fundamentally alters natural conditions. As a major side-effect of urbanization, it is blamed for compromising health, disrupting ecosystems and spoiling aesthetic environments.

==Definitions==
Light [[pollution]] is the adding-of/added light itself, in analogy to added sound, [[carbon dioxide]], etc. Adverse consequences are multiple; some of them may not be known yet. Scientific definitions thus include the following:
*The degradation of photic habitat by artificial light.&lt;ref name="scientific_definition1985"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The alteration of natural light levels in the outdoor environment owing to artificial light sources.&lt;ref name="scientific_definition0"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03562.x|date=2000|last1=Cinzano|pages=641–657|volume=318|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|url=http://www.lightpollution.it/cinzano/download/mnras_paper.pdf|first1=P.|last2=Falchi|first2=F.|last3=Elvidge|first3=C.

*The alteration of light levels in the outdoor environment (from those present naturally) due to man-made sources of light. Indoor light pollution is such alteration of light levels in the indoor environment due to sources of light, which compromises human health.&lt;ref name="scientific_definition"&gt;[http://amper.ped.muni.cz/light/lp_what_is.pdf Hollan, J: What is light pollution, and how do we quantify it?]. Darksky2008 conference paper, Vienna, August 2008. Updated April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The introduction by humans, directly or indirectly, of artificial light into the environment.&lt;ref name="scientific_definitionAct"&gt;Marín, C. and Orlando, G. (eds.) (June 2009) [http://www.starlight2007.net/pdf/FinalReportFuerteventuraSL.pdf Starlight Reserves and World Heritage]. Starlight Initiative, IAC and the UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Fuerteventura, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three of the above four scientific definitions describe the state of the environment. The fourth (and newest) one describes the process of polluting by light.

Light pollution competes with starlight in the [[night sky]] for urban residents, interferes with [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory|observatories]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/community/lightpollution.html |title=Light Pollution and Palomar Observatory |publisher=[[Caltech]] Astronomy |location=[[Palomar Observatory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, like any other form of [[pollution]], disrupts [[ecosystem]]s and has adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-earth-artificial-light-night-darkness-20171122-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-science-light/the-future-looks-bright-light-pollution-rises-on-a-global-scale-idUSKBN1DM2OK&lt;/ref&gt;

Light pollution is a side-effect of industrial civilization. Its sources include building exterior and interior lighting, advertising, outdoor area lighting (e.g. car parks/parking lots), offices, factories, streetlights, and illuminated sporting venues. It is most severe in highly industrialized, densely populated areas of [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Japan]] and in major cities in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] like [[Tehran]] and [[Cairo]], but even relatively small amounts of light can be noticed and create problems. Awareness of the deleterious effects of light pollution began early in the 20th Century (see e.g. Beston&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beston|first1=Henry|title=The Outermost House|date=1928|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York, New York|isbn=080507368X}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but efforts to address effects did not begin until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Portree|first1=David. S. F.|title=Flagstaff’s Battle for Dark Skies|journal=The Griffith Observer|date=2002|issue=October, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s a global [[dark-sky movement]] emerged with the founding of the [[International Dark-Sky Association]] (IDA). There are now such educational and advocacy organizations in many countries worldwide.

==Impact on energy usage==
[[Energy conservation]] advocates contend that light pollution must be addressed by changing the [[Habituation|habit]]s of society, so that lighting is used more [[lighting efficiency|efficiently]], with less waste and less creation of unwanted or unneeded illumination.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Several industry groups also recognize light pollution as an important issue. For example, the [[Institution of Lighting Engineers]] in the [[United Kingdom]] provides its members with information about light pollution, the problems it causes, and how to reduce its impact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070212032719/http://www.ile.org.uk/index.php?page=pollution Light Nuisance]. Institution of Light Engineers&lt;/ref&gt; Although, recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=Christopher C.

Since not everyone is irritated by the same lighting sources, it is common for one person's light "pollution" to be light that is desirable for another. One example of this is found in advertising, when an advertiser wishes for particular lights to be bright and visible, even though others find them annoying. Other types of light pollution are more certain. For instance, light that ''accidentally'' crosses a property boundary and annoys a neighbor is generally wasted and pollutive light.

Disputes are still common when deciding appropriate action; and differences in opinion over what light is considered reasonable, and who should be responsible, mean that negotiation must sometimes take place between parties. Where objective measurement is desired, light levels can be quantified by field measurement or [[mathematical model]]ing, with results typically displayed as an isophote map or light [[contour line|contour map]]. Authorities have also taken a variety of measures for dealing with light pollution, depending on the interests, beliefs and understandings of the society involved.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Measures range from doing nothing at all, to implementing strict laws and regulations about how lights may be installed and used.

==Types==

'''Light pollution''' is a broad term that refers to multiple problems, all of which are caused by inefficient, unappealing, or (arguably) unnecessary use of artificial light. Specific categories of light pollution include light trespass, [[over-illumination]], [[glare (vision)|glare]], light clutter, and [[skyglow]]. A single offending light source often falls into more than one of these categories.

===Light trespass===
Light trespass occurs when unwanted light enters one's property, for instance, by shining over a neighbor's fence. A common light trespass problem occurs when a strong light enters the window of one's home from the outside, causing problems such as [[sleep deprivation]]. A number of cities in the U.S. have developed standards for outdoor lighting to protect the rights of their citizens against light trespass. To assist them, the [[International Dark-Sky Association]] has developed a set of model lighting ordinances.&lt;ref name="International Dark-Sky Association"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081122040258/http://www.darksky.org/programs/model-lighting-ordinance.php International Dark-Sky Association]. darksky.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dark-Sky Association was started to reduce the light going up into the sky which reduces visibility of stars (see Skyglow below). This is any light which is emitted more than 90° above [[nadir]]. By limiting light at this 90° mark they have also reduced the light output in the 80–90° range which creates most of the light trespass issues.
[[File:Phoenix Lights from afar.jpg|thumb|The light pollution from the city of Phoenix can be seen from 55 miles away in Surprise.  Even from afar the pollution is severe and travels high into the night sky.]]
U.S. federal agencies may also enforce standards and process complaints within their areas of jurisdiction. For instance, in the case of light trespass by white [[strobe]] lighting from communication towers in excess of [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] minimum lighting requirements&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| title = AC 70/7460-1K Obstruction Marking and Lighting| date = 2007-02-01| url = http://wireless.fcc.gov/antenna/documentation/faadocs/7460-1K.pdf|format = PDF| accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Communications Commission]] maintains an Antenna Structure Registration database&lt;ref name="FCC Antenna Structure Registration"&gt;{{cite web| title = FCC Antenna Structure Registration|url = http://wireless.fcc.gov/antenna/index.htm?&amp;job=home|accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; information which citizens may use to identify offending structures and provides a mechanism for processing citizen inquiries and complaints.&lt;ref name="fcc.gov"&gt;{{cite web| title = FCC Consumer &amp; Governmental Affairs Bureau|url = http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/cgb_offices.html#CICD|publisher=U.S. Federal Communications Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC) has also incorporated a credit for reducing the amount of light trespass and sky glow into their environmentally friendly building standard known as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]].

Light trespass can be reduced by selecting light fixtures which limit the amount of light emitted more than 80° above the nadir. The [[Illuminating Engineering Society of North America|IESNA]] definitions include full cutoff (0%), cutoff (10%), and semi-cutoff (20%). (These definitions also include limits on light emitted above 90° to reduce sky glow.)

===Over-illumination===
{{Main|Over-illumination}}
{{bad summary}}

[[File:HPS-lamps.jpg|thumb|right|190px|An office building is illuminated by [[sodium lamp|high pressure sodium (HPS)]] lamps shining upward, of which much light goes into the sky and neighboring apartment blocks and causes light pollution.]]

Over-illumination is the excessive use of light. Specifically within the [[United States]], over-illumination is responsible for approximately two million [[Barrel (unit)#Oil barrel|barrels of oil]] per day in [[Efficient energy use|energy wasted]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} This is based upon U.S. consumption of equivalent of {{convert|18.8|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} of petroleum.&lt;ref name="Energy Explained"&gt;{{Cite web |publication-date=April 23, 2012 |title=Oil: Crude and Petroleum Products Explained |work=Energy Explained |publisher=[[Energy Information Administration]] |url=http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=oil_home#tab2 |at=Data &amp; Statistics: Consumption and Disposition |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further noted in the same U.S. Department of Energy source that over 30% of all primary energy is consumed by commercial, industrial and residential sectors. Energy audits of existing buildings demonstrate that the lighting component of residential, commercial and industrial uses consumes about 20–40% of those land uses, variable with region and land use. (Residential use lighting consumes only 10–30% of the energy bill while commercial buildings' major use is lighting.&lt;ref name="Irby Circuit – Energy Savings"&gt;[http://www.irby.com/IrbyCircuit/Vol1No2/energysavings.htm Irby Circuit – Energy Savings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315214321/http://www.irby.com/IrbyCircuit/Vol1No2/energysavings.htm |date=2006-03-15 }}. Irby.com. Retrieved 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;) Thus lighting energy accounts for about four or five million barrels of oil (equivalent) per day. Again energy audit data demonstrates that about 30–60% of energy consumed in lighting is unneeded or gratuitous.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lumina Technologies, Santa Rosa, California, ''Survey of 156 California commercial buildings energy use'', August, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative calculation starts with the fact that commercial building lighting consumes in excess of 81.68 [[terawatt]]s (1999 data) of electricity,&lt;ref name="eia.doe.gov"&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/contents.html Energy Information Administration — Commercial Energy Consumption Survey]. Eia.doe.gov. Retrieved 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; according to the U.S. DOE. Thus commercial lighting alone consumes about four to five million barrels per day (equivalent) of petroleum, in line with the alternate rationale above to estimate U.S. lighting energy consumption. Even among developed countries there are large differences in patterns of light use. American cities emit 3–5 times more light to space per capita compared to German cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=Christopher|last2=Garz|first2=Stefanie|last3=Kuechly|first3=Helga|last4=de Miguel|first4=Alejandro|last5=Zamorano|first5=Jaime|last6=Fischer|first6=Jürgen|last7=Hölker|first7=Franz|title=High-Resolution Imagery of Earth at Night: New Sources, Opportunities and Challenges|journal=Remote Sensing|date=23 December 2014|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.3390/rs70100001|bibcode = 2014RemS....7....1K |url=http://eprints.ucm.es/29216/}}&lt;!--|accessdate=8 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Over-illumination stems from several factors:

* Consensus based standards or norms that are not based on vision science;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fotios|first1=S|last2=Gibbons|first2=R|title=Road lighting research for drivers and pedestrians: The basis of luminance and illuminance recommendations|journal=Lighting Research &amp; Technology|date=9 January 2018|volume=50|issue=1|pages=154–186|doi=10.1177/1477153517739055}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not using timers, [[occupancy sensor]]s or other controls to extinguish lighting when not needed;
* Improper design, by specifying higher levels of light than needed for a given visual task;&lt;ref name="EcoSky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=Christopher C. M.|last2=Mohar|first2=Andrej|last3=Pintar|first3=Gašper|last4=Stare|first4=Jurij|title=Reducing the environmental footprint of church lighting: matching façade shape and lowering luminance with the EcoSky LED|journal=International Journal of Sustainable Lighting|date=20 February 2018|volume=19|issue=2|pages=132|doi=10.26607/ijsl.v19i2.80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Incorrect choice of fixtures or [[light bulbs]], which do not direct light into areas as needed;&lt;ref name="EcoSky"/&gt;
* Improper selection of hardware to utilize more energy than needed to accomplish the lighting task;
* Incomplete training of building managers and occupants to use lighting systems efficiently;
* Inadequate lighting maintenance resulting in increased [[stray light]] and energy costs;
* "Daylight lighting" demanded by citizens to reduce crime or by shop owners to attract customers;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Over-illumination can be a design choice, not a fault. In both cases target achievement is questionable.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Substitution of old lamps with more efficient [[LED]]s using the same electrical power; and
* [[Indirect lighting]] techniques, such as illuminating a vertical wall to bounce light onto the ground.

Most of these issues can be readily corrected with available, inexpensive technology, and with resolution of landlord/tenant practices that create barriers to rapid correction of these matters. Most importantly, public awareness would need to improve for industrialized countries to realize the large payoff in reducing over-illumination.

In certain cases an over-illumination lighting technique may be needed. For example, indirect lighting is often used to obtain a "softer" look, since hard direct lighting is generally found less desirable for certain surfaces, such as skin. The indirect lighting method is perceived as more cozy and suits bars, restaurants and living quarters. It is also possible to block the direct lighting effect by adding softening filters or other solutions, though intensity will be reduced.

===Glare===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Solar power]]. --&gt;
{{Main|Glare (vision)}}

Glare can be categorized into different types. One such classification is described in a book by Bob Mizon, coordinator for the British Astronomical Association's Campaign for Dark Skies, as follows:&lt;ref name="Mizon, Bob 2001"&gt;Mizon, Bob (2001) ''Light Pollution: Responses and Remedies''. Springer. {{ISBN|1-85233-497-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Blinding glare'' describes effects such as that caused by staring into the Sun. It is completely blinding and leaves temporary or permanent vision deficiencies.
*''Disability glare'' describes effects such as being blinded by oncoming car lights, or light scattering in fog or in the eye, reducing contrast, as well as reflections from print and other dark areas that render them bright, with significant reduction in sight capabilities.
*''Discomfort glare'' does not typically cause a dangerous situation in itself, though it is annoying and irritating at best. It can potentially cause fatigue if experienced over extended periods.

According to Mario Motta, president of the [[Massachusetts Medical Society]], "... glare from bad lighting is a public-health hazard—especially the older you become. Glare light scattering in the eye causes loss of contrast and leads to unsafe driving conditions, much like the glare on a dirty windshield from low-angle sunlight or the high beams from an oncoming car."&lt;ref name = "MottaJune09"&gt;{{cite web| last = Motta| first = Mario| title = U.S. Physicians Join Light-Pollution Fight| work = news| publisher = Sky &amp; Telescope| date = 2009-06-22| url = http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/48814012.html| accessdate = 2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence bright and/or badly shielded lights around roads can partially blind drivers or pedestrians and contribute to accidents.

The blinding effect is caused in large part by reduced contrast due to light scattering in the eye by excessive brightness, or to reflection of light from dark areas in the field of vision, with luminance similar to the background luminance. This kind of glare is a particular instance of disability glare, called veiling glare. (This is not the same as loss of accommodation of [[night vision]] which is caused by the direct effect of the light itself on the eye.)
[[File:San Tan Mountain Lights.jpg|thumb|The view of the Phoenix metro area and its light clutter and pollution from the top of Goldmine Trail in the San Tan Mountains.]]

===Light clutter===
[[File:Las Vegas Strip.png|thumb|right|200px|The [[Las Vegas Strip]] displays excessive groupings of colorful lights. This is a classic example of light clutter.]]

Light clutter refers to excessive groupings of lights. Groupings of lights may generate confusion, distract from obstacles (including those that they may be intended to illuminate), and potentially cause accidents. Clutter is particularly noticeable on roads where the street lights are badly designed, or where brightly lit advertising surrounds the roadways. Depending on the motives of the person or organization that installed the lights, their placement and design can even be intended to distract drivers, and can contribute to accidents.

==Measurement and global effects==
[[File:Light pollution europe.jpg|thumb|left|200px|False colors show intensities of [[skyglow]] from artificial light sources.]]

Measuring the effect of sky glow on a global scale is a complex procedure. The natural atmosphere is not completely dark, even in the absence of terrestrial sources of light and illumination from the Moon. This is caused by two main sources: ''airglow'' and ''scattered light''.

At high altitudes, primarily above the [[mesosphere]], there is enough UV radiation from the sun of very short wavelength to cause [[ionization]]. When the ions collide with electrically neutral particles they recombine and emit photons in the process, causing [[airglow]]. The degree of ionization is sufficiently large to allow a constant emission of radiation even during the night when the upper atmosphere is in the Earth's shadow. Lower in the atmosphere all of the solar photons with energies above the ionization potential of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have already been absorbed by the higher layers and thus no appreciable ionization occurs.

Apart from emitting light, the sky also scatters incoming light, primarily from distant stars and the [[Milky Way]], but also the [[zodiacal light]], sunlight that is reflected and backscattered from interplanetary dust particles.

The amount of airglow and zodiacal light is quite variable (depending, amongst other things on sunspot activity and the [[Solar cycle]]) but given optimal conditions the darkest possible sky has a brightness of about 22 magnitude/square arcsecond. If a full moon is present, the [[sky brightness]] increases to about 18 magnitude/sq. arcsecond depending on local atmospheric transparency, 40 times brighter than the darkest sky. In densely populated areas a sky brightness of 17 magnitude/sq. arcsecond is not uncommon, or as much as 100 times brighter than is natural.

To precisely measure how bright the sky gets, night time satellite imagery of the earth is used as raw input for the number and intensity of light sources. These are put into a physical model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Inspection of the area surrounding Madrid reveals that the effects of light pollution caused by a single large conglomeration can be felt up to {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} away from the center.&lt;ref name=NWA/&gt;
Global effects of light pollution are also made obvious. The entire area consisting of southern England, Netherlands, Belgium, west Germany, and northern France have a sky brightness of at least 2 to 4 times above normal (see above right). The only places in continental Europe where the sky can attain its natural darkness are in northern Scandinavia and in islands far from the continent.

In North America the situation is comparable. There is a significant problem with light pollution ranging from the Canadian Maritime Provinces to the American Southwest.&lt;ref name=NWA /&gt; The [[International Dark-Sky Association]] works to designate areas that have high quality night skies. These areas are supported by communities and organizations that are dedicated to reducing light pollution (e.g.[[Dark-sky preserve]]).

In June 2009, the [[American Medical Association]] developed a policy in support of control of light pollution. News about the decision emphasized [[glare (vision)|glare]] as a [[public health]] hazard leading to unsafe driving conditions. Especially in the elderly, glare produces loss of contrast, obscuring night vision.&lt;ref name = "MottaJune09"/&gt;

===Disruption of ecosystems===
{{Main|Ecological light pollution}}
When artificial light affects organisms and ecosystems it is called [[ecological light pollution]]. While light at night can be beneficial, neutral, or damaging for individual [[species]], its presence invariably disturbs ecosystems. For example, some species of spiders avoid lit areas, while other species are happy to build their [[spider web]] directly on a lamp post. Since lamp posts attract many flying insects, the spiders that don't mind light gain an advantage over the spiders that avoid it. This is a simple example of the way in which species frequencies and food webs can be disturbed by the introduction of light at night.

Light pollution poses a serious threat in particular to [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] wildlife, having negative impacts on plant and animal physiology. It can confuse [[animal navigation]], alter competitive interactions, change predator-prey relations, and cause physiological harm.&lt;ref name="Perry08"&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Perry| first1=G.| last2=Buchanan| first2=B.

Studies suggest that light pollution around lakes prevents zooplankton, such as [[Daphnia]], from eating surface [[algae]], causing [[algal bloom]]s that can kill off the lakes' plants and lower water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Moore, Marianne V.| author2=Pierce, Stephanie M. | author3=Walsh, Hannah M. | author4=Kvalvik, Siri K. | author5=Julie D.

This form of pollution is named [[polarized light pollution]] (PLP). Unnatural polarized light sources can trigger maladaptive behaviors in polarization-sensitive taxa and alter ecological interactions.&lt;ref name="PolarizedLightEnv" /&gt;

Lights on tall structures can disorient migrating birds. Estimates by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of the number of birds killed after being attracted to tall towers range from 4 to 5 million per year to an order of magnitude higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Malakoff, D. |title=Faulty towers|journal=Audubon|date=2001|volume=103|pages=78–83 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP) works with building owners in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada and other cities to reduce mortality of birds by turning out lights during migration periods.

Similar disorientation has also been noted for bird species migrating close to offshore production and drilling facilities. Studies carried out by Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij b.v. (NAM) and Shell have led to development and trial of new lighting technologies in the North Sea. In early 2007, the lights were installed on the Shell production platform L15. The experiment proved a great success since the number of birds circling the platform declined by 50 to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nam.nl/home/Framework?siteId=nam-nl |title=Welkom op de site van de Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij BV |publisher=Nam.nl |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sea turtle]] hatchlings emerging from nests on beaches are another casualty of light pollution. It is a common misconception that hatchling sea turtles are attracted to the moon.

Introduced light sources during normally dark periods can disrupt levels of melatonin production. Melatonin is a hormone that regulates photoperiodic physiology and behaviour.

In September 2009, the 9th European Dark-Sky Symposium in Armagh, Northern Ireland had a session on the environmental effects of light at night (LAN). It dealt with bats, turtles, the "hidden" harms of LAN, and many other topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/2181927 Video] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102120622/http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/2181927 |date=2011-01-02 }}.

The following is an excerpt from that article, called "Electricity and English songbirds":

{{quote|An English journal has become alarmed at the relation of electricity to songbirds, which it maintains is closer than that of cats and fodder crops. How many of us, it asks, foresee that electricity may extirpate the songbird?...With the exception of the finches, all the English songbirds may be said to be insectivorous, and their diet consists chiefly of vast numbers of very small insects which they collect from the grass and herbs before the dew is dry. As the electric light is finding its way for street illumination into the country parts of England, these poor winged atoms are slain by thousands at each light every warm summer evening....The fear is expressed, that when England is lighted from one end to the other with electricity the song birds will die out from the failure of their food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electricity and English songbirds|date=14 September 1897|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Effect on astronomy===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2008}}
[[File:Light pollution It's not pretty.jpg|thumb|The constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], imaged at left from dark skies, and at right from within the Provo/Orem, Utah metropolitan area.]]

[[Astronomy]] is very sensitive to light pollution. The [[night sky]] viewed from a city bears no resemblance to what can be seen from dark skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/light-pollution/klinkenborg-text |work=[[National Geographic]] |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |date=November 2008 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Skyglow]] (the [[light scattering by particles|scattering of light]] in the atmosphere at night) reduces the contrast between stars and [[galaxy|galaxies]] and the sky itself, making it much harder to see fainter [[astronomical object|objects]]. This is one factor that has caused newer [[telescope]]s to be built in increasingly remote areas.

Some astronomers use narrow-band "[[astronomical filter|nebula filters]]", which only allow specific wavelengths of light commonly seen in [[nebula]]e, or broad-band "light pollution filters", which are designed to reduce (but not eliminate) the effects of light pollution by [[optical filter|filtering]] out [[spectral line]]s commonly emitted by [[sodium-vapor lamp|sodium]]- and [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, thus enhancing contrast and improving the view of dim objects such as galaxies and nebulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronexus.com/node/4 |title=Use of light pollution filters in astronomy |publisher=Astronexus |accessdate=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, these light pollution reduction (LPR) filters are not a cure for light pollution. LPR filters reduce the brightness of the object under study and this limits the use of higher magnifications. LPR filters work by blocking light of certain wavelengths, which alters the color of the object, often creating a pronounced green cast. Furthermore, LPR filters only work on certain object types (mainly [[emission nebulae]]) and are of little use on galaxies and stars. No filter can match the effectiveness of a dark sky for visual or [[photographic filter|photographic]] purposes.

Light pollution affects the visibility of [[deep-sky object|diffuse sky objects]] like nebulae and galaxies more than stars, due to their low surface brightness. Most such objects are rendered invisible in heavily light-polluted skies above major cities. A simple method for estimating the darkness of a location is to look for the [[Milky Way]], which from truly dark skies appears bright enough to cast a shadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite APOD |date=23 August 2010 |title=A Milky Way Shadow at Loch Ard Gorge |access-date=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to skyglow, light trespass can impact observations when artificial light directly enters the tube of the telescope and is reflected from non-optical surfaces until it eventually reaches the [[eyepiece]]. This direct form of light pollution causes a glow across the [[field of view]], which reduces contrast. Light trespass also makes it hard for a visual observer to become sufficiently adapted to the dark. The usual measures to reduce this glare, if reducing the light directly is not an option, include [[flocking (texture)|flocking]] the telescope tube and accessories to reduce reflection, and putting a [[light shield]] (also usable as a [[dew shield]]) on the telescope to reduce light entering from angles other than those near the target. Under these conditions, some astronomers prefer to observe under a black cloth to ensure maximum [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] to the dark.

=== Increase in atmospheric pollution ===
A study presented at the [[American Geophysical Union]] meeting in [[San Francisco]] found that light pollution destroys [[nitrate]] [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]] thus preventing the normal night time reduction of atmospheric smog produced by fumes emitted from cars and factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11990737 | work=BBC News | title=City lighting 'boosts pollution' | date=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.agu.org/cgi-bin/SFgate/SFgate?language=English&amp;verbose=0&amp;listenv=table&amp;application=fm10&amp;convert=&amp;converthl=&amp;refinequery=&amp;formintern=&amp;formextern=&amp;transquery=au%3dstark&amp;_lines=&amp;multiple=0&amp;descriptor=%2fdata%2fepubs%2fwais%2findexes%2ffm10%2ffm10 | title=Nighttime photochemistry: Nitrate radical destruction by anthropogenic light sources }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was presented by Harald Stark from the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].

=== Reduction of natural sky polarization ===
[[File:Effect of light pollution on sky polarization.jpg|thumb|Light pollution is mostly unpolarized, and its addition to moonlight results in a decreased polarization signal.]]

In the night, the polarization of the moonlit sky is very strongly reduced in the presence of [[Urban area|urban]] light pollution, because scattered urban light is not strongly polarized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=C.

[[File:LED Droplight.JPG|thumb|right|This kind of LED droplight could reduce unnecessary light pollution in building interiors]]
Reducing light pollution implies many things, such as reducing sky glow, reducing glare, reducing light trespass, and reducing clutter. The method for best reducing light pollution, therefore, depends on exactly what the problem is in any given instance. Possible solutions include:
* Utilizing light sources of minimum intensity necessary to accomplish the light's purpose.
* Turning lights off using a timer or occupancy sensor or manually when not needed.
* Improving lighting fixtures, so that they direct their light more accurately towards where it is needed, and with fewer side effects.
* Adjusting the ''type'' of lights used, so that the light waves emitted are those that are less likely to cause severe light pollution problems. Mercury, metal halide and above all first generation of blue-light LED road luminaires are much more polluting than sodium lamps: Earth's atmosphere scatters and transmits blue light better than yellow or red light. It is a common experience observing "glare" and "fog" around and below LED road luminaires as soon as air humidity increases, while orange sodium lamp luminaires are less prone to showing this phenomenon.
* Evaluating existing lighting plans, and re-designing some or all of the plans depending on whether existing light is actually needed.

===Improving lighting fixtures===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}

[[File:Flat-lens cobra luminaire.jpg|thumb|A ''flat-lens cobra luminaire'', which is a full-cutoff fixture, is very effective in reducing light pollution. It ensures that light is only directed below the horizontal, which means less light is wasted through directing it outwards and upwards.]]
[[File:Drop-lens cobra luminaire.jpg|thumb|This ''drop-lens cobra luminaire'' allows light to escape sideways and upwards, where it may cause problems.]]

The use of ''full cutoff'' lighting fixtures, as much as possible, is advocated by most campaigners for the reduction of light pollution. It is also commonly recommended that lights be spaced appropriately for maximum efficiency, and that number of luminaires being used as well as the wattage of each luminaire match the needs of the particular application (based on local lighting design standards).

Full cutoff fixtures first became available in 1959 with the introduction of [[General Electric]]'s M100 fixture.&lt;ref name="AM-Feb2009-57"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakich|first=M.E.|date=February 2009|title=Can we win the war against light pollution|journal=[[Astronomy Magazine]]|page=57|issn=0091-6358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full cutoff fixture, when correctly installed, reduces the chance for light to escape above the plane of the horizontal. Light released above the horizontal may sometimes be lighting an intended target, but often serves no purpose. When it enters into the atmosphere, light contributes to sky glow. Some governments and organizations are now considering, or have already implemented, full cutoff fixtures in street lamps and stadium lighting.

The use of full cutoff fixtures help to reduce sky glow by preventing light from escaping above the horizontal. Full cutoff typically reduces the visibility of the lamp and reflector within a luminaire, so the effects of glare are also reduced. Campaigners also commonly argue that full cutoff fixtures are more efficient than other fixtures, since light that would otherwise have escaped into the atmosphere may instead be directed towards the ground. However, full cutoff fixtures may also trap more light in the fixture than other types of luminaires, corresponding to lower luminaire efficiency, suggesting a re-design of some luminaires may be necessary.

The use of full cutoff fixtures can allow for lower wattage lamps to be used in the fixtures, producing the same or sometimes a better effect, due to being more carefully controlled. In every lighting system, some sky glow also results from light reflected from the ground. This reflection can be reduced, however, by being careful to use only the lowest wattage necessary for the lamp, and setting spacing between lights appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpi.edu/dept/lrc/nystreet/ NYSERDA How-to Guide to Effective Energy-Efficient Street Lighting for Planners and Engineers.] NYSERDA-Planners (October 2002). New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuring luminaire setback is greater than 90° from highly reflective surfaces also diminishes reflectance.

A common criticism of full cutoff lighting fixtures is that they are sometimes not as aesthetically pleasing to look at. This is most likely because historically there has not been a large market specifically for full cutoff fixtures, and because people typically like to see the source of illumination. Due to the specificity with their direction of light, full cutoff fixtures sometimes also require expertise to install for maximum effect.

The effectiveness of using full cutoff roadway lights to combat light pollution has also been called into question. According to design investigations, luminaires with full cutoff distributions (as opposed to ''cutoff'' or ''semi cutoff'', compared here&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eskimo.com/~jrterry/optics.html |title=Optics for Streetlights |publisher=Eskimo.com |accessdate=2010-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915083231/http://www.eskimo.com/~jrterry/optics.html |archivedate=2010-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have to be closer together to meet the same light level, uniformity and glare requirements specified by the [[Illuminating Engineering Society of North America|IESNA]]. These simulations optimized the height and spacing of the lights while constraining the overall design to meet the IESNA requirements, and then compared total uplight and energy consumption of different luminaire designs and powers. Cutoff designs performed better than full cutoff designs, and semi-cutoff performed better than either cutoff or full cutoff. This indicates that, in roadway installations, over-illumination or poor uniformity produced by full cutoff fixtures may be more detrimental than direct uplight created by fewer cutoff or semi-cutoff fixtures. Therefore, the overall performance of existing systems could be improved more by reducing the number of luminaires than by switching to full cutoff designs.

[[File:110101 LightPollution Italian Regional bills specs.jpg|thumb|The majority of Italian regions require "zero upward light", which usually implies use of overall full cut-off lamps for new luminaires, but violations are common.]]

However, using the definition of "light pollution" from some Italian regional bills (i.e., "every irradiance of artificial light outside competence areas and particularly upward the sky") only full cutoff design prevents light pollution. The Italian [[Lombardy]] region, where only full cutoff design is allowed (Lombardy act no. 17/2000, promoted by [[CieloBuio|Cielobuio-coordination for the protection of the night sky]]), in 2007 had the lowest per capita energy consumption for public lighting in Italy. The same legislation also imposes a minimum distance between street lamps of about four times their height, so full cut off street lamps are the best solution to reduce both light pollution and electrical power usage.

===Adjusting types of light sources===
Several different types of light sources exist, each having different properties that affect their appropriateness for certain tasks, particularly efficiency and spectral power distribution. It is often the case that inappropriate light sources have been selected for a task, either due to ignorance or because more sophisticated light sources were unavailable at the time of installation. Therefore, badly chosen light sources often contribute unnecessarily to light pollution and energy waste. By re-assessing and changing the light sources used, it is often possible to reduce energy use and pollutive effects while simultaneously greatly improving efficiency and visibility.

Some types of light sources are listed in order of energy efficiency in the table below (figures are approximate maintained values), and include relative visual skyglow impacts.&lt;ref name=luginbuhl2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luginbuhl|first1=C.|title=The impact of light source spectral power distribution on sky glow|journal=Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer|date=2014|volume=139|pages=21–26|doi=10.1016/j.jqsrt.2013.12.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407313004792|bibcode = 2014JQSRT.139...21L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aube2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aubé|first1=M.|last2=Roby|first2=J.|last3=Kocifaj|first3=M.|title=Evaluating Potential Spectral Impacts of Various Artificial Lights on Melatonin Suppression, Photosynthesis, and Star Visibility|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0067798|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067798|pmid=23861808|pmc=3702543|volume=8|pages=e67798|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...867798A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many astronomers request that nearby communities use low pressure sodium lights or amber [[Aluminium gallium indium phosphide]] LED as much as possible, because the principal wavelength emitted is comparably easy to work around or in rare cases filter out.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference

In 1980, for example, [[San Jose, California]], replaced all street lamps with [[low pressure sodium lamp]]s, whose light is easier for nearby [[Lick Observatory]] to filter out. Similar programs are now in place in [[Arizona]] and [[Hawaii]]. Such yellow light sources also have significantly less visual [[skyglow]] impact,&lt;ref name=fdsc-lslp&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition|title=Lamp Spectrum and Light Pollution|url=http://www.flagstaffdarkskies.org/for-wonks/lamp-spectrum-light-pollution/|website=Lamp Spectrum and Light Pollution|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; so reduce visual sky brightness and improve star visibility for everyone.

Disadvantages of low pressure sodium lighting are that fixtures must usually be larger than competing fixtures, and that color cannot be distinguished, due to its emitting principally a single wavelength of light (see [[security lighting]]). Due to the substantial size of the lamp, particularly in higher wattages such as 135 W and 180 W, control of light emissions from low pressure sodium luminaires is more difficult. For applications requiring more precise direction of light (such as narrow roadways) the native lamp efficacy advantage of this lamp type is decreased and may be entirely lost compared to [[sodium vapor lamp|high pressure sodium lamps]]. Allegations that this also leads to higher amounts of light pollution from luminaires running these lamps arise principally because of older luminaires with poor shielding, still widely in use in the UK and in some other locations. Modern low-pressure sodium fixtures with better optics and full shielding, and the decreased [[skyglow]] impacts of yellow light preserve the luminous efficacy advantage of low-pressure sodium and result in most cases is less energy consumption and less visible light pollution. Unfortunately, due to continued lack of accurate information,&lt;ref&gt;Section ''4.10 What Types of Lamps Are Used in Outdoor Lighting?'' in [http://www.nofs.navy.mil/about_NOFS/darksky/OLCHB1.14/lc-hb-v1-14.html ''Outdoor Lighting Code Handbook''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161212231714/http://www.nofs.navy.mil/about_NOFS/darksky/OLCHB1.14/lc-hb-v1-14.html |date=2016-12-12 }}. International Dark-Sky Association (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; many lighting professionals continue to disparage low-pressure sodium, contributing to its decreased acceptance and specification in lighting standards and therefore its use. Another disadvantage of low-pressure sodium lamps is that some people find the characteristic yellow light very displeasing aesthetically.{{Citation needed|reason=This often-repeated claim needs documentation|date=February 2017}}

Because of the increased sensitivity of the human eye to blue and green wavelengths when viewing low-luminances (the [[Purkinje effect]]) in the night sky, different sources produce dramatically different amounts of visible [[skyglow]] from the same amount of light sent into the atmosphere.

===Re-designing lighting plans===
In some cases, evaluation of existing plans has determined that more efficient lighting plans are possible. For instance, light pollution can be reduced by turning off unneeded outdoor lights, and only lighting stadiums when there are people inside. Timers are especially valuable for this purpose. One of the world's first coordinated ''legislative'' efforts to reduce the adverse effect of this pollution on the environment began in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], in the U.S.  There, over three decades of ordinance development has taken place, with the full support of the population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flagstaffdarkskies.org Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition].

Lowell.edu. Retrieved 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station]]. Each component helps to educate, protect and enforce the imperatives to intelligently reduce detrimental light pollution.

One example of a lighting plan assessment can be seen in a report originally commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in the [[United Kingdom]], and now available through the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towards good practice|work=Lighting in the countryside|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/lighting|accessdate = 2008-01-16| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080108232309/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/lighting| archivedate = January 8, 2008}} [[Department for Communities and Local Government]], United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; The report details a plan to be implemented throughout the UK, for designing lighting schemes in the countryside, with a particular focus on preserving the environment.

In another example, the city of [[Calgary]] has recently replaced most residential street lights with models that are comparably energy efficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calgary.ca/Transportation/Roads/Pages/Traffic/Traffic-signals-and-streetlights/Envirosmart-streetlight-retrofit/EnviroSmart-streetlight-retrofit.aspx The City of Calgary: Envirosmart Streetlight Retrofit Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502014929/http://www.calgary.ca/Transportation/Roads/Pages/Traffic/Traffic-signals-and-streetlights/Envirosmart-streetlight-retrofit/EnviroSmart-streetlight-retrofit.aspx |date=2012-05-02 }}. calgary.ca&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation is primarily operation cost and environmental conservation. The costs of installation are expected to be regained through energy savings within six to seven years.

The Swiss Agency for Energy Efficiency (SAFE) uses a concept that promises to be of great use in the diagnosis and design of road lighting, "''consommation électrique spécifique'' (''CES'')", which can be translated into English as "specific electric power consumption (SEC)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efficace.ch/f/IndexAktuell.html |title=S.A.F.E &gt; Actualité |publisher=Efficace.ch |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, based on observed lighting levels in a wide range of Swiss towns, SAFE has defined target values for electric power consumption per metre for roads of various categories. Thus, SAFE currently recommends an SEC of 2 to 3 watts per meter for roads of less than 10 metre width (4 to 6 watts per metre for wider roads). Such a measure provides an easily applicable environmental protection constraint on conventional "norms", which usually are based on the recommendations of lighting manufacturing interests, who may not take into account environmental criteria. In view of ongoing progress in lighting technology, target SEC values will need to be periodically revised downwards.

[[File:110213 LED vs Sodium vs Mercury.jpg|thumb|Crossroad in Alessandria, Italy: luminaires with mercury lamps are in the background, LED street lights in the middle, luminaires with high pressure sodium lamps are in the foreground.]]

A newer method for predicting and measuring various aspects of light pollution was described in the journal Lighting Research Technology (September 2008). Scientists at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]'s Lighting Research Center have developed a comprehensive method called Outdoor Site-Lighting Performance (OSP), which allows users to quantify, and thus optimize, the performance of existing and planned lighting designs and applications to minimize excessive or obtrusive light leaving the boundaries of a property. OSP can be used by lighting engineers immediately, particularly for the investigation of glow and trespass (glare analyses are more complex to perform and current commercial software does not readily allow them), and can help users compare several lighting design alternatives for the same site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/544092/ Lighting Research Center Develops Framework for Assessing Light Pollution] Newswise. Retrieved 2008-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the effort to reduce light pollution, researchers have developed a "Unified System of Photometry," which is a way to measure how much or what kind of [[street light]]ing is needed. The Unified System of Photometry allows light fixtures to be designed to reduce energy use while maintaining or improving perceptions of visibility, safety, and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1191/1365782804li114oa |author=Rea, M. |author2=J.D.

Using this new system of photometry, results from recent studies have indicated that replacing traditional, yellowish, [[High pressure sodium|high-pressure sodium]] (HPS) lights with "cool" white light sources, such as induction, [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]], [[Ceramic discharge metal halide lamp|ceramic metal halide]], or [[LED]]s can actually reduce the amount of electric power used for lighting while maintaining or improving visibility in nighttime conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rea|first1=M.|last2=Yuan|first2=Z.|last3=Bierman|first3=A.|title=The unified system of photometry applied to remote airfield lighting|journal=Lighting Research and Technology|volume=41|pages=51–70|date=2009|doi=10.1177/1477153508095735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Commission on Illumination]], also known as the CIE from its French title, la Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage, will soon be releasing its own form of unified photometry for outdoor lighting.

A '''low-carbon economy''' ('''LCE'''), '''low-fossil-fuel economy''' ('''LFFE'''),&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://nanoparis.blogspot.com/2006/03/dye-sensitized-solar-cells.html Nanomech in Photovoltaics: Dye Sensitized Solar Cells&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''decarbonised economy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/news/Decarbonised-Economy1/|title=Decarbonised Economy|work=Greenpeace India|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[economy]] based on [[low carbon power]] sources that therefore has a minimal output of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions into the [[biosphere]], but specifically refers to the greenhouse gas [[carbon dioxide]]. GHG emissions due to anthropogenic (human) activity are the dominant cause of observed [[global warming]] ([[climate change]]) since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf |title= IPCC, 2014: Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report.

Meyer (eds.)|publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shifting to low-carbon economy on a global scale could bring substantial benefits both for developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Koh, Jae Myong (2018). ''Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects''. London: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-3-319-71769-2}}. &lt;/ref&gt; Many countries around the world are designing and implementing low emission development strategies (LEDS). These strategies seek to achieve social, economic and environmental development goals while reducing long-term greenhouse gas emissions and increasing resilience to climate change impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CDKN_LEDS_global_factsheet.pdf|title=LEDS GP factsheet|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally implemented low-carbon economies are therefore proposed by those having drawn this conclusion, as a means to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid catastrophic climate change]], and as a precursor to the more advanced, zero-carbon economy.

==Rationale and aims==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
Nations may seek to become low-carbon or decarbonised economies as a part of a national [[climate change mitigation]] strategy.  A comprehensive strategy to mitigate [[climate change]] is through [[carbon neutrality]].

The aim of a LCE is to integrate all aspects of itself from its manufacturing, agriculture, transportation, and power-generation, etc. around technologies that produce energy and materials with little GHG emission, and, thus, around populations, buildings, machines, and devices that use those energies and materials efficiently, and, dispose of or recycle its wastes so as to have a minimal output of GHGs. Furthermore, it has been proposed that to make the transition to an LCE economically viable we would have to attribute a cost (per unit output) to GHGs through means such as [[emissions trading]] and/or a [[carbon tax]].

Some nations are presently low carbon: societies that are not heavily industrialised or populated. In order to avoid climate change on a global level, all nations considered [[carbon intensity|carbon intensive]] societies, and societies that are heavily populated might have to become zero-carbon societies and economies. Several of these countries{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} have pledged to cut their emissions by 100% via [[Carbon offset|offset]]ting emissions rather than ceasing all emissions ([[carbon neutrality]]); in other words, emitting will not cease but will continue and will be ''offset'' to a different geographical area. EU emission trading system allows companies to buy international carbon credits, thus the companies can channel clean technologies to promote other countries to adopt low-carbon developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The EU Emission Trading System(EU ETS) Factsheet |url=http://ec.europa.eu/clima/publications/docs/factsheet_ets_en.pdf |website=European Commission |publisher=European Union |accessdate=27 Oct 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715223057/http://ec.europa.eu/clima/publications/docs/factsheet_ets_en.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of low-carbon economies===
Low-carbon economies present multiple benefits to ecosystem resilience, trade, employment, health, energy security, and industrial competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/2016/06/presenting-co-benefits-of-leds/?loclang=en_gb|title=Presenting the benefits of low emission development strategies|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benefits to ecosystem resilience====
Low emission development strategies for the land use sector can prioritize the protection of carbon rich ecosystems to not only reduce emissions, but also to protect [[biodiversity]] and safeguard local livelihoods to reduce rural poverty - all of which can lead to more climate resilient systems, according to a report by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]. [[REDD+]] and blue carbon initiatives are among the measures available to conserve, sustainably manage, and restore these carbon rich ecosystems, which are crucial for natural carbon storage and sequestration, and for building climate resilient communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-boost-ecosystem-resilience/?loclang=en_gb|title=Boost ecosystem resilience to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Job creation====
Transitioning to a low-carbon, environmentally and socially sustainable economies can become a strong driver of job creation, job upgrading, social justice, and poverty eradication if properly managed with the full engagement of governments, workers, and employers’ organizations.&lt;ref name="ledsgp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-green-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=Create green jobs to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates from the [[International Labour Organization]]’s Global Economic Linkages model suggest that unmitigated climate change, with associated negative impacts on enterprises and workers, will have negative effects on output in many industries, with drops in output of 2.4% by 2030 and 7.2% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/docs/WCMS_192582/lang--en/index.htm|title=Global Economic Linkages Model|publisher=[[International Labour Organization]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transitioning to a low-carbon economy will cause shifts in the volume, composition, and quality of employment across sectors and will affect the level and distribution of income. Research indicates that eight sectors employing around 1.5 billion workers, approximately half the global workforce, will undergo major changes: agriculture, forestry, fishing, energy, resource intensive manufacturing, recycling, buildings, and transport.&lt;ref name="ledsgp.org"/&gt;

====Business competitiveness====
Low emission industrial development and [[resource efficiency]] can offer many opportunities to increase the competitiveness of economies and companies. According to the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], there is often a clear business case for switching to lower emission technologies, with payback periods ranging largely from 0.5–5 years, leveraging financial investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-gain-competitive-edge/?loclang=en_gb|title=Gain the competitive edge to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Improved trade policy====
Trade and trade policies can contribute to low-carbon economies by enabling more efficient use of resources and international exchange of climate friendly goods and services. Removing tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade in [[clean energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] technologies is one such measure. In a sector where finished products consist of many components that cross borders numerous times - a typical [[wind turbine]], for example, contains up to 8,000 components - even small tariff cuts would reduce costs. This would make the technologies more affordable and competitive in the global market, particularly when combined with a phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-use-trade-policy/?loclang=en_gb|title=Use trade policy to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy policy===

====Renewable energy and energy efficiency====
{{See also|Renewable energy commercialization}}
[[Image:Total Installed Wind Capacity 1997-2020-MW.jpg|thumb|Worldwide installed wind power capacity 1997–2020 [MW], history and predictions. Data source: [http://www.wwindea.org/ WWEA]]]

Recent advances in technology and policy will allow [[renewable energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] to play major roles in displacing fossil fuels, meeting global energy demand while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Renewable energy technologies are being rapidly commercialized and, in conjunction with efficiency gains, can achieve far greater emissions reductions than either could independently.&lt;ref name=wwinst2009&gt;Janet L. Sawin and William R. Moomaw. [http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Renewable%20Revolution.pdf Renewable Revolution:Low-Carbon Energy by 2030] Worldwatch Report, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy is [[energy]] that comes from [[natural resource]]s such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal energy|tides]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]], which are [[Renewable resource|renewable]] (naturally replenished). In 2008, about 19% of global final energy consumption came from renewables.&lt;ref name=r2010&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=August 20, 2010 }} p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; During the five years from the end of 2004 through 2009, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies. For wind power and many other renewable technologies, growth accelerated in 2009 relative to the previous four years.&lt;ref name=ren15/&gt; More wind power capacity was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology. However, grid-connected [[photovoltaics]] increased the fastest of all renewables technologies, with a 60 percent annual average growth rate for the five-year period.&lt;ref name=ren15&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=August 20, 2010 }} p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy for power, heat, cooling, and mobility is the key ingredient for development and growth, with energy security a prerequisite economic growth, making it arguably the most important driver for energy policy. Scaling up renewable energy as part of a low emission development strategy can diversify a country's energy mixes and reduces dependence on imports. It can also lower geopolitical risks and exposure to fuel price volatility, and improve the balance of trade for importing countries (noting that only a handful of countries export oil and gas). Renewable energy offers lower financial and economic risk for businesses through a more stable and predictable cost base for energy supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-ensure-energy-security/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Ensure energy security to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficiency gains in recent decades have been significant, but there is still much more that can be achieved. With a concerted effort and strong policies in place, future energy efficiency improvements are likely to be very large. Heat is one of many forms of "energy wastage" that could be captured to significantly increase useful energy without burning more fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=wwinst2009/&gt;

====Sustainable biofuels====
{{Main|Sustainable biofuel}}
[[Biofuels]], in the form of [[liquid fuels]] derived from plant materials, are entering the market, driven by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]] and the need for increased [[energy security]]. However, many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the [[natural environment]], [[food security]], and [[land use]].&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sol/&gt;

The challenge is to support biofuel development, including the development of new [[Cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic technologies]], with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is [[sustainable]]. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;[[The Royal Society]] (January 2008). ''Sustainable biofuels: prospects and challenges'',  {{ISBN|978-0-85403-662-2}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sol&gt;Gordon Quaiattini. [http://www.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=e08c8e19-4a95-491c-9386-d30afeab5cdf&amp;sponsor= Biofuels are part of the solution]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Canada.com'', April 25, 2008. Retrieved December 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPFL Energy Center (c2007). ''[http://www.webcitation.org/5luiZYDX8?url=http://www.its.berkeley.edu/sustainabilitycenter/RSB_Intro.pdf Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels]'' Retrieved December 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of [[alternative energy]] sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on [[fossil fuel]]s, especially in the transport sector.&lt;ref name=sol/&gt; Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a [[sustainable transport]] strategy.

====Nuclear power====
[[Nuclear power]] has been offered as the primary means to achieve a LCE. In terms of large [[industrialized]] nations, mainland France, due primarily to [[nuclear power in France|75% of its electricity being produced by nuclear power]], has the [[List of countries by ratio of GDP to carbon dioxide emissions|lowest carbon dioxide production]] per unit of [[GDP]] in the world and it is the [[List of countries by electricity exports|largest exporter of electricity in the world]], earning it approximately €3 billion annually in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessandfinance.ie/index.jsp?p=164&amp;n=397&amp;a=1565|title=Privacy policy|work=Business &amp; Finance|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302010428/http://www.businessandfinance.ie/index.jsp?p=164&amp;n=397&amp;a=1565|archivedate=2 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern is often expressed with the matter of spent nuclear fuel storage and security; although the physical issues are not large, the political difficulties are significant. The [[liquid fluoride thorium reactor]] (LFTR) has been suggested as a solution to the concerns posed by conventional nuclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = N. | last2 = Minakata | first2 = D. | last3 = Begovic | first3 = M. | last4 = Crittenden | first4 = J. | title = Should We Consider Using Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors for Power Generation? | doi = 10.1021/es2021318 | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 45 | issue = 15 | pages = 6237 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2011EnST...45.6237C }} "LFTR can mean a 1000+ year solution or a quality low-carbon bridge to truly [[sustainable energy]] sources solving a huge portion of mankind’s negative [[environmental impact]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

France reprocesses their spent nuclear fuel at the [[La Hague site]] since 1976 and has also treated spent nuclear fuel from France, Japan, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.

====Smart grid====
One proposal from Karlsruhe University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR8gEMpzos4|title=Fully renewable: biogas + wind + solar|date=29 December 2007|work=YouTube|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kombikraftwerk.de/index.php?id=27 Combined Power Plant&lt;/ref&gt; developed as a virtual power station is the use of solar and wind energy for base load with hydro and biogas for make up or peak load. Hydro and biogas are used as [[grid energy storage]]. This requires the development of a smart intelligent grid hopefully including local power networks than use energy near the site of production, thereby reducing the existing 5% grid loss.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&amp;t=3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon-neutral hydrocarbons===
{{main|Carbon-neutral fuel}}

====Methane cycle====
A further development of this is the use of the carbon capture, hydrogen and its conversion into methane (SNG synthetic natural gas) to act as a storage for intermittent renewables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-kassel.de/upress/online/frei/978-3-89958-798-2.volltext.frei.pdf Bioenergy and renewable power methane in integrated 100% renewable energy system]&lt;/ref&gt;

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Sabatier reaction

This involves the use of the existing natural gas (methane) grid as the store. In this case, the carbon dioxide is given economic value as a component of energy carrier. This "solar fuel"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solar-fuel.net/en/the-challenge|title=Solar Fuel|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; cycle uses the excess electrical renewable energy that cannot be used instantaneously in the grid, which otherwise would be wasted to create hydrogen via electrolysis of water. The hydrogen is then combined with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to create synthetic or substitute natural gas SNG and stored in the natural gas network. The natural gas is used to create electrical energy (and the heat used as well in CHP) on demand when there is not enough sun (photovoltaic, CSP...) or wind (turbines) or water (hydro, ocean current, waves,...).  The German natural gas grid, for example, has two months of storage, more than enough to outlast renewable energy low production points.

====Ocean derived hydrocarbon fuels====
The concentration of [[Ocean acidification|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the upper layer of the world's oceans]] is higher than is found in air, and thus it is the most concentrated "[[mining|mine]]" from which zero-net carbon fuels can be produced. The U.S. Navy estimates that a typical nuclear propelled aircraft carrier [[A4W reactor|which generates 100 megawatts]] of electricity can produce 41,000 [[US gallon]]s(155,202 [[litre]]s) of [[jet fuel]] per day and production from the onboard nuclear reactor would cost about $6 per gallon($1.58 per liter). While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010, it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue. Moreover, since the delivery of fuel to a [[carrier battle group]] costs about $8 per gallon, shipboard production is already much less expensive.&lt;ref name="jetsea"&gt;{{Cite report |last=Willauer |first=Heather D. |last2=Hardy |first2=Dennis R. |last3=Williams |first3=Frederick W. |date=September 29, 2010 |title=''Feasibility and Current Estimated Capital Costs of Producing Jet Fuel at Sea'' |publisher=Chemistry Division, Navy Technology Center for Safety and Survivability, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory |location=Washington, DC |type=memorandum report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA539765 |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heather Willauer]] of the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] proof-tested the technology in 2013, fueling an internal combustion engine equipped [[model airplane]] with the [[synthetic fuel]].&lt;ref name=Parry2014&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2014/scale-model-wwii-craft-takes-flight-with-fuel-from-the-sea-concept |title=Scale Model WWII Craft Takes Flight With Fuel From the Sea Concept |last=Parry |first=Daniel |date=April 7, 2014 |work=Naval Research Laboratory News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carbon capture and storage ====
The proposed strategy of [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) - continued use of non-renewable fossil fuels but without allowing carbon dioxide to reach the atmosphere - has also been considered as a means to achieve a LCE, either in a primary or supporting role. Major concerns include the uncertainty of costs and time needed to successfully implement CCS worldwide and with guarantees that stored emissions will not leak into the [[biosphere]].

====Combined heat and power====

[[Cogeneration|Combined Heat and Power]] (CHP) is a technology which by allowing the more efficient use of fuel will at least reduce carbon emissions; should the fuel be [[biomass]] or [[biogas]] or hydrogen used as an energy store then in principle it can be a zero carbon option. CHP can also be used with a nuclear reactor as the energy source; there are examples of such installations in the far North of the Russian Federation.

==Primary sector==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Low carbon diet}}

Most of the agricultural facilities in the developed world are mechanized due to rural electrification.  Rural electrification has produced significant productivity gains, but it also uses a lot of energy.  For this and other reasons (such as transport costs) in a low-carbon society, rural areas would need available supplies of renewably produced electricity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Irrigation can be one of the main components of an agricultural facility's energy consumption.  In parts of California, it can be up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fypower.org/agri/|title=Thank You|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the low carbon economy, irrigation equipment will be maintained and continuously updated and farms will use less irrigation water.

====Crops====
Different crops require different amounts of energy input.  For example, glasshouse crops, irrigated crops, and orchards require a lot of energy to maintain, while row crops and field crops do not need as much maintenance.  Those glasshouse and irrigated crops that do exist will incorporate the following improvements:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;New Zealand Energy Intensive Business Initiative, {{cite web |url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/energy-pilot-scheme.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232041/http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/energy-pilot-scheme.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glasshouse crops
*environmental control systems
*heat recovery using condensers
*heat storage using buffer tanks
*heat retention using thermal screens
*alternative fuels (e.g., waste wood and trees)
*cogeneration (heat and power)
Irrigated arable crops
*soil moisture measurement to regulate irrigation
*variable-speed drives on pumps

====Livestock====
Livestock operations can also use a lot of energy depending on how they are run.  Feed lots use animal feed made from corn, soybeans, and other crops.  Energy must be expended to produce these crops, process, and transport them.  Free-range animals find their own vegetation to feed on.  The farmer may expend energy to take care of that vegetation, but not nearly as much as the farmer growing cereal and oil-seed crops.

Many livestock operations currently use a lot of energy to water their livestock.  In the low-carbon economy, such operations will use more water conservation methods such as rainwater collection, water cisterns, etc., and they will also pump/distribute that water with on-site renewable energy sources (most likely wind and solar).

Due to rural electrification, most agricultural facilities in the developed world use a lot of electricity.  In a low-carbon economy, farms will be run and equipped to allow for greater energy efficiency.  The dairy industry, for example, will incorporate the following changes:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Irrigated Dairy
*heat recovery on milk vats
*variable speed drives on motors/pumps
*heat recovery from hot water wash
*soil moisture measurement to regulate irrigation
*biodigester with cogen (heat &amp; power)
*vat wrap
*solar water heating
*ripple control
*ice bank
*chemical substitute for hot-water wash

===Hunting and fishing===
Fishing is quite energy intensive.  Improvements such as heat recovery on refrigeration and trawl net technology will be common in the low-carbon economy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}

===Forestry===
{{Main|Wood economy}}
Protecting forests provides integrated benefits to all, ranging from increased food production, safeguarded local livelihoods, protected [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystems]] provided by forests, and reduced rural poverty. Adopting low emission strategies for both agricultural and forest production also mitigates some of the effects of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CDKN_LEDS_Forestry_WG_factsheet.pdf|title=LEDS GP Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use Working Group factsheet|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the low-carbon economy, forestry operations will be focused on low-impact practices and regrowth.  Forest managers will make sure that they do not disturb soil-based carbon reserves too much.  Specialized tree farms  will be the main source of material for many products.  Quick maturing tree varieties will be grown on short rotations in order to maximize output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm Trees and their role in carbon management for land and business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190041/http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, The Woodland Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
{{Main|Gas flare}}
Flaring and venting of [[natural gas]] in oil wells is a significant source of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Its contribution to greenhouse gases has declined by three-quarters in absolute terms since a peak in the 1970s of approximately 110 million metric tons/year, and in 2004 accounted for about 1/2 of one percent of all [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/trends/emis/tre_glob.htm Global, Regional, and National CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Emissions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711043835/http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/trends/emis/tre_glob.htm |date=2007-07-11 }}. In ''Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change'', Marland, G., T.A. Boden, and R. J. Andres, 2005, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] estimates that 134 billion cubic meters of natural gas are flared or vented annually (2010 datum), an amount equivalent to the combined annual gas consumption of [[Germany]] and [[France]] or enough to supply the entire world with gas for 16 days.
This flaring is highly concentrated: 10 countries account for 70% of emissions, and twenty for 85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/gasflaringreduction |title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=worldbank.org |publisher=The [[World Bank]] |access-date=August 24, 2016 |quote=previous redirect from web.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top-ten leading contributors to world gas flaring in 2010, were (in declining order): [[Russia]] (26%), [[Nigeria]] (11%), [[Iran]] (8%), [[Iraq]] (7%), [[Algeria]] (4%), [[Angola]] (3%), [[Kazakhstan]] (3%), [[Libya]] (3%), [[Saudi Arabia]] (3%), and [[Venezuela]] (2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTOGMC/EXTGGFR/0,,contentMDK:22137498~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:578069,00.html|title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction - Estimated Flared Volumes from Satellite Data, 2007-2011|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tertiary sector==

===Retail===
Retail operations in the low-carbon economy will have several new features.  One will be high-efficiency lighting such as compact fluorescent, halogen, and eventually LED light sources.  Many retail stores will also feature roof-top solar panel arrays.  These make sense because solar panels produce the most energy during the daytime and during the summer.  These are the same times that electricity is the most expensive and also the same times that stores use the most electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=35633 Grocery Store Sets California Solar Standard], Renewable Energy World, 22 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation services===
Sustainable, low-carbon transport systems are based on minimizing travel and shifting to more environmentally (as well as socially and economically) sustainable mobility, improving transport technologies, fuels and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CDKN_LEDS_transport_WG_factsheet.pdf|title=LEDS GP Transport Working Group factsheet|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decarbonisation of (urban) mobility by means of:
* More energy efficiency and alternative propulsion:
** Increased focus on fuel efficient vehicle shapes and configurations, with more [[vehicle electrification]], particularly through [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEV) or [[all-electric vehicle]]s
** More alternative and flex-fuel vehicles (based on local conditions and availability)
** Driver training for more fuel efficiency.
** Low-carbon [[biofuel]]s [[cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic]] ([[biodiesel]], [[bioethanol]], [[biobutanol]])
** Petroleum fuel [[fee|surcharge]]s will be a more significant part of consumer costs.
* Less international trade of physical objects, despite more overall trade (as measure by value of goods)
* Greater use of marine and [[electric rail transport]], less use of air and truck transport.
* Increased non-motorised transport (i.e. walking and cycling) and public transport usage, less reliance on private motor vehicles.
* More [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] capacity for common fluid commodities such as water, ethanol, butanol, natural gas, petroleum, and hydrogen (in addition to gasoline and diesel). See&lt;ref&gt;[[Energy Information Administration]] Industry Analysis Briefs, http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/mecs/iab/index5e.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carbon Trust, http://www.carbontrust.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10719.pdf BERR - Redirect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925194653/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10719.pdf |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable transport has many co-benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], low carbon transport can help create jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Create jobs|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-make-roads-safe/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Make roads safe|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people’s time and household income as well as government budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-save-time-money/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Save money and time|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.

===Health services===
There have been some moves to investigate the ways and extent to which health systems contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and how they may need to change to become part of a low-carbon world.  The Sustainable Development Unit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdu.nhs.uk/|title=Sustainable Development Unit|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the NHS in the UK is one of the first official bodies to have been set up in this area, whilst organisations such as the Campaign for Greener Healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenerhealthcare.org/|title=Munin :: overview|author=Auto-generated Munin|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also producing influential changes at a clinical level.   This work includes
* Quantification of where the health services emissions stem from.
* Information on the environmental impacts of alternative models of treatment and service provision
Some of the suggested changes needed are:
* Greater efficiency and lower ecological impact of energy, buildings, and procurement choices (e.g., in-patient meals, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment).
* A shift from focusing solely on cure to prevention, through the promotion of healthier, lower-carbon lifestyles, e.g. diets lower in red meat and dairy products, walking or cycling wherever possible, better town planning to encourage more outdoor lifestyles.
* Improving public transport and liftsharing options for transport to and from hospitals and clinics.

=== Tourism ===
Low-carbon tourism includes travels with low energy consumption, and low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and pollution emissions. Change of personal behavior to more low-carbon oriented activities is mostly influenced by both individual awareness and attitudes, as well as external social aspect, such as culture and environment. Studies indicate that educational level and occupation influence an individual perception of low-carbon tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Wenjie|last2=Zhang|first2=Xiaolei|last3=Yang|first3=Zhaoping|last4=Wall|first4=Geoffrey|last5=Wang|first5=Fang|date=2017-06-04|title=Creating a low carbon tourism community by public cognition, intention and behaviour change analysisa case study of a heritage site (Tianshan Tianchi, China)|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/geo-2017-0017/geo-2017-0017.xml?format=INT|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=197-210|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0017|issn=2391-5447|via=|bibcode=2017OGeo....9...17W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial steps==
A good overview of the history of international efforts towards a low-carbon economy, from its initial seed at the inaugural UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972, has been given by David Runnals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/1150 Runnals, D. (2011) “Environment and economy: joined at the hip or just strange bed-fellows?”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''4''' (1) ]&lt;/ref&gt;
On the international scene, the most prominent early step in the direction of a low-carbon economy was the signing of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which came into force on February 16, 2005, under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2050.nies.go.jp/|title=Low-Carbon Society Research Project|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Towards a low carbon economy | author = Margot Wallström | date = 11 March 2004 | location = Brussels | url = http://www.europaworld.org/week168/speechwalstrom12304.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080921222229/http://www.europaworld.org/week168/speechwalstrom12304.htm | archivedate = 21 September 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, all member nations of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] except the [[Energy policy of the United States|United States]] have ratified the protocol.
Europe is the leading geopolitical continent in defining and mobilising decarbonisation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/climate-change/decarbonisation-challenge-us-european-perspectives/article-162796|title=The decarbonisation challenge - US and European perspectives|work=EurActiv - EU News &amp; policy debates, across languages|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[International Association of Public Transport|UITP]] - an organisation advocating [[sustainable mobility]] and [[public transport]] - has an EU office, but less well developed contacts with, for example, the US. The European Union Committee of the [[International Association of Public Transport|UITP]] wants to promote decarbonisation of urban mobility in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uitp.org/news/pics/pdf/PR_Decarbonisation.pdf|title=News|work=UITP|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Europe is nowadays the leading geopolitical continent with regard to lowering emissions, Europe is quickly losing ground to Asia, with countries such as China and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e3g.org/programmes/europe-articles/financing-the-decarbonisation-of-european-infrastructure|title=E3G — Third Generation Environmentalism - Action on climate and energy|author=E3G, Third Generation Environmentalism|work=E3G - Third Generation Environmentalism|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730155101/http://www.e3g.org/programmes/europe-articles/financing-the-decarbonisation-of-european-infrastructure|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the 2014 ''Global Green Economy Index™ (GGEI)'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://dualcitizeninc.com/GGEI-Report2014.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ranks 60 nations on their green economic performance, finding that the Nordic countries and Switzerland have the best combined performance around climate change and green economy.

===Countries===

====Australia====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Australia}}
Australia has implemented schemes to start the transition to a low-carbon economy but [[carbon neutrality]] has not been mentioned and since the introduction of the schemes, emissions have increased. The [[Second Rudd Government]] pledged to lower emissions by 5-15%. In 2001, The Howard Government introduced a Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) scheme. In 2007, the Government revised the MRET - 20 percent of Australia's electricity supply to come from renewable energy sources by 2020. Renewable energy sources provide 8-10% of the nation's energy, and this figure will increase significantly in the coming years. However coal dependence and exporting conflicts with the concept of Australia as a low-carbon economy. Carbon-neutral businesses have received no incentive; they have voluntarily done so. Carbon-offset companies offer assessments based on lifecycle impacts to businesses that seek carbon neutrality. In Australia the only true certified carbon neutral scheme is the Australian government's National Carbon Offset Standard (NCOS) which includes a mandatory independent audit. Three of the four of Australia's top banks are now certified under this scheme and full list of compliant companies can be seen here http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/carbon-neutral/carbon-neutral-program/accredited-businesses#Certified_organisations . Businesses are now moving from unaccredited schemes such as noco2 and transitioning to NCOS as the only one that is externally audited. Most of leading carbon management companies have also aligned with NCOS such as Net Balance https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125415/http://www.netbalance.com/ , Pangolin Associates (who themselves are independently certified under NCOS) http://pangolinassociates.com/sustainability-services/ncos-carbon-neutrality/, Energetics http://energetics.com.au/home and the big four accounting firms.

In 2011 the Gillard Government introduced a price on carbon dioxide emissions for businesses. Although often characterised as a tax, it lacked the revenue-raising nature of a true tax. In 2013, on the election of the Abbott government, immediate legislative steps were taken to repeal the so-called carbon tax. The price on carbon was repealed on the 17th July 2014 by an act of parliament. As it stands Australia currently has no mechanism to deal with climate change.

====China====

====Iceland====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Iceland}}
Iceland began utilising renewable energy early in the 20th century and so since has been a low-carbon economy. However, since dramatic economic growth, Iceland's emissions have increased significantly per capita. As of 2009, Iceland energy is sourced from mostly [[geothermal energy]] and [[hydropower]], [[renewable energy in Iceland]] and, since 1999, has provided over 70% of the nation's [[primary energy]] and 99.9% of Iceland's [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statice.is/Uploads/files/LH06/L060701.xls |title=Gross energy consumption by source 1987–2005 |publisher=''[http://www.statice.is/?PageID=583 Statistics Iceland]'' |accessdate=2007-05-14 |format=XLS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125021947/http://www.statice.is/Uploads/files/LH06/L060701.xls |archivedate=2007-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, Iceland's carbon emissions per capita are 62% lower than those of the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Data.aspx |title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals Indicators |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2006-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite using more primary energy per capita,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.idnadarraduneyti.is/Publications/nr/1170 |title=Energy in Iceland |publisher=Icelandic Ministries of Industry and Commerce |accessdate=2007-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305070726/http://eng.idnadarraduneyti.is/Publications/nr/1170 |archive-date=2007-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the fact that it is renewable and low-cost. Iceland seeks [[carbon neutrality]] and expects to use 100% renewable energy by 2050 by generating [[hydrogen fuel]] from renewable energy sources.

====Peru====
The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) estimates that economic losses related to climate change for Peru could reach over 15% of national gross domestic product (GDP) by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economics of Climate Change in Peru|url=http://www.cepal.org/en/pressreleases/climate-change-peru-seen-affecting-fishing-high-andes-livestock-and-agricultural|website=Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a large country with a long coastline, snow-capped mountains and sizeable forests, Peru's varying ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Several mountain glaciers have already begun to retreat, leading to [[water scarcity]] in some areas. In the period between 1990 and 2015, Peru experienced a 99% increase in per capita carbon emissions from fossil fuel and cement production, marking one of the largest increases amongst South American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forging low emission development paths in Latin America and the Caribbean: Multi-level dynamics in the world’s most urbanized region |url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GIP01771-CDKN_LEDS_LAC_Urbanization_final_updated_5-6-17_proof.pdf|website=LEDS GP|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peru brought in a National Strategy on Climate Change in 2003. It is a detailed accounting of 11 strategic focuses that prioritize scientific research, mitigation of climate change effects on the poor, and creating Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) mitigation and adaptation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSE Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/legislation/countries/peru/|website=London School of Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Peruvian Ministry of Environment published a Plan of Action for Adaptation and Mitigation of Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action Plan for Adaptation and Mitigation Against Climate Change (Peru)|url=http://theredddesk.org/countries/plans/action-plan-adaptation-and-mitigation-against-climate-change-peru|website=The REDD Desk|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Plan categorises existing and future programmes into seven action groups, including: reporting mechanisms on GHG emissions, mitigation, adaptation, research and development of technology of systems, financing and management, and public education. It also contains detailed budget information and analysis relating to climate change.

In 2014, Peru hosted the Twentieth Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP20) negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Framework Convention on Climate Change COP20|url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/lima_dec_2014/meeting/8141.php|website=UNFCCC COP20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Peru enacted a new climate law which provides for the creation of a national greenhouse gas inventory system called INFOCARBONO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEDS GP Peru's National Climate Law|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CDKN_LEDS_PB_INFOCARBONO_FINAL_WEB.pdf|website=LEDS Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], INFOCARBONO is a major transformation of the country's greenhouse gas management system. Previously, the system was under the sole control of the Peruvian Ministry of the Environment. The new framework makes each relevant ministry responsible for their own share of greenhouse gas management.

====United Kingdom====
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Climate Change Act 2008]] outlining a framework for the transition to a low-carbon economy became law on November 26, 2008.  This legislation requires an 80% cut in the UK's [[carbon emissions]] by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), with an intermediate target of between 26% and 32% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070313a.htm|title=New Bill and strategy lay foundations for tackling climate change|publisher=[[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]|date=2007-03-13|accessdate=2007-03-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000610/http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070313a.htm |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the UK became the first country to set such a long-range and significant carbon reduction target into law.

A meeting at the [[Royal Society]] on 17–18 November 2008 concluded that an integrated approach, making best use of all available technologies, is required to move toward a low-carbon future. It was suggested by participants that it would be possible to move to a low-carbon economy within a few decades, but that 'urgent and sustained action is needed on several fronts'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/document.asp?tip=0&amp;id=8174 Towards a low carbon future], [[Royal Society]], 29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the UK [[coalition government]] announced the introduction of mandatory carbon reporting, requiring around 1,100 of the UK’s largest listed companies to report their [[greenhouse gas emissions]] every year. [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]] confirmed that emission reporting rules would come into effect from April 2013 in his piece for The Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/19/rio-earth-summit-development-deadlines|title=Rio's reprise must set hard deadlines for development|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2012-06-19|accessdate=2012-07-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120730141206/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/19/rio-earth-summit-development-deadlines |archivedate = July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the UK Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) came into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1643/contents/made |title=The Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme Regulations 2014 |publisher=UK Government |accessdate=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This requires all large businesses in the UK to undertake mandatory assessments looking at energy use and energy efficiency opportunities at least once every four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/esos |title=ESOS: Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme |publisher=The Carbon Trust |accessdate=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The low carbon economy has been described as a "UK success story", accounting for more than £120 billion in annual sales and employing almost 1 million people. A 2013 report suggests that over a third of the UK's economic growth in 2011/12 was likely to have come from green business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/technology/low-carbon-entrepreneurs |title=Low Carbon Entrepreneurs: the new engines of growth |date=May 2013 |publisher=The Carbon Trust |accessdate=25 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cities===
Companies are planning large scale developments without using fossil fuels. Development plans such as those by [[World Wide Assets LLC]] for entire cities using only [[geothermal energy]] for electricity, [[geothermal desalination]], and employing full recycling systems for water and waste are under development (2006) in Mexico and Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73586">'''Mormon studies''' is the [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[list of academic disciplines|academic]] study of the [[beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|beliefs, practices]], [[Latter Day Saint movement#History|history]] and [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|culture]] of those known by the term ''[[Mormon]]'' and [[list of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|denominations]] belonging to the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] whose members do not generally go by the term "Mormon". The Latter Day Saint movement includes not only [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) but also the [[Community of Christ]] (CoC) and other groups, as well as those falling under the umbrella of [[Mormon fundamentalism]].

Before 1903, writings about Mormons were mostly orthodox documentary histories or [[Anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] material. The first dissertations on Mormons, published in the 1900s, had a naturalistic style that approached [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement|Mormon history]] from economic, psychological, and philosophical theories. While their position within Mormon studies is debated, Mormon [[apologetics]] have a tradition dating back to [[Parley P. Pratt]]'s response to an anti-Mormon book in 1838.

The amount of scholarship in Mormon studies increased after World War II. From 1972–1982, while [[Leonard J. Arrington|Leonard Arrington]] was a [[Church Historian and Recorder|Church Historian]] in the history department, the [[Church History Library|LDS Church Archives]] were open to Mormon and non-Mormon researchers. Researchers wrote detached accounts for Mormon intellectuals in the "New Mormon history" style. Many new publications started to publish history in this style, including [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'']], ''[[BYU Studies Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Woman's Exponent|Exponent II]]''. Some [[General authority|general authorities]] in the church did not like the New Mormon history style, and Arrington and his remaining staff were transferred to [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) in 1982, where they worked in the [[Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History]]. The institute continued to support scholarship in Mormon history until 2005, when the institute closed and employees transferred to the LDS Church Office Building. In the late 1980s and 1990s, several other incidents made BYU faculty reluctant to voice unorthodox ideas about church history. Around 1990, BYU professors were asked not to contribute to ''Dialogue'' or ''[[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]''. Two historians were [[Excommunication#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|excommunicated]] in 1993, probably for their published unorthodox views. ''BYU Studies'' and other LDS church-sponsored publishers published more "faithful" scholarship at this time. Presses outside of Utah started to publish more books in Mormon studies. 

Mormon scholars engaging in Mormon studies still feel they must be careful about what they write, especially if they work with material from the Church History Library archives. Non-Mormon scholars are often suspicious of Mormon scholars' work. This is gradually changing as Mormon scholars find employment outside of church-sponsored institutions. Universities without affiliation to the LDS Church have endowed chairs for Mormon studies. Emerging trends in "Newer" Mormon History are an increase in interdisciplinary work and women's history. The LDS Church History Department hired a women's history specialist in 2011 and has recently published books focusing on women's history. Blogs focusing on Mormon history have helped make Mormon history more accessible and provided a safe space for unorthodox ideas, although they may be superficial at times. 

==Pre-1903 writings about Mormons==
Before World War II, church histories were mostly either orthodox Mormon or anti-Mormon and written by faithful Mormons or hostile non-Mormons, respectively.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=504}} A few writers in the first era of church history (1830–1905) wrote about Mormons as a curiosity and focused on their peculiar ways.{{sfn|Arrington|1966|p=16}}

===Anti-Mormon literature===
Non-Mormons wrote for a non-Mormon public about how "primitive and dangerous" Mormons were in "extreme terms."{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|pp=199–200}}  [[Eber D. Howe]] published ''[[Mormonism Unvailed|Mormonism Unvailed, or a Faithful Account of that Singular Imposition and Delusion]]'' in 1834, which claimed that [[Sidney Rigdon]] was the original author of the [[Book of Mormon]] and that [[Joseph Smith]] was a "vile wretch." Howe included affidavits from people who knew Joseph Smith collected by ex-Mormon [[Doctor Philastus Hurlbut|Philastus Hurlbut]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=53–54}} The book influenced future anti-Mormon literature. (by La Roy Sunderland, [[John C. Bennett|John Bennett]], and John A. Clark).{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=55}} Origen Bacheler examined the Book of Mormon itself in ''Mormonism Exposed Internally and Externally'', arguing that the book was inconsistent with the Bible and was written by Joseph Smith himself.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=56–57}}

In the 1960s, ex-Mormons [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] continued that anti-Mormon tradition by reprinting anti-Mormon works in the [[public domain]] as well as important but unflattering documents from LDS history through Utah Light House Ministry. They published their own criticisms of the LDS church as well, which, unlike early anti-Mormon works, cite historical documents.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=60–62}} [[Ed Decker]], an excommunicated Mormon, made two anti-Mormon films: ''[[The God Makers]]'' (1982) and ''[[The God Makers II]]'' (1993). The films described Mormons as being a [[cult]], abusing women and children, manipulating news outlets, and practicing [[Satanism]]. ''The God Makers II'' received criticism from other anti-Mormons, including Jerald and Sandra Tanner, who stated it contained inaccuracies.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=62–63}}

===Official church records and early histories===
[[File:Andrew Jenson.jpg|thumb|Andrew Jenson wrote the LDS Biographical Encyclopedia]]
Official recorders have existed since Joseph Smith organized the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] on April 6, 1830. Church records continue to the present and are kept in the LDS church archives. The first official church history was published in 1842, when Smith and his associates began writing ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of Joseph Smith]]'' as an official diary of Joseph Smith. This history was published in [[Times and Seasons]] in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], and then in [[Deseret News]] and Latter-day Saints' [[Millennial Star]] up until 1863. ''History of Joseph Smith'' was followed by ''History of Brigham Young'', which was also published in Deseret News and Millennial Star over the next two years. Church Historians and their assistants edited the material, which was published in official publications.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|pp=1–2}} [[Andrew Jenson]] made sizable contributions to documentary church history with the [[Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia]] (1901–36), Encyclopedic History of the Church (1941), and an unpublished "Journal History of the Church" containing over 1,500 scrapbooks filled with published and unpublished records of daily activities in the church.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|pp=1–2}} Jenson made a special report on the [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]], and parts of the report were not openly used until [[Massacre at Mountain Meadows|''Massacre at Mountain Meadows'']] (2008) by [[Richard E. Turley Jr.|Richard E. Turley]], [[Ronald W. Walker]], and [[Glen M. Leonard]].{{sfn|Walker|2008|p=25}}

The first historian to attempt to summarize Mormon history on a large scale was [[Edward Tullidge]], who wrote ''Life of Brigham Young: or Utah and Her Founders'' (1876), ''History of Salt Lake City'' (1886), and History of Northern Utah and Southern Idaho (1889). [[Hubert Howe Bancroft|Hubert How Bancroft]] wrote ''History of Utah'' (1889) with the help of the Historian's Office.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|p=3}} Bancroft's history of Utah portrayed Mormons favorably. Critics say that he wasn't objective since he allowed LDS Church authorities to read the book before publication. Perhaps his favorable treatment was how he obtained access to the church records.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=144–145}} Expanding on Bancroft's history, [[Orson F. Whitney]] wrote ''History of Utah'' (1898–1904) in four volumes. [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] wrote ''Essentials of Church History'' in 1922. Most of these accounts combined various testimonies into a single narrative without questioning the validity of the eyewitnesses or other observers, especially those of church authorities.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|p=3}}

Mormons wrote accounts for other Mormons, often published in church-sponsored venues like ''[[Juvenile Instructor|The Juvenile Instructor]]'' and in church-published lesson manuals. These writings were written for a Mormon audience in order to support their existing beliefs. [[B. H. Roberts|Brigham H. Roberts]] was an associate editor of the ''Salt Lake Herald'' and while on a mission to England, was the editor of the ''[[Millennial Star|Millenial Star]]''. Upon returning to Utah, he became a [[General Authority]]. After an invitation from ''Americana'', Brigham H. Roberts wrote a chapter each month from 1909 to 1915 in what later became the ''[[Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]: Century One''.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|pp=199–200}} The history had some of the first historical analysis of events in church history.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=140}} It was serialized in Americana 1909–1915.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|p=3}} 

From 1830-1930, women were victims or symbols in historical accounts.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=1}} Church historians mentioned their suffering, but rarely mentioned them by name. Anti-polygamy tracts also described Mormon women in general terms, describing them as deluded or miserable.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=2}} In an effort to combat the way anti-polygamists portrayed Mormon women, Edward Tullidge and Eliza R. Snow compiled ''The Women of Mormondom'' (1877), a book that portrayed Mormon women as hardworking and independent in a combined history, biography, and theology. ''Heroines of Mormondom'' (1884) highlighted faithful Mormon women's lives. Women wrote short biographies of other women and recorded them in [[Woman's Exponent|''Women's Exponent'']] and through publications from the [[Daughters of the Utah Pioneers]].{{sfn|Erekson|2017|pp=3–4}}

==Early Mormon studies==
[[File:Great Basin Desert 3 by Earth's beauty site.jpg|thumb|Great Basin Desert]]
Early academic writers on Mormon topics had a "naturalistic" approach to history, using theory from economics, psychology, and philosophy to guide their study.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=155}} Richard Ely contributed to the professionalization of Mormon studies with his early dissertation "Economic Aspects of Mormonism" (1903). In the work, he praised Mormon irrigation and communalism as a good model of economic development.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=146–147}} He influenced [[Leonard J. Arrington|Leonard Arrington']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s interest in economics and Mormons.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=160}} Andrew Love Neff wrote "The Mormon Migration to Utah," which he finished in 1918 but had started over ten years earlier. He was interested in how Mormons helped colonize the West.{{sfn|Arrington|1966|p=19}} Mormon [[E. E. Ericksen|Ephraim Edward Ericksen]] wrote "The Psychological and Ethical Aspects of Mormonism" (1922) while studying at the University of Chicago. His dissertation, influenced by functionalist theory, argued that Mormonism was a product of conflicts with non-Mormons and harsh environments.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=147–148}} Lowry Nelson, also a Mormon, studied at the University of Wisconsin in the 1920s. He worked in agriculture and was dean of BYU's College of Applied Science and director of the Utah Agriculture Experiment stations. He wrote articles about how the Mormon village was designed to promote unity and sociability, which allowed Mormon settlers to colonize the Great Basin Desert. He left Utah in 1937.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=149–150}} [[Nels Anderson]] studied at the University of Chicago, and studied hobos in Utah, where he converted to Mormonism. His book ''Desert Saints'' (1944) recounted the history of saints in the St. George, Utah area.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=150–151}} Other scholars publishing on Mormonism from this time period include I. Woodbridge Riley, [[Walter Franklin Prince|Walter F. Prince]], Franklin D. Daines, Hamilton Gardner, Joseph Geddes, [[Feramorz Y. Fox|Feramorz Fox]], Arden Beal Olsen, William McNiff, [[Kimball Young]], [[Austin E. and Alta S. Fife|Austin Fife and Alta Fife]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=151–154}}

In the 1950s after World War II, an increasing number of Mormons studied history professionally and wrote dissertations about Mormon history. Non-Mormon sociologist Thomas F. O'Dea wrote a dissertation entitled "Mormon Values: The Significance of a Religious Outlook for Social Action" after living in a rural Mormon farming village in New Mexico for six months and subsequently teaching at Utah State University.{{sfn|Arrington|1966|p=22}} This study of Mormon culture "stunned Mormon readers with its objectivity and sympathetic insight," according to Mormon scholar [[Richard Bushman]].{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=203}} [[Bernard DeVoto]], [[Dale Morgan|Dale L. Morgan]], [[Fawn M. Brodie|Fawn McKay Brodie]], Stuart Ferguson, and [[Juanita Brooks]] did not have graduate degrees in history, but made significant contributions to the foundations of Mormonism's "New History" movement.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=499–500}}{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=151–154}} Brodie wrote [[No Man Knows My History|''No Man Knows My History'']] (1945), which contemporary reviews praised as definitive and scholarly. Other LDS scholars, notably [[Hugh Nibley]], criticized Brodie's biography.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=499–500}} In 1950, Juanita Brooks, an educated Mormon housewife, published a scholarly book on the Mountain Meadows Massacre, which is well-researched and balanced even by contemporary standards. Brooks's Mormon neighbors did not like "the frankness" of her book.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=202}}

==Apologetics and polemics==
{{anchor|Apologetics}}
&lt;!--Please don't edit text within above anchor template. Thanks.--&gt;
{{see also|Apologetics#Mormonism|Criticism of Mormonism}}

Mormon scholars are divided on whether apologetics should be considered part of Mormon studies or not. Brian D. Birch argues that it should be a part of Mormon studies, as long as apologetic authors concede that their arguments are objective and subject to academic debate.{{sfn|Birch|2014}} Apologists write defensively, and view their polemical responses to criticism as a battle for their faith.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|pp=518–519}} [[Parley P. Pratt]] responded to ''Mormonism Unveiled'' in detail in his 1838 pamphlet ''Mormonism Unveiled: Zion's Watchman Unmasked and Its Editor Mr. L.R. Sunderland Exposed, Truth Vindicated, the Devil Mad, and Priestcraft in Danger!'' Pratt argued against Sunderland's character, quoting Hurlbut, who stated that Sunderland has a "notorious character."{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=69}}

Hugh Nibley's ''No Ma'am, That's Not History'' set a standard for apologetics to use academic language, and criticized Brodie's use of sources in her controversial biography of Joseph Smith, ''No Man Knows My History''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} The [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS) aimed to support the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon and respond to criticism, and used Nibley's style{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} to counter research that contradicted the Book of Mormon's ancient origins.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|p=517}} FARMS collaborated with [[Deseret Book Company|Deseret Book]] to publish the complete works of Hugh Nibley starting in 1984.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} In 1997, LDS church president [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] invited FARMS to be officially affiliated at BYU, and in 2006 it was subsumed by the [[Neal A. Maxwell Institute of Religious Scholarship]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} In 2012, Daniel C. Petersen, the editor of ''[[FARMS Review]]'', started publishing a new journal called [[Interpreter (journal)|''Interpreter'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Peterson|first=Daniel C.|title=The Role of Apologetics in Mormon Studies|date=December 14, 2012|url=http://www.mormoninterpreter.com/the-role-of-apologetics-in-mormon-studies/|work=Mormoninterpreter.com|accessdate=2013-09-04|authorlink=Daniel C.

Some other Mormon "insiders" countered the Book of Mormon's ancient origins through the Smith-Pettit Foundation in Salt Lake City and George Smith's [[Signature Books]] publishing company. Signature Books published ''New Approaches to the Book of Mormon'' by Brent Metcalfe and ''American Apocrypha'' by Dan Vogel and Metcalfe.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=73–74}} These insider views of the Book of Mormon's origins were diverse. ''American Apocrypha'' described the Book of Mormon as a work of fiction reflecting its environment. Ostler argued that the Book of Mormon was partially inspired.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=75}} FARMS's responses were at times patronizing, and even descending into veiled name-calling in William Hamblin's 1994 critique of a Metcalfe essay.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=76–77}}

===Counter-apologetics===
{{see also|Counter-apologetics}}
In the 1990s and 2000s, [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] Carl Mosser and Paul Owen encouraged other Evangelicals to respond to Mormon apologetics. Evangelical [[Craig Blomberg|Craig L. Blomberg]] discussed whether or not Mormons were Christian with Mormon [[Stephen E. Robinson]] in ''How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and Evangelical in Conversation''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=79}} Richard Bushman encouraged fellow Mormon historians to be less defensive and more open to criticism, and also to do research on Mormon history from a consciously Mormon point of view.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|p=521}}

==New Mormon history==
In the 1960s, a new generation of Mormon scholars emerged. The publication of [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'']], the newly-established Mormon History Association, and the professionalization of LDS and RLDS history departments provided spaces for historians to do new research in Mormon topics.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=498–499}} RLDS scholars founded the [[John Whitmer Historical Association]] in 1972.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} In 1974, [[Claudia Bushman]] and [[Laurel Thatcher Ulrich]] founded the magazine ''[[Woman's Exponent|Exponent II]]''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=164}} The first issue of [[BYU Studies Quarterly|''BYU Studies'']] was published in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrington|first1=Leonard|title=An Economic Interpretation of the "Word of Wisdom"|journal=BYU Studies|date=1959|volume=1|issue=1|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/economic-interpretation-word-wisdom|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leonard Arrington 1950s.jpeg|thumb|Leonard Arrington]]
Also in 1972, the LDS Church hired Leonard Arrington as their historian.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=501}} During Arrington's time as historian, Mormon and non-Mormon historians were allowed to access the [[Church History Library|LDS Church Archives]]. Much of the research in the 1970s used these newly-available sources to examine church history, sometimes in great detail.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=502}} Leonard Arrington influenced important scholars of Mormon history, including [[Richard L. Jensen|Richard Jensen]], [[William G. Hartley|William Hartley]], and [[Ronald W. Walker|Ronald Walker]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=164}} In 1969, Jewish historian [[Moses Rischin]] named the increasing amount of Mormon scholarship "the New Mormon history."{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=203}} The "New Mormon History" movement included non-Mormons Thomas F. O'Dea, P.A.M. Taylor, [[Mario De Pillis]], Lawrence Foster, Community of Christ member Robert Flanders, and Mormon scholar Klaus Hansen.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=5}}{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} 

[[Maureen Ursenbach Beecher]] was a leading researcher in women's studies.{{sfn|Whittaker|2013}}{{sfn|Cope|2012|p=102}} In the 1970s women's biographies were published, but not integrated into larger narratives.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=2}} Other women hired by the Church Historical Department included Jill Mulvay Derr, Carol Cornwall Madsen, and Edyth Romney. Journals dedicated special issues to Mormon women, and the increased interest in Mormon women led to more publications focused on them. Scholars published biographies of Emma Smith, Eliza Snow, Emmeline B. Wells, and Amy Brown Lyman.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=5}} 

Some writers looked at Mormon women's history with the goal of restructuring historical narratives. Mormon feminist articles on Mormon history started with the special Summer 1971 issue of ''Dialogue'' on women's issues and continued in publications like ''Exponent II'' (starting in 1974), and ''Mormon Sisters: Women in Early Utah'' (1976), edited by [[Claudia Bushman]]. Beecher and Laurel Thatcher Ulrich edited another volume about Mormon women's history in ''Sisters in Sprit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective'' (1987). ''Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism'' (1992) was another milestone in feminist publications, and it encouraged Mormon women to be empowered by their history and "reclaim lost opportunities."{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=6}}

Most New Mormon historians were LDS.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=6}} Their audience was Mormon intellectuals{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=5}} and non-Mormons.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=204}} They maintained their respect for the Mormon faith, admitted to flaws in people and policies, and avoided taking a defensive stance,{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=204}} a tone which non-Mormon historian [[Jan Shipps]] wrote "made them seem more secular than they actually were."{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=504–505}} Mormon history by non-Mormons at this time had a similar detached tone.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=204}} New Mormon historians often published with the [[University of Illinois Press]] in order to publish for an academic audience independent of the church.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=206}} Charles S. Peterson argued in ''The Great Basin Kingdom Revisited'' that Arrington took an exceptionalist view of Mormon history, which he then taught to other New Mormon Historians. This exceptionalist view was that they could believe in both secular history and orthodox Mormon views of the restoration.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=234–235}}

==LDS church reaffirms orthodoxy and New Mormon Faith Historians==
The LDS church stopped funding so much research and limited access to the church archives.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=510}} Apostle [[Ezra Taft Benson]] warned employees in the [[Church Educational System]] against New Mormon History in a 1976 speech. He said that writing history in a neutral style undermined "prophetic history."  [[Boyd K. Packer]]'s 1981 article, "The Mantle is Far, Far Greater than the Intellect" was published in ''BYU Studies.'' He wrote that contemporary historians were too eager to focus on the faults of church leaders and dismiss spiritual inspiration.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=215}} In 1982, historians from Arrington's department were transferred to Brigham Young University, where they were assigned to teach in the history department and worked in the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History.{{sfn|Anderson|2005}}

[[File:Carol C. Madsen (41596667191).jpg|thumb|Carol Cornwall Madsen]]
After Arrington's death in 1999, [[Ronald K. Esplin]] and [[Jill Mulvay Derr]] led the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History at BYU. [[Carol Cornwall Madsen]] led research in the Women's History Initiative at the institute, where she wrote an important biographical study of [[Emmeline B. Wells]].{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=512}} In 2001,{{sfn|Bushman|2009|137}} [[Richard Bushman]] retired from full-time teaching at [[Columbia University]] and was a research director at the Smith Institute.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=513}} [[Dean C. Jessee]] started editing Joseph Smith's papers in ''The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith''. The Smith Institute closed in 2005, and institute staff along with the Smith papers project moved to the [[Church Office Building]].{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=512}} The [[The Joseph Smith Papers|Joseph Smith Papers]] project, started by the LDS church in 2001, aimed to publish Joseph Smith's papers with rigorous accuracy, and was validated by the National Historic Public Records Commission.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=205}} 

[[Jan Shipps]] asserts that this reluctance to support new Mormon history was a response to the [[Mark Hofmann]] document forgeries. Also, some church authorities disliked the books and articles produced by the history department, which noted flaws as well as strengths of people in church history.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=510}} Shipps states that the increase in new converts to the LDS Church led General Authorities to emphasize the need for "palatable" versions of church history in museums and historic sites rather than in-depth articles in church-sponsored publications.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=511}} Mormon sociologist [[Armand Mauss]] argued that Mormonism was a struggle between remaining distinctive and assimilating to accepted American cultural practices; scholar Ronald Helfrich speculates that the change in General Authority's reception to Arrington's research was because they feared assimilating too much.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=218}} General interest in Mormon studies continued during the 1980s, with over 2,000 books, articles, and other material published on Mormon history during that decade.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} 

''BYU Studies'' and Deseret Books published more "New Mormon Faith Historians" after General Authority pushback against New Mormon History. One of these New Mormon Faith Historians was [[Louis C. Midgley|Louis Midgely]], who argued that from a relativist, postmodern theory, the Mormon view that the LDS Church had divine origins was just as valuable and valid as others. New Mormon Faith Historians said that the New Mormon scholars left faith out of their analyses.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=219–220}} Many were members of FARMS, and often saw writers of New Mormon History as the same as other anti-Mormons, even though most writers of New Mormon History were Mormon.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=221–222}} The difference between the New Mormon Faith Historians and New Mormon scholars was hard to define.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=219–220}} 

Along with Arrington's transfer and a subsequent increase in restrictions in the LDS Church Archives, several other incidents led to an intellectual chilling of Mormon history by Mormons in the 1990s.{{sfn|Schuessler|2012}} In 1992, Arrington wrote that "the church cannot afford to place its official stamp of approval on any 'private' interpretation of its past," and this kind of history must be not sponsored by the LDS Church.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|pp=4–5}} In September 1993, the LDS church excommunicated the [[September Six]], which included two historians: [[Lavina Fielding Anderson]] and [[D. Michael Quinn]]. These excommunications served as a warning to other Mormon historians.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=510}} Quinn's excommunication was perhaps tied to his idea that Mormon women had been given the priesthood in 1843, which he published in an essay in ''Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=224–225}} In 2003, he was scheduled to give a speech at a conference at Yale which was co-sponsored by BYU, and BYU stated they would withdraw their funding if Quinn presented his paper. That same year, Quinn applied to work as a professor at the University of Utah and Arizona State University. He was not hired as a professor, possibly because of fears that LDS people in power would retaliate against the university.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=227–228}} In 1986, administrators were asked not to contribute to ''Dialogue'' or present at the [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]] symposium; around 1990, BYU professors were asked not to contribute to ''Dialogue'' or ''Sunstone''.{{sfn|Hansen|2010|pp=40–41}} [[Eugene England]], one of the founders of ''Dialogue'' and then a professor at BYU, spoke out against these prohibitions. He was asked not to write for the ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'' in 1990, and in 1998 he was asked to retire from BYU without justification. England saw this as stemming from his publicly anti-war stance, and for his attention to Mormon racism and sexism. He viewed his differences as a potential source of learning for himself and others. After retiring from BYU, he started one of the first Mormon studies programs at [[Utah Valley University|Utah Valley State College]]. According to a 1997 report by the [[American Association of University Professors]] on academic freedom at BYU, Alan Wilkins was questioned about his motives for contributing to ''Dialogue'' and ''Sunstone'' in a tenure review. The report also mentioned other incidents where BYU administration criticized speakers and articles for criticism of the church, among other complaints.{{sfn|Pratt|1997|p=63}} 

In 1997, [[Joanna Brooks]] argued that the goal of Mormon studies was to critically examine Mormonism, not to determine religious truths.{{sfn|Brooks|1997|p=135}} She postulated that Mormon studies done as a type of cultural studies will help scholars in the field feel less defensive and more productive.{{sfn|Brooks|1997|p=138}} Outside of Brigham Young University and Utah, the [[University of North Carolina Press]], [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], and the [[University of Oklahoma Press]] published books on Mormonism.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} In the 2000s, Jan Shipps was a large influence on news articles about Mormons; often she is the only expert cited for an entire article.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} In 2005, the National Endowment for the Humanities held a seminar at Brigham Young University on the bicentennial of Joseph Smith's birth.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=197}}  [[Terryl Givens]], a comparative literature scholar, analyzed discourse about the Book of Mormon in ''By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World Religion'' in 2002. {{sfn|McLemee|2002}}

Mormon women's history has not been well-integrated in general histories. Arrington and Davis Bitton discussed women's issues in two chapters on marriage and sisterhood in ''The Mormon Experience'' (1992). ''The Story of the Latter-day Saints'' (1992) by James Allen and Glen Leonard mentioned women in the context of auxiliaries like Relief Society and Primary, plural marriage, suffrage, and the ERA. ''The Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History'' (2000) contained 435 entries about men, but only 64 about women, with three-quarters of the women receiving less than a page of description. Church publication ''Our Heritage'' (1996) only mentioned a few women. Women's history remained in a "separate sphere."{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=7–8}} ''Daughters in My Kingdom'' (2011), an official history of the Relief Society, is mostly used in women's meetings. Outside of Mormon history specialists, Mormon women are rarely mentioned.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=9}}

==Newer Mormon history==
Non-Mormon scholars are still often suspicious of LDS scholars' work.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=3}} That is gradually changing as non-Mormon scholars increase and universities not affiliated with the LDS Church have endowed chairs for Mormon studies.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=4}} [[Kathleen Flake]] is the first Richard L. Bushman Chair of Mormon Studies at [[University of Virginia]], and [[Patrick Q. Mason|Patrick Mason]] is the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at Claremont Graduate University in California.{{sfn|Walker|2013}}

[[File:Church History Library in Salt Lake City.jpg|thumb|Church History Library in Salt Lake City]]
The Church History Library still restricts access to certain documents for most scholars. Scholars may self-censor their research for fear of losing access to documents from the Church History Library. Previous excommunications of Mormon historians give Mormon researchers the sense that they are being watched.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=4}} Scholars from various disciplines see the "New Mormon History" movement as ending, bring replaced by "Post New Mormon History" or "Newer Mormon History." This emerging movement is interdisciplinary and endeavors to place Mormon studies in a broader historical context, further eroding boundaries between disciplines.{{sfn|Newell|2013|pp=6–7}} Mormon women's history has not been well-integrated with other Mormon studies topics.{{sfn|Coles|2018}} Contemporary historians like [[R. Marie Griffith]], [[Grant Wacker]], and [[Robert Orsi]] encourage the use of interdisciplinary tools in Mormon studies.{{sfn|Cope|2012|p=100}}

Included in these interdisciplinary tools are oral histories. In 1972, an the Charles Redd Center for Western Studies was established at BYU, where Jessie L. Embry directed an extensive oral history project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=John |last2=Ainsworth |first2=GlendaLynn |last3=Casper |first3=Zann |last4=Balif |first4=Elizabeth |title=Charles Redd Center for Western Studies oral history project records|url=https://findingaid.lib.byu.edu/viewItem/MSS%207752 |website=findingaid.lib.byu.edu |publisher=L.

Tom Perry Special Collections |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church History Department started their own oral history project in 2009.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=6}} Claudia L. Bushman and her students started the Claremont Oral History collection in 2009, and papers using the oral history data were published in ''Mormon Women Have Their Say: Essays from the Claremont Oral History Collection''.{{sfn|Bushman|Kline|2013b}}

The LDS Church History Department hired a specialist in women's history in 2011, Kate Holbrook. She co-authored ''The First Fifty Years of Relief Society: Key Documents in Latter-Day Saint Women's History'' with Jill Mulvay Derr, Carol Cornwall Madsen, and Matthew J. Grow. Laurel Thatcher Ulrich said the book was "the most important work to emerge from a Mormon Press in the last 50 years." Jenny Reeder, specializing in 19th century women's history, was hired in 2013. Brittany Chapman Nash and Lisa Tait also specialize in women's history and work in the LDS Church history department. Nash works in public services and helps researchers to be aware of women's sources the archive offers. She co-authored ''Women of Faith in the Latter Days'' with [[Richard E. Turley Jr.|Richard Turley]]. Tait works on the web team, helping to add a "Women of Conviction" section to church history website.{{sfn|Walch|2016}} In 2017, Reeder and Holbrook edited a compilation of women's speeches called ''At the Pulpit: 185 Years of Discourses by Latter-day Saint Women.'' {{sfn|Walch|2017}}

==Blogs and Mormon studies==
The [[Mormon blogosphere]] influences Mormon studies. In 2011, Patrick Mason surveyed 113 Mormon blog readers who were also graduate students.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=13}} Most respondents viewed blogs as a way to democratize Mormon studies. Since blogs are independent from Church institutions, many felt that blogs were a safe space to test more unorthodox ideas.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=17}} A few observed that men's voices are more prominent in the blogging community, though a few prominent blogs have all-women authors.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=18}} Other respondents felt that blogs made Mormon studies "more of an echo chamber," and were "superficial," and "glorified navel-gazing."{{sfn|Mason|2012|pp=18–19}}  One of the most popular blogs, By Common Consent, had over two million page visitors in 2011. It and other blogs are influential on Mormon studies.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=20}}

== Archives ==
Archives with significant Mormon collections include the [[L. Tom Perry Special Collections]] at BYU, the Church Archives in Salt Lake, the J. Willard Marriott Library at the [[University of Utah]] in Salt Lake, Utah State University Libraries, and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=165}}

== Awards ==
Awards for writing or service in the field of Mormon studies are presented annually by scholarly societies.  The [[Mormon History Association]] (MHA) and the [[John Whitmer Historical Association]] (JWHA) each present annual awards for various categories within Mormon history, such as books, biographies, documentary history, journal articles, and lifetime achievement.&lt;ref name=mha_awards&gt;{{cite web | title=MHA Awards | work=mormonhistoryassociation.org | publisher=Mormon History Association | url=https://www.mormonhistoryassociation.org/awards | accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Awards | work=jwha.info | publisher=John Whitmer Historical Association | url=http://www.jwha.info/awards | accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The MHA also gives awards for theses and student papers.&lt;ref name=mha_awards/&gt;  The [[Utah State Historical Society]] (USHS), which frequently engages Mormon history, also presents awards for books, articles, and student papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NEWS: Utah State History Announces 2013 Annual Awards | date=September 17, 2013 | work=Utah Cultural Alliance: Unifying Utah's Cultural Community | url=http://ut-cultural-alliance.blogspot.com/2013/09/news-utah-state-history-announces-2013.html

== Academic programs ==
Several universities have programs in the study of Mormonism, with professors named to oversee coursework, research, and events on Mormon studies.  While independent academic programs have emerged in recent years, devotional religious education programs have existed far longer.  Additional colleges have also taught courses on Mormonism without having institutionally sponsored programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New Series: Mormon Studies in the Classroom | author=Benjamin Park | date=April 21, 2014 | work=Juvenile Instructor | url=http://juvenileinstructor.org/new-series-mormon-studies-in-the-classroom/ | accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are not included in the list below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20536">'''Novel ecosystems''' are human-built, modified, or engineered [[ecological niche|niches]] of the [[Anthropocene]]. They exist in places that have been altered in structure and function by human agency. Novel ecosystems are part of the [[human ecology|human]] [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[Ecological niche|niche]] (including [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]], and [[rural]]), they lack natural analogs, and they have extended an influence that has converted more than three-quarters of wild Earth. These anthropogenic [[biome]]s include technoecosystems that are fuelled by powerful [[energy sources]] (fossil and nuclear) including ecosystems populated with technodiversity, such as roads and unique combinations of soils called [[technosols]]. [[Vegetation association]]s on old buildings or along field boundary stone walls in old agricultural [[landscape]]s are examples of sites where research into novel [[ecosystem ecology]] is developing.

==Overview==

[[Human society]] has transformed the planet to such an extent that we may have ushered in a new epoch known as the ''[[anthropocene]]''. The ecological niche of the anthropocene contains entirely novel ecosystems that include technosols, technodiversity, [[anthrome]]s, and the [[#Technosphere|technosphere]]. These terms describe the human ecological phenomena marking this unique turn in the evolution of Earth's history.&lt;ref name="Odum05"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Odum | first1=E.

Ellis (2008)&lt;ref name="Ellis08" /&gt; identifies twenty-one different kinds of anthropogenic biomes that sort into the following groups: 1) dense settlements, 2) villages, 3) croplands, 4) rangeland, 5) forested, and 6) wildlands. These anthropogenic biomes (or anthromes for short) create the technosphere that surrounds us and are populated with diverse technologies (or technodiversity for short). Within these anthromes the human species (one species out of billions) appropriates 23.8% of the global net primary production. "This is a remarkable impact on the biosphere caused by just one species."

{{Main|Noosphere}}
Noosphere (sometimes '''noösphere''') is the "[[theory of mind|sphere]] of human thought".&lt;ref&gt;Georgy S. Levit: The Biosphere and the Noosphere Theories of V. I. Vernadsky and P. Teilhard de Chardin: A Methodological Essay. International Archives on the History of Science/Archives Internationales D'Histoire des Sciences, 50 (144) - 2000: S. 160-176 {{cite web |url=http://www2.uni-jena.de/biologie/ehh/personal/glevit/Teilhard.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050517081543/http://www2.uni-jena.de/biologie/ehh/personal/glevit/Teilhard.pdf |archivedate=2005-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''νοῦς'' ([[nous]] "[[mind]]") + ''σφαῖρα''  (sphaira "[[sphere]]"), in lexical analogy to "[[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]" and "[[biosphere]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[...]he defined noosphere as the 'thinking envelope of the biosphere' and the 'conscious unity of souls'" David H. Lane, 1996, "The phenomenon of Teilhard: prophet for a new age" p.4 https://books.google.com/books?id=QrwityQkdxkC&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] 1922 &lt;ref&gt;In 1922, Teilhard wrote in an essay with the title 'Hominization': "And this amounts to imagining, in one way or another, above the animal biosphere a  human sphere, a sphere of reflection, of conscious invention, of conscious souls (the noosphere, if you will)" (1966, p. 63) It was a neologism employing the Greek word noos for "mind."  ( Teilhard de Chardin, "Hominization" (1923), "The Vision of the Past" pages 71,230,261 https://books.google.com/books?id=GnwPAQAAIAAJ )&lt;/ref&gt; in his [[Cosmogenesis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Tambov State Technical University: [http://www.tstu.ru/win/kultur/nauka/vernad/uchver.htm Russian Scientist V.I.Vernadsky], in Russian&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is the first use of the term by [[Édouard Le Roy]], who together with [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Chardin]] was listening to lectures of [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] at [[Sorbonne]]. In 1936 [[Vladimir Vernadsky|Vernadsky]] presented on the idea of the Noosphere in a letter to  [[Boris Leonidovich Lichkov]] (though, he states that the concept derives from Le Roy).

The technosphere is the part of the environment on Earth where technodiversity extends its influence into the biosphere.&lt;ref name="Barett00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Naveh82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palm96"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Palm | first1=V. | last2=Östlund | first2=C. | title=Lead and zinc flows from technosphere to biosphere in a city region | journal=Science of the Total Environment | volume=192 | issue=1 | pages=95–109 | year=1996 | doi=10.1016/0048-9697(96)05301-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "For the development of suitable [[restoration (ecology)|restoration]] strategies, a clear distinction has to be made between different functional classes of natural and cultural solar-powered biosphere and fossil-powered technosphere landscapes, according to their inputs and throughputs of energy and materials, their organisms, their control by natural or human information, their internal [[self-organization]] and their regenerative capacities."&lt;ref name="Naveh98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Naveh | first1=Z. | title=Ecological and cultural landscape restoration and the cultural evolution towards a post-industrial symbiosis between human society and nature | journal=Restoration Ecology | year=2004 | volume=6 | issue=2 | pages=135–143 | doi=10.1111/j.1526-100X.1998.00624.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of Earth's technosphere has been calculated as 30 trillion tons, a mass greater than 50 kilos for every square metre of the planet's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161130085021.htm |title=Earth's 'technosphere' now weighs 30 trillion tons |publisher=Science Daily |date=30 November 2016|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technoecosystems===
The concept of technoecosystems has been pioneered by ecologists [[Howard T. Odum]] and Zev Naveh. Technoecosystems interface with and are competitive toward natural systems. They have advanced technology (or technodiversity) money-based [[market economies]] and have a large [[ecological footprint]]s.  Technoecosystems have far greater [[energy use|energy requirements]] than natural ecosystems, excessive [[water consumption]], and release [[toxic]] and [[eutrophication|eutrophicating]] chemicals.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naveh82" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Odum01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naveh98" /&gt; Other ecologists have defined the extensive [[street network|global network of road system]]s as a type of technoecosystem.&lt;ref name="Lugoa00" /&gt;

===Technoecotypes===
"Bio-agro- and techno-ecotopes are spatially integrated in larger, regional landscape units, but they are not structurally and functionally integrated in the ecosphere. Because of the adverse impacts of the latter and the great human pressures on bio-ecotopes, they are even antagonistically related and therefore cannot function together as a coherent, sustainable ecological system."&lt;ref name="Naveh98" /&gt;{{rp|136}}

[[File:Swanage Punch &amp; Judy.JPG|thumb|A traditional Punch and Judy booth, at [[Swanage]], Dorset, England]]

'''Punch and Judy''' is a traditional [[puppet]] show featuring Mr. Punch and his wife Judy. The performance consists of a sequence of short scenes, each depicting an interaction between two characters, most typically Mr. Punch and one other character who usually falls victim to Punch's slap stick. It is often associated with traditional [[British culture]].&lt;ref name="British seaside" /&gt; The various episodes of Punch comedy—often provoking shocked laughter—are dominated by the clowning of Mr. Punch.&lt;ref name="350 years"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr Punch celebrates 350 years of puppet anarchy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17895716|agency=BBC|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is performed by a single puppeteer inside the booth, known since Victorian times as a "professor" or "punchman", and assisted sometimes by a "bottler" who corrals the audience outside the booth, introduces the performance, and collects the money ("the bottle"). The bottler might also play accompanying music or sound effects on a drum or guitar, and engage in back chat with the puppets, sometimes repeating lines that may have been difficult for the audience to understand. In Victorian times, the drum and [[pan pipe]]s were the instruments of choice. Today, the audience is also encouraged to participate, calling out to the characters on the stage to warn them of danger or clue them in to what is going on behind their backs. Also nowadays, most professors work solo, since the need for a bottler became less important when [[busking]] with the show gave way to paid engagements at private parties or public events.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|quote="[Pulcinella] went down particularly well with Restoration British audiences, fun-starved after years of [[Puritanism]]. We soon changed Punch's name, transformed him from a marionette to a hand puppet, and he became, really, a spirit of Britain – a subversive maverick who defies authority, a kind of puppet equivalent to our political cartoons." |source=—Punch and Judy showman Glyn Edwards.&lt;ref name="British seaside"&gt;{{cite news|title=Punch and Judy around the world |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/7949781/Punch-and-Judy-around-the-world.html|work=The Telegraph|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Punch and Judy show has roots in the 16th-century Italian [[commedia dell'arte]]. The figure of Punch is derived from the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] stock character of [[Pulcinella]], which was [[anglicized]] to ''Punchinello''.&lt;ref name="eb1911-punch"&gt;{{cite EB1911|last=Wheeler|first=R. Mortimer|wstitle=Punch (puppet)|title=Punch|volume=22|pages=648–649}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a manifestation of the [[Lord of Misrule]] and [[Trickster]] figures of deep-rooted mythologies. Punch's wife was originally called "Joan."
[[File:Punch Plaque Covent Garden.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Plaque commemorating the first recorded performance of Punch and Judy on [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's]] in [[Covent Garden]]]]

The figure who later became Mr. Punch made his first recorded appearance in England on 9 May 1662, which is traditionally reckoned as Punch's UK birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Watson. [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2141622/Thats-way-Mr-Punch-celebrates-350-years-recorded-time-diary-Samuel-Pepys.html "That's the way to do it! Mr Punch celebrate 350 years since being recorded for the first time in the diary of Samuel Pepys"], ''The Daily Mail''&lt;/ref&gt; The diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] observed a [[marionette]] show featuring an early version of the Punch character in [[Covent Garden]] in London. It was performed by Italian puppet showman Pietro Gimonde, a.k.a. "Signor Bologna." Pepys described the event in his diary as "an Italian puppet play, that is within the rails there, which is very pretty."

In the British Punch and Judy show, Punch wears a brightly coloured [[jester]]'s [[motley]] and [[Capotain|sugarloaf hat]] with a tassel. He is a [[hunchback]] whose hooked nose almost meets his curved, jutting chin. He carries a stick (called a slapstick) as large as himself, which he freely uses upon most of the other characters in the show. He speaks in a distinctive squawking voice, produced by a contrivance known as a ''[[swazzle]]'' or ''swatchel'' which the professor holds in his mouth, transmitting his gleeful cackle. This gives Punch a vocal quality as though he were speaking through a [[kazoo]]. So important is Punch's signature sound that it is a matter of some controversy within Punch and Judy circles as to whether a "non-swazzled" show can be considered a true Punch and Judy Show. Other characters do not use the swazzle, so the Punchman has to switch back and forth while still holding the device in his mouth.

In the early 18th century, the marionette theatre starring Punch was at its height, with showman [[Martin Powell (puppetry)|Martin Powell]] attracting sizable crowds at both his ''Punch's Theatre'' at Covent Garden and earlier in provincial [[Bath, Somerset]].&lt;ref name="eb1911-punch"/&gt; Powell has been credited with being "largely responsible for the form taken by the drama of Punch and Judy".&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{DNB|prescript=|wstitle=Powell, Martin|first=Thomas| last=Seccombe|authorlink=Thomas Seccombe|volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1721, a puppet theatre opened in [[Dublin]] that ran for decades. The cross-dressing actress [[Charlotte Charke]] ran the successful but short-lived Punch's Theatre in the Old Tennis Court at [[St. James's]], [[Westminster]], presenting adaptations of [[Shakespeare]] as well as plays by herself, her father [[Colley Cibber]], and her friend [[Henry Fielding]]. Fielding eventually ran his own puppet theatre under the pseudonym Madame de la Nash to avoid the censorship concomitant with the Theatre [[Licensing Act of 1737]].

Punch was extremely popular in [[Paris]] and, by the end of the 18th century, he was also playing in Britain's American colonies,&lt;!---By the end of the 18th century, Britain didn't HAVE any American colonies---&gt; where even [[George Washington]] bought tickets for a show. However, marionette productions were expensive and cumbersome to mount and transport, presented in empty halls, the back rooms of [[taverns]], or within large tents at England's yearly agricultural events at [[Bartholomew Fair]] and [[Mayfair]]. In the latter half of the 18th century, marionette companies began to give way to glove-puppet shows, performed from within a narrow, lightweight booth by one puppeteer, usually with an assistant, or "bottler," to gather a crowd and collect money. These shows might travel through country towns or move from corner to corner along busy London streets, giving many performances in a single day. The character of Punch adapted to the new format, going from a stringed comedian who might say outrageous things to a more aggressive glove-puppet who could do outrageous—and often violent—things to the other characters. About this time, Punch's wife's name changed from "Joan" to "Judy."

The mobile puppet booth of the late 18th- and early 19th-century Punch and Judy [[Hand puppet|glove-puppet]] show was originally covered in checked bed ticking or whatever inexpensive cloth might come to hand. Later Victorian booths were gaudier affairs, particularly those used for Christmas parties and other indoor performances. In the 20th century, however, red-and-white-striped puppet booths became iconic features on the beaches of many English seaside and summer holiday resorts. Such striped cloth is the most common covering today, wherever the show might be performed.

A more substantial change came over time to the show's [[target audience]]. The show was originally intended for adults, but it changed into primarily a children's entertainment in the late Victorian era. Ancient members of the show's cast ceased to be included, such as the [[Devil]] and Punch's mistress "Pretty Polly," when they came to be seen as inappropriate for young audiences.

The story changes, but some phrases remain the same for decades or even centuries. For example, Punch dispatches his foes each in turn and still squeaks his famous catchphrase: "''That's'' the way to do it!"&lt;ref name="350 years" /&gt; The term "pleased as Punch" is derived from Punch and Judy; specifically, Mr. Punch's characteristic sense of gleeful self-satisfaction.

Modern British performances of Punch and Judy are no longer exclusively the traditional [[seaside resort|seaside]] children's entertainments which they had become. They can now be seen at carnivals, festivals, birthday parties, and other celebratory occasions.

==Characters==
[[File:Islington Punch and Judy.JPG|thumb|Punch and Judy, taken in [[Islington]], north London.]]
The characters in a Punch and Judy show are not fixed. They are similar to the cast of a [[soap opera]] or a [[Folklore|folk tale]] such as [[Robin Hood]]: the principal characters must appear, but the lesser characters are included at the discretion of the performer. New characters may be added and older characters dropped as the tradition changes.

Along with Punch and Judy, the cast of characters usually includes their baby, a hungry crocodile, a clown, an officious policeman, and a prop string of sausages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speckinspace.com/whatsit/history/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123140814/http://www.speckinspace.com/whatsit/history/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 November 2010 |title=A Brief History of Punch and Judy (with an introduction to the characters) |publisher=Speckinspace.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The devil and the generic hangman [[Jack Ketch]] may still make their appearances but, if so, Punch will always get the better of them. The cast of a typical Punch and Judy show today will include:
* Mr. Punch
* Judy
* The Baby
* The Constable
* Joey the Clown
* The Crocodile
* The Skeleton
* The Doctor

Characters once regular but now occasional include:
* Toby the Dog
* The Ghost
* The Lawyer
* Hector the Horse
* Pretty Polly
* The Hangman (a.k.a. Jack Ketch)
* The Devil
* The Beadle
* Jim Crow  ('The black man')
* Mr. Scaramouche
* The Servant (or 'The Minstrel')
* The Blind Man

Other characters included Boxers, Chinese Plate Spinners, topical figures, a trick puppet with an extending neck (the "Courtier"), and a monkey. A live Dog Toby was once a regular featured novelty routine, sitting on the playboard and performing 'with' the puppets.

==Story==
Glyn Edwards has likened the story of Punch and Judy to the story of [[Cinderella]].&lt;ref name="Edwards Glyn Successful"&gt;Edwards, Glyn. (2000) ''Successful Punch and Judy'', Second Edition 2011. Worthing: The Fedora Group. {{ISBN|9780956718914}}. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that there are parts of the Cinderella story which everyone knows, namely the cruel step sisters, the invitation to the ball, the handsome prince, the fairy godmother, Cinderella's dress turning to rags at midnight, the glass slipper left behind, the prince searching for its owner, and the happy ending. None of these elements can be omitted and the famous story still be told. The same principle applies to Punch and Judy. Everyone knows that Punch mishandles the baby, that Punch and Judy quarrel and fight, that a policeman comes for Punch and gets a taste of his stick, that Punch has a gleeful run-in with a variety of other figures and takes his stick to them all, that eventually he faces his final foe (which might be a hangman, the devil, a crocodile, or a ghost). Edwards contends that a proper Punch and Judy show requires these elements or the audience will feel let down.&lt;ref name="Edwards Glyn Successful" /&gt;

Peter Fraser writes, "the drama developed as a succession of incidents which the audience could join or leave at any time, and much of the show was impromptu."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Peter (1970) ''Punch and Judy''. London: B.T Batsford. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Company. {{ISBN|0-7134-2284-X}}. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 71-110085. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was elaborated by [[George Speaight]], who explained that the plotline "is like a story compiled in a parlour game of [[Consequences (game)|Consequences]]&amp;nbsp;... the show should, indeed, not be regarded as a story at all but a succession of encounters."&lt;ref&gt;Speaight, George. (1955) ''Punch and Judy: A History'', Revised Edition 1970. London: Studio Vista Ltd. {{ISBN|0-289-79785-3}}. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Leach makes it clear that "the story is a conceptual entity, not a set text: the means of telling it, therefore, are always variable."&lt;ref&gt;Leach, Robert. (1985) ''The Punch &amp; Judy Show: History, Tradition and Meaning''. London: Batsford Academic and Educational; Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press. {{ISBN|0713447842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosalind Crone asserts that the story needed to be episodic so that passersby on the street could easily join or leave the audience during a performance.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006"&gt;Crone, Rosalind (2006). "Mr and Mrs Punch in Nineteenth-Century England." ''The Historical Journal'', 49(4) pp. 1055–1082.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much emphasis is often placed on the first printed script of Punch and Judy, in 1827. It was based on a show by travelling performer Giovanni Piccini, illustrated by [[George Cruikshank]], and written by [[John Payne Collier]]. This is the only surviving script of a performance, and its accuracy is questioned. The performance was stopped frequently to allow Collier and Cruikshank to write and sketch and, in the words of Speaight, Collier is someone of whom "the full list of his forgeries has not yet been reckoned, and the myths he propagated are still being repeated. (His) 'Punch and Judy' is to be warmly welcomed as the first history of puppets in England, but it is also sadly to be examined as the first experiment of a literary criminal."&lt;ref&gt;Speaight (1970), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale of Punch and Judy varies from puppeteer to puppeteer, as previously with Punchinello and Joan, and it has changed over time. Nonetheless, the skeletal outline is often recognizable. It typically involves Punch behaving outrageously, struggling with his wife Judy and the baby, and then triumphing in a series of encounters with the forces of law and order (and often the supernatural), interspersed with jokes and songs.

===Typical 21st-century performance===
A typical show as performed currently in the UK will start with the arrival of Mr. Punch, followed by the introduction of Judy. They may well kiss and dance before Judy requests Mr. Punch to look after the baby. Punch will fail to carry out this task appropriately. It is rare for Punch to hit his baby these days, but he may well sit on it in a failed attempt to "babysit", or drop it, or even let it go through a sausage machine. In any event, Judy will return, will be outraged, will fetch a stick, and the knockabout will commence. A policeman will arrive in response to the mayhem and will himself be felled by Punch's slapstick. All this is carried out at breakneck farcical speed with much involvement from a gleefully shouting audience. From here on anything goes.

Joey the Clown might appear and suggest, "It's dinner time." This will lead to the production of a string of sausages, which Mr. Punch must look after, although the audience will know that this really signals the arrival of a crocodile whom Mr. Punch might not see until the audience shouts out and lets him know. Punch's subsequent comic struggle with the crocodile might then leave him in need of a Doctor who will arrive and attempt to treat Punch by walloping him with a stick until Punch turns the tables on him. Punch may next pause to count his "victims" by laying puppets on the stage, only for Joey the Clown to move them about behind his back in order to frustrate him. A ghost might then appear and give Mr. Punch a fright before it too is chased off with a [[slapstick]].

In less squeamish times, a hangman would arrive to punish Mr. Punch, only to himself be tricked into sticking his head in the noose. "Do you do the hanging?" is a question often asked of performers. Some will include it where circumstances warrant (such as for an adult audience) but most do not. Some will choose to include it whatever the circumstances and will face down any critics. Finally, the show will often end with the Devil arriving for Mr. Punch (and possibly to threaten his audience as well). Punch—in his final gleefully triumphant moment—will win his fight with the Devil, bring the show to a rousing conclusion, and earn a round of applause.

===Plots reflect their own era===

[[File:Hitler Punch and Judy Show.jpg|thumb|A traditional Punch and Judy show dating from [[World War II]] with the addition of a [[Hitler]] Character as a figure of derision to reflect the times. Taken at the [[History On Wheels Museum]], [[Eton Wick]], UK.]]
Punch and Judy might follow no fixed storyline, as with the tales of Robin Hood, but there are episodes common to many recorded versions. It is these set piece encounters or "routines" which are used by performers to construct their own Punch and Judy shows. A visit to a Punch and Judy Festival at Punch's "birthplace" in London's Covent Garden will reveal a whole variety of changes that are wrung by puppeteers from this basic material. Scripts have been published at different times since the early 19th century, but none can be claimed as the definitive traditional script of Punch and Judy. Each printed script reflects the era in which it was performed and the circumstances under which it was printed.

The various episodes of the show are performed in the spirit of outrageous comedy—often provoking shocked laughter—and are dominated by the anarchic clowning of Mr. Punch. Just as the Victorian version of the show drew on the morality of its day, so also the Punch &amp; Judy College of Professors considers that the 20th- and 21st-century versions of the tale have changed into something akin to a primitive version of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in which a bizarre family is used as a vehicle for grotesque visual comedy and a sideways look at contemporary society.

{{quote|In my opinion the street Punch is one of those extravagant reliefs from the realities of life which would lose its hold upon the people if it were made moral and instructive. I regard it as quite harmless in its influence, and as an outrageous joke which no one in existence would think of regarding as an incentive to any kind of action or as a model for any kind of conduct. It is possible, I think, that one secret source of pleasure very generally derived from this performance… is the satisfaction the spectator feels in the circumstance that likenesses of men and women can be so knocked about, without any pain or suffering.|[[Charles Dickens]]|Letter to Mary Tyler, 6 November 1849, from ''The [[Letters of Charles Dickens]] Vol V, 1847–1849''}}

An awareness of the prevalence of domestic abuse, and how Punch and Judy could be seen to make light of this, threatened Punch and Judy performances in the UK and other English-speaking countries for a time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Puppet show faces knockout punch? |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/502752.stm |accessdate=3 September 2008 |date=8 November 1999 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the show is having one of its cyclical recurrences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.punchandjudyworld.org/wwfbloggem/?itemid=134 |title=around the world with mr. punch » Silly-Season-On-Sea |publisher=Punchandjudyworld.org |date=14 August 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223201406/http://www.punchandjudyworld.org/wwfbloggem/?itemid=134 |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can now be seen in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Ireland]]—and also in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Puerto Rico]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]].

==Comedy==
Despite Punch’s unapologetic murders throughout the performances, it is still a comedy. The humour is aided by a few things. Rosalind Crone (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;1065) suggests that, since the puppets are carved from wood, their facial expressions cannot change, but are stuck in the same exaggerated pose, which helps to deter any sense of realism and to distance the audience.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006" /&gt; The use of the swazzle also helps to create humour, and that the swazzled sound of Punch's voice takes the cruelty out of Punch.&lt;ref&gt;Proschan, Frank (1981). "Puppet Voices and Interlocutors: Language in Folk Puppetry." ''The Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 94, No. 374, Folk Drama (Oct.–Dec. 1981), pp.527–555. The American Folklore Society.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crone, a third aspect that helped make the violence humorous was that Punch's violence toward his wife was prompted by her own violence toward him.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006" /&gt; In this aspect, he retains some of his previous hen-pecked persona. This would suggest that, since Punch was merely acting violently out of self-defence, it was okay. This is a possible explanation for the humour of his violence toward his wife, and even towards others who may have somehow "had it coming."&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006" /&gt; This suggestion better explains the humour of the violence toward the baby. Other characters that had to incur the wrath of Punch varied depending on the punchman, but the most common were the foreigner, the blind man, the publican, the constable, and the devil.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006"/&gt;

==Published scripts==
Punch is primarily an oral tradition, adapted by a succession of exponents from live performances rather than authentic scripts, and in constant evolution. There exist, however, some early published scripts of varying authenticity.

In 1828, the critic [[John Payne Collier]] published a Punch and Judy script under the title ''The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Punch and Judy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spyrock.com/nadafarm/html/punch_pdf.html |title=Punch &amp; Judy: 1832 Book pdf file |publisher=Spyrock.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was illustrated by the well-known caricaturist [[George Cruikshank]]. Collier said his script was based on the version performed by the "professor" Giovanni Piccini in the early 19th century, and Piccini himself had begun performing in the streets of London in the late 18th century. The Collier/Cruickshank ''Punch'' has been republished in facsimile several times. Collier's later career as a literary forger has cast some doubt on the authenticity of the script, which is rather literary in style and may well have been tidied up from the rough-and-tumble street-theatre original. 

A transcript of a typical Punch and Judy show in [[London]] of the 1840s can be found in [[Henry Mayhew]]'s ''London Labour and the London Poor''.

==Terminology==
The term draws a comparison with the [[mandala]] of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] [[Mount Meru|worldview]]; the comparison emphasises the radiation of power from each power center, as well as the non-physical basis of the system.

The terminology was revived two millenniums later as a result of Twentieth Century efforts to comprehend patterns of diffuse but coherent political power. [[Metaphors]] such as [[social anthropologist]] [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah|Tambiah]]'s idea of a "galactic polity",&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah|Tambiah, Stanley Jeyaraja]].

[[File:PIA07712 - F ring animation videoquality 6 framerate 5.ogv|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[natural satellite|moons]] [[Prometheus (moon)|Prometheus]] (right) and [[Pandora (moon)|Pandora]] orbit just inside and outside the [[Rings of Saturn#F ring|F ring]] of [[Saturn]], but only Prometheus is thought to function as a ring shepherd]]

A '''ring system''' is a disc or ring orbiting an [[astronomical object]] that is composed of solid material such as [[cosmic dust|dust]] and [[moonlet]]s, and is a common component of [[satellite system (astronomy)|satellite system]]s around giant planets. A ring system around a planet is also known as a '''planetary ring''' system.

The most prominent and most famous planetary rings in the [[Solar System]] are [[Rings of Saturn|those around Saturn]], but the other three [[giant planet]]s ([[Rings of Jupiter|Jupiter]], [[Rings of Uranus|Uranus]], and [[Rings of Neptune|Neptune]]) also have ring systems. Recent evidence suggests that ring systems may also be found around other types of astronomical objects, including minor planets, moons, and brown dwarfs.

== Ring systems of planets ==
[[File:Saturn in natural colors (captured by the Hubble Space Telescope).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The ring swirling around [[Saturn]] consists of chunks of ice and dust. The little dark spot on Saturn is the shadow from Saturn's moon [[Enceladus]].]]
There are three ways that thicker planetary rings (the rings around planets) have been proposed to have formed: from material of the [[protoplanetary disk]] that was within the [[Roche limit]] of the planet and thus could not coalesce to form moons, from the debris of a [[natural satellite|moon]] that was disrupted by a large impact, or from the debris of a moon that was disrupted by [[tidal stress]]es when it passed within the planet's Roche limit. Most rings were thought to be unstable and to dissipate over the course of tens or hundreds of millions of years, but it now appears that Saturn's rings might be quite old, dating to the early days of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 12, 2007|title=Saturn's Rings May Be Old Timers|publisher=NASA (News Release 2007-149)|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini20071212.html|accessdate=2008-04-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415131747/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini20071212.html|archivedate=April 15, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fainter planetary rings can form as a result of meteoroid impacts with moons orbiting around the planet or, in case of Saturn's E-ring, the ejecta of cryovolcanic material.&lt;ref name=Spahn&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spahn | first = F. | title = Cassini Dust Measurements at Enceladus and Implications for the Origin of the E Ring | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5766 | pages = 1416–8 | doi = 10.1126/science.1121375 | pmid = 16527969 | bibcode = 2006Sci...311.1416S | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Schmidt | first2 = J | last3 = Albers | first3 = N | last4 = Hörning | first4 = M | last5 = Makuch | first5 = M | last6 = Seiss | first6 = M | last7 = Kempf | first7 = S | last8 = Srama | first8 = R | last9 = Dikarev | first9 = V | year = 2006 | url = http://www.igpp.ucla.edu/public/mkivelso/refs/PUBLICATIONS/1121375Spahn.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170809130224/http://www.igpp.ucla.edu/public/mkivelso/refs/PUBLICATIONS/1121375Spahn.pdf | archivedate = 2017-08-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Porco Helfenstein et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1123013| last1 = Porco| first1 = C.

The composition of ring particles varies; they may be silicate or icy dust. Larger rocks and boulders may also be present, and in 2007 [[tidal]] effects from eight 'moonlets' only a few hundred meters across were detected within Saturn's rings. The maximum size of a ring particle is determined by the [[specific strength]] of the material it is made of, its density, and the tidal force at its altitude. The tidal force is proportional to the average density inside the radius of the ring, or to the mass of the planet divided by the radius of the ring cubed. It is also inversely proportional to the square of the orbital period of the ring.

{{anchor|shepherds}}Sometimes rings will have [[Shepherd moon|"'''shepherd'''" '''moons''']], small [[Natural satellite|moons]] that orbit near the inner or outer edges of rings or within gaps in the rings. The [[gravity]] of shepherd moons serves to maintain a sharply defined edge to the ring; material that drifts closer to the shepherd moon's orbit is either deflected back into the body of the ring, ejected from the system, or accreted onto the moon itself.

It is also predicted that [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]], a moon of Mars, will break up and form into a planetary ring in about 50 million years, because its low orbit with an orbital period that is shorter than a Martian day is decaying due to [[tidal deceleration]].&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite journal|first=K.

===Saturn===
{{main|Rings of Saturn}}
Saturn's rings are the most extensive ring system of any planet in the Solar System, and thus have been known to exist for quite some time. [[Galileo Galilei]] first observed them in 1610, but they were not accurately described as a disk around Saturn until [[Christiaan Huygens]] did so in 1655.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solarviews.com/eng/saturnbg.htm|title=Historical Background of Saturn's Rings|website=www.solarviews.com|access-date=2016-06-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AckPhClE?url=http://www.solarviews.com/eng/saturnbg.htm|archivedate=2012-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With help from the NASA/ESA/ASI [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] mission, a further understanding of the ring formation and active movement was understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/indepth|title=Cassini - In Depth {{!}} Missions - NASA Solar System Exploration|website=NASA Solar System Exploration|access-date=2017-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213164556/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/indepth|archivedate=2017-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rings are not a series of tiny ringlets as many think, but are more of a disk with varying density.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-007-5606-9_7|title=Planetary Rings|last=Tiscareno|first=Matthew S.|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789400756052|editor-last=Oswalt|editor-first=Terry D.|pages=309–375|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5606-9_7|editor-last2=French|editor-first2=Linda M.|editor-last3=Kalas|editor-first3=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consist mostly of water ice and trace amounts of [[Rock (geology)|rock]], and the particles range in size from micrometers to meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciclops.org/sci/common_questions.php#ring|title=Questions about Saturn's rings|last=Porco|first=Carolyn|authorlink=Carolyn Porco|date=|website=CICLOPS web site|publisher=|access-date=2012-10-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003073842/http://www.ciclops.org/sci/common_questions.php#ring|archivedate=2012-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are dark and likely consist of water ice and some radiation-processed [[Organic compound|organics]]. The relative lack of dust is due to [[aerodynamic drag]] from the extended [[exosphere]]-[[Uranus|corona]] of Uranus.

===Neptune===
{{main|Rings of Neptune}}
The system around Neptune consists of five principal rings that, at their densest, are comparable to the low-density regions of Saturn's rings. However, they are faint and dusty, much more similar in structure to those of Jupiter. The very dark material that makes up the rings is likely organics processed by [[radiation]], like in the rings of Uranus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=B.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that Saturn's moon [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] may have [[Rings of Rhea|its own tenuous ring system]], which would make it the only moon known to have a ring system. A later study published in 2010 revealed that imaging of Rhea by the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' spacecraft]] was inconsistent with the predicted properties of the rings, suggesting that some other mechanism is responsible for the magnetic effects that had led to the ring hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Matthew S. | last1 = Tiscareno | first2 = Joseph A. | last2 = Burns | first3 = Jeffrey N. | last3 = Cuzzi | first4 = Matthew M. | last4 = Hedman | title = Cassini imaging search rules out rings around Rhea | date = 2010 | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 37 | issue = 14 | pages = L14205 | doi = 10.1029/2010GL043663 | bibcode = 2010GeoRL..3714205T |arxiv = 1008.1764 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, this possibility has been ruled out by ''[[New Horizons]]'', which would have detected any such ring system.

===Chariklo===
'''[[10199 Chariklo]]''', a [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaur]], was the first minor planet discovered to have rings. It has [[Rings of Chariklo|two rings]], perhaps due to a collision that caused a chain of debris to orbit it. The rings were discovered when astronomers observed Chariklo passing in front of the star [[UCAC4 248-108672]] on June 3, 2013 from seven locations in South America. While watching, they saw two dips in the star's apparent brightness just before and after the occultation. Because this event was observed at multiple locations, the conclusion that the dip in brightness was in fact due to rings is unanimously the leading hypothesis. The observations revealed what is likely a {{convert|19|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}}-wide ring system that is about 1,000 times closer than the Moon is to Earth. In addition, astronomers suspect there could be a moon orbiting amidst the ring debris. If these rings are the leftovers of a collision as astronomers suspect, this would give fodder to the idea that moons (such as the Moon) form through collisions of smaller bits of material. Chariklo's rings have not been officially named, but the discoverers have nicknamed them Oiapoque and Chuí, after two rivers near the northern and southern ends of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=March 2014|title=Surprise!

Their changing appearance at different viewing angles can explain the long-term variation in Chiron's brightness over time.&lt;ref name = "Ortiz2015"/&gt;

Ring systems may form around centaurs when they are [[Tidal force|tidally disrupted]] in a close encounter (within 0.4 to 0.8 times the [[Roche limit]]) with a giant planet. (By definition, a centaur is a minor planet whose orbit crosses the orbit(s) of one or more giant planets.) For a [[Planetary differentiation|differentiated body]] approaching a giant planet at an initial relative velocity of 3−6&amp;nbsp;km/s with an initial rotational period of 8 hours, a ring mass of 0.1%−10% of the centaur's mass is predicted. Ring formation from an undifferentiated body is less likely. The rings would be composed mostly or entirely of material from the parent body's icy mantle. After forming, the ring would spread laterally, leading to satellite formation from whatever portion of it spreads beyond the centaur's Roche Limit. Satellites could also form directly from the disrupted icy mantle. This formation mechanism predicts that roughly 10% of centaurs will have experienced potentially ring-forming encounters with giant planets.&lt;ref name="Hyodo2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Hyodo|first1=R.|last2= Charnoz|first2=S.|last3= Genda|first3=H.|last4= Ohtsuki|first4=K.|title=Formation of Centaurs’ Rings Through Their Partial Tidal Disruption During Planetary Encounters|journal= [[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume= 828|issue= 1|date= 2016-08-29|pages= L8|doi= 10.3847/2041-8205/828/1/L8 |arxiv= 1608.03509|bibcode = 2016ApJ...828L...8H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rings around exoplanets ==
Because all [[giant planet]]s of the Solar System have rings, the existence of [[exoplanet]]s with rings is plausible. Although particles of [[ice]], the material that is predominant in the [[rings of Saturn]], can only exist around planets beyond the [[Frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], within this line rings consisting of rocky material can be stable in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|author=Hilke E. Schlichting, Philip Chang|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=734|issue=2|pages=117|title=Warm Saturns: On the Nature of Rings around Extrasolar Planets that Reside Inside the Ice Line|arxiv=1104.3863 |year=2011|bibcode = 2011ApJ...734..117S |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/734/2/117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such ring systems can be detected for planets observed by the [[transit method]] by additional reduction of the light of the central star if their opacity is sufficient. As of January 2015, no such observations are known.

A sequence of occultations of the star [[1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6]] observed in 2007 over 56 days was interpreted as a transit of a ring system of a (not directly observed) [[substellar companion]] dubbed “J1407b”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matthew A. Kenworthy, Eric E. Mamajek|title=Modeling giant extrasolar ring systems in eclipse and the case of J1407b: sculpting by exomoons?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=800|issue=2|pages=126|arxiv=1501.05652 |year=2015|bibcode = 2015ApJ...800..126K |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/800/2/126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ring system is attributed a radius of about 90 million km (about 200 times that of Saturn's rings). In press releases, the term '''''super-Saturn''''' was dubbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Feltman|work=The Washington Post|title=This planet's rings make Saturn look puny|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/01/26/this-planets-rings-make-saturn-look-puny/|date=2015-01-26|accessdate=2015-01-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127132726/http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/01/26/this-planets-rings-make-saturn-look-puny/|archivedate=2015-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the age of this stellar system is only about 16 million years, which suggests that this structure, if real, is more like a [[protoplanetary disk]] rather than a stable ring system in an evolved [[planetary system]].

[[Fomalhaut b]] was found to be large and unclearly defined when detected in 2008. This may either be due to a cloud of dust attracted from the dust disc of the star, or a possible ring system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0811.1994 |journal=Science |volume=322 |issue=5906 |pages=1345 |last1=Kalas |first1=Paul |title=Optical Images of an Exosolar Planet 25 Light-Years from Earth |last2=Graham |first2=James R |last3=Chiang |first3=Eugene |last4=Fitzgerald |first4=Michael P |last5=Clampin |first5=Mark |last6=Kite |first6=Edwin S |last7=Stapelfeldt |first7=Karl |last8=Marois |first8=Christian |last9=Krist |first9=John |year=2008 |doi=10.1126/science.1166609 |pmid=19008414 |bibcode=2008Sci...322.1345K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seriousness''' (noun; adjective: '''''serious''''') is an attitude of [[gravitas|gravity]], [[:wikt:solemnity|solemnity]], persistence, and [[:wikt:earnest|earnest]]ness toward something considered to be of [[importance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Seriousness ''Seriousness'', The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable philosophers and commentators have criticised excessive seriousness, while others have praised it.&lt;ref name=PSB&gt;''The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings'', Perry Miller, Thomas Herbert Johnson, p. 59, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-fBB7uGjYoC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=puritanism+seriousness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qzRHytADSW&amp;sig=RG6-211MUe3bFbUmGHR_HD8WSMY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0OVZTeObI4P2tgO11-WoCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=serious&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SS&gt;''"Spirit of Seriousness"'', The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, NICHOLAS BUNNIN and JIYUAN YU, editors, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679520_ss1-185]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BN&gt;''Being and Nothingness'', Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;''Joseph Adler on Seriousness'', Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you- thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS&gt;''"High Seriousness"'', ''Historicism Once More: Problems and Occasions for the American Scholar'', NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Spring, 1971), pp. 283–286, Roy Harvey Pearce, George Levine, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1345129]&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness is often contrasted with [[comedy]], as in the [[seriocomedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;''Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, SAMMY and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz'', The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D.

== Philosophical attitudes toward seriousness ==

=== Praise for "high seriousness" in scholarship and poetry ===
Some use "seriousness" as a term of praise for scholarship or in literary review.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; 19th century [[poet]], [[cultural critic]], and [[literary critic]], [[Matthew Arnold]] said that the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were "high truth" and "high seriousness".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Pater, Wilde, and the Object as in Themselves They See It, Wendell V. Harris, Studies in English Literature, 1500–1900, Vol. 11, No. 4, Nineteenth Century (Autumn, 1971), pp. 733–747&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophical disdain for seriousness ===
Many have expressed an attitude of disdain toward taking things too seriously, as opposed to viewing things with an attitude of humor. Poet, playwright, and philosopher [[Joseph Addison]] said that being serious is dull, "we are growing serious, and let me tell you, that's the next step to being dull."&lt;ref name= JA/&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you-thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt; Political satirist [[P.J. O'Rourke]] said that "Seriousness is stupidity sent to college."&lt;ref&gt;[http://quotationsbook.com/quote/35911/ ''P. J. O'Rourke on Seriousness'', Quotations Book]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigram]]ist, poet, and playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] said that "life is too important to be taken seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary-quotes.com/life-is-too-important-to-be-taken-seriously-oscar-wilde/ ''Seriously Oscar Wild", Dictionary of Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt; In a play on words, novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] indicated that the ''central serious conviction in life'' is that nothing should be taken with too much seriousness, "the one serious conviction that a man should have is that nothing is to be taken too seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famous-quotes.com/topic.php?tid=1109 ''Samuel Butler on Seriousness'', Book of Famous Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[ascetic]] or [[puritan]] religious sects, an attitude of seriousness is always to be taken, and [[solemnity]], [[sobriety]], and puritanism with its hostility to social pleasures and indulgences are the only acceptable attitudes. [[Perry Miller]], "the master of American intellectual history", wrote of excessive seriousness of the [[Puritan]]s, "simple humanity cries at last for some relief from the interminable high seriousness of the Puritan code."&lt;ref name=PSB/&gt;

==== The "spirit of seriousness" in existential philosophy ====
{{Further|Bad faith (existentialism)}}
[[Existentialist]] philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] called the "spirit of seriousness’’ the belief that there is an objective and independent goodness in things for people to discover, and that this belief leads to [[bad faith]]. He argued that people forget that values are not absolute, but are contingent and subjectively determined.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;&lt;ref name=BN/&gt; In Sartre’s words, "the spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] ‘'[[:wikt:given|given]]s’’,  independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of ‘desirable’ from the [[ontological]] structure of things to their simple material constitution."&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

== Seriousness and comedy ==
{{Further|Seriocomedy}}
Seriousness is sometimes contrasted with the [[comedy|comical]] in [[humor]]. In the [[performing arts]] and [[literature]], the [[seriocomedy]] is a [[genre]] which blends seriousness with the comical, [[drama]] with [[comedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz, The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D. Chaston, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/lion_and_the_unicorn/v025/25.1chaston01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Comedy: The Development of Modern Comic Tragedy'', J. L. Styan, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=w1DNaVCV2YgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=seriousness+comedy&amp;ots=Mzl7_hDgkX&amp;sig=wIco2kXThh47fgLYqg2vzSBNVv0#v=onepage&amp;q=seriousness%20comedy&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and detection ==

=== Detecting presence and absence of seriousness in humor ===
{{Further|Theory of humor}}
In the [[theory of humor]], one must have a [[sense of humor]] and a sense of seriousness to distinguish what is supposed to be taken literally or not. An even more keen sense is needed when humor is used to make a serious point.&lt;ref name=SRF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''When Congress makes a joke: Congressional Humor as Serious and Purposeful Communication'', International Journal of Humor Research. Volume 14, Issue 4, Pages 359–394, Nov 2004, Dean L. Yarwood&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have studied how humor is intended to be taken as having seriousness, as when court jesters used humor to convey serious information.&lt;ref name=NSIH&gt;''Negotiating the Serious Import of Humor'', Sociometry, Vol. 32, No. 2 (Jun., 1969), pp. 169–181, Joan P. Emerson&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, when humor is not intended to be taken seriously, [[Taste (sociology)|bad taste]] in humor may cross a line after which it is taken seriously, though not intended.&lt;ref name=NSIH/&gt;

=== Detecting degree of seriousness in developmental psychology ===
{{Further|Educational psychology}}
In [[Developmental psychology]] and [[educational psychology]], seriousness is studied as it relates to how children develop an ability to distinguish levels of seriousness as it relates to transgressions and expenditure of time; for example, a child must learn to distinguish between levels of seriousness in admonitions such as between "don't fidget" and "don't forget to look both ways when crossing the street", which have the same linguistic and normative structure, but different levels of seriousness.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;&lt;ref name=PMJ&gt;''"regarding the seriousness... their ability to understand the reality-fantasy distinction"'', ''Preschoolers' Moral Judgments: Distinctions Between Realistic and Cartoon-Fantasy Transgressions'', Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Interaction design and children: building a community, 2004, Kristen M. Peters, Fran C. Blumberg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring degree of seriousness in crime ===
{{Further|Punishment|Felony|Misdemeanor}}
The degree of seriousness of crimes is an important factor relating to crime. One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. A [[felony]] is generally considered to be a crime of "high seriousness", while a [[misdemeanor]] is not.

In [[criminal law]] the degree of seriousness is considered when meting out punishment to fit the crime, and in considering to what extent overcrowded prison facilities will be used.&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Justice – The Choice of Punishments'', A VONHIRSCH'', 1976, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness of a crime is a major factor in considerations of the allocation of scarce [[law enforcement]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminology'', Larry J. Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Economic Analysis of the Criminal Law as Preference-Shaping Policy'', Duke Law Journal, Feb 1990, Vol. 1, Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1372651]&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning and measurement of seriousness is a major concern in [[public policy]] considerations.  A quantitative scoring system called the "seriousness score" has been developed for use in allocating law enforcement resources and sentencing.&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;

As to England and Wales, see section 143 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].

=== Medical triage ===
Degrees of seriousness are used in medicine to make decisions about care. Seriousness is related to the effects of delaying or not having medical care. In an emergency hospital, the [[triage]] nurse must evaluate levels of seriousness of medical emergencies and rank them to determine order of care. Seriousness of illness is used to make decisions as to whether to perform invasive procedures such as surgery.

==== Measuring crime seriousness in the media ====
There is a [[positive correlation]] between the degree of seriousness of a crime and viewer ratings of news coverage.&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;

=== Cultural variation in measurement and detection ===
What is considered serious varies widely across cultures and is studied in [[sociology]], [[cultural anthropology]], and [[criminology]]; being of the wrong religious faith may be considered a serious crime in some cultures; smoking marijuana may be a serious crime in some cultures and not others; homosexuality a serious crime in some cultures; and prostitution is a serious crime in some cultures.&lt;ref name=CRCC/&gt; Perception of seriousness is measured in assessing varying cultural perceptions on health risks.&lt;ref&gt;''Explaining Risk Perception: An Evaluation of the Psychometric Paradigm in Risk Perception Research'', Lennart Sjöberg, Bjørg-Elin Moen, Torbjørn Rundmo, [http://www.paul-hadrien.info/backup/LSE/IS%20490/Sjoberg%20Psychometric_paradigm.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MarsLander2.JPG|thumb|[[NASA]]'s Phoenix Mars Lander]]
In [[archaeology]], '''space archaeology''' is the research-based study of various human-made items found in space, their interpretation as clues to the adventures mankind has experienced in space, and their preservation as cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=Archaeology&gt;{{cite journal|last=Capelotti|first=P.J.|title=Space: The Final [Archaeological] Frontier|journal=Archaeology|date=November–December 2004|volume=57| issue = 6|url=http://www.archaeology.org/0411/etc/space.html|accessdate=3 June 2012|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes launch complexes on Earth, orbital debris, satellites, and objects and structures on other celestial bodies such as Mars. It also includes the applied field of cultural resource which evaluates the significance of space sites and objects in terms of national and international preservation laws. Cultural resource looks at what, how and why these artifacts of our recent history should be preserved for future generations.

==Satellites==
Satellites are key artifacts in examining human encounters with space over time and the effect we leave through artificial objects. This list includes:
* [[Vanguard 1]] - Launched in 1958, the manmade satellite Vanguard 1 and the upper stage of its launch rocket are the oldest still in orbit. Vanguard 1 lost communication in 1964 but had a few different functions, including the obtention of geodetic measurements and the testing of capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1958-002B] NASA. NASA, n.d. Web. 26 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Asterix-1]] - With the intention of testing the French Diamant Rocket, Asterix-1 was the first French satellite launched into space. Asterix-1 had a very short lived transmission period of 2 days but remains in orbit and is expected to for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spacearchaeology.org/] Space Archaeology." Space Archaeology. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Skynet 1A]] - Providing communication to Middle Eastern forces, Skynet 1A was launched over the Indian Ocean in 1969. No longer in operation, Skynet 1A has an approximate lifetime of more than 1 million years.&lt;ref name="Space Archaeology 2015"&gt;Space Archaeology." Space Archaeology. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kosmos 2222]] - With the intended function of identifying ballistic missiles launches, Cosmos-2222 was launched in 1992. With an operation life of 4 years, Cosmos and its rocket body remain in orbit today.&lt;ref name="Space Archaeology 2015"/&gt;

Satellites are just one example of several human traces we leave behind in, and out of this world.

==Legal matters==
{{Main|Space law}}
{{See also|Common heritage of mankind}}
The complexities and ambiguities of international legal structures to deal with these sites as cultural resources leave them vulnerable to impacts in the near future by many varieties of space travel. An outline of the legal situation was made by [[Harrison Schmitt]] and [[Neil Armstrong]], both of them astronauts who walked on the moon as part of the [[Apollo program]].&lt;ref name=Armstrong&gt;{{cite book |title=Return to the Moon |author1=Harrison H. Schmitt |author2=Neil Armstrong |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g06vVWEW2mgC&amp;pg=PA280 |pages=280''ff'' |isbn=0-387-24285-6 |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governing law on the Moon and other celestial bodies is the ''Outer Space Treaty'' of 1967 based upon guidelines from experience in the Antarctic. Another source of ideas is the ''Law of the Sea''. The ''Outer Space Treaty'' contains language stating that space objects remain under the jurisdiction of the originating state, and the civil and criminal laws of that state govern private parties both on the Moon and ''events leading up to such activity''. State parties are to inform the public about the nature and result of their activities.

The later ''Moon Agreement'' of 1979 was signed but not ratified by many spacefaring nations. Schmitt and Armstrong believe this lack of ratification relates to disagreement over wording such as "the Moon and its natural resources are the [[common heritage of mankind]]", which is taken as possibly excluding private activity, and objections to wording concerning the disruption of the existing environment.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
&lt;!-- For an extensive discussion see Schmitt and Armstrong.&lt;ref name=Armstrong/&gt; For the treaty text see [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/peace/docs/treatyouterspace.html UN treaty on outer space of 1967]. --&gt;

A non-profit organization called [[For All Moonkind, Inc.]] is working to establish legal protections for archaeological sites in outer space.  The entirely volunteer group includes space lawyers and policymakers from around the world.  As a result of their efforts, the [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]] agreed, in January 2018, to consider the creation of a "universal space heritage sites program.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNCOPUOS|title=Draft Declaration|url=http://www.unoosa.org/res/oosadoc/data/documents/2018/aac_105c_12018crp/aac_105c_12018crp_6_0_html/AC105_C1_2018_CRP06E.pdf|website=unoosa.org|publisher=UNOOSA|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having created a discussion around preservation in outer space, For All Moonkind is now focused on preparing drafts of implementing regulations and protocols.

==Background and history==
During a graduate seminar at New Mexico State University in 1999, Ralph Gibson asked: "Does federal preservation law apply on the moon?" That question led to Gibson's thesis "''Lunar Archaeology: The Application of Federal Historic Preservation Law to the Site where Humans first set foot upon the Moon''", to a grant from the New Mexico Space Grant Consortium, and to creation of the Lunar Legacy Project.&lt;ref&gt;http://spacegrant.nmsu.edu/lunarlegacies/&lt;/ref&gt;

A manuscript by scientists at [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] in 2004 raised the possibility of preserving Apollo landing sites for future "astroarcheologists."&lt;ref name="Glavin et al. 2004"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glavin et al. (2004) Int. J. Astrobio. 3, 265-271.|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/S1473550404001958#}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Dr. O’Leary with New Mexico State Historic Preservation Officer Katherine Slick and the [[New Mexico Museum of Space History]] (NMMSH), documented the [[Apollo 11]] Tranquility Base archaeological site on the Moon.&lt;ref name=Newsletter&gt;[http://lib.nmsu.edu/aboutlib/newsletter/sept02.pdf New Mexico State University Newsletter].&lt;/ref&gt; Some legal aspects of this work already have surfaced.&lt;ref name=Oleary&gt;[http://spacegrant.nmsu.edu/lunarlegacies/lunar_archaeology.pdf Applicability of federal historic preservation law]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though its mission isn't primarily archaeological, the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] has imaged all of the Apollo landing sites as well as rediscovering the location of the first [[Lunokhod 1]] rover, lost since 1971 (note: all of the U. S. flags left on the moon during the Apollo missions were found to still be standing, with the exception of the one left during the Apollo 11 mission, which was blown over during that mission's lift-off from the lunar surface and return to the mission command module in lunar orbit; the degree to which these flags are preserved and intact remains unknown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/620-Question-Answered!.html |title=Question Answered! |last=Robinson |first=Mark |date=27 July 2012 |work=LROC News System |publisher=[[Arizona State University]] |accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on an idea by British amateur astronomer Nick Howes, a team of experts has been assembled to try to locate the [[Lunar Module]] of the [[Apollo 10]] mission nicknamed "Snoopy", which was released during the mission and is currently thought to be in a [[heliocentric orbit]].&lt;ref name=redorbit.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronomy Team Looking For Lost ‘Snoopy’ Module From Apollo 10|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1112391824/astronomy-team-looking-for-lost-snoopy-module-from-apollo-10/|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Snoopy mission is encouraged by the 2002 re-sighting of the [[Apollo 12]] third-stage rocket.&lt;ref name=redorbit.com/&gt;

'''Taplow Court''' is a large [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] house in the village of [[Taplow]]  in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]], which has served as the national headquarters for the [[Soka Gakkai International]] of the United Kingdom (SGI-UK) since 1988.

==Locale==
The [[Taplow burial]], a 7th-century [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] burial mound, is in the grounds of the house, near the [[parish church]] which is scenically positioned  on a hill directly above [[Maidenhead Bridge]] and the town's riverside district. The mound was excavated in 1883 and a number of treasures were discovered, of quality of the early Saxon centuries surpassed only by [[Sutton Hoo]] in 1939.

==Manor House==
There has been a manor house on the site since before the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066. The manor was owned by the monks at [[Merton Priory]] until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. It was then owned by the [[Hampson Baronets|Hampson family]] in the 17th century, coming under attack during the [[English Civil War]]. Throughout  the 18th century and through to the 1850s, Taplow Court was home to the [[George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Earl and Countess of Orkney]] who has also owned the adjacent [[Cliveden]].

===19th Century Rebuilding===
From 1852, Taplow Court became the home of the Grenfell family, purchased by [[Charles Pascoe Grenfell]] in August of that year.&lt;ref name="Sheahan1862"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheahan|first=James Joseph|title=History and topography of Buckinghamshire: comprising a general survey of the county, preceded by an epitome of the early history of Great Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9oWAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA852|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=1862|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts|isbn=978-0-8048-3390-5|page=852}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family had it rebuilt in 1855, as it is dated, etched into the masonry. The exterior in an early [[Tudor architecture|Tudor style]] and the interior (with its central glazed hall rising the full height of the house) in [[Romanesque architecture]]. A [[listed building]] in the starting category of Grade II, it is built of red brick partly dressed in light stone and has a slate roof, has four storeys with 2 stone [[stringcourse]]s carried round the building as drip moulds over the windows. It has a central projection with a porch. Here its heavy oak door is set in recess with a [[Norman architecture|Norman style arch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1165286|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:taplow court inside.jpg|thumb|An interior room at Taplow Court]]

It was inherited in 1867 by his grandson [[William Grenfell, 1st Baron Desborough]] where a prominent social role was also played by [[Ethel Fane|his wife Ettie]].&lt;ref name=ettie&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/ettie-by-richard-davenport-hines-1785255.html Ettie], book review, The Independent, Retrieved 1 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Their son was war poet [[Julian Grenfell]].  They prominently hosted an aristocratic and elite group known as "[[the Souls]]" at the house. Visitors included [[Henry Irving]], [[Vita Sackville-West]], [[Edward VII]] when [[Prince of Wales]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Patrick Shaw-Stewart|Patrick Shaw Stewart]], [[Edith Wharton]] and [[Oscar Wilde]].

A [[stické]] court was built by Lord Desborough at Taplow Court in 1892 and the dimension of this court subsequently became the standard size of the court.

After [[World War II]], Taplow Court was owned by British Telecommunications Research, a subsidiary of [[Plessey|Plessey Electronics]] until 1988 when it became a [[Soka Gakkai International]] Buddhist centre.

As the Clarence B.

A fan of the overall series of [[The Great Courses]] is [[Bill Gates]], who said the courses have "incredible professors" who cover "every topic that you can think of".&lt;ref name="TIME-20180104"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gates |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Gates |title=The 4 Learning Hacks Bill Gates Swears By |url=http://time.com/5066247/bill-gates-learning-hacks/ |date=4 January 2018 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=9 May 2018 |quote=... One of my favorite sources for interesting lectures is The Teaching Company. They get incredible professors to teach courses on pretty much every topic you can think of.

The '''unity of science''' is a thesis in [[philosophy of science]] that says that all the sciences form a unified whole.

==Overview==
Even though, for example, [[physics]] and [[sociology]] are distinct disciplines, the thesis of the unity of science says that in principle they must be part of a unified intellectual endeavor: science. The unity of science thesis is usually associated with the view of levels of organization in nature, where physics is the most basic, [[chemistry]] the level above physics, [[biology]] above chemistry, sociology above biology, and so forth. Further, [[Cell (biology)|cells]], [[organism]]s, and [[culture]]s are all biological, but they represent three different levels of biological organization.

It has also been suggested (for example, in [[Jean Piaget]]'s 1918 work ''Recherche'') that the unity of science can be considered in terms of a circle of the sciences, where logic is the foundation for mathematics, which is the foundation for mechanics and physics, and physics is the foundation for chemistry, which is the foundation for biology, which is the foundation for sociology, the moral sciences, psychology, and the theory of knowledge, and the theory of knowledge is based on logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website=www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch|title=Recherche|last=Piaget|first=Jean|authorlink=Jean Piaget|date=2006|origyear=1918|access-date=9 February 2017|url=http://www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch/fjp/site/textes/VE/JP_18_Recherche.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesis of a unity of science simply says that common scientific laws apply everywhere and on all levels of organization.  On some levels of organization, the scientists there will call these laws by another name, or emphasize the importance of one over another.  For example, thermodynamics or the laws of energy seem to be universal across a number of disciplines.  That is almost certainly because nearly all systems in nature operate using transactions in energy.  However, this does not rule out the possibility of some laws being particular to specific domains of inquiry—perhaps characterized by increasing complexity of those domains, as suggested by Henriques' (2003) [[tree of knowledge system]] that proposes four degrees of complexity (Matter, Life, Mind, and Culture). Of course, his tree might equally be a circle, with culture necessarily framing people's understanding of matter.

Science is a human endeavor, a part of human culture.  It is unified in the sense that it is understood as a single endeavor, and there are no scientists studying alternative realities. To the extent that they do, however, one could argue that they are not unified. It is the perception of a single reality that results in a unity of science.

Separately, science is also apparently on a path toward simplification or actually a "universalization" of discrete scientific theories about energy that physicists call unification. This has led to several theory among which [[string theory]], and is probably related to the notion that, at bottom, there is only the energy that was released in the big bang, and really nothing else. 
 
The unity of science thesis is most famously clarified and tentatively argued for by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]'s [[General System Theory]], Sir Jagdish Chandra Bos ,[[Paul Oppenheim]] and [[Hilary Putnam]]. It is most famously argued against by [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Dupre]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]].

The '''''Zone Rouge''''' (English: '''Red Zone''') is a chain of non-contiguous areas throughout northeastern [[France]] that the French government isolated after the [[First World War]]. The land, which originally covered more than {{convert|1200|km2|sqmi}}, was deemed too physically and environmentally damaged by conflict for human habitation. Rather than attempt to immediately clean up the former battlefields, the land was allowed to return to nature. Restrictions within the ''zone rouge'' still exist today although the control areas have been greatly reduced.

The ''zone rouge'' was defined just after the war as "Completely devastated. Damage to properties: 100%. Damage to Agriculture: 100%. Impossible to clean. Human life impossible".&lt;ref name=nogo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.messynessychic.com/2015/05/26/the-real-no-go-zone-of-france-a-forbidden-no-mans-land-poisoned-by-war/|title=The Real "No-Go Zone" of France: A Forbidden No Man's Land Poisoned by War|date=26 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under French law, activities such as [[housing]], [[Agriculture|farming]] or [[forestry]] were temporarily or permanently forbidden in the ''zone rouge''. This was because of the vast amounts of human and animal remains and millions of items of [[unexploded ordnance]] contaminating the land. Some towns and villages were never permitted to be rebuilt after the war.

==Main dangers==
The area is saturated with [[unexploded ordnance|unexploded shells]] (including many gas shells), [[grenades]], and rusty ammunition. Soils were heavily polluted by [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[chlorine]], [[arsenic]], various dangerous gases, acids, and human and animal remains.&lt;ref name=nogo/&gt; The area was also littered with ammunition depots and chemical plants.

Each year dozens of tons of unexploded shells are recovered. According to the Sécurité Civile agency in charge, at the current rate no fewer than 700 more years will be needed to clean the area completely. Some experiments conducted in 2005–06 discovered up to 300 shells/{{formatnum:10000}} m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the top 15&amp;nbsp;cm of soil in the worst areas.&lt;ref name=nogo/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2016}}

Some areas where 99% of all plants still die remain off limits (for example two small pieces of land close to [[Ypres]] and [[Woëvre]]), as arsenic constitutes up to 176&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of soil samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-09-01|title=Exposure assessment of a burning ground for chemical ammunition on the Great War battlefields of Verdun|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969707004986|journal=Science of the Total Environment|language=en|volume=382|issue=2-3|pages=259–271|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.04.029|issn=0048-9697}}&lt;/ref&gt;
