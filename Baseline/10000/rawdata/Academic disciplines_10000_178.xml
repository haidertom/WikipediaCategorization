      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5129">The '''American Association for the Promotion of Social Science''' (est.1865) was founded in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], by several high-profile academics. Officers in the first years of the society included [[William Barton Rogers|William B. Rogers]], [[Thomas Hill (clergyman)|Thomas Hill]], [[George S. Boutwell]], [[Francis Lieber]], [[Erastus Otis Haven|Erastus O. Haven]], Mary Eliot Parkman, David A. Wells, [[Emory Washburn]], [[Caroline Healey Dall]], [[Samuel Eliot]], [[Franklin Benjamin Sanborn|F. B. Sanborn]], Joseph White, George Walker, Theodore W. Dwight, and James J.

In 1865 the group intended "to aid the development of social science, and to guide the public mind to the best practical means of promoting the amendment of laws, the advancement of education, the prevention and repression of crime, the reformation of criminals, and the progress of public morality, the adoption of sanitary regulations, and the diffusion of sound principles on questions of economy, trade, and finance. It will give attention to pauperism, and the topics related thereto ; including the responsibility of the well-endowed and successful, the wise and educated, the honest and respectable, for the failures of others. It will aim to bring together the various societies and individuals now interested in these objects, for the purpose of obtaining by discussion the real elements of truth; by which doubts are removed, conflicting opinions harmonized, and a common ground afforded for treating wisely the great social problems of the day."&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt;

The society divided itself into departments of inquiry (education; health; jurisprudence; economy, trade and finance) and laid out research questions to guide collection of the most pertinent "data required." The questions proposed for research reflected key issues of the time in American society: national debt and a national currency; taxation and revenue; labor and capital; hasty and excessive legislation; crime and punishment; the province of law in regard to education, public  health, and social morals; education of neglected and vicious children; relative value of classical and scientific instruction in schools and colleges; fine arts in education and industry; half-time system of instruction; quarantine considered in its relation to cholera; the tenement house; inspection of food and drugs; pork as an article of food; sewerage of great cities; and management of hospitals and insane asylums."&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt;

Meetings took place in Boston at the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]] (Oct. 1865) and the [[Lowell Institute]] (Dec. 1865);&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt; and in New York at the YMCA on 5th Ave. (Nov. 1867).&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, Nov. 20, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 the group joined with the "Boston Social Science Association" to form a joint committee called the "[[American Social Science Association]]" (ASSA);&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt; the committee met in Boston's [[Old City Hall (Boston)|city hall]] to discuss school reform and other matters.

The '''Ateliers d'Art Sacré''' (Studios of Sacred Art) was an artistic movement based in Paris in the first half of the 20th century that aimed to create church art that avoided the artificiality of traditional academic or realist work.

==Foundation==

The Ateliers d'Art Sacré were founded on 5 November 1919 after [[World War I]] (1914-18) by [[Maurice Denis]] (1870–1943) and [[Georges Desvallières]] (1861–1950) as part of a broad movement in Europe to reconcile the church with modern civilization.{{sfn|Rinuy|2002}}
Their aim was to train artists and crafts people in the practice of Christian art and to provide tasteful religious works of traditional and modern style to churches, particularly those that had been devastated by the war.{{sfn|Lebée|2014}}
Denis said that he was against academic art because it sacrificed emotion to convention and artifice, and was against realism because it was prose and he wanted music. Above all he wanted beauty, which was an attribute of divinity.{{sfn|Rossi|2010}}

==Activities==

The artists were largely involved in decoration of the [[Église Saint-Esprit (Paris)|Église Saint-Esprit]] in Paris, where the iconography shows the milestones in church history.
In this church, built in 1928-35 by the architect [[Paul Tournon]], murals were painted by forty artists including Maurice Denis, Georges Desvallières, [[Henri Marret]], Jean Dupa, Pauline Peugniez and  [[Robert Poughéon]].
In the Way of the Cross of Saint-Michel de Picpus, decorated in 1934 under the direction of Henri de Maistre, the personality of the artists was effaced for the sake of the collaborative work.{{sfn|Lebée|2014}}
The number of church commissions for the Ateliers was not enough for them to survive.{{sfn|Rossi|2010}}

The Dominican [[Marie-Alain Couturier]] (1897–1954) was a member of the Ateliers. 
He argued that a masterpiece, even if made by a non-believer, would always be more effective than a religious work of lesser value.{{sfn|Dekoninck|Trémolières|2010|p=9}}
He gradually moved away from the influence of Maurice Denis, his master, and developed an admiration for [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]].{{sfn|Rossi|2010}}
The Canadian painter [[Jean Dallaire]] (1916–1965) was another artist who joined the Ateliers, but then became interested in Picasso and the surrealists.{{sfn|Jean Dallaire, Musée des beaux-arts du Canada}}

'''Bagan''' ({{MYname|MY=ပုဂံ|MLCTS=pu.gam}}, {{IPA-my|bəɡàɴ|IPA}}; formerly '''Pagan''') is an ancient city located in the [[Mandalay Region]] of [[Myanmar]]. From the 9th to 13th centuries, the city was the capital of the [[Pagan Kingdom]], the first kingdom that unified the regions that would later constitute modern Myanmar. During the kingdom's height between the 11th and 13th centuries, over 10,000 [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples, [[pagoda]]s and monasteries were constructed in the Bagan plains alone, of which the remains of over 2,200 temples and pagodas still survive to the present day.

The '''Bagan Archaeological Zone''' is a main attraction for [[Tourism in Burma|the country's nascent tourism industry]]. It is seen by many as equal in attraction to [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21578171-why-investors-still-need-proceed-caution-promiseand-pitfalls |title=Business: The promise—and the pitfalls |website=The Economist |date=25 May 2013 |access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Bagan is the present-day [[Burmese dialects#Standard dialects|standard Burmese pronunciation]] of the Burmese word ''Pugan'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|ပုဂံ}}), derived from [[Old Burmese]] ''Pukam'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|ပုကမ်}}). Its classical [[Pali]] name is ''[[Arimaddana|Arimaddanapura]]'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|အရိမဒ္ဒနာပူရ}}, lit. "the City that Tramples on Enemies"). Its other names in Pali are in reference to its extreme dry zone climate: ''Tattadesa'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|တတ္တဒေသ}}, "parched land"), and ''Tampadīpa'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|တမ္ပဒီပ}}, "bronzed country").&lt;ref name="tt-117-118"&gt;Than Tun 1964: 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Burmese chronicles]] also report other classical names of ''[[Thiri Pyissaya]]'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|သီရိပစ္စယာ}}; {{lang-pi|Siripaccaya}}) and ''[[Tampawaddy]]'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|တမ္ပဝတီ}}; {{lang-pi|Tampavatī}}).&lt;ref name="my-1-139-141"&gt;Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===9th to 13th centuries===
{{Main article|Early Pagan Kingdom|Pagan Kingdom}}
[[File:Bagan Sunset.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bagan's prosperous economy built over 10,000 temples between the 11th and 13th centuries.]]
[[File:Pagan Empire -- Sithu II.PNG|thumb|150px|Pagan Empire c. 1210]]

According to the [[Burmese chronicles]], Bagan was founded in the second century [[Anno Domini|AD]], and fortified in 849 AD by King [[Pyinbya]], 34th successor of the founder of early Bagan.&lt;ref name="geh-18"&gt;Harvey 1925: 18&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream scholarship however holds that Bagan was founded in the mid-to-late 9th century by the [[Bamar|Mranma]] (Burmans), who had recently entered the Irrawaddy valley from the [[Nanzhao Kingdom]]. It was among several competing [[Pyu city-states]] until the late 10th century when the Burman settlement grew in authority and grandeur.&lt;ref name="vbl-90-91"&gt;Lieberman 2003: 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1044 to 1287, Bagan was the capital as well as the political, economic and cultural nerve center of the [[Pagan Empire]]. Over the course of 250 years, Bagan's rulers and their wealthy subjects constructed over 10,000 religious monuments (approximately 1000 stupas, 10,000 small temples and 3000 monasteries)&lt;ref name="dms-216"&gt;Stadtner 2011: 216&lt;/ref&gt; in an area of {{convert|104|km2|sqmi}} in the Bagan plains. The prosperous city grew in size and grandeur, and became a cosmopolitan center for religious and secular studies, specializing in Pali scholarship in grammar and philosophical-psychological (''[[abhidhamma]]'') studies as well as works in a variety of languages on [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], [[phonology]], grammar, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], medicine, and legal studies.&lt;ref name="vbl-115-116"&gt;Lieberman 2003: 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; The city attracted monks and students from as far as [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Khmer Empire]].

The culture of Bagan was dominated by religion. The religion of Bagan was fluid, syncretic and by later standards, unorthodox. It was largely a continuation of religious trends in the [[Pyu city-states|Pyu era]] where [[Theravada Buddhism]] co-existed with [[Mahayana Buddhism]], [[Tantric Buddhism]], various Hindu ([[Shaivism|Saivite]], and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishana]]) schools as well as native animist (''[[nat (spirit)|nat]]'') traditions. While the royal patronage of Theravada Buddhism since the mid-11th century had enabled the Buddhist school to gradually gain primacy, other traditions continued to thrive throughout the Pagan period to degrees later unseen.&lt;ref name="vbl-115-116"/&gt;

The Pagan Empire collapsed in 1287 due to repeated [[First Mongol invasion of Burma|Mongol invasions]] (1277–1301). Recent research shows that Mongol armies may not have reached Bagan itself, and that even if they did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal.&lt;ref name="vbl-119-120"&gt;[[Victor Lieberman|Lieberman]] 2003: 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; However, the damage had already been done. The city, once home to some 50,000 to 200,000 people, had been reduced to a small town, never to regain its preeminence. The city formally ceased to be the capital of Burma in December 1297 when the [[Myinsaing Kingdom]] became the new power in Upper Burma.&lt;ref name="mha-74"&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt-1959-119-120"&gt;Than Tun 1959: 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

===14th to 19th centuries===

Bagan survived into the 15th century as a human settlement,&lt;ref name="mat-1985-196-197"&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 196–197&lt;/ref&gt; and as a pilgrimage destination throughout the imperial period. A smaller number of "new and impressive" religious monuments still went up to the mid-15th century but afterward, new temple constructions slowed to a trickle with fewer than 200 temples built between the 15th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="dms-216"/&gt; The old capital remained a pilgrimage destination but pilgrimage was focused only on "a score or so" most prominent temples out of the thousands such as the [[Ananda Temple|Ananda]], the [[Shwezigon Pagoda|Shwezigon]], the [[Sulamani Temple|Sulamani]], the [[Htilominlo Temple|Htilominlo]], the [[Dhammayazika Pagoda|Dhammayazika]], and a few other temples along an ancient road. The rest—thousands of less famous, out-of-the-way temples—fell into disrepair, and most did not survive the test of time.&lt;ref name="dms-216"/&gt;

For the few dozen temples that were regularly patronized, the continued patronage meant regular upkeep as well as architectural additions donated by the devotees. Many temples were repainted with new frescoes on top of their original Pagan era ones, or fitted with new Buddha statutes. Then came a series of state-sponsored "systematic" renovations in the [[Konbaung dynasty|Konbaung period]] (1752–1885), which by and large were not true to the original designs—some finished with "a rude plastered surface, scratched without taste, art or result". The interiors of some temples were also whitewashed, such as the [[Thatbyinnyu Temple|Thatbyinnyu]] and the Ananda. Many painted inscriptions and even murals were added in this period.&lt;ref name="dms-217"&gt;Stadtner 2011: 217&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century to present===
[[File:Pumpkin Pagoda -Bupaya Pagoda-, Pagan, Upper Burma.jpg|thumb|The original Bupaya seen here in 1868 was completely destroyed by the 1975 earthquake. A new pagoda in the original shape, but gilded, has been rebuilt.]]

Bagan, located in an active earthquake zone, had suffered from many earthquakes over the ages, with over 400 recorded earthquakes between 1904 and 1975.&lt;ref name="uc-28-ix"&gt;Unesco 1976: ix&lt;/ref&gt; A [[1975 Bagan earthquake|major earthquake]] occurred on 8 July 1975, reaching 8 [[Mercalli intensity scale|MM]] in Bagan and [[Myinkaba]], and 7 MM in [[Nyaung-U]].&lt;ref name="iy-ky"&gt;Ishizawa and Kono 1989: 114&lt;/ref&gt; The quake damaged many temples, in many cases, such as the [[Bupaya Pagoda|Bupaya]], severely and irreparably. Today, 2229 temples and pagodas remain.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-117"&gt;Köllner, Bruns 1998: 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these damaged pagodas underwent restorations in the 1990s by the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]], which sought to make Bagan an international tourist destination. However, the restoration efforts instead drew widespread condemnation from art historians and preservationists worldwide. Critics are aghast that the restorations paid little attention to original architectural styles, and used modern materials, and that the government has also established a [[golf course]], a paved highway, and built a 61-meter (200-foot) watchtower. Although the government believed that the ancient capital's hundreds of (unrestored) temples and large corpus of stone inscriptions were more than sufficient to win the designation of UNESCO World Heritage Site,&lt;ref name="unesco-whs"&gt;Unesco 1996&lt;/ref&gt; the city has not been so designated, allegedly mainly on account of the restorations.&lt;ref name=jbt&gt;Tourtellot 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagan today is a main tourist destination in the country's nascent tourism industry, which has long been the target of various boycott campaigns. The majority of over 300,000 international tourists to the country in 2011 are believed to have also visited Bagan.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Several Burmese publications note that the city's small tourism infrastructure will have to expand rapidly even to meet a modest pickup in tourism in the following years.

On 24 August 2016, a [[August 2016 Myanmar earthquake|major earthquake]] hit central Burma and again did major damage in Bagan; this time almost 400 temples were destroyed. The Sulamani and Myauk Guni (North Guni) were severely damaged. The Bagan Archaeological Department has started a survey and reconstruction effort with the help of UNESCO experts. Visitors are prohibited from entering 33 damaged temples.

==Geography==
[[File:Bagan temples map.png|thumb|Map of the Bagan area showing the locations of the temples, hotels and transportation hubs]]
The '''Bagan Archaeological Zone''', defined as the 13 x 8&amp;nbsp;km area centred around Old Bagan, consisting of [[Nyaung U]] in the north and New Bagan in the south,&lt;ref name="unesco-whs"/&gt; lies in the vast expanse of plains in Upper Burma on the bend of the [[Irrawaddy river]]. It is located {{convert|290|km|mi}} south-west of [[Mandalay]] and {{convert|700|km|mi}} north of [[Yangon]]. Its coordinates are 21°10' North and 94°52' East.

===Climate===
Bagan lies in the middle of the "dry zone" of Burma, the region roughly between [[Shwebo]] in the north and [[Pyay]] in the south. Unlike the coastal regions of the country, which receive annual monsoon rainfalls exceeding 2500 [[millimeter|mm]], the dry zone gets little precipitation as it is sheltered from the rain by the [[Rakhine Yoma]] mountain range in the west.

Available online climate sources report Bagan climate quite differently.

===Architecture===
Bagan stands out for not only the sheer number of religious edifices of Myanmar but also the magnificent architecture of the buildings, and their contribution to Burmese temple design. The artistry of the architecture of pagodas in Bagan proves the achievement of Myanmar craftsmen in handicrafts. The Bagan temple falls into one of two broad categories: the ''[[stupa]]''-style solid temple and the ''gu''-style ({{my|ဂူ}}) hollow temple.

====Stupas====
A ''stupa'', also called a pagoda, is a massive structure, typically with a relic chamber inside. The Bagan ''stupas'' or pagodas evolved from earlier Pyu designs, which in turn were based on the ''stupa'' designs of the Andhra region, particularly [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]] in present-day south-eastern India, and to a smaller extent to [[Ceylon]].&lt;ref name="mat-2005-26-31"&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 26–31&lt;/ref&gt; The Bagan-era stupas in turn were the prototypes for later Burmese stupas in terms of symbolism, form and design, building techniques and even materials.&lt;ref name="mat-2005-233-235"&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 233–235&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

Originally, a Ceylonese ''stupa'' had a hemispheric body ({{lang-pi|anda}} "the egg"), on which a rectangular box surrounded by a stone [[balustrade]] (''harmika'') was set. Extending up from the top of the ''stupa'' was a shaft supporting several ceremonial umbrellas. The ''stupa'' is a representation of the [[Buddhist cosmology|Buddhist cosmos]]: its shape symbolizes [[Mount Meru]] while the umbrella mounted on the brickwork represents the world's axis.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-118-120"&gt;Köllner, Bruns 1998: 118–120&lt;/ref&gt; The brickwork pediment was often covered in stucco and decorated in relief. Pairs or series of ogres as guardian figures ('bilu') were a favourite theme in the Bagan period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Falconer, J.; Moore, E.; Tettoni, L. I. |title=Burmese design and architecture |year=2000 |publisher=Periplus |location=Hong Kong |isbn=9625938826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Indic design was gradually modified first by the [[Pyu people|Pyu]], and then by Burmans at Bagan where the ''stupa'' gradually developed a longer, cylindrical form. The earliest Bagan ''stupas'' such as the Bupaya (c. 9th century) were the direct descendants of the Pyu style at [[Sri Ksetra]]. By the 11th century, the ''stupa'' had developed into a more bell-shaped form in which the parasols morphed into a series of increasingly smaller rings placed on one top of the other, rising to a point. On top the rings, the new design replaced the ''harmika'' with a lotus bud. The lotus bud design then evolved into the "banana bud", which forms the extended apex of most Burmese pagodas. Three or four rectangular terraces served as the base for a pagoda, often with a gallery of terra-cotta tiles depicting Buddhist ''[[jataka]]'' stories. The [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] and the [[Shwesandaw Pagoda (Bagan)|Shwesandaw Pagoda]] are the earliest examples of this type.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-118-120"/&gt; Examples of the trend toward a more bell-shaped design gradually gained primacy as seen in the [[Dhammayazika Pagoda]] (late 12th century) and the [[Mingalazedi Pagoda]] (late 13th century).&lt;ref name="mat-2005-210-213"&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 210–213&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hollow temples====
{{double image|right|Gawdawpalin Temple Bagan Myanmar.jpg|131|Dhammayangyi Paya, Bagan, Myanmar.jpg|120|"One-face"-style [[Gawdawpalin Temple]] (left) and "four-face" [[Dhammayangyi Temple]]}}

In contrast to the ''stupas'', the hollow ''gu''-style temple is a structure used for meditation, devotional worship of the Buddha and other Buddhist rituals. The ''gu'' temples come in two basic styles: "one-face" design and "four-face" design—essentially one main entrance and four main entrances. Other styles such as five-face and hybrids also exist. The one-face style grew out of 2nd century [[Beikthano]], and the four-face out of 7th century Sri Ksetra. The temples, whose main features were the pointed arches and the vaulted chamber, became larger and grander in the Bagan period.&lt;ref name="mat-2005-224-225"&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 224–225&lt;/ref&gt;

====Innovations====
Although the Burmese temple designs evolved from Indic, Pyu (and possibly Mon) styles, the techniques of vaulting seem to have developed in Bagan itself. The earliest vaulted temples in Bagan date to the 11th century, while the vaulting did not become widespread in India until the late 12th century. The masonry of the buildings shows "an astonishing degree of perfection", where many of the immense structures survived the 1975 earthquake more or less intact.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-118-120"/&gt; (Unfortunately, the vaulting techniques of the Bagan era were lost in the later periods. Only much smaller ''gu'' style temples were built after Bagan. In the 18th century, for example, King [[Bodawpaya]] attempted to build the [[Mingun Pagoda]], in the form of spacious vaulted chambered temple but failed as craftsmen and masons of the later era had lost the knowledge of vaulting and keystone arching to reproduce the spacious interior space of the Bagan hollow temples.&lt;ref name="mat-2005-233-235"/&gt;)

Another architectural innovation originated in Bagan is the Buddhist temple with a pentagonal floor plan. This design grew out of hybrid (between one-face and four-face designs) designs. The idea was to include the veneration of the [[Maitreya Buddha]], the future and fifth Buddha of this era, in addition to the four who had already appeared. The Dhammayazika and the [[Ngamyethna Pagoda]] are examples of the pentagonal design.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-118-120"/&gt;

===Museums===
[[File:Bagan Palace.JPG|thumb|Old palace site in Old Bagan. A new completely conjectural palace has been reconstructed since 2003.]]
* The Bagan Archaeological Museum: The only museum in the Bagan Archaeological Zone, itself a field museum a millennium old. The three-story museum houses a number of rare Bagan period objects including the original [[Myazedi inscription]]s, the [[Rosetta stone]] of Burma.
* Anawrahta's Palace: It was rebuilt in 2003 based on the extant foundations at the old palace site.&lt;ref name=moc&gt;Ministry of Culture&lt;/ref&gt; But the palace above the foundation is completely conjectural.

==Transport==
[[File:Nyaung U Airport.JPG|thumb|left|[[Nyaung U Airport]] is the gateway to the Bagan region]]

Bagan is accessible by air, rail, bus, car and river boat.

===Air===
Most international tourists fly to the city. The [[Nyaung U Airport]] is the gateway to the Bagan region. Several domestic airlines have regular flights to [[Yangon]], which take about 80 minutes to cover the 600 kilometres. Flights to [[Mandalay]] take approximately 30 minutes and to [[Heho]] about 40 minutes.&lt;ref name="bagantravel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-bagan.com/getting-there.html |title=Getting to Bagan Myanmar |website=Visit Bagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport is located on the outskirts of [[Nyaung U]] and it takes about 20 minutes by taxi to reach Bagan.

===Rail===
The city is on a spur from the Yangon-Mandalay rail line. [[Myanmar Railways]] operates a daily overnight train service each way between [[Yangon]] and Bagan (Train Nos 61 &amp; 62), which takes at least 18 hours. The trains have a sleeper car and also 1st Class and Ordinary Class seating.&lt;ref name="trainmyanmar"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.seat61.com/Burma.htm#Yangon-Bagan |title=Train Travel in Myanmar |website=The man in seat 61...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Between [[Mandalay]] and Bagan there are two daily services each way (Train Nos 117,118,119 &amp; 120) that take at least 8 hours. The trains have 1st Class and Ordinary Class seating.&lt;ref name="trainmyanmar" /&gt;

===Buses and cars===
Overnight buses and cars also operate to and from [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]] taking approximately 9 and 6 hours respectively.&lt;ref name="bagantravel" /&gt;

===Boat===
An 'express' ferry service runs between Bagan and [[Mandalay]]. Following the Irrawaddy river the fastest ferry takes around 9 hours to travel the 170 kilometres. The service runs daily during peak periods and slower sailings with overnight stops are also available.

==Economy==
[[File:Bagan-Lacquerware-Factory-Workers.JPG|thumb|Workers at a lacquerware factory]]

Bagan's economy is based mainly on [[tourism]]. Because of boycotts against the previous military government, the Bagan region's tourism infrastructure is still quite modest by international standards. The city has a few international standard hotels and many family-run guesthouses. Bagan is also the center of Burmese [[lacquerware]] industry, which to a large degree depends on tourist demand. Much of the lacquerware is destined for souvenir shops in Yangon, and to the world markets. Moreover, the lacquerware-making process itself has become a tourist draw.

==Demographics==
The population of Bagan in its heyday is estimated anywhere between 50,000&lt;ref name="geh-78"&gt;Harvey 1925: 78&lt;/ref&gt; to 200,000 people.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-115"&gt;Köllner, Bruns 1998: 115&lt;/ref&gt; Until the advent of tourism industry in the 1990s, only a few villagers lived in Old Bagan. The rise of tourism has attracted a sizable population to the area. Because Old Bagan is now off limits to permanent dwellings, much of the population reside in either New Bagan, south of Old Bagan, or Nyaung-U, north of Old Bagan. The majority of native residents are [[Bamar people|Bamar]].

==Administration==
The Bagan archaeological zone is part of [[Nyaung-U District]], [[Mandalay Region]].

{{Life timeline}}
'''Biotic material''' or '''biological derived material''' is any material that originates from [[living organisms]]. Most such materials contain [[carbon]] and are capable of [[Decomposition|decay]].

The earliest [[origin of life|life on Earth arose]] at least 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Origin1"&gt;Schopf, JW, Kudryavtsev, AB, Czaja, AD, and Tripathi, AB. (2007).

Examples of biotic materials are [[wood]], [[straw]], [[humus]], [[manure]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[crude oil]], [[cotton]], [[spider silk]], [[chitin]], [[fibrin]], and [[bone]].

The use of biotic materials, and processed biotic materials ([[bio-based material]]) as [[alternative natural materials]], over synthetics is popular with those who are environmentally conscious because such materials are usually biodegradable, renewable, and the processing is commonly understood and has minimal environmental impact. However, not all biotic materials are used in an environmentally friendly way, such as those that require high levels of processing, are harvested unsustainably, or are used to produce [[greenhouse gasses|carbon emission]]s.

When the source of the recently living material has little importance to the product produced, such as in the production of [[biofuel]]s, biotic material is simply called [[biomass]]. Many fuel sources may have biological sources, and may be divided roughly into [[fossil fuels]], and [[biofuel]].

In [[soil science]], biotic material is often referred to as ''[[organic matter]]''. Biotic materials in [[soil]] include [[glomalin]], [[Dopplerite]] and [[humic acid]].  Some biotic material may not be considered to be organic matter if it is low in [[organic compounds]], such as a clam's shell, which is an essential component of the living organism, but contains little organic carbon.

Examples of the use of biotic materials include:

*[[Alternative natural materials]]
*[[Building material]], for a stylistic reasons, or to reduce allergic reactions
*[[Clothing]]
*[[Energy industry|energy production]]
*[[Food]]

'''CAB Direct''' is a source of references for the ''[[life sciences|applied life sciences]]'' It incorporates two  bibliographic databases: '''''CAB Abstracts''''' and '''''Global Health'''''. CAB Direct is an access point for multiple [[bibliographic databases]] produced by ''CABI''. This database contains 8.8 million [[bibliographic record]]s, which includes  85,000 full text articles. It also includes noteworthy literature reviews. News articles and reports are also part of this combined database.&lt;ref name=direct&gt;{{cite web

==CAB Abstracts==
'''CAB Abstracts''' is an applied life sciences bibliographic database emphasising [[agricultural]] literature, which is international in scope. It contains 8 million records, with coverage from 1973 to present day, adding 360,000 abstracts per year. Subject coverage includes [[agriculture]], [[environmental science|environment]], [[veterinary]] sciences, [[applied economics]], [[food science]] and nutrition. Database covers international issues in agriculture, [[forestry]], and allied disciplines in the life sciences. Indexed publications are from 120 countries in 50 languages, including English abstracts for most articles. Literature coverage includes journals, proceedings,  books, and a large collection of agricultural serials. Other non-journal formats are also indexed.&lt;ref name=cabAb&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4766">'''California Ocean Science Trust (OST) ([http://www.oceansciencetrust.org www.oceansciencetrust.org])''' is a nonprofit [[501(c)(3)]] [[public-benefit corporation]] established pursuant to the California Ocean Resources Stewardship Act (CORSA) of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;CORSA: http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/99-00/statute/ch_0501-0550/ch_516_st_2000_ab_2387 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028083450/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/99-00/statute/ch_0501-0550/ch_516_st_2000_ab_2387# |date=2009-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of OST is to advance a constructive role for science in decision-making by promoting collaboration and mutual understanding among scientists, citizens, managers, and policymakers working toward sustained, healthy, and productive coastal and ocean ecosystems. Because OST is not a government entity, it can act as an independent and unbiased broker between policymakers and managers, and the scientific community. 

To achieve its mission and align with the purposes laid out in the enabling legislation, OST has two overarching organizational goals: 1) Facilitate two-way connections between the worlds of science and California coastal ocean policy and management and 2) Institutionalize the integration of the best science into California coastal ocean policy and decision-making.

== Programs ==

===MPA Monitoring===

Ocean Science Trust partnered with the state to lead the development and implementation of impartial, scientifically rigorous, and cost-effective monitoring of the statewide marine protected area (MPA) network established under the California [[Marine Life Protection Act]] (MLPA). Working at the boundary between science and management, MPA Monitoring provides a unique combination of science and policy expertise to implement monitoring that assesses ecosystem condition and evaluates the performance of the statewide MPA network. The MPA Monitoring work does not advocate for or against the implementation of MPAs, but rather ensures that policymakers, resource managers, and the public have timely and useful information to support MPA management decisions.

===Science Advising===

OST provides science support and services to California state agencies and entities by coordinating expert advice, providing scientific review, advice, and feedback, and acting as a liaison and bridging institution between experts, producers of science, and decision-makers. OST's key partner in its science-support function is the California Ocean Protection Council (OPC), a cabinet-level body that spans across multiple agencies responsible for ocean and coastal jurisdictions. The OPC solicits the best available science to support its policy decisions and recommendations, making the Council an objective, nonpartisan body. While OST supports this mission through a number of activities, in particular OST’s Executive Director serves as Science Advisor to the OPC and co-chair of the [http://www.oceansciencetrust.org/projects/providing-science-advice/ OPC Science Advisory Team] (OPC-SAT).

===Science Initiatives===

OST develops and implements a variety of science initiatives to span the complex nexus between science, policy, and management. OST’s initiatives are diverse, including coordination of project teams to conduct needed scientific studies to inform better ocean policy and management decisions, such as the [http://www.oceansciencetrust.org/projects/oil-and-gas-platform-decommissioning-study/ Oil and Gas Decommissioning Study], the [http://www.oceansciencetrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Plastic-Debris-in-the-CA-Marine-Ecosystem_OST-2011-Report.pdf Marine Debris Report], and the Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning initiative. OST strives to provide the highest scientific rigor while ensuring that initiative outcomes offer tangible information and processes that are accessible to key decision-makers and non-scientific audiences.

A '''Chemist In Training''' ('''CIT''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] designation for someone who has obtained a [[academic degree|degree]] from an accredited institution that qualifies for registration with one of the provincial or territorial chemical professional associations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pchem.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102101620/http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |archivedate=2009-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acpo.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; but has not yet achieved the additional requirements (like relevant supervised work experience) to become accredited as a [[Professional Chemist]] (P.Chem.).

==Licensure==
A licensed CIT is certified to work in a [[chemistry]] profession. Upon completing a certain amount of work experience under the supervision of a Licensed Professional Chemist (P.Chem.) as determined by a [[licensing board]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pchem.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102101620/http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |archivedate=2009-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acpo.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; a CIT is then eligible to gain experience by supervision from a P.Chem.

While being a certified CIT may help in obtaining a chemistry related job, it is not typically required to do chemistry work. All work performed by an CIT must still be checked and certified by a P.Chem.

[[File:Drei Frauen am Pranger, China, Anonym, um 1875.jpg|thumb|right|Three women in the [[pillory]], [[Ching China|China]], 1875]]
'''Criminology''' (from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|crīmen}}, "accusation" originally derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] verb "krino" "κρίνω", and Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''-logy|-logia'', from "logos" meaning: “word,” “reason,” or “plan”) is the [[Scientific method|scientific study]] of the nature, extent, management, causes, control, consequences, and prevention of [[criminal behavior]], both on individual and social levels. Criminology is an interdisciplinary field in both the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[social science]]s, drawing especially upon the research of [[sociology|sociologists]], [[psychology|psychologists]], [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]], [[biology|biologists]], [[social anthropology|social anthropologists]], as well as scholars of law.

The term ''criminology'' was coined in 1885 by Italian law professor [[Raffaele Garofalo]] as ''[[:it:Criminologia|criminologia]].'' Later, French anthropologist [[Paul Topinard]] used the analogous French term ''[[:fr:Criminologie|criminologie]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociological Theory and Criminological Research: Views from Europe and the United States |page=279 |editor=Deflem, Mathieu |isbn=978-0-7623-1322-8 |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States for the past 100 years, criminology has experienced three life course phases : (1) Golden Age of Research (1900-1930) which has been described as multiple-factor approach, (2) Golden Age of Theory (1930-1960) which shows that they were no systematic way of connecting criminological research to theory, and 1960-2000 period as seen as a significant turning point for criminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braithwaite|first=J.|date=2000-03-01|title=The New Regulatory State and the Transformation of Criminology|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article-abstract/40/2/222/611103?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=British Journal of Criminology|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=222–238|doi=10.1093/bjc/40.2.222|issn=0007-0955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminological Schools of thought==
In the mid-18th century, criminology arose as [[social philosophy|social philosophers]] gave thought to crime and concepts of law. Over time, several schools of thought have developed. There were three main schools of thought in early criminological theory spanning the period from the mid-18th century to the mid-twentieth century: [[Classical school (criminology)|Classical]], [[Positivist school (criminology)|Positivist]], and [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago]]. These schools of thought were superseded by several contemporary paradigms of criminology, such as the sub-culture, control, strain, labeling, [[critical criminology]], [[cultural criminology]], [[Postmodernist school (criminology)|postmodern criminology]], [[Feminist school of criminology|feminist criminology]] and others discussed below.

===Classical school===
{{POV|date=January 2013}}
The [[Classical school (criminology)|Classical school]] arose in the mid-18th century and has its basis in [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] philosophy. [[Cesare Beccaria]],&lt;ref name="Beccaria, Cesare 1764 64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Beccaria, Cesare |title=On Crimes and Punishments, and Other Writings |year=1764 |page=64 |translator=Richard Davies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-40203-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; author of ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene|On Crimes and Punishments]]'' (1763–64), [[Jeremy Bentham]] (inventor of the ''[[panopticon]]''), and other philosophers in this school argued:{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
# People have [[free will]] to choose how to act.
# The basis for deterrence is the idea humans are '[[Hedonism|hedonists]]' who seek pleasure and avoid pain, and 'rational calculators' who weigh the costs and benefits of every action. It ignores the possibility of [[irrationality]] and unconscious drives as motivators.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
# [[Punishment]] (of sufficient severity) can deter people from crime, as the costs (penalties) outweigh benefits, and severity of punishment should be proportionate to the crime.&lt;ref name="Beccaria, Cesare 1764 64"/&gt;
# The more swift and certain the punishment, the more effective as a deterrent to criminal behavior.
This school developed during a major reform in [[penology]], when society began designing prisons for the sake of extreme punishment. This period also saw many legal reforms, the [[French Revolution]], and the development of the [[Law of the United States|legal system in the United States]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Positivist school===
The [[Positivist school]] argues criminal behavior comes from internal and external factors out of the individual's control. Philosophers within this school applied the scientific method to study human behavior. Positivism comprises three segments: [[Positivist school (criminology)#Biological positivism|biological]], [[Positivist school (criminology)#Psychological postivism|psychological]] and [[social positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;David, Christian Carsten.

====Italian school====
[[Cesare Lombroso]] (1835–1909), an Italian sociologist working in the late 19th century, is often called "the father of [[criminal anthropology|criminology]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5047&amp;context=jclc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227053359/http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5047&amp;context=jclc |archivedate=27 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the key contributors to biological positivism and founded the [[Italian school of criminology]].&lt;ref name="siegel-p7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Siegel, Larry J. |title=Criminology, 8th edition |year=2003 |publisher= Thomson-Wadsworth |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombroso took a scientific approach, insisting on empirical evidence for studying crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crime and Society: Readings in History and Theory |isbn=978-0-415-02755-7 |author1=McLennan, Gregor |author2=Jennie Pawson |author3=Mike Fitzgerald |publisher= Routledge |page=311 |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested physiological traits such as the measurements of cheek bones or hairline, or a cleft palate could indicate "[[atavism|atavistic]]" criminal tendencies. This approach, whose influence came via the theory of [[phrenology]] and by [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]], has been superseded. [[Enrico Ferri]], a student of Lombroso, believed social as well as biological factors played a role, and believed criminals should not be held responsible when factors causing their criminality were beyond their control. Criminologists have since rejected Lombroso's biological theories, since [[control group]]s were not used in his studies.&lt;ref name="siegel-p139"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sociological positivism====
[[Sociological positivism]] suggests societal factors such as [[poverty]], membership of subcultures, or low levels of education predispose people to crime. [[Adolphe Quetelet]] used data and statistical analysis to study the relationship between crime and sociological factors. He found age, gender, poverty, education, and alcohol consumption were important factors to crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/228630 |title=Adolphe Quetelet and the Origins of Positivist Criminology |author=Beirne, Piers |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=92 |date=March 1987 |pages=1140–1169 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lance Lochner performed three different research experiments, each one proving education reduces crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lochner|first=Lance|title=The American Economic Review|journal=The Effect of Education on Crime: Evidence from Prison Inmates, Arrests, and Self-Reports|volume=94|pages=155–189|doi=10.1257/000282804322970751|year=2004|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4mf8k11n|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rawson W. Rawson]] used [[crime statistics]] to suggest a link between [[population density]] and [[crime rate]]s, with crowded cities producing more crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hayward, Keith J. |title=City Limits: Crime, Consumerism and the Urban Experience |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-904385-03-5 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Fletcher (statistician)|Joseph Fletcher]] and John Glyde read papers to the [[Statistical Society of London]] on their studies of crime and its distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Garland, David |chapter=Of Crimes and Criminals |page=21 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Criminology, 3rd edition |editor=Maguire, Mike |editor2=Rod Morgan |editor3=Robert Reiner |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Mayhew]] used [[empirical]] methods and an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] approach to address social questions and poverty, and gave his studies in ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/25 |title=Henry Mayhew: London Labour and the London Poor |publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515160854/http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/25/ |archivedate=15 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]] viewed crime as an inevitable aspect of a society with uneven distribution of wealth and other differences among people.

====Differential association (subcultural)====
People learn crime through [[Differential association|association]]. This theory was advocated by [[Edwin Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deviance: A Symbolic Interactionist Approach|last=Herman|first=Nancy|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1995|isbn=978-1882289387|location=Michigan|pages=64–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; These acts may condone criminal conduct, or justify crime under specific circumstances. Interacting with [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] peers is a major cause. Reinforcing criminal behavior makes it chronic. Where there are criminal [[subcultures]], many individuals learn crime, and crime rates swell in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Ferracuti|title=Criminological Theory Summaries|url=http://www.uwec.edu/patchinj/crmj301/theorysummaries.pdf|publisher=Cullen &amp; Agnew|accessdate=3 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131020192418/http://www.uwec.edu/patchinj/crmj301/theorysummaries.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago school===
The [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] arose in the early twentieth century, through the work of [[Robert E. Park]], [[Ernest Burgess]], and other [[urban sociology|urban sociologists]] at the [[University of Chicago]].  In the 1920s, Park and Burgess identified five [[Concentric ring model|concentric zones]] that often exist as cities grow, including the "[[zone of transition]]", which was identified as the most volatile and subject to disorder.  In the 1940s, [[Harry McKay|Henry McKay]] and Clifford R. Shaw focused on [[juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquents]], finding that they were concentrated in the zone of transition.

Chicago school sociologists adopted a [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] approach to studying cities and postulated that urban neighborhoods with high levels of poverty often experience breakdown in the [[social structure]] and [[institution]]s such as family and schools.  This results in [[social disorganization]], which reduces the ability of these institutions to control behavior and creates an environment ripe for [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]].

Other researchers suggested an added social-psychological link.  [[Edwin Sutherland]] suggested that people learn criminal behavior from older, more experienced criminals with whom they may associate.

Theoretical perspectives used in criminology include [[psychoanalysis]], [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], [[interactionism]], [[Marxism]], [[econometrics]], [[systems theory]], [[postmodernism]], [[genetics]], [[neuropsychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], etc.

===Social structure theories===
This theory is applied to a variety of approaches within the bases of criminology in particular and in sociology more generally as a [[conflict theory]] or structural conflict perspective in sociology and sociology of crime. As this perspective is itself broad enough, embracing as it does a diversity of positions.&lt;ref&gt;Hester, S., Eglin, P. 1992, ''A Sociology of Crime'', London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social disorganization (neighborhoods)====
[[Social disorganization theory]] is based on the work of Henry McKay and Clifford R. Shaw of the Chicago School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shaw, Clifford R.  |author2=McKay, Henry D. |title=Juvenile Delinquency and Urban Areas |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1942 |isbn=978-0-226-75125-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social disorganization theory postulates that neighborhoods plagued with poverty and economic deprivation tend to experience high rates of [[population turnover]].&lt;ref name="bursik-1988"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social Disorganization and Theories of Crime and Delinquency: Problems and Prospects |author1=Bursik Jr. |author2=Robert J. |journal=Criminology |year=1988 |volume=26 |pages=519–539 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1988.tb00854.x |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that crime and deviance is valued within groups in society, ‘subcultures’ or ‘gangs’. These groups have different values to the [[social norm]]. These neighborhoods also tend to have high population [[Heterogeneous|heterogeneity]].&lt;ref name="bursik-1988"/&gt; With high turnover, informal [[social structure]] often fails to develop, which in turn makes it difficult to maintain [[social order]] in a community.

====Social ecology====
Since the 1950s, social ecology studies have built on the social disorganization theories.  Many studies have found that crime rates are associated with poverty, disorder, high numbers of abandoned buildings, and other signs of community deterioration.&lt;ref name="bursik-1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Morenoff, Jeffrey |author2=Robert Sampson |author3=Stephen Raudenbush |title=Neighborhood Inequality, Collective Efficacy and the Spatial Dynamics of Urban Violence |journal=Criminology |volume=39 |year=2001 |pages=517–60 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2001.tb00932.x |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[working class|working]] and [[Middle class|middle-class]] people leave deteriorating neighborhoods, the most disadvantaged portions of the population may remain. [[William Julius Wilson]] suggested a poverty "concentration effect", which may cause neighborhoods to be isolated from the mainstream of society and become prone to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=Larry|title=Criminology: Theories, Patterns, and Typologies|date=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1305446090|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strain theory (social strain theory)====
{{Main|Strain theory (sociology)}}
Strain theory, also known as Mertonian Anomie, advanced by American sociologist [[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]], suggests that mainstream culture, especially in the United States, is saturated with dreams of opportunity, freedom, and prosperity—as Merton put it, the ''[[American Dream]]''. Most people buy into this dream, and it becomes a powerful cultural and psychological motivator. Merton also used the term ''[[anomie]]'', but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]].  Merton saw the term as meaning a [[dichotomy]] between what society expected of its citizens and what those citizens could actually achieve.  Therefore, if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of those dejected will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order to realize it. Others will retreat or drop out into [[deviance (sociology)|deviant]] subcultures (such as [[Gang|gang members]], or what he calls "[[hobo]]s"). [[Robert Agnew (criminologist)|Robert Agnew]] developed this theory further to include types of strain which were not derived from financial constraints. This is known as [[general strain theory]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Merton, Robert |year=1957 |title=Social Theory and Social Structure |publisher=Free Press |isbn=978-0-02-921130-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Anomie Theory'''

''Main article: Messner and Institutional Anomie Theory''

The Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory stems from a pre-existing theory, discovered by Merton named Strain theory. Rosenberger took his findings and offered a different approach to definition and based it on the assumption that everybody should already have "the assumption that the “American Dream” produces a society that is dominated by the economy and obsessed with the pursuit of success."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberger|first=Jared|date=October 2016|title=Television consumption and institutional anomie theory|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=a46dc574-3755-410e-8199-998554e3b4a9%40sdc-v-sessmgr05&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=116344296&amp;db=sih|journal=Television consumption and institutional anomie theory|volume= 49|pages=305–325. 21p|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory has many different views and definitions by many people therefore this becomes a very flexible theory.

Larine Hughes found a correlation between economic pressure and how it combines the "American Dream" and "Individualism" to a high crime. Hughes came to  final decision that "Therefore, individuals that do not have the drive to succeed and achieve this “goal”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Lorine|date=2015|title=Economic Dominance, the "American Dream," and Homicide:|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=f60096cd-f6eb-4b62-b63c-18b30345ebe9%40sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=100487344&amp;db=sih|journal=A Cross-National Test of Institutional Anomie Theory|volume= 85|pages=p. 100–128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will fail, despite social and cultural pressures.

Samantha Applin, then took an approached relating genders and The Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory. Stated in an article by S. Applin, "males make up what is considered “normal subjects”, and due to this, force woman to lie on a boundary that expectation is outside the dominant cultural frame."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samantha|first=Applin|date=April 2014|title=Her American Dream|url=https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1557085114525654|journal=Bringing Gender Into Institutional-Anomie Theory|volume= 10|pages= 36–59|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, setting women back in the beginning stages of Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory.

Brian Stults began to research studies on the violence between youth and the correlation that it  has on Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Anomie Theory. Stults found sated " As well as the results showed graduating high school represents an important developmental stage in American society, as it ends the compulsory education, and is often followed by a significant decline in daily need and extra resources from your parents."

====Subcultural theory====
{{Main|Subcultural theory}}
Following the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] and strain theory, and also drawing on [[Edwin Sutherland]]'s idea of [[differential association]], subcultural theorists focused on small cultural groups [[Fragmentation (sociology)|fragmenting]] away from the mainstream to form their own values and meanings about life.

[[Albert K. Cohen]] tied anomie theory with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[reaction formation]] idea, suggesting that delinquency among lower class youths is a reaction against the social norms of the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cohen, Albert |title=Delinquent Boys |publisher=Free Press |year=1955 |isbn=978-0-02-905770-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some youth, especially from poorer areas where opportunities are scarce, might adopt social norms specific to those places that may include "toughness" and disrespect for authority.  Criminal acts may result when youths conform to norms of the deviant subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kornhauser, R. |year=1978 |title=Social Sources of Delinquency |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-45113-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Cloward]] and [[Lloyd Ohlin]] suggested that delinquency can result from a differential opportunity for lower class youth.&lt;ref name="cloward"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cloward, Richard, Lloyd Ohlin |title=Delinquency and Opportunity |publisher=Free Press |year=1960 |isbn=978-0-02-905590-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such youths may be tempted to take up criminal activities, choosing an illegitimate path that provides them more lucrative economic benefits than conventional, over legal options such as [[minimum wage]]-paying jobs available to them.&lt;ref name="cloward"/&gt;

British subcultural theorists focused more heavily on the issue of [[Social class|class]], where some criminal activities were seen as "imaginary solutions" to the problem of belonging to a subordinate class. A further study by the Chicago school looked at gangs and the influence of the interaction of gang leaders under the observation of adults.

Sociologists such as [[Raymond Gastil|Raymond D. Gastil]] have explored the impact of a [[Southern culture of honor]] on violent crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond D. Gastil, "Homicide and a Regional Culture of Violence," American Sociological Review 36 (1971): 412-427.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Control theories====
Another approach is made by the social bond or [[social control theory]]. Instead of looking for factors that make people become criminal, these theories try to explain why people do ''not'' become criminal. [[Travis Hirschi]] identified four main characteristics: "attachment to others", "belief in moral validity of rules", "commitment to achievement", and "involvement in conventional activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hirschi, Travis |title=Causes of Delinquency |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=1969 |isbn=978-0-7658-0900-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The more a person features those characteristics, the less likely he or she is to become deviant (or criminal).  On the other hand, if these factors are not present, a person is more likely to become a criminal. Hirschi expanded on this theory with the idea that a person with low [[self control]] is more likely to become criminal. As opposed to most criminology theories, these do not look at why people commit crime but rather why they do not commit crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A General Theory of Crime |author=[[Michael R. Gottfredson|Gottfredson, Michael R.]], [[Travis Hirschi|Hirschi, Travis]] |year=1990 |publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple example: Someone wants a big yacht but does not have the means to buy one.  If the person cannot exert self-control, he or she might try to get the yacht (or the means for it) in an illegal way, whereas someone with high self-control will (more likely) either wait, deny themselves of what want or seek an intelligent intermediate solution, such as joining a yacht club to use a yacht by group consolidation of resources without violating social norms.

Social bonds, through [[Peer group|peers]], parents, and others can have a countering effect on one's low self-control.  For families of low socio-economic status, a factor that distinguishes families with delinquent children, from those who are not delinquent, is the control exerted by parents or [[Chaperone (social)|chaperonage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilson, Harriet |title=Parental Supervision: A Neglected Aspect of Delinquency |year=1980 |journal=British Journal of Criminology |volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, theorists such as [[David Matza]] and [[Gresham Sykes]] argued that criminals are able to temporarily neutralize internal moral and social behavioral constraints through [[techniques of neutralization]].

====Psychoanalysis and the unconscious desire for punishment====
Psychoanalysis is the system of psychological theory and therapy looking towards the investigation of the conscious and unconscious mind elements, along with repressed memories that can be taken back into consciousness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Pleasure Principle|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Broadview Editions|year=2011|isbn=|location=Peterborough, Ontario|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigmund Freud talks about how the unconscious desire for pain relates to psychoanalysis in his novel, ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' which was interpreted by Hubback.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Freud looks into research indicating a ‘repetition compulsion’ and a ‘death drive’ which is the unconscious impulse that one may get to become self-destructive and actually have the ability to take over the creativity drive within someone. Phillida Rosnick, author of the article ''Mental Pain and Social Trauma,'' looks into the mental state of someone who has experienced extreme trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosnick|first=Phillida|date=2017|title=Mental Pain and Social Trauma|url=|journal=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|volume=94(6)|pages=1200–1202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They discovered there is a difference in the actions and thoughts of individuals suffering traumatic unconscious pain and this corresponds to them having thoughts and feelings that are unlike their normal selves. By looking at the unconscious within a paranoid state of mind from trauma, there is a direct correlation to how this behavior can cause criminals to act in deviant ways based on their brain structure and how their unconscious is taking information. Sander Gilman, the author of the article ''Freud and the Making of Psychoanalysis'', actually looks into the physical mechanisms of the human brain and the nervous system relating to the impulses that someone might feel and the impulses that might cause someone to unconsciously desire pain.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilman|first=Sander|date=2008|title=Freud and the Making of Psychoanalysis|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/docview/199033499?accountid=28917|journal=The Lancet|volume=372|pages=1799–1800|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman speaks to Freud’s position on the various issues of the mind and the potential discovery from looking at the brain and interpreting data about the unconscious mind and the Eros within the brain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By looking at how psychoanalysis and the unconscious desire for pain relate to each other, there is more evidence as to how it can occur within criminals and how these impulses or the innate desires within an individual can ultimately be the cause of deviant acts.

Symbolic interactionism draws on the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[George Herbert Mead]], as well as [[subcultural theory]] and [[conflict theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mead, George Herbert |title=Mind Self and Society |year=1934 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This school of thought focused on the relationship between state, media, and conservative-ruling elite and other less powerful groups. The powerful groups had the ability to become the "significant other" in the less powerful groups' processes of generating [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. The former could to some extent impose their meanings on the latter; therefore they were able to "label" minor delinquent youngsters as criminal. These youngsters would often take the label on board, indulge in crime more readily, and become [[Free will|actors]] in the "[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]" of the powerful groups. Later developments in this set of theories were by [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Becker]] and [[Edwin Lemert]], in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Becker, Howard |title=Outsiders |publisher=Free Press |year=1963 |isbn=978-0-684-83635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]] developed the concept of "[[moral panic]]" describing societal reaction to spectacular, alarming social phenomena (e.g. post-World War 2 youth cultures like the [[Mods and Rockers]] in the UK in 1964, [[AIDS epidemic]] and [[football hooliganism]]).

==== Labeling theory ====
{{Main|Labeling theory}}
Labelling theory refers to an individual who is labelled in a particular way and was studied in great detail by Becker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slattery|first=Martin|title=Key Ideas In Sociology|year=2003|publisher=Nelson Thornes|pages=154+}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arrives originally from sociology but is regularly used in criminological studies. It is said that when someone is given the label of a criminal they may reject or accept it and continue to commit crime. Even those who initially reject the label can eventually accept it as the label becomes more well known, particularly among their peers. This stigma can become even more profound when the labels are about deviancy, and it is thought that this stigmatization can lead to [[Deviancy amplification spiral|deviancy amplification]]. [[Malcolm W. Klein|Malcolm Klein]] conducted a test which showed that labelling theory affected some youth offenders but not others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelin|first=Malcolm|journal=Criminal Justice &amp; Behaviour|date=March 1986|volume=13|pages=47–79|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/13/1/47.short|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0093854886013001004|title=Labeling Theory and Delinquency Policy: An Experimental Test|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614061209/http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/13/1/47.short|archivedate=14 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual theories===
[[File:Keyhoe sign.jpg|thumb|right|The self-assessment of the perpetrator of the [[Bath School disaster]] ]]

====Traitor theories====
At the other side of the spectrum, criminologist [[Lonnie Athens]] developed a theory about how a process of brutalization by parents or peers that usually occurs in childhood results in violent crimes in adulthood. [[Richard Rhodes]]' ''Why They Kill'' describes Athens' observations about domestic and societal violence in the criminals' backgrounds. Both Athens and Rhodes reject the genetic inheritance theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =  Rhodes| first =  Richard| title = Why They Kill: The Discoveries of a Maverick Criminologist| publisher = Vintage| year = 2000| isbn = 978-0-375-40249-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rational choice theory====
{{Main|Rational choice theory (criminology)}}
[[File:Cesare Beccaria 1738-1794.jpg|thumb|180px|Cesare Beccaria]]
Rational choice theory is based on the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]], classical school philosophies of [[Cesare Beccaria]], which were popularized by [[Jeremy Bentham]].  They argued that punishment, if certain, swift, and proportionate to the crime, was a deterrent for crime, with risks outweighing possible benefits to the offender. In ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'' (On Crimes and Punishments, 1763–1764), Beccaria advocated a rational [[penology]]. Beccaria conceived of punishment as the necessary application of the law for a crime; thus, the judge was simply to conform his or her sentence to the law. Beccaria also distinguished between crime and [[sin]], and advocated against the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], as well as [[torture]] and inhumane treatments, as he did not consider them as rational deterrents.

This philosophy was replaced by the positivist and Chicago schools and was not revived until the 1970s with the writings of [[James Q. Wilson]], [[Gary Becker]]'s 1965 article ''Crime and Punishment''&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Becker]], "Crime and Punishment", in ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', vol. 76 (2), March–April 1968, p.196-217&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Stigler]]'s 1970 article ''The Optimum Enforcement of Laws''.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler]], "The Optimum Enforcement of Laws", in ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', vol.78 (3), May–June 1970, p. 526–536&lt;/ref&gt; Rational choice theory argues that criminals, like other people, weigh costs or risks and benefits when deciding whether to commit crime and think in economic terms.&lt;ref name="cornish"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cornish, Derek |author2=Ronald V. Clarke |year=1986 |title=The Reasoning Criminal |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-0-387-96272-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will also try to minimize risks of crime by considering the time, place, and other situational factors.&lt;ref name="cornish"/&gt;

Becker, for example, acknowledged that many people operate under a high moral and ethical constraint but considered that criminals rationally see that the benefits of their crime outweigh the cost, such as the probability of apprehension and conviction, severity of punishment, as well as their current set of opportunities. From the public policy perspective, since the cost of increasing the fine is marginal to that of the cost of increasing [[surveillance]], one can conclude that the best policy is to maximize the fine and minimize surveillance.

With this perspective, [[crime prevention]] or reduction measures can be devised to increase the effort required to commit the crime, such as [[target hardening]].&lt;ref name="clarke-1992"&gt;{{cite book |author=Clarke, Ronald V. |year=1992 |title=Situational Crime Prevention |publisher=Harrow and Heston |isbn=978-1-881798-68-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rational choice theories also suggest that increasing risk and likelihood of being caught, through added surveillance, law enforcement presence, added street lighting, and other measures, are effective in reducing crime.&lt;ref name="clarke-1992"/&gt;

One of the main differences between this theory and Bentham's rational choice theory, which had been abandoned in criminology, is that if Bentham considered it possible to completely annihilate crime (through the [[panopticon]]), Becker's theory acknowledged that a society could not eradicate crime beneath a certain level. For example, if 25% of a supermarket's products were stolen, it would be very easy to reduce this rate to 15%, quite easy to reduce it until 5%, difficult to reduce it under 3% and nearly impossible to reduce it to zero (a feat which the measures required would cost the supermarket so much that it would outweigh the benefits). This reveals that the goals of utilitarianism and [[classical liberalism]] have to be tempered and reduced to more modest proposals to be practically applicable.

Such rational choice theories, linked to [[neoliberalism]], have been at the basics of [[crime prevention through environmental design]] and underpin the [[Market Reduction Approach]] to theft &lt;ref&gt;Sutton, M. Schneider, J. and Hetherington, S. (2001) Tackling Theft with the Market Reduction Approach. Crime Reduction Research Series paper 8. Home Office.

====Routine activity theory====
{{Main|Routine activity theory}}
Routine activity theory, developed by Marcus Felson and Lawrence Cohen, draws upon control theories and explains crime in terms of crime opportunities that occur in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Felson, Marcus |title=Crime and Everyday Life |year=1994 |publisher=Pine Forge |isbn=978-0-8039-9029-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crime opportunity requires that elements converge in time and place including a motivated offender, suitable target or victim, and lack of a capable guardian.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cohen, Lawrence |author2=Marcus Felson |title=Social Change and Crime Rate Trends |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=44 |year=1979 |doi=10.2307/2094589 |pages=588–608 |issue=4 |jstor=2094589|citeseerx=10.1.1.476.3696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A guardian at a place, such as a street, could include security guards or even ordinary pedestrians who would witness the criminal act and possibly intervene or report it to law enforcement.&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt; Routine activity theory was expanded by John Eck, who added a fourth element of "place manager" such as rental property managers who can take [[nuisance]] abatement measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reducing Crime and Drug Dealing by Improving Place Management: A Randomized Experiment |author1=Eck, John |author2=Julie Wartell |publisher=National Institute of Justice |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosocial theories===
[[Biosocial criminology]] is an interdisciplinary field that aims to explain crime and antisocial behavior by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. While contemporary criminology has been dominated by sociological theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as [[genetics]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name=Asghate2011&gt;Kevin M. Beaver and Anthony Walsh. 2011. Biosocial Criminology. Chapter 1 in The Ashgate Research Companion to Biosocial Theories of Crime. 2011. Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aggressive behavior]] has been associated with abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body: [[serotonin]] systems, [[catecholamine]] systems, and the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis]]. Abnormalities in these systems also are known to be induced by [[Stress (biology)|stress]], either severe, acute stress or chronic low-grade stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=WALTON K. G. |author2=LEVITSKY D. K. |date=2003 |title=Effects of the Transcendental Meditation program on neuroendocrine abnormalities associated with aggression and crime |journal=Journal of Offender Rehabilitation |volume=36 |issue=1–4 |pages=67–87 |pmc= |pmid= |issn= |doi=10.1300/J076v36n01_04 |quote= |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist criminology===
{{Main|Marxist criminology}}
In 1968, young British sociologists formed the [[National Deviancy Symposium|National Deviance Conference]] (NDC) group. The group was restricted to academics and consisted of 300 members. [[Ian Taylor (sociologist)|Ian Taylor]], Paul Walton and [[Jock Young]] – members of the NDC – rejected previous explanations of crime and deviance. Thus, they decided to pursue a new Marxist criminological approach.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Richard F., "A Critique of Marxist Criminology." Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The New Criminology'', they argued against the biological "positivism" perspective represented by Lombroso, [[Hans Eysenck]] and Gordon Trasler.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Richard F., "A Critique of Marxist Criminology." Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Marxist perspective on crime, "defiance is normal – the sense that men are now consciously involved [...] in assuring their human diversity." Thus Marxists criminologists argued in support of society in which the facts of human diversity, be it social or personal, would not be criminalized.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Richard F., "A Critique of Marxist Criminology." Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 170 - 171&lt;/ref&gt; They further attributed the processes of crime creation not to genetic or psychological facts, but rather to the material basis of a given society.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Charles, C. W. G. Jasperse, K. A. van Leeuwen-Burow. "Criminology Between the Rule of Law and the Outlaws." (1976). Deventer: Kluwer D.V. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convict Criminology===
Convict criminology is a school of thought in the realm of criminology. Convict criminologists have been directly affected by the [[criminal justice system]], oftentimes having spent years inside the prison system. Researchers in the field of convict criminology such as John Irwin and Stephan Richards argue that traditional criminology can better be understood by those who lived in the walls of a prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Stephen C.|last2=Ross|first2=Jeffrey Ian|date=2001|title=Introducing the New School of Convict Criminology|jstor=29768063|journal=Social Justice|volume=28|issue=1 (83)|pages=177–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Leyva argues that "prisonization" oftentimes begins before prison, in the home, community, and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leyva|first=Martin|last2=Bickel|first2=Christopher|date=2010|title=From Corrections to College: The Value of a Convict's Voice|url=http://convictcriminology.org/pdf/Leyva.pdf|journal=Western Criminology Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=50–60|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809135344/http://www.convictcriminology.org/pdf/Leyva.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queer Criminology===
Queer criminology is a field of study that focuses on [[LGBT]] individuals and their interactions with the criminal justice system. The goals of this field of study are as follows:
* To better understand the history of LGBT individuals and the laws put against the community
* Why LGBT citizens are incarcerated and if or why they are arrested at higher rates than heterosexual and [[cisgender]] individuals
* How queer activists have fought against oppressive laws that criminalized LGBT individuals
* To conduct research and use it as a form of activism through education

====Legitimacy====
The value of pursuing criminology from a queer theorist perspective is contested; some believe that it is not worth researching and not relevant to the field as a whole, and as a result is a subject that lacks a wide berth of research available. On the other hand, it could be argued that this subject is highly valuable in highlighting how LGBT individuals are affected by the criminal justice system. This research also has the opportunity to “queer” the curriculum of criminology in educational institutions by shifting the focus from controlling and monitoring LGBT communities to liberating and protecting them.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Matthew. "Queer Criminology as Activism." Critical Criminology 24.4 (2016): 473-87. Web. 5 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and definitions of crime==
Both the positivist and classical schools take a consensus view of crime: that a crime is an act that violates the basic values and beliefs of society.  Those values and beliefs are manifested as laws that society agrees upon. However, there are two types of laws:
*[[Natural law]]s are rooted in core values shared by many cultures. Natural laws protect against harm to persons (e.g. murder, rape, assault) or property (theft, larceny, robbery), and form the basis of [[common law]] systems.
* [[Statutory law|Statutes]] are enacted by legislatures and reflect current cultural [[mores]], albeit that some laws may be controversial, e.g. laws that prohibit [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use and gambling. Marxist criminology, conflict criminology and critical criminology claim that most relationships between [[state (polity)|state]] and citizen are non-consensual and, as such, [[criminal law]] is not necessarily representative of public beliefs and wishes: it is exercised in the interests of the [[Ruling class|ruling]] or dominant class.  The more right-wing criminologies tend to posit that there is a consensual [[social contract]] between state and citizen.

Therefore, definitions of crimes will vary from place to place, in accordance to the cultural norms and mores, but may be broadly classified as [[blue-collar crime]], [[corporate crime]], [[organized crime]], [[political crime]], [[public order crime]], [[state crime]], [[state-corporate crime]], and [[white-collar crime]].&lt;ref&gt;"Attack the System » Crime and Conflict Theory."

'''Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature''', which opened in 1854, was set up by the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Company]] as a new enterprise to occupy part of its buildings when it  re-erected the Crystal Palace in suburban [[Sydenham]] in 1853. Civil engineer and later first director of the [[Royal College of Music]], [[George Grove]] was appointed secretary. It was a part of the great movements for educational and social reform of the nineteenth century.

The main buildings were destroyed by fire in 1936.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Letter to The Editor, ''The Times'', Monday Dec. 07, 1936. page 10, issue 47551&lt;br&gt;
The end of the Crystal Palace brings to mind  memories of the School of Engineering which was housed  in the South Tower, fortunately still standing firm as a rock. This school, founded by J. W. Wilson, M.I.M.E., an engineer who helped to build the Great Exhibition of 1851, sent many of its students to the four quarters of the globe. The curriculum of the school included mechanical and civil courses and about five of the circular rooms were used. There was a fitting shop, pattern shop, and drawing office. Those in the mechanical section built a 4 h.p. vertical engine which was generally exhibited at the head of the stairs on the south side of the Palace. In the Civil Engineering section we surveyed the whole of the grounds, and drew plans and made estimates for an imaginary railway which extended from one side to the other. This entailed all the necessary estimates for embankments, a cantilever bridge etc. Then there was the Colonial section presided over by a most congenial superintendent, who had no doubt seen much of a pioneer's life and infused his enthusiasm into those who belonged to his section. Concerning the rigidity of the South Tower, I was working in a high storey soon after joining the school when there was a strong wind, and, feeling giddy, I mentioned it to the superintendent. He informed me that it rocked several inches at the top, which made it safer than absolute rigidity.–Mr F. C. Bell, 74, Berners Street, Ipswich.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Elgin Marbles''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|ɡ|ɪ|n}}), also known as the '''Parthenon Marbles''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Γλυπτά του Παρθενώνα), are a collection of [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] [[marble sculpture]]s made under the supervision of the architect and sculptor [[Phidias]] and his assistants. They were originally part of the [[Parthenon|temple of the Parthenon]] and other buildings on the [[Acropolis of Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/w/what_are_the_elgin_marbles.aspx|title=What are the 'Elgin Marbles'?|publisher=britishmuseum.org|accessdate=2009-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420232511/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/w/what_are_the_elgin_marbles.aspx|archive-date=20 April 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Elgin-Marbles|title=Elgin Marbles&amp;nbsp;– Greek sculpture |work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | accessdate = 2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1801 to 1812, agents of [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]] removed about half of the surviving sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as sculptures from the [[Propylaea]] and [[Erechtheum]].&lt;ref name=BritB&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Elgin Marbles, 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The Marbles were transported by sea to Britain.

After [[Greek War of Independence|gaining its independence]] from the Ottoman Empire in 1832, the newly found Greek state began a series of projects to restore its monuments and retrieve looted art. It has expressed its disapproval of Elgin's removal of the Marbles from the Acropolis and the Parthenon,&lt;ref name="Ministry of Culture: The Background of the Removal"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://odysseus.culture.gr/a/1/12/ga125.html |title=The Background of the Removal |publisher=Greek Ministry of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is regarded as one of the world's greatest cultural monuments.&lt;ref name="UNESCO: Acropolis, Athens"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404 |title=Acropolis, Athens |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; International efforts to repatriate the Marbles to Greece were intensified in the 1980s by then Greek Minister of Culture [[Melina Mercouri]], and there are now many organisations actively campaigning for the Marbles' return, several united as part of the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]]. The [[Greek government]] itself continues to urge the return of the marbles to [[Athens]] so as to be unified with the remaining marbles and for the complete [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon frieze sequence]] to be restored, through diplomatic, political and legal means.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-greece-marbles/greece-wants-parthenon-marbles-back-tsipras-tells-may-idUSKBN1JM2T6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[UNESCO]] offered to mediate between Greece and the [[United Kingdom]] to resolve the dispute, although this was later turned down by the British Museum on the basis that UNESCO works with government bodies, not trustees of museums.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Letter to British Government for the return of Parthenon's Marbles"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iemc-unesco.org/unesco-letter-to-british-government-for-the-return-of-parthenons-marbles/ |title=UNESCO Letter to British Government for the return of Parthenon's Marbles |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK has not written back to UNESCO Letter"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CLT/19_ICPRCP_Recommendations_en_final.pdf |title=UK has not written back to UNESCO Letter |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elgin Marbles: UK declines mediation over Parthenon sculptures|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32204548|website=BBC News|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1798 the Earl of Elgin was appointed as "Ambassador Extraordinary and [[Plenipotentiary|Minister Plenipotentiary]] of His Britannic Majesty to the Sublime Porte of [[Selim III]], Sultan of Turkey" (Greece was then [[Ottoman Greece|part of the Ottoman Empire]]). Before his departure to take up the post he had approached officials of the British government to inquire if they would be interested in employing artists to take casts and drawings of the sculptured portions of the Parthenon. According to Lord Elgin, "the answer of the Government&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;was entirely negative."&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt;

Lord Elgin decided to carry out the work himself, and employed artists to take casts and drawings under the supervision of the [[Parthenopaean Republic|Neapolitan]] court painter, [[Giovanni Battista Lusieri|Giovani Lusieri]].&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt; According to a Turkish local, [[marble]] sculptures that fell were being burned to obtain [[lime (material)|lime]] for building.&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt; Although his original intention was only to document the sculptures, in 1801 Lord Elgin began to remove material from the Parthenon and its surrounding structures&lt;ref name="guardian faq"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jul/21/highereducation.parthenon |title=Elgin Marbles: fact or fiction? |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2004-07-21|accessdate=2009-06-25 | location=London | first=Dorothy | last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the supervision of Lusieri. Pieces were also removed from the [[Erechtheion]], the [[Propylaia]], and the [[Temple of Athena Nike]], all inside the [[Acropolis]].

The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost to Elgin of around £70,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184554/Elgin-Marbles |title=Elgin Marbles |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elgin intended to use the marbles to decorate [[Broomhall House]], his private home near [[Dunfermline]] in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/19/books/books-of-the-times-refueling-the-elgin-marbles-debate.html&lt;/ref&gt; but a costly divorce suit forced him to sell them to settle his debts.&lt;ref&gt;As reported by John E. Simmons in: [https://web.archive.org/web/20170109104920/https://books.google.com/books?id=wCFsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT167&amp;lpg=PT167&amp;dq= Museums: A History], chapter 7, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 07.07.2016 - 326 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Elgin sold the Parthenon Marbles to the British government for less than it cost him to procure them, declining higher offers from other potential buyers, including [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt;

==Description==
{{Main article|Parthenon Frieze|Metopes of the Parthenon}}
The Parthenon Marbles acquired by Elgin include some 21 figures from the statuary from the east and west [[pediment]]s, 15 of an original 92 [[Metope (architecture)|metope]] panels depicting battles between the [[Lapiths]] and the [[Centaur]]s, as well as 75 meters of the [[Parthenon Frieze]] which decorated the horizontal course set above the interior architrave of the temple. As such, they represent more than half of what now remains of the surviving sculptural decoration of the Parthenon.

Elgin's acquisitions also included objects from other buildings on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Athenian Acropolis]]: a [[Caryatid]] from [[Erechtheum]]; four slabs from the parapet frieze of the [[Temple of Athena Nike]]; and a number of other [[Architecture|architectural]] fragments of the Parthenon, Propylaia, Erechtheum, the Temple of Athene Nike, and the [[Treasury of Atreus]].

==Legality of the removal from Athens==
The Acropolis was at that time an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] military fort, so Elgin required special permission to enter the site, the Parthenon, and the surrounding buildings. He stated that he had obtained a [[firman (decree)|firman]] from the [[Sultan]] which allowed his artists to access the site, but he was unable to produce the original documentation. However, Elgin presented a document claimed to be an English translation of an [[Italian language|Italian]] copy made at the time. This document is now kept in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;St Clair, William: Lord Elgin and the Marbles. Oxford University Press, USA, 3 edition (17 July 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Its authenticity has been questioned, as it lacked the formalities characterising edicts from the sultan. Vassilis Demetriades, Professor of Turkish Studies at the University of Crete, has argued that "any expert in Ottoman diplomatic language can easily ascertain that the original of the document which has survived was not a firman".&lt;ref name=firman/&gt; The document was recorded in an appendix of an 1816 parliamentary committee report. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NwUFAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PR1&amp;ots=GiMElOqrbf&amp;dq=lord%20elgin%20testified%201816%20british%20parliamentary%20committee&amp;hl=el&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=lord%20elgin%20testified%201816%20british%20parliamentary%20committee&amp;f=false  'The committee permission'] had convened to examine a request by Elgin asking the British government to purchase the Marbles. The report said that the document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parthenon.newmentor.net/firman.htm|title=firman|work=newmentor.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the appendix was an accurate translation, in English, of an Ottoman firman dated July 1801. In Elgin's view it amounted to an Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles. The committee was told that the original document was given to Ottoman officials in Athens in 1801. Researchers have so far failed to locate it despite the fact that the Ottoman archives in Istanbul still hold a number of similar documents dating from the same period.&lt;ref name=Nation/&gt;

The parliamentary record shows that the Italian copy of the firman was not presented to the committee by Elgin himself but by one of his associates, the clergyman Rev. [[Philip Hunt (priest)|Philip Hunt]]. Hunt, who at the time resided in Bedford, was the last witness to appear before the committee and stated that he had in his possession an Italian translation of the Ottoman original. He went on to explain that he had not brought the document, because, upon leaving Bedford, he was not aware that he was to testify as a witness. The English document in the parliamentary report was filed by Hunt, but the committee was not presented with the Italian translation in Hunt's possession. William St. Clair, a contemporary biographer of Lord Elgin, said he possessed Hunt's Italian document and "vouches for the accuracy of the English translation". The committee report states on page 69 "(Signed with a signet.) Seged Abdullah Kaimacan" - however, the document presented to the committee was "an English translation of this purported translation into Italian of the original ''firman''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kate Fitz |last=Gibbon |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |pages=115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had neither signet nor signature on it, a fact corroborated by St. Clair.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Rudenstine |title=Did Elgin cheat the Marbles? |journal=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1967 study by British historian William St. Clair, ''Lord Elgin and the Marbles,'' stated the sultan did not allow the removal of statues and reliefs from the Parthenon. The study judged a clause authorizing the British to take stones “with old inscriptions and figures” probably meant items in the excavations the site, not the art decorating the temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2017/03-04/parthenon-sculptures-british-museum-controversy/?sf72336468=1|title=How the Parthenon Lost Its Marbles|date=2017-03-28|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document allowed Elgin and his team to erect scaffolding so as to make drawings and mouldings in [[chalk]] or [[gypsum]], as well as to measure the remains of the ruined buildings and excavate the foundations which may have become covered in the [''ghiaja'' (meaning gravel, debris)]; and "...that when they wish to take away [''qualche'' (meaning 'some' or 'a few')] pieces of stone with old inscriptions or figures thereon, that no opposition be made thereto". The interpretation of these lines has been questioned even by non-restitutionalists,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal |first=John Henry |last=Merryman |title=Thinking about the Elgin Marbles |journal=[[Michigan Law Review]] |volume=83 |issue=8 |year=1985 |pages=1898–1899 |doi=10.2307/1288954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English translation of the firman {{cite web|url=http://www.greece.org/parthenon/marbles/firman.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510201851/http://www.greece.org/parthenon/marbles/firman.htm |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the word ''qualche'', which in modern language should be translated as ''a few'' but can also mean ''any''. According to non-restitutionalists, further evidence that the removal of the sculptures by Elgin was approved by the Ottoman authorities is shown by a second firman which was required for the shipping of the marbles from the Piraeus.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite book |first=John Henry |last=Merryman |chapter=Whither the Elgin Marbles? |title=Imperialism, Art And Restitution |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have questioned the legality of Elgin's actions, including the legitimacy of the documentation purportedly authorising them. A study by Professor [[David Rudenstine]] of the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] concluded that the premise that Elgin obtained legal title to the marbles, which he then transferred to the British government, "is certainly not established and may well be false".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudenstine |first=David |title=The Legality of Elgin's Taking: A Review Essay of Four Books on the Parthenon Marbles |journal=International Journal of Cultural Property |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=356–376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudenstine's argumentation is partly based on a translation discrepancy he noticed between the surviving Italian document and the English text submitted by Hunt to the parliamentary committee. The text from the committee report reads "We therefore have written this Letter to you, and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English Gentleman, Secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador" but according to the St. Clair Italian document the actual wording is "We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N.N.". In Rudenstine's view, this substitution of "Mr. Philip Hunt" with the initials "N.N." can hardly be a simple mistake. He further argues that the document was presented after the committee's insistence that some form of Ottoman written authorisation for the removal of the marbles be provided, a fact known to Hunt by the time he testified. Thus, according to Rudenstine, "Hunt put himself in a position in which he could simultaneously vouch for the authenticity of the document and explain why he alone had a copy of it fifteen years after he surrendered the original to Ottoman officials in Athens". On two earlier occasions, Elgin stated that the Ottomans gave him written permissions more than once, but that he had "retained none of them." Hunt testified on March 13, and one of the questions asked was "Did you ever see any of the written permissions which were granted to [Lord Elgin] for removing the Marbles from the Temple of Minerva?" to which Hunt answered "yes", adding that he possessed an Italian translation of the original firman. Nonetheless, he did not explain why he had retained the translation for 15 years, whereas Elgin, who had testified two weeks earlier, knew nothing about the existence of any such document.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;

English travel writer [[Edward Daniel Clarke]], an eyewitness, wrote that the [[Dizdar]], the Ottoman fortress commander on the scene, attempted to stop the removal of the metopes but was bribed to allow it to continue.&lt;ref name="Edward Daniel Clarke 1818 223ff"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Edward Daniel Clarke |title= Travels in various Countries of Europe, Asia and Africa Part the Second Greece Egypt and the Holy Land Section the Second Fourth Edition Volume the Sixth |publisher=T.

In contrast, John Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at [[Stanford Law School]] and also Professor of Art at [[Stanford University]], putting aside the discrepancy presented by Rudenstine, argues that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable. The Ottoman [[sultan]] was grateful to the British for repelling [[Napoleon]]ic expansion, and the Parthenon marbles had no sentimental value to him.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; Further, that written permission exists in the form of the firman, which is the most formal kind of permission available from that government, and that Elgin had further permission to export the marbles, legalises his (and therefore the British Museum's) claim to the Marbles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; He does note, though, that the clause concerning the extent of Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles "is at best ambiguous", adding that the document "provides slender authority for the massive removals from the Parthenon&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The reference to 'taking away any pieces of stone' seems incidental, intended to apply to objects found while excavating. That was certainly the interpretation privately placed on the firman by several of the Elgin party, including Lady Elgin. Publicly, however, a different attitude was taken, and the work of dismantling the sculptures on the Parthenon and packing them for shipment to England began in earnest. In the process, Elgin's party damaged the structure, leaving the Parthenon not only denuded of its sculptures but further ruined by the process of removal. It is certainly arguable that Elgin exceeded the authority granted in the firman in both respects".&lt;ref name="NafzigerPaterson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James A. R.

The issue of firmans of this nature, along with universally required bribes, was not unusual at this time: In 1801 for example, [[Edward Daniel Clarke|Edward Clarke]] and his assistant Cripps, obtained an authorisation from the governor of Athens for the removal of a statue of the goddess [[Demeter]] which was at [[Eleusis]], with the intervention of Italian artist [[Giovanni Battista Lusieri]] who was Lord Elgin's assistant at the time.&lt;ref name="Fagan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Fagan|title=From Stonehenge to Samarkand: An Anthology of Archaeological Travel Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-f-24-8negC&amp;pg=PA54|date=20 July 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516091-8|page=54|quote=Clarke and Cripps greatly admired the statue, which weighed over 2 tons (1.8 tonnes) and decided to take it to England.

==Contemporary reaction{{anchor | Criticism by Elgin's contemporaries}}==
[[File:Temporary Elgin Room at the Museum in 1819.jpg|thumb|300px|A portrait depicting the Elgin Marbles in a temporary Elgin Room at the [[British Museum]] surrounded by museum staff, a trustee and visitors, 1819]]
When the marbles were shipped to England, they were "an instant success among many"&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; who admired the sculptures and supported their arrival, but both the sculptures and Elgin also received criticism from detractors. Lord Elgin began negotiations for the sale of the collection to the British Museum in 1811, but negotiations failed despite the support of British artists&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; after the government showed little interest. Many Britons opposed purchase of the statues because they were in bad condition and therefore did not display the "ideal beauty" found in other sculpture collections.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;  The following years marked an increased interest in classical Greece, and in June 1816, after parliamentary hearings, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] offered £35,000 in exchange for the sculptures. Even at the time the acquisition inspired much debate, although it was supported by "many persuasive calls" for the purchase.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

[[Lord Byron]] strongly objected to the removal of the marbles from [[Greece]], denouncing Elgin as a vandal.&lt;ref name=BritA/&gt; His point of view about the removal of the Marbles from Athens is also mentioned in his narrative poem ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'', published in 1812, which itself was largely inspired by Byron's travels around the Mediterranean and the [[Aegean Sea]] between 1809 and 1811:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elginism.com/20040720/90/ |title=The story of the Elgin Marbles
|publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2004-07-14 |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Dull is the eye that will not weep to see
:Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed
:By British hands, which it had best behoved
:To guard those relics ne'er to be restored.
:Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved,
:And once again thy hapless bosom gored,
:And snatch'd thy shrinking gods to northern climes abhorred!

Byron was not the only one to protest against the removal at the time:
:"The Honourable Lord has taken advantage of the most unjustifiable means and has committed the most flagrant pillages. It was, it seems, fatal that a representative of our country loot those objects that the Turks and other barbarians had considered sacred," said [[Sir John Newport, 1st Baronet|Sir John Newport]].&lt;ref name="newsweek stones"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/200852 |title=Romancing the Stones |publisher=Newsweek |date= |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Daniel Clarke]] witnessed the removal of the metopes and called the action a "spoliation", writing that "thus the form of the temple has sustained a greater injury than it had already experienced from the Venetian artillery," and that "neither was there a workman employed in the undertaking ... who did not express his concern that such havoc should be deemed necessary, after moulds and casts had been already made of all the sculpture which it was designed to remove."&lt;ref name="Edward Daniel Clarke 1818 223ff"/&gt; When Sir [[Francis Ronalds]] visited Athens and [[Giovanni Battista Lusieri]] in 1820, he wrote that "If Lord Elgin had possessed real taste in lieu of a covetous spirit he would have done just the reverse of what he has, he would have removed the rubbish and left the antiquities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sirfrancisronalds.co.uk/athens.html|title=Sir Francis Ronalds' Travel Journal: Athens|website=Sir Francis Ronalds and his Family|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A parliamentary committee investigating the situation concluded that the monuments were best given "asylum" under a "free government" such as the British one.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; In 1810, Elgin published a defence of his actions,&lt;ref name=BritB/&gt; but the subject remained controversial.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;!-- Obviously they're controversial now, but citation needed that they remained controversial in Britain at that time.--&gt; [[John Keats]] viewed them in 1817 when they were exhibited in the British Museum, hence his famous [[sonnet]] about the marbles titled "On Seeing the Elgin Marbles". Notable supporters of Elgin included the painter [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]].&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

A public debate in Parliament followed Elgin's publication, and Parliament again exonerated Elgin's actions. Parliament decided to purchase the marbles for the "British nation" in 1816 by a vote of 82–30 for £35,000.&lt;ref name=BritA/&gt; They were deposited in the British Museum, where they were displayed in the Elgin Saloon (constructed in 1832), until the [[Duveen Gallery]] was completed in 1939. Crowds packed the British Museum to view the sculptures, setting attendance records for the museum.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; [[William Wordsworth]] viewed the marbles at the museum and commented favourably on their aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=William Wordsworth |title=The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth |publisher=W.

==Damage==

===Morosini===
[[File:Elgin Marbles east pediment.jpg|thumb|East Pediment]]
Prior damage to the marbles was sustained during successive wars, and it was during such conflicts that the Parthenon and its artwork sustained, by far, the most extensive damage. In particular, an explosion ignited by [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]] gun and cannon-fire bombardment in 1687, whilst the Parthenon was used as a munitions store during the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman rule]], destroyed or damaged many pieces of Parthenon art, including some of that later taken by Lord Elgin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/198 |title=Stanford Archaeopedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314025855/http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/198 |archivedate=14 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this explosion that sent the marble roof, most of the [[cella]] walls, 14 columns from the north and south [[peristyle]]s, and carved metopes and frieze blocks flying and crashing to the ground, destroying much of the artwork. Further damage to the Parthenon's artwork occurred when the Venetian general [[Francesco Morosini]] looted the site of its larger sculptures. The tackle he was using to remove the sculptures proved to be faulty and snapped, dropping an over-life-sized sculpture of [[Poseidon]] and the horses of [[Athena]]'s chariot from the west pediment on to the rock of the Acropolis {{convert|40|ft}} below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521820936&amp;ss=exc|title=The Parthenon|work=cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of Independence===
The [[Erechtheion]] was used as a munitions store by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] during the [[Greek War of Independence]]&lt;ref name=Erechtheion&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 |title=History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203021650/http://www.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 |archivedate=3 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1821–1833) which ended the 355-year Ottoman rule of Athens. The Acropolis was besieged twice during the war, first [[Siege of the Acropolis (1821–22)|by the Greeks]] in 1821–22 and then [[Siege of the Acropolis (1826–27)|by the Ottoman forces]] in 1826–27. During the first siege the besieged Ottoman forces attempted to melt the lead in the columns to cast bullets, even prompting the Greeks to offer their own bullets to the Ottomans in order to minimize damage.&lt;ref name=Hitchens&gt;Hitchens Christopher, ''The Elgin Marbles: Should They Be Returned to Greece?'', 1998, p.viii, {{ISBN|1-85984-220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elgin===
Elgin consulted with Italian sculptor [[Antonio Canova]] in 1803 about how best to restore the marbles. Canova was considered by some to be the world's best sculptural restorer of the time; Elgin wrote that Canova declined to work on the marbles for fear of damaging them further.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

To facilitate transport by Elgin, the columns' capitals and many metopes and frieze slabs were either hacked off the main structure or sawn and sliced into smaller sections, causing irreparable damage to the Parthenon itself.&lt;ref name="Greek Ministry of Culture: Memorandum on the Parthenon Marbles"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yppo.gr/4/marm/memorandum-gr.pdf |title=Greek Government's Memorandum |publisher=Greek Ministry of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/arts/design/28ouro.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin Where Gods Yearn for Long-Lost Treasures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016235933/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/arts/design/28ouro.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin |date=16 October 2015 }}, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; One shipload of marbles on board the British brig ''Mentor'' &lt;ref name="The Wreck of the Mentor on the Coast of the Island of Kythera and the Operation to Retrieve, Salvage, and Transport the Parthenon Sculptures to London"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/376886/_The_Wreck_of_the_Mentor_on_the_Coast_of_the_Island_of_Kythera_and_the_Operation_to_Retrieve_Salvage_and_Transport_the_Parthenon_Sculptures_to_London_1802-1805_ |title=The Wreck of the Mentor on the Coast of the Island of Kythera and the Operation to Retrieve, Salvage, and Transport the Parthenon Sculptures to London (1802-1805) |publisher=Arts Books, Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt; was caught in a storm off [[Cape Matapan]] in southern Greece and sank near [[Kythera]], but was salvaged at the Earl's personal expense;&lt;ref name="British Museum releases"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/parthenon_sculptures/parthenon_-_facts_and_figures.aspx |title=The Parthenon Sculptures |publisher=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; it took two years to bring them to the surface.

The artefacts held in London suffered from 19th-century pollution which persisted until the mid-20th century and have suffered irreparable damage by previous cleaning methods employed by British Museum staff.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Oddy, Andrew]], "The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975", in ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.145–146, Quote: "However, for a short time in the late 1930s copper scrapers were used to remove areas of discolouration from the surface of the Elgin Marbles. New information is presented about this lamentable episode."&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1838, scientist [[Michael Faraday]] was asked to provide a solution to the problem of the deteriorating surface of the marbles. The outcome is described in the following excerpt from the letter he sent to Henry Milman, a commissioner for the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Oddy, Andrew]], "The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975", in ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, I., '"Sir, they are scrubbing the Elgin Marbles!"&amp;nbsp;– some controversial cleanings of the Parthenon Sculptures', ''Minerva'' 10(6) (1999) 43-45.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The marbles generally were very dirty&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;from a deposit of dust and soot.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;I found the body of the marble beneath the surface white.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The application of water, applied by a sponge or soft cloth, removed the coarsest dirt.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The use of fine, gritty powder, with the water and rubbing, though it more quickly removed the upper dirt, left much embedded in the cellular surface of the marble. I then applied alkalies, both carbonated and caustic; these quickened the loosening of the surface dirt&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;but they fell far short of restoring the marble surface to its proper hue and state of cleanliness. I finally used dilute nitric acid, and even this failed.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The examination has made me despair of the possibility of presenting the marbles in the British Museum in that state of purity and whiteness which they originally possessed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further effort to clean the marbles ensued in 1858. [[Richard Westmacott]], who was appointed superintendent of the "moving and cleaning the sculptures" in 1857, in a letter approved by the British Museum Standing Committee on 13 March 1858 concluded&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Oddy, Andrew]], "The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975", in ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.148&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think it my duty to say that some of the works are much damaged by ignorant or careless moulding&amp;nbsp;– with oil and lard&amp;nbsp;– and by restorations in wax and resin. These mistakes have caused discolouration. I shall endeavour to remedy this without, however, having recourse to any composition that can injure the surface of the marble.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Yet another effort to clean the marbles occurred in 1937–38. This time the incentive was provided by the construction of a new Gallery to house the collection. The Pentelic marble mined from [[Mount Pentelicus]] north of Athens, from which the sculptures are made, naturally acquires a tan colour similar to honey when exposed to air; this colouring is often known as the marble's "patina"&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Ernest Arthur: A Handbook of Greek Sculpture.

The tools used were seven scrapers, one chisel and a piece of [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]] stone. They are now deposited in the British Museum's Department of Preservation.&lt;ref name="oddy149"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMScandal&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/543077.stm|title=Museum admits 'scandal' of Elgin Marbles|work=[[BBC News Online]] | date=1999-12-01 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cleaning process scraped away some of the detailed tone of many carvings.&lt;ref&gt;Paterakis AB.

The British Museum has responded with the statement that "mistakes were made at that time."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/parthenon/article/0,,195563,00.html mistakes were made at that time]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605154549/http://www.guardian.co.uk/parthenon/article/0%2C%2C195563%2C00.html |date=5 June 2008 }}, ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion it was said that "the damage had been exaggerated for political reasons" and that "the Greeks were guilty of excessive cleaning of the marbles before they were brought to Britain."&lt;ref name=BMScandal/&gt; During the international symposium on the cleaning of the marbles, organised by the British Museum in 1999, curator [[Ian Jenkins (curator)|Ian Jenkins]], deputy keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities, remarked that "The British Museum is not infallible, it is not the Pope. Its history has been a series of good intentions marred by the occasional cock-up, and the 1930s cleaning was such a cock-up". Nonetheless, he claimed that the prime cause for the damage inflicted upon the marbles was the 2000-year-long weathering on the Acropolis.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/01/maevkennedy |title=Mutual attacks mar Elgin Marbles debate | work=[[The Guardian]]

American archeologist [[Dorothy King]], in a newspaper article, wrote that techniques similar to the ones used in 1937–38 were applied by Greeks as well in more recent decades than the British, and maintained that Italians still find them acceptable.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; The British Museum said that a similar cleaning of the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Athenian Agora]] was carried out by the conservation team of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;J. M. Cook and John Boardman, "Archaeology in Greece, 1953", The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 74, (1954), pp. 147&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953 using steel chisels and brass wire.&lt;ref name="British Museum releases"/&gt; According to the Greek ministry of Culture, the cleaning was carefully limited to surface salt crusts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; The 1953 American report concluded that the techniques applied were aimed at removing the black deposit formed by rain-water and "brought out the high technical quality of the carving" revealing at the same time "a few surviving particles of colour".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

Documents released by the British Museum under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] revealed that a series of minor accidents, thefts and acts of [[vandalism]] by visitors have inflicted further damage to the sculptures.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Hastings, Chris.

==Relocation debate==

===Rationale for returning to Athens===

Those arguing for the Marbles' return claim legal, moral and artistic grounds. Their arguments include:

* The main stated aim of the Greek campaign is to reunite the Parthenon sculptures around the world in order to restore "organic elements" which "at present remain without cohesion, homogeneity and historicity of the monument to which they belong" and allow visitors to better appreciate them as a whole;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://odysseus.culture.gr/a/1/12/ea121.html |title=Hellenic Ministry of Culture, Special Issues |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017204203/http://odysseus.culture.gr/a/1/12/ea121.html |archivedate=17 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicoletta Divari-Valakou 2008"&gt;Nicoletta Divari-Valakou, (Director of the Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of Athens), "Revisiting the Parthenon: National Heritage in the Age of Globalism" in Mille Gabriel &amp; Jens Dahl, (eds.)

The debate hits Sydney"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sydney.edu.au/senate/documents/History/Elgin_marbles_articles.pdf |title=Debate of the Elgin Marbles |publisher=University of Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Precedents have been set with the return of fragments of the monument by [[Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6138214.stm |title= Swede gives back Acropolis marble | work=[[BBC News Online]]  | date=2006-11-10 | accessdate=2010-01-03 | first=Malcolm | last=Brabant}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Heidelberg]], [[Germany]],&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/09/05/parthenon-marbles.html |title=Greece reclaims Parthenon sculpture from Germany |work=CBC News |date=2006-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527154618/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/09/05/parthenon-marbles.html |archivedate=27 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]]&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; and the [[Holy See|Vatican]];&lt;ref name=VAT&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tanea.gr/default.asp?pid=2&amp;artid=1407815&amp;ct=4 |title=TA NEA On-line |publisher=Tanea.gr |accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Returning the Parthenon sculptures (it should be noted that Greece is requesting only the return of sculptures from this particular building) would not set a precedent for other restitution claims because of the distinctively "universal value" of the Parthenon;&lt;ref&gt;Nicoletta Divari-Valakou, (Director of the Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of Athens), "Revisiting the Parthenon: National Heritage in the Age of Globalism" in Mille Gabriel &amp; Jens Dahl, (eds.)

* Safekeeping of the marbles would be ensured at the New [[Acropolis Museum]], situated to the south of the Acropolis hill. It was built to hold the Parthenon sculpture in natural sunlight that characterises the Athenian climate, arranged in the same way as they would have been on the Parthenon. The museum's facilities have been equipped with state-of-the-art technology for the protection and preservation of exhibits;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcspace.com/architects/Tschumi/|title=Bernard Tschumi Architects|work=arcspace.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051614/http://www.arcspace.com/architects/Tschumi/|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The friezes are part of a single work of art, thus it was unintended that fragments of this piece be scattered across different locations;
* Casts of the marbles would be just as able to demonstrate the cultural influences which Greek sculptures have had upon European art as would the original marbles, whereas the context with which the marbles belong cannot be replicated within the British museum;
* A poll suggested that more British people (37%) supported  the marbles' restoration to Greece than opposed it (23%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/10/18/british-people-tend-want-elgin-marbles-returned/|title=British people tend to want Elgin marbles returned|newspaper=Yougov.co.uk|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationale for retaining in London===
A range of different arguments have been presented by scholars,&lt;ref name="newsweek stones"/&gt; British political leaders and British Museum spokespersons over the years in defence of retention of the Elgin Marbles by the British Museum. The main points include:
* the assertion that fulfilling all restitution claims would empty most of the world's great museums&amp;nbsp;– this has also caused concerns among other European and American museums, with one potential target being the [[Nefertiti Bust|famous bust of Nefertiti]] in [[Berlin]]'s [[Neues Museum]]; in addition, portions of Parthenon marbles are kept by many other European museums.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; Advocates of the British Museum's position also point out that the Marbles in Britain receive about 6 million visitors per year as opposed to 1.5 million visitors to the Acropolis Museum. The removal of the Marbles to Greece would therefore, they argue, significantly reduce the number of people who have the opportunity to visit the Marbles.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/why-returning-the-elgin-marbles-would-be-madness/&lt;/ref&gt; The English Romantic poet John Keats, and the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, are notable examples of visitors to the Elgin Marbles after their removal to England who subsequently produced famous work inspired by them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/elgin-marbles-british-museum-rodin-exhibition-uk-return-parthenon-greece-a8339661.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52305/on-seeing-the-elgin-marbles&lt;/ref&gt;
* the assertion that Greece could mount no court case, because Elgin claims to have been granted permission by what was then Greece's ruling government and [[Statute of limitations|a legal principle of limitation]] would apply, i.e., the ability to pursue claims expires after a period of time prescribed by law;&lt;ref name="newsweek stones"/&gt;
The last was tested in the English High Court in May 2005 in relation to Nazi-looted Old Master artworks held at the British Museum, which the Museum's Trustees wished to return to the family of the original owner; the Court found that due to the [[British Museum Act 1963]] these works could not be returned without further legislation. The judge, [[Andrew Morritt|Mr Justice Morritt]], found that the Act, which protects the collections for posterity, could not be overridden by a "moral obligation" to return works, even if they are believed to have been plundered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/may/27/arts.parthenon Ruling tightens grip on Parthenon marbles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103042358/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/may/27/arts.parthenon |date=3 January 2012 }}, ''The Guardian'', 27 May 2005. Retrieved 5 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Her Majesty's Attorney General v The Trustees of the British Museum, [2005] EWHC (Ch) 1089&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued, however, that the case was not directly relevant to the Elgin Marbles, as it was about a transfer of ownership, and not the loan of artefacts for public exhibition overseas, which is provided for in the 1963 Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elginism.com/20050603/126/|title=Article on the relevance of the Feldmann paintings judgment to the Elgin Marbles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another argument for keeping the Elgin Marbles within the UK has been made by J. H. Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at [[Stanford University]] and co-operating professor in the Stanford Art Department. He has argued that
the Marbles are now established as a significant element of Britain's own cultural history, as "the Elgin Marbles have been in England since 1821 and in that time have become a part of the British cultural heritage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Merryman paper|
url=https://law.wustl.edu/harris/Conferences/imperialism/Merryman_PAPER_FINALelgin2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has also argued that if the Parthenon were actually being restored, there would be a moral argument for returning the Marbles to the temple whence they came, and thus restoring its integrity. ''The Guardian'' has written that many among those who support repatriation imply that the marbles would be displayed in their original position on the Parthenon.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; However, the Greek plan is to transfer them from a museum in London to one in Athens. These arguments are perhaps complicated a little by the completion of the new [[Acropolis Museum]] in 2009, where the
half not removed by Elgin is now displayed, aligned in orientation and within sight of the [[Parthenon]], 
with the position of the missing elements clearly marked and space left should they be returned to [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="acrop museum"/&gt;

==Public perception of the issue==

===Popular support for restitution===
Outside Greece a campaign for the Return of the Marbles began in 1981 with the formation of the ''[https://iocarpm.wordpress.com/ International Organising Committee - Australia - for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles], and in 1983 with the formation of the ''[http://www.parthenonuk.com/ ''British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles'']. International organisations such as [[UNESCO]] and the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]], as well as campaign groups such as, [[Marbles Reunited]], and stars of Hollywood, such as [[George Clooney]] and [[Matt Damon]], as well as Human Rights activists, lawyers, and the people of the arts, voiced their strong support for the return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece.

American actor George Clooney voiced his support for the return by the United Kingdom and reunification of the Parthenon Marbles in Greece, during his promotional campaign for his 2014 film ''[[The Monuments Men]]'' which retells the story of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] efforts to save important masterpieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by [[Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] during [[World War II]]. His remarks regarding the Marbles reignited the debate in the United Kingdom about their return to their home country. Public polls were also carried out by newspapers in response to Clooney's stance on this matter.

An internet campaign site,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bringthemback.org |title=Bring Them Back |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part sponsored by [[Metaxa]], aims to consolidate support for the return of the Elgin Marbles to the New Acropolis Museum in Athens.

Noted public intellectual [[Christopher Hitchens]] had, at numerous times, argued for their repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2009/07/hitchens200907 |title=The Lovely Stones |accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In BBC TV Series ''[[QI]]'' (S12E07XL), host [[Stephen Fry]] provided his support for the return of the Elgin Marbles while recounting the story of the Greeks giving lead shot to their [[Ottoman Empire]] enemies, as the Ottomans were running out of ammunition, in order to prevent damage to the Acropolis. Fry had previously written a blog post along much the same lines in December 2011 entitled "A Modest Proposal", signing off with "It's time we lost our marbles"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stephenfry.com/2011/12/19/a-modest-proposal/ |title=A Modest Proposal |accessdate=2014-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Opinion polls===
A [[YouGov]] poll in 2014 suggested that more British people (37%) supported  the marbles' restoration to Greece than opposed it (23%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/10/18/british-people-tend-want-elgin-marbles-returned/|title=British people tend to want Elgin marbles returned|newspaper=Yougov.co.uk|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In older polls, [[Ipsos MORI]] asked in 1998, "If there were a referendum on whether or not the Elgin Marbles should be returned to Greece, how would you vote?" This  returned these values from the British general adult population:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=2001|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126092318/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=2001|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-26|title=

*40% in favour of returning the marbles to Greece
*15% in favour of keeping them at the British Museum
*18% would not vote
*27% had no opinion

Another opinion poll in 2002 (again carried out by MORI) showed similar results, with 40% of the British public in favour of returning the marbles to Greece, 16% in favour of keeping them within Britain and the remainder either having no opinion or would not vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=1053|title=Return Of The Parthenon Marbles|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=18 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409021725/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=1053|archivedate=9 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked how they would vote if a number of conditions were met (including, but not limited to, a long-term loan whereby the British maintained ownership and joint control over maintenance) the number responding in favour of return increased to 56% and those in favour of keeping them dropped to 7%.

Both MORI poll results have been characterised by proponents of the return of the Marbles to Greece as representing a groundswell of public opinion supporting return, since the proportion explicitly supporting return to Greece significantly exceeds the number who are explicitly in favour of keeping the Marbles at the British Museum.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stosacucine.pk/ |title=Opinion poll: Majority of Britons favor return of Parthenon Marbles |work=stosacucine.pk |date= |accessdate=2009-01-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615202701/http://stosacucine.pk/ |archivedate=15 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the surviving sculptures that are not in museums or storerooms in Athens are held in museums in various locations across Europe. The British Museum also holds additional fragments from the Parthenon sculptures acquired from various collections that have no connection with Lord Elgin.

The collection held in the British Museum includes the following material from the Acropolis:
*Parthenon: {{convert|247|ft|m|abbr=on}} of the original {{convert|524|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[frieze]]
**15 of the 92 metopes

==British Museum loan==

The British Museum lent the figure of a river-god, possibly the river [[Ilissos]],
to the [[Hermitage Museum|State Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] to celebrate its 250th
anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/12/05/loan-of-a-parthenon-sculpture-to-the-hermitage-a-marble-ambassador-of-a-european-ideal/ |title=Loan to the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg |publisher=britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231192906/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/12/05/loan-of-a-parthenon-sculpture-to-the-hermitage-a-marble-ambassador-of-a-european-ideal/ |archivedate=31 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on display there from Saturday 6 December 2014 until Sunday 18 January 2015.

==Labour party leader stance and new dimensions to the dispute caused by Brexit==
In a 2018 interview to the Athens newspaper [[Ta Nea]], quoted later in [[The Independent]], the British [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] vowed to return the Marbles to Greece, stating
&lt;blockquote&gt;

'''Epidemiology''' is the study and analysis of the distribution (who, when, and where) and [[risk factor|determinants]] of health and disease conditions in defined [[population]]s.

It is the cornerstone of [[public health]], and shapes policy decisions and [[evidence-based practice]] by identifying [[risk factor]]s for disease and targets for [[preventive healthcare]]. Epidemiologists help with study design, collection, and [[statistical analysis]] of data, amend interpretation and dissemination of results (including [[peer review]] and occasional [[systematic review]]). Epidemiology has helped develop [[methodology]] used in [[clinical research]], [[public health]] studies, and, to a lesser extent, [[basic research]] in the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miquel Porta |title=A Dictionary of Epidemiology |url=http://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-dictionary-of-epidemiology-9780199976737?cc=us&amp;lang=en |edition=6th |year=2014 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-997673-7 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major areas of epidemiological study include disease causation, [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]], [[outbreak]] investigation, [[disease surveillance]], [[forensic epidemiology]], [[occupational epidemiology]], [[screening (medicine)|screening]], [[biomonitoring]], and comparisons of treatment effects such as in [[clinical trials]]. Epidemiologists rely on other scientific disciplines like [[biology]] to better understand disease processes, [[statistics]] to make efficient use of the data and draw appropriate conclusions, [[social science]]s to better understand proximate and distal causes, and [[engineering]] for [[exposure assessment]].

== Etymology ==
''Epidemiology'', literally meaning "the study of what is upon the people", is derived {{ety|gre|epi|upon, among||[[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]]|people, district||[[logos]]|study, word, discourse}}, suggesting that it applies only to human populations. However, the term is widely used in studies of zoological populations (veterinary epidemiology), although the term "[[epizoology]]" is available, and it has also been applied to studies of plant populations (botanical or [[plant disease epidemiology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Nutter, Jr. |first= F.W. |title= Understanding the interrelationships between botanical, human, and veterinary epidemiology: the Ys and Rs of it all |journal= Ecosys Health |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=131–40 |year=1999 |doi=10.1046/j.1526-0992.1999.09922.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between "epidemic" and "endemic" was first drawn by [[Hippocrates]],&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates. (~200BC). Airs, Waters, Places.&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish between diseases that are "visited upon" a population (epidemic) from those that "reside within" a population (endemic).&lt;ref name="Carol Buck 1998 p3"&gt;Carol Buck, Alvaro Llopis, Enrique Nájera, Milton Terris. (1998). The Challenge of Epidemiology: Issues and Selected Readings. Scientific Publication No. 505. Pan American Health Organization. Washington, DC. p3.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "epidemiology" appears to have first been used to describe the study of epidemics in 1802 by the Spanish physician Villalba in ''Epidemiología Española''.&lt;ref name="Carol Buck 1998 p3"/&gt; Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population, a condition known as a [[syndemic]].

The term epidemiology is now widely applied to cover the description and causation of not only epidemic disease, but of disease in general, and even many non-disease, health-related conditions, such as high blood pressure and [[obesity]]. Therefore, this epidemiology is based upon how the pattern of the disease causes change in the function of everyone.

Merrill |year=2010 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |page=24 |isbn=0-7637-6622-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippocrates believed sickness of the human body to be caused by an imbalance of the four [[humorism|humors]] (air, fire, water and earth “atoms”). The cure to the sickness was to remove or add the humor in question to balance the body. This belief led to the application of bloodletting and dieting in medicine.&lt;ref name="Merril, Ray M. 2010"&gt;Merril, Ray M., PhD, MPH. "An Introduction to Epidemiology, Fifth Edition".

Web. 17 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He coined the terms [[Endemic (epidemiology)|''endemic'']] (for diseases usually found in some places but not in others) and ''[[epidemic]]'' (for diseases that are seen at some times but not others).&lt;ref name="hip"&gt;{{cite web |title=Changing Concepts: Background to Epidemiology |publisher=Duncan &amp; Associates |url=http://www.duncan-associates.com/changing_concepts.pdf |accessdate= 3 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern era ===
{{See also|History of emerging infectious diseases}}
In the middle of the 16th century, a doctor from [[Verona]] named [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] was the first to propose a theory that these very small, unseeable, particles that cause disease were alive. They were considered to be able to spread by air, multiply by themselves and to be destroyable by fire. In this way he refuted [[Galen]]'s [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]] (poison gas in sick people). In 1543 he wrote a book ''[[De contagione et contagiosis morbis]]'', in which he was the first to promote personal and environmental [[hygiene]] to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a [[germ theory of disease]].

[[Wu Youke]] (1582–1652) developed the concept that some diseases were caused by transmissible agents, which he called liqi (pestilential factors). His book Wenyi Lun (Treatise on Acute Epidemic Febrile Diseases) can be regarded as the main etiological work that brought forward the concept, ultimately attributed to Westerners, of germs as a cause of epidemic diseases (source: http://baike.baidu.com/view/143117.htm). His concepts are still considered in current scientific research in relation to Traditional Chinese Medicine studies (see: http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js6170e/4.html).

Another pioneer, [[Thomas Sydenham]] (1624–1689), was the first to distinguish the fevers of Londoners in the later 1600s. His theories on cures of fevers met with much resistance from traditional physicians at the time. He was not able to find the initial cause of the [[smallpox]] fever he researched and treated.&lt;ref name="Merril, Ray M. 2010"/&gt;

[[File:Snow-cholera-map.jpg|thumb|350px|Original map by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] showing the [[cluster (epidemiology)|cluster]]s of cholera cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|London epidemic of 1854]].]]
[[John Graunt]], a [[haberdasher]] and amateur statistician, published ''Natural and Political Observations ... upon the Bills of Mortality'' in 1662. In it, he analysed the mortality rolls in [[London]] before the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]], presented one of the first [[life tables]], and reported time trends for many diseases, new and old. He provided statistical evidence for many theories on disease, and also refuted some widespread ideas on them.

[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] is famous for his investigations into the causes of the 19th century cholera epidemics, and is also known as the father of (modern) epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/fatherofepidemiology.html Doctor John Snow Blames Water Pollution for Cholera Epidemic, by David Vachon] UCLA Department of Epidemlology, School of Public Health May &amp; June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3935461 John Snow, Father of Epidemiology] NPR Talk of the Nation. 24 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He began with noticing the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Company. His identification of the [[Broadwick Street|Broad Street]] pump as the cause of the Soho epidemic is considered the classic example of epidemiology. Snow used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and removed the handle; this ended the outbreak. This has been perceived as a major event in the history of [[public health]] and regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology, having helped shape public health policies around the world.&lt;ref&gt;

Other pioneers include Danish physician [[Peter Anton Schleisner]], who in 1849 related his work on the prevention of the epidemic of [[neonatal tetanus]] on the [[Vestmanna Islands]] in [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ólöf Garðarsdóttir |author2=Loftur Guttormsson |title=An isolated case of early medical intervention.

His findings were published in 1850, but his work was ill-received by his colleagues, who discontinued the procedure. Disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] 'discovered' [[antiseptics]] in 1865 in light of the work of [[Louis Pasteur]].

In the early 20th century, mathematical methods were introduced into epidemiology by [[Ronald Ross]], [[Janet Lane-Claypon]], [[Anderson Gray McKendrick]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6DD1FKq6fFoC&amp;lpg=PA323&amp;pg=PA323#v=onepage&amp;q=mathematical%20methods%20were%20introduced%20into%20epidemiology%2020th%20century%20ross Statisticians of the centuries].

Heyde, Eugene Senet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://statprob.com/encyclopedia/AndersonGrayMcKENDRICK.html Anderson Gray McKendrick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822114404/http://statprob.com/encyclopedia/AndersonGrayMcKENDRICK.html |date=22 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economics.soton.ac.uk/staff/aldrich/Hardy%20and%20Magnello.pdf Statistical methods in epidemiology: Karl Pearson, Ronald Ross, Major Greenwood and Austin Bradford Hill, 1900 – 1945.

Another breakthrough was the 1954 publication of the results of a [[British Doctors Study]], led by [[Richard Doll]] and [[Austin Bradford Hill]], which lent very strong statistical support to the link between [[tobacco smoking]] and [[lung cancer]].

In the late 20th century, with advancement of biomedical sciences, a number of molecular markers in blood, other biospecimens and environment were identified as predictors of development or risk of a certain disease. Epidemiology research to examine the relationship between these [[biomarker]]s analyzed at the molecular level, and disease was broadly named “[[molecular epidemiology]]”. Specifically, "[[genetic epidemiology]]" has been used for epidemiology of germline genetic variation and disease. Genetic variation is typically determined using DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. Since the 2000s, [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]] (GWAS) have been commonly performed to identify genetic risk factors for many diseases and health conditions.

While most molecular epidemiology studies are still using conventional disease [[diagnosis]] and classification systems, it is increasingly recognized that disease progression represents inherently heterogeneous processes differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual (“the unique disease principle”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E | year = 2012 | title = How many molecular subtypes? Implications of the unique tumor principle in personalized medicine | url = | journal = Expert Rev Mol Diagn | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 621–8 | doi=10.1586/erm.12.46 | pmid=22845482 | pmc=3492839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Lochhead P, Chan AT, Nishihara R, Cho E, Wolpin BM, Meyerhardt JA, Meissner A, Schernhammer ES, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E | year = 2013 | title = Molecular pathological epidemiology of epigenetics: Emerging integrative science to analyze environment, host, and disease | url = | journal = Mod Pathol | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 465–84 | doi=10.1038/modpathol.2012.214 | pmid=23307060 | pmc=3637979}}&lt;/ref&gt; considering uniqueness of the [[exposome]] (a totality of endogenous and exogenous / environmental exposures) and its unique influence on molecular pathologic process in each individual. Studies to examine the relationship between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly [[cancer]]) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of [[molecular pathology]] in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of research guidelines and standardized [[Statistics|statistical]] methodologies, and paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, King EE, Beck AH, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E | year = 2012 | title = Interdisciplinary education to integrate pathology and epidemiology: Towards molecular and population-level health science | url = | journal = Am J Epidemiol | volume = 176 | issue = | pages = 659–67 | doi=10.1093/aje/kws226| pmc = 3571252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the long-standing premise in epidemiology that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes. To resolve these issues and advance population health science in the era of molecular [[precision medicine]], “[[molecular pathology]]” and “epidemiology” was integrated to create a new interdisciplinary field of “[[molecular pathological epidemiology]]” (MPE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Stampfer M | year = 2010 | title = Lifestyle factors and microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer: the evolving field of molecular pathological epidemiology | url = | journal = J Natl Cancer Inst | volume = 102 | issue = | pages = 365–7 | doi=10.1093/jnci/djq031 | pmid=20208016 | pmc=2841039}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Chan AT, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E | year = 2011 | title = Molecular pathological epidemiology of colorectal neoplasia: an emerging transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary field | url = | journal = Gut | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 397–411 | doi=10.1136/gut.2010.217182 | pmid=21036793 | pmc=3040598}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined as “epidemiology of [[molecular pathology]] and heterogeneity of disease”. In MPE, investigators analyze the relationships between; (A) environmental, dietary, lifestyle and genetic factors; (B) alterations in cellular or extracellular molecules; and (C) evolution and progression of disease. A better understanding of heterogeneity of disease [[pathogenesis]] will further contribute to elucidate [[Etiology|etiologies]] of disease.

== Types of studies ==
{{Main|Study design}}
Epidemiologists employ a range of study designs from the observational to experimental and generally categorized as descriptive, analytic (aiming to further examine known associations or hypothesized relationships), and experimental (a term often equated with clinical or community trials of treatments and other interventions). In observational studies, nature is allowed to “take its course," as epidemiologists observe from the sidelines. Conversely, in experimental studies, the epidemiologist is the one in control of all of the factors entering a certain case study.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology 2009"&gt;"Principles of Epidemiology." Key Concepts in Public Health. London: Sage UK, 2009. Credo Reference. 1 August 2011. Web. 30 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemiological studies are aimed, where possible, at revealing unbiased relationships between [[Exposure Assessment#Exposure|exposures]] such as alcohol or smoking, [[infections|biological agents]], [[stress (medicine)|stress]], or [[Chemical compound|chemicals]] to [[death|mortality]] or [[morbidity]]. The identification of causal relationships between these exposures and outcomes is an important aspect of epidemiology. Modern epidemiologists use [[Health informatics|informatics]] as a tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garzia|first=Nichole A.|last2=Spinelli|first2=John J.|last3=Gotay|first3=Carolyn C.|last4=Teschke|first4=Kay|date=2018-07-03|title=Literature review: dermal monitoring data for pesticide exposure assessment of farm workers|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=187–214|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1448734|pmid=30047858|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observational studies have two components, descriptive and analytical. Descriptive observations pertain to the “who, what, where and when of health-related state occurrence”. However, analytical observations deal more with the ‘how’ of a health-related event.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology 2009"/&gt; [[Experimental epidemiology]] contains three case types: randomized controlled trials (often used for new medicine or drug testing), field trials (conducted on those at a high risk of contracting a disease), and community trials (research on social originating diseases).&lt;ref name="Epidemiology 2009"/&gt;

The term 'epidemiologic triad' is used to describe the intersection of ''Host'', ''Agent'', and ''Environment'' in analyzing an outbreak.

=== Case series ===
Case-series may refer to the qualitative study of the experience of a single patient, or small group of patients with a similar diagnosis, or to a statistical factor with the potential to produce illness with periods when they are unexposed.

The former type of study is purely descriptive and cannot be used to make inferences about the general population of patients with that disease. These types of studies, in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patient's history, may lead to a formulation of a new hypothesis. Using the data from the series, analytic studies could be done to investigate possible causal factors. These can include case-control studies or prospective studies. A case-control study would involve matching comparable controls without the disease to the cases in the series. A prospective study would involve following the case series over time to evaluate the disease's natural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hennekens |first1=Charles H. |author2=Julie E. Buring |year=1987 |title=Epidemiology in Medicine |editor=Mayrent, Sherry L. (Ed.) |publisher=Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins |isbn=978-0-316-35636-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter type, more formally described as self-controlled case-series studies, divide individual patient follow-up time into exposed and unexposed periods and use fixed-effects Poisson regression processes to compare the incidence rate of a given outcome between exposed and unexposed periods. This technique has been extensively used in the study of adverse reactions to vaccination and has been shown in some circumstances to provide statistical power comparable to that available in cohort studies.

=== Case-control studies ===
[[case-control study|Case-control studies]] select subjects based on their disease status. It is a retrospective study. A group of individuals that are disease positive (the "case" group) is compared with a group of disease negative individuals (the "control" group). The control group should ideally come from the same population that gave rise to the cases. The case-control study looks back through time at potential exposures that both groups (cases and controls) may have encountered. A 2×2 table is constructed, displaying exposed cases (A), exposed controls (B), unexposed cases (C) and unexposed controls (D). The statistic generated to measure association is the [[odds ratio]] (OR), which is the ratio of the odds of exposure in the cases (A/C) to the odds of exposure in the controls (B/D), i.e. OR = (AD/BC).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 
! Cases
! Controls
|-
| Exposed
| A
| B
|-
| Unexposed
| C
| D
|}

If the OR is significantly greater than 1, then the conclusion is "those with the disease are more likely to have been exposed," whereas if it is close to 1 then the exposure and disease are not likely associated. If the OR is far less than one, then this suggests that the exposure is a protective factor in the causation of the disease.
Case-control studies are usually faster and more cost effective than [[cohort studies]], but are sensitive to bias (such as [[recall bias]] and [[selection bias]]). The main challenge is to identify the appropriate control group; the distribution of exposure among the control group should be representative of the distribution in the population that gave rise to the cases. This can be achieved by drawing a random sample from the original population at risk. This has as a consequence that the control group can contain people with the disease under study when the disease has a high attack rate in a population.

A major drawback for case control studies is that, in order to be considered to be statistically significant, the minimum number of cases required at the 95% confidence interval is related to the odds ratio by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{total cases} = A+C = 1.96^2 (1+N) \left(\frac{1}{\ln(OR)}\right)^2 \left(\frac{OR+2\sqrt{OR}+1}{\sqrt{OR}}\right) \approx 15.5 (1+N) \left(\frac{1}{\ln(OR)}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where N is the ratio of cases to controls.
As the odds ratio approached 1, approaches 0; rendering case control studies all but useless for low odds ratios. For instance, for an odds ratio of 1.5 and cases = controls, the table shown above would look like this:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Cases
! Controls
|-
| Exposed
| 103
| 84
|-
| Unexposed
| 84
| 103
|}

For an odds ratio of 1.1:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Cases
! Controls
|-
| Exposed
| 1732
| 1652
|-
| Unexposed
| 1652
| 1732
|}

=== Cohort studies ===
[[Cohort studies]] select subjects based on their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation at the beginning of the cohort study; this usually means that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be the investigation of a cohort of smokers and non-smokers over time to estimate the incidence of lung cancer. The same 2×2 table is constructed as with the case control study. However, the point estimate generated is the [[relative risk]] (RR), which is the probability of disease for a person in the exposed group, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;(''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B'') over the probability of disease for a person in the unexposed group, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;(''C''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''D''), i.e. ''RR''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! .....
! Case
! Non-case
! Total
|-
| Exposed
| ''A''
| ''B''
| (''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B'')
|-
| Unexposed
| ''C''
| ''D''
| (''C''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''D'')
|}

As with the OR, a RR greater than 1 shows association, where the conclusion can be read "those with the exposure were more likely to develop disease."

Prospective studies have many benefits over case control studies. The RR is a more powerful effect measure than the OR, as the OR is just an estimation of the RR, since true incidence cannot be calculated in a case control study where subjects are selected based on disease status. Temporality can be established in a prospective study, and confounders are more easily controlled for. However, they are more costly, and there is a greater chance of losing subjects to follow-up based on the long time period over which the cohort is followed.

Cohort studies also are limited by the same equation for number of cases as for cohort studies, but, if the base incidence rate in the study population is very low, the number of cases required is reduced by&amp;nbsp;½.

=== Outbreak investigation ===
: ''For information on investigation of [[infectious disease]] outbreaks, please see [[Outbreak#Outbreak investigation|outbreak investigation]].''

== Causal inference ==
{{main|Causal inference}}
Although epidemiology is sometimes viewed as a collection of statistical tools used to elucidate the associations of exposures to health outcomes, a deeper understanding of this science is that of discovering ''causal'' relationships.

"[[Correlation does not imply causation]]" is a common theme for much of the epidemiological literature. For epidemiologists, the key is in the term [[inference]]. Correlation, or at least association between two variables, is  a necessary but not sufficient criteria for inference that one variable causes the other. Epidemiologists use gathered data and a broad range of biomedical and psychosocial theories in an iterative way to generate or expand theory, to test hypotheses, and to make educated, informed assertions about which relationships are causal, and about exactly how they are causal.

Epidemiologists emphasize that the "'''one cause – one effect'''" understanding is a simplistic mis-belief.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Most outcomes, whether disease or death, are caused by a chain or web consisting of many component causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Epidemiology|last=Rothman|first=Kenneth J.|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1986|isbn=0-316-75776-4|location=Boston/Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes can be distinguished as necessary, sufficient or probabilistic conditions. If a necessary condition can be identified and controlled (e.g., antibodies to a disease agent, energy in an injury), the harmful outcome can be avoided (Robertson, 2015).

=== Bradford Hill criteria ===
{{Main|Bradford Hill criteria}}
In 1965, [[Austin Bradford Hill]] proposed a series of considerations to help assess evidence of causation,&lt;ref name="bh65"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hill |first=Austin Bradford |year=1965 |title=The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation? |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine]] |volume=58 |pages=295–300 |url=http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/hill |pmid=14283879 |pmc=1898525 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have come to be commonly known as the "[[Bradford Hill criteria]]". In contrast to the explicit intentions of their author, Hill's considerations are now sometimes taught as a checklist to be implemented for assessing causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=Carl V. |author2=Karen J. Goodman |title=The missed lessons of Sir Austin Bradford Hill |journal=Epidemiologic Perspectives and Innovations |volume=1 |issue=3 |url=http://www.epi-perspectives.com/content/1/1/3 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15507128 |pmc=524370 |doi=10.1186/1742-5573-1-3 |pages=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523185244/http://www.epi-perspectives.com/content/1/1/3 |archivedate=23 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill himself said "None of my nine viewpoints can bring indisputable evidence for or against the cause-and-effect hypothesis and none can be required ''sine qua non''."&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;

# '''Strength of Association''': A small association does not mean that there is not a causal effect, though the larger the association, the more likely that it is causal.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Consistency of Data''': Consistent findings observed by different persons in different places with different samples strengthens the likelihood of an effect.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Specificity''': Causation is likely if a very specific population at a specific site and disease with no other likely explanation. The more specific an association between a factor and an effect is, the bigger the probability of a causal relationship.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Temporality''': The effect has to occur after the cause (and if there is an expected delay between the cause and expected effect, then the effect must occur after that delay).&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Biological gradient''': Greater exposure should generally lead to greater incidence of the effect. However, in some cases, the mere presence of the factor can trigger the effect. In other cases, an inverse proportion is observed: greater exposure leads to lower incidence.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Plausibility''': A plausible mechanism between cause and effect is helpful (but Hill noted that knowledge of the mechanism is limited by current knowledge).&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Coherence''': Coherence between epidemiological and laboratory findings increases the likelihood of an effect. However, Hill noted that "... lack of such [laboratory] evidence cannot nullify the epidemiological effect on associations".&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Experiment''': "Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence".&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Analogy''': The effect of similar factors may be considered.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;

=== Legal interpretation ===
[[Epidemiological study|Epidemiological studies]] can only go to prove that an agent could have caused, but not that it did cause, an effect in any particular case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Epidemiology is concerned with the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of disease in populations and does not address the question of the cause of an individual's disease. This question, sometimes referred to as specific causation, is beyond the domain of the science of epidemiology. Epidemiology has its limits at the point where an inference is made that the relationship between an agent and a disease is causal (general causation) and where the magnitude of excess risk attributed to the agent has been determined; that is, epidemiology addresses whether an agent can cause a disease, not whether an agent did cause a specific plaintiff's disease."&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Green |first1= Michael D. |author2= D. Michal Freedman, and Leon Gordis |title= Reference Guide on Epidemiology |publisher= Federal Judicial Centre |url= http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/sciman06.pdf/$file/sciman06.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 3 February 2008 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080227143925/http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/sciman06.pdf/$file/sciman06.pdf |archivedate= 27 February 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In United States law, epidemiology alone cannot prove that a causal association does not exist in general. Conversely, it can be (and is in some circumstances) taken by US courts, in an individual case, to justify an inference that a causal association does exist, based upon a balance of [[probability]].

The subdiscipline of forensic epidemiology is directed at the investigation of specific causation of disease or injury in individuals or groups of individuals in instances in which causation is disputed or is unclear, for presentation in legal settings.

== Population-based health management ==
Epidemiological practice and the results of epidemiological analysis make a significant contribution to emerging population-based health management frameworks.

Population-based health management encompasses the ability to:

* Assess the health states and health needs of a target population;
* Implement and evaluate interventions that are designed to improve the health of that population; and
* Efficiently and effectively provide care for members of that population in a way that is consistent with the community's cultural, policy and health resource values.

Modern population-based health management is complex, requiring a multiple set of skills (medical, political, technological, mathematical etc.) of which epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component, that is unified with management science to provide efficient and effective health care and health guidance to a population. This task requires the forward looking ability of modern risk management approaches that transform health risk factors, incidence, prevalence and mortality statistics (derived from epidemiological analysis) into management metrics that not only guide how a health system responds to current population health issues, but also how a health system can be managed to better respond to future potential population health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring Health and Disease I: Introduction to Epidemiology |url=http://open.umich.edu/education/med/oernetwork/public-health/epidemiology/intro-epidemiology/2010 |accessdate=16 December 2011 |author1=Neil Myburgh |author2=Debra Jackson |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110801204104/https://open.umich.edu/education/med/oernetwork/public-health/epidemiology/intro-epidemiology/2010 |archivedate=1 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of organizations that use population-based health management that leverage the work and results of epidemiological practice include Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control, Health Canada Tobacco Control Programs, Rick Hansen Foundation, Canadian Tobacco Control Research Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Smetanin |first1=P. |author2=P.

Each of these organizations use a population-based health management framework called Life at Risk that combines epidemiological quantitative analysis with demographics, health agency operational research and economics to perform:

* ''Population Life Impacts Simulations'': Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon the population with respect to new disease cases, prevalence, premature death as well as potential years of life lost from disability and death;
* ''Labour Force Life Impacts Simulations'': Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon the labour force with respect to new disease cases, prevalence, premature death and potential years of life lost from disability and death;
* ''Economic Impacts of Disease Simulations'': Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon private sector disposable income impacts (wages, corporate profits, private health care costs) and public sector disposable income impacts (personal income tax, corporate income tax, consumption taxes, [[publicly funded health care]] costs).

== Applied field epidemiology ==

Applied epidemiology is the practice of using epidemiological methods to protect or improve the health of a population. Applied field epidemiology can include investigating communicable and non-communicable disease outbreaks, mortality and morbidity rates, and nutritional status, among other indicators of health, with the purpose of communicating the results to those who can implement appropriate policies or disease control measures.

=== Humanitarian context ===

As the surveillance and reporting of diseases and other health factors becomes increasingly difficult in humanitarian crisis situations, the methodologies used to report the data are compromised. One study found that less than half (42.4%) of nutrition surveys sampled from humanitarian contexts correctly calculated the prevalence of malnutrition and only one-third (35.3%) of the surveys met the criteria for quality. Among the mortality surveys, only 3.2% met the criteria for quality. As nutritional status and mortality rates help indicate the severity of a crisis, the tracking and reporting of these health factors is crucial.

Vital registries are usually the most effective ways to collect data, but in humanitarian contexts these registries can be non-existent, unreliable, or inaccessible.  As such, mortality is often inaccurately measured using either prospective demographic surveillance or retrospective mortality surveys. Prospective demographic surveillance requires lots of manpower and is difficult to implement in a spread-out population. Retrospective morality surveys are prone to selection and reporting biases. Other methods are being developed, but are not common practice yet.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, “Health topics: Epidemiology.” http://www.who.int/topics/epidemiology/en/ Accessed: October 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miquel Porta.

== Validity: precision and bias ==
Different fields in epidemiology have different levels of validity. One way to assess the validity of findings is the ratio of false-positives (claimed effects that are not correct) to false-negatives (studies which fail to support a true effect). To take the field of genetic epidemiology, candidate-gene studies produced over 100 false-positive findings for each false-negative. By contrast genome-wide association appear close to the reverse, with only one false positive for every 100 or more false-negatives.&lt;ref name="Ioannides2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = J. P. A. | last2 = Tarone | first2 = R. | last3 = McLaughlin | first3 = J. K. | title = The False-positive to False-negative Ratio in Epidemiologic Studies | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 450–456 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21490505 | doi = 10.1097/EDE.0b013e31821b506e }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ratio has improved over time in genetic epidemiology as the field has adopted stringent criteria. By contrast other epidemiological fields have not required such rigorous reporting and are much less reliable as a result.&lt;ref name="Ioannides2011"/&gt;

=== Random error ===
Random error is the result of fluctuations around a true value because of sampling variability. Random error is just that: random. It can occur during data collection, coding, transfer, or analysis. Examples of random error include: poorly worded questions, a misunderstanding in interpreting an individual answer from a particular respondent, or a typographical error during coding. Random error affects measurement in a transient, inconsistent manner and it is impossible to correct for random error.

There is random error in all sampling procedures. This is called [[sampling error]].

Precision in epidemiological variables is a measure of random error. Precision is also inversely related to random error, so that to reduce random error is to increase precision. Confidence intervals are computed to demonstrate the precision of relative risk estimates. The narrower the confidence interval, the more precise the relative risk estimate.

There are two basic ways to reduce random error in an [[epidemiological study]]. The first is to increase the sample size of the study. In other words, add more subjects to your study. The second is to reduce the variability in measurement in the study. This might be accomplished by using a more precise measuring device or by increasing the number of measurements.

Note, that if sample size or number of measurements are increased, or a more precise measuring tool is purchased, the costs of the study are usually increased. There is usually an uneasy balance between the need for adequate precision and the practical issue of study cost.

=== Systematic error ===
A systematic error or bias occurs when there is a difference between the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of systematic error is if, unknown to you, the [[pulse oximeter]] you are using is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could be [[Accuracy and precision|precise but not accurate]]. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).

A mistake in coding that affects ''all'' responses for that particular question is another example of a systematic error.

The validity of a study is dependent on the degree of systematic error. Validity is usually separated into two components:

* [[Internal validity]] is dependent on the amount of error in measurements, including exposure, disease, and the associations between these variables. Good internal validity implies a lack of error in measurement and suggests that inferences may be drawn at least as they pertain to the subjects under study.
* [[External validity]] pertains to the process of generalizing the findings of the study to the population from which the sample was drawn (or even beyond that population to a more universal statement). This requires an understanding of which conditions are relevant (or irrelevant) to the generalization. Internal validity is clearly a prerequisite for external validity.

==== Selection bias ====
[[Selection bias]] occurs when study subjects are selected or become part of the study as a result of a third, unmeasured variable which is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest.&lt;ref name="Hernán2004"/&gt; For instance, it has repeatedly been noted that cigarette smokers and non smokers tend to differ in their study participation rates. (Sackett D cites the example of Seltzer et al., in which 85% of non smokers and 67% of smokers returned mailed questionnaires.)&lt;ref name="Sackett D. Bias in analytic research. J Chron Dis 1979; vol. 32:51–63."&gt;[http://www.epidemiology.ch/history/PDF%20bg/Sackett%20DL%201979%20bias%20in%20analytic%20research.pdf] 24&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that such a difference in response will not lead to bias if it is not also associated with a systematic difference in outcome between the two response groups.

==== Information bias ====
[[Information bias (epidemiology)|Information bias]] is bias arising from systematic error in the assessment of a variable.&lt;ref name=Rothman2002&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothman|first1=K.|title=Epidemiology: An Introduction|date=2002|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=0195135547}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is recall bias. A typical example is again provided by Sackett in his discussion of a study examining the effect of specific exposures on fetal health: "in questioning mothers whose recent pregnancies had ended in fetal death or malformation (cases) and a matched group of mothers whose pregnancies ended normally (controls) it was found that 28% of the former, but only 20% of the latter, reported exposure to drugs which could not be substantiated either in earlier prospective
interviews or in other health records".&lt;ref name="Sackett D. Bias in analytic research. J Chron Dis 1979; vol. 32:51–63." /&gt; In this example, recall bias probably occurred as a result of women who had had miscarriages having an apparent tendency to better recall and therefore report previous exposures.

==== Confounding ====
[[Confounding]] has traditionally been defined as bias arising from the co-occurrence or mixing of effects of extraneous factors, referred to as confounders, with the main effect(s) of interest.&lt;ref name=Rothman2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenland&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenland S, Morgenstern H | year = 2001 | title = Confounding in Health Research | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.22.1.189 | journal = Annu. Rev. Public Health | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 189–212 | doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.22.1.189}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent definition of confounding invokes the notion of ''counterfactual'' effects.&lt;ref name=Greenland/&gt; According to this view, when one observes an outcome of interest, say Y=1 (as opposed to Y=0), in a given population A which is entirely exposed (i.e. exposure ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for every unit of the population) the risk of this event will be ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;. The counterfactual or unobserved risk ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the risk which would have been observed if these same individuals had been unexposed (i.e. ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for every unit of the population). The true effect of exposure therefore is: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt; (if one is interested in risk differences) or ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt; (if one is interested in relative risk). Since the counterfactual risk ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt; is unobservable we approximate it using a second population B and we actually measure the following relations: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;B0&lt;/sub&gt; or ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;B0&lt;/sub&gt;. In this situation, confounding occurs when ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;B0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenland/&gt; (NB: Example assumes binary outcome and exposure variables.)

Some epidemiologists prefer to think of confounding separately from common categorizations of bias since, unlike selection and information bias, confounding stems from real causal effects.&lt;ref name="Hernán2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hernán | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Hernández-Díaz | first2 = S. | last3 = Robins | first3 = J. M. | title = A structural approach to selection bias | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 615–625 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15308962 | doi=10.1097/01.ede.0000135174.63482.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The profession ==
To date, few [[universities]] offer epidemiology as a course of study at the undergraduate level. One notable undergraduate program exists at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where students who major in public health can take graduate level courses, including epidemiology, their senior year at the [[Bloomberg School of Public Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Health Studies|url=http://krieger.jhu.edu/publichealth/|website=Public Health Studies at Johns Hopkins|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although epidemiologic research is conducted by individuals from diverse disciplines, including clinically trained professionals such as physicians, formal training is available through Masters or Doctoral programs including [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH), [[Master of Science]] of Epidemiology (MSc.), [[Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH), [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] (PharmD), [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD), [[Doctor of Science]] (ScD).  Many other graduate programs, e.g., [[Doctor of Social Work]] (DSW), [[Doctor of Clinical Practice]] (DClinP), [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine]] (DPM), [[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine]] (DVM), [[Doctor of Nursing Practice]] (DNP), [[Doctor of Physical Therapy]] (DPT), or for clinically trained physicians, [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) or [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] (MBBS or MBChB) and [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (DO), include some training in epidemiologic research or related topics, but this training is generally substantially less than offered in training programs focused on epidemiology or public health. Reflecting the strong historical tie between epidemiology and medicine, formal training programs may be set in either schools of public health and medical schools.

As public health/health protection practitioners, epidemiologists work in a number of different settings. Some epidemiologists work 'in the field'; i.e., in the community, commonly in a public health/health protection service, and are often at the forefront of investigating and combating disease outbreaks. Others work for non-profit organizations, universities, hospitals and larger government entities such as state and local health departments, various Ministries of Health, [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors without Borders]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the [[Health Protection Agency]], the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), or the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]]. Epidemiologists can also work in for-profit organizations such as pharmaceutical and medical device companies in groups such as market research or clinical development.

'''Ethnochoreology''' (also '''dance ethnology''', '''dance anthropology''')  is the study of [[dance]] through the application of a number of  disciplines  such as [[anthropology]], [[musicology]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[ethnography]], etc. The word itself is relatively recent and etymologically means “the study of [[ethnic dance]]”, though this is not exclusive of research on more formalized dance forms, such as [[classical ballet]], for example.  Thus, ethnochoreology reflects the relatively recent attempt to apply academic thought to why people dance and what it means. It is not just the study or cataloging of the thousands of external forms of dances—the [[dance move]]s, music, costumes, etc.— in various parts of the world, but the attempt to come to grips with dance as existing  within the social events of a given community as well as within the [[cultural history]] of a community. Dance is not just a static representation of [[history]], not just a repository of meaning, but a producer of meaning each time it is produced—not just a living mirror of a culture, but a shaping part of culture, a power within the culture:

:“The power of dance rests in acts of performance by dancers and spectators alike, in the process of making sense of dance… and in linking dance experience to other sets of ideas and social experiences.”&lt;ref&gt;John Blacking. (1984)  “Dance as Cultural System and Human Capability: An Anthropological Perspective.”  in ''Dance, A Multicultural Perspective. Report of the Third Study of Dance Conference,'' ed. J. Adshead, 4-21, [[Guildford]], [[University of Surrey]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''fish kill''', known also as '''fish die-off''', refers to a localized die-off of fish populations which may also be associated with more generalized mortality of aquatic life.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC (2000).

EPA-841-S-00-001. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;University of Florida. Gainesville, FL (2005).

[[Fish diseases and parasites|Infectious diseases and parasites]] can also lead to fish kill. [[Toxicity]] is a real but far less common cause of fish kill.&lt;ref&gt;Noga, Fish Disease: Diagnosis and Treatment, 2010, John Wiley and Sons {{ISBN|0-8138-0697-6}}, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish kills are often the first visible signs of [[Environmental quality|environmental]] stress and are usually investigated as a matter of urgency by environmental agencies to determine the cause of the kill. Many fish species have a relatively low tolerance of variations in environmental conditions and their death is often a potent indicator of problems in their environment that may be affecting other animals and plants and may have a direct impact on other uses of the water such as for [[drinking water]] production. Pollution events may affect fish species and [[Age class structure|fish age classes]] in different ways. If it is a cold-related fish kill, [[juvenile fish]] or species that are not cold-tolerant may be selectively affected. If [[toxicity]] is the cause, species are more generally affected and the event may include amphibians and shellfish as well. A reduction in [[dissolved oxygen]] may affect larger specimens more than smaller fish as these may be able to access oxygen richer water at the surface, at least for a short time.

==Causes==
[[File:Scheme eutrophication-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Depleted oxygen levels are the most common cause of fish kills. In this way [[eutrophication]] can have devastating consequences for the health of [[Benthos|benthic life]]]]

Fish kills may result from a variety of causes. Of known causes, fish kills are most frequently caused by pollution from agricultural runoff or biotoxins. [[hypoxia (environmental)|Ecological hypoxia]] (oxygen depletion) is one of the most common natural causes of fish kills. The hypoxic event may be brought on by factors such as [[algae bloom]]s, droughts, high temperatures&lt;ref&gt;Oregon State University (2006). [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-10/osu-dhe103006.php "Deadly hypoxic event finally concludes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314083456/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-10/osu-dhe103006.php |date=14 March 2011 }},&lt;/ref&gt; and [[thermal pollution]]. Fish kills may also occur due to the presence of disease, [[agricultural runoff]], [[sewage]] discharges, oil or [[hazardous waste]] spills, [[hydraulic fracturing]] wastewater, [[earthquake|sea-quake]]s, inappropriate re-stocking of fish, [[poaching]] with chemicals, underwater [[explosion]]s, and other catastrophic events that upset a normally stable aquatic population.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; Because of the difficulty and lack of standard protocol to investigate fish kills, many fish kill cases are designated as having an 'unknown' cause.&lt;ref&gt;La, V. and S.

Oxygen enters the water through [[diffusion]]. The amount of oxygen that can be dissolved in water depends on the [[atmospheric pressure]], the water temperature and whether the water is salty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/oxygen-solubility-water-d_841.html Oxygen Solubility in Fresh and Sea Water] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103230758/http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/oxygen-solubility-water-d_841.html |date=3 January 2011 }}. Engineeringtoolbox.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F) and one atmosphere of pressure, a maximum of 8&amp;nbsp;mg/l of oxygen can dissolve in [[sea water]] (35&amp;nbsp;mg/l [[salinity]]) while a maximum of 9&amp;nbsp;mg/l of oxygen can dissolve in fresh water. The amount of oxygen that can be dissolved in the water decreases by about 1&amp;nbsp;mg/l for each 10&amp;nbsp;°C increase in water temperature above 20&amp;nbsp;°C.

Many cold water fish that live in clean cold waters become stressed when oxygen concentrations fall below 8&amp;nbsp;mg/l while warm water fish generally need at least 5 ppm (5&amp;nbsp;mg/l) of dissolved oxygen. Fish can endure short periods of reduced oxygen. Depleted oxygen levels are the most common cause of fish kills. Oxygen levels normally fluctuate even over the course of a day and are affected by weather, temperature, the amount of sunlight available, and the amount of living and dead plant and animal matter in the water.&lt;ref name="BGWM"&gt;A Beginner’s Guide to Water Management – Fish Kills, Information Circular 107, University of Florida IFAS Extension, 2003 [http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/topic_fish_kills read online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504040737/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/topic_fish_kills |date=4 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In temperate zones oxygen levels in [[eutrophic]] rivers in summertime can exhibit very large [[Diurnal cycle|diurnal]] fluctuations with many hours of oxygen [[supersaturation]] during daylight followed by [[oxygen depletion]] at night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wat/wq/BCguidelines/do/do-02.htm Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Dissolved Oxygen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811091231/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wat/wq/BCguidelines/do/do-02.htm |date=11 August 2010 }}.

This can lead to pH stress even when oxygen levels are high.

Additional dissolved organic loads are the most common cause of oxygen depletion and such organic loads may come from sewage, farm waste, tip [[leachate]] and many other sources.

===Diseases and parasites===
{{See also|Fish diseases and parasites}}
[[File:Cadmans Pool, New Forest. - geograph.org.uk - 61031.jpg|thumb|right|This pond in [[New Forest]], England, has been restored following a [[viral infection]] which killed all the fish.]]
Fish are subject to various [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] in addition to parasites such as [[protozoan]]s, flukes and worms, or crustaceans. These are naturally occurring in many bodies of water, and fish that are stressed for other reasons, such as spawning or suboptimal water quality, are more susceptible. Signs of disease include sores, missing scales or lack of slime, strange growths or visible parasites, and abnormal behavior–lazy, erratic, gasping at the water surface or floating head, tail or belly up.

For example, since 2004 fish kills have been observed in the [[Shenandoah River]] basin in the spring, from the time water temperatures are in the 50s (°F) until they reach the mid-70s.  So far, investigators suspect certain bacteria, along with environmental and contaminant factors that may cause [[immune suppression]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deq.state.va.us/info/srfishkill.html information from the Department of Environmental Quality, Virginia, USA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524035958/http://www.deq.state.va.us/info/srfishkill.html |date=24 May 2011 }}; see also [http://www.deq.state.va.us/info/srfishkillhistory.html History of fish kills in the Shenandoah watershed, Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524044853/http://www.deq.state.va.us/info/srfishkillhistory.html |date=24 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fish farming]], where populations are optimized for the available resources, [[parasites]] or disease can spread quickly. In [[channel catfish]] [[Aquaculture of catfish|aquaculture ponds]], for example, the "hamburger gill disease" is caused by a protozoan called ''Aurantiactinomyxon'' and can kill all the fish in an affected pond. In addition to altered behavior, affected fish have swollen gills that are mottled and have the appearance of ground hamburger meat.&lt;ref name="BGWM"/&gt;

Some early warning signs of fish suffering from disease or parasite infections include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100610081128/http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/420/420-252/420-252.pdf Fish Kills - Their Causes and Prevention, Virginia Tech, Virginia Cooperative Extension Publication 420-252, 2009]. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;
#Discolouration, open sores, reddening of the skin, bleeding, black or white spots on the skin
#Abnormal shape, swollen areas, abnormal lumps, or popeyes
#Abnormal distribution of the fish such as crowding at the surface, inlet, or pond edges (though crowding at the surface during specific times of day, such as early morning, is more likely a sign of low oxygen)
#Abnormal activity such as flashing, twisting, whirling, convulsions, loss of buoyancy
#Listlessness, weakness, sluggishness, lack of activity
#Loss of appetite or refusal to feed.

===Toxins===
{{See also|Fish toxins|Cyanide fishing|Marine pollution#Toxins}}
[[Agricultural runoff]], [[sewage]], [[surface runoff]], [[chemical spill]]s and [[hazardous waste]] spills can all potentially lead to water [[toxicity]] and fish kill. Some algae species also produce toxins. In Florida, these include ''[[Aphanizomenon]]'', ''[[Anabaena]]'' and ''Microcystis''. Some notable fish kills in Louisiana in the 1950s were due to a [[pesticide]] called [[endrin]].&lt;ref&gt;Larson et al., 1997, Pesticides in Surface Waters: distribution, trends and governing factors. CRC Press {{ISBN|1-57504-006-9}} p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Natural instances of toxic conditions can occur, especially in poorly [[Buffer solution|buffer]]ed water. Aluminium compounds can cause complete fish kills, sometimes associated with autumn turn-over of lakes leading to complex chemical interactions between pH, [[calcium]] ions and complex [[polymeric]] salts of aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf33/anzf33-517p.pdf http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf33/anzf33-517p.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828232501/http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf33/anzf33-517p.pdf |date=28 August 2011 }}. Retrieved on 2012-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human-induced fish kills are unusual, but occasionally a spilled substance causes direct toxicity or a shift in water temperature or pH that can lead to fish kill.  For example, in 1997 a [[phosphate]] plant in [[Mulberry, Florida]], accidentally dumped 
{{convert|60|e6USgal|e6kl|abbr=unit}} of acidic process water into Skinned Sapling Creek, reducing the pH from about 8 to less than 4 along {{convert|36|mi|km}} of creek, resulting in the death of about 1.3 million fish.&lt;ref name="BGWM"/&gt;

It is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a potential toxin is the direct cause of a fish kill.  For example, hundreds of thousands of fish died after an accidental spill of [[bourbon whiskey]] into the [[Kentucky River]] near [[Lawrenceburg, Kentucky|Lawrenceburg]]. However, officials could not determine whether the fish kill was due to the bourbon directly or to oxygen depletion that resulted when aquatic [[microbe]]s rapidly began to consume and digest the liquor.&lt;ref name="BGWM"/&gt;

[[Cyanide]] is a particular toxic compound that has been [[Cyanide fishing|used to poach fish]]. In cyanide poisoning the gills turn a distinctive cherry red. [[Chlorine]] introduced as alkaline hypochlorite solution is also extremely toxic,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110317032617/http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/202794/nsw-fish-kill.pdf Fish Kills in New South Wales]&lt;/ref&gt; leaving pale mucilaginous gills and an over-production of mucilage across the whole body. [[Calcium oxide|Lime]] produces similar symptoms but is also often associated with milk eyes.

===Algae blooms and red tides===
[[File:River Cam green.JPG|thumb|right|A small algae bloom on [[River Cam]] near Trinity College]]
[[File:Cwall99 lg.jpg|thumb|right|A large algae bloom off the southern coast of England in 1999]]
[[File:Red tide.jpg|thumb|right|[[Red tide]] is a reddish algae bloom caused by a microorganism common in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]
{{See also|Algae bloom|Red tide}}
An [[algae bloom]] is the appearance of a large amount of [[algae]] or [[Impurities|scum]] floating on the surface of a body of water. Algae blooms are a natural occurrence in nutrient-rich lakes and rivers, though sometimes increased nutrient levels leading to algae blooms are due to fertilizer or animal waste [[Land runoff|runoff]]. A few species of algae produce [[toxin]]s, but most fish kills due to algae bloom are a result of decreased oxygen levels. When the algae die, [[decomposition]] uses oxygen in the water that would be available to fish. A fish kill in a lake in Estonia in 2002 was attributed to a combination of algae bloom and high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Estonian Academy Publishers|title=Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Sciences, Biology and Ecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGqUHtmTCuoC&amp;pg=PA67|year=2005|publisher=Estonian Academy Publishers|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When people manage algae blooms in [[fish pond]]s, it is recommended that treatments be staggered to avoid too much algae dying at once, which may result in a large drop in oxygen content.

Some diseases result in mass die-offs.&lt;ref name="Moyle466"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 466&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more bizarre and recently discovered diseases produces huge fish kills in shallow marine waters. It is caused by the [[ambush predator]] [[dinoflagellate]] ''[[Pfiesteria piscicida]]''. When large numbers of fish, like [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] [[forage fish]],  are in confined situations such as shallow bays, the excretions from the fish encourage this dinoflagellate, which is not normally toxic, to produce free-swimming [[zoospores]]. If the fish remain in the area, continuing to provide nourishment, then the zoospores start secreting a [[neurotoxin]]. This toxin results in the fish developing bleeding lesions, and their skin flakes off in the water. The dinoflagellates then eat the blood and flakes of tissue while the affected fish die.&lt;ref name="Burkholder"&gt;Burkholder JM, Glasgow HB and Hobbs CW (1995) [http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/124/m124p043.pdf "Fish kills linked to a toxic ambush-predator dinoflagellate: distribution and environmental conditions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223203635/http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/124/m124p043.pdf |date=23 February 2012 }} ''Marine Ecology Progress Series''.&lt;/ref&gt; Fish kills by this dinoflagellate are common, and they may also have been responsible for kills in the past which were thought to have had other causes.&lt;ref name="Burkholder"/&gt; Kills like these can be viewed as natural mechanisms for regulating the population of exceptionally abundant fish. The rate at which the kills occur increases as organically polluted [[land runoff]] increases.&lt;ref&gt;Magnien RE (2001) [http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051%5B0843:TDOSPA%5D2.0.CO%3B2 "The Dynamics of Science, Perception, and Policy during the Outbreak of Pfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay"] ''BioScience'' '''51'''(10):843-852.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red tide]] is the name commonly given to an algal bloom of ''[[Karenia brevis]]'', a  microscopic marine dinoflagellate which is common in [[Gulf of Mexico]] waters. In high concentrations it discolors the water which often appears reddish-brown in color. It produces a toxin which paralyses the central nervous system of fish so they cannot breathe. Dead fish wash up on beaches around Texas and Florida. Humans can also become seriously ill from eating oysters and other shellfish contaminated with the red tide toxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/faq.phtml#q9 |title=Red Tide FAQ - Is it safe to eat oysters during a red tide? |publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department |accessdate= 2009-08-23 |deadurl=no

The term "red tide" is also commonly used to describe harmful algal blooms on the northern east coast of the United States, particularly in the [[Gulf of Maine]]. This type of bloom is caused by another species of [[dinoflagellate]] known as ''[[Alexandrium fundyense]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eohhs2modulechunk&amp;L=4&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Provider&amp;L2=Guidance+for+Businesses&amp;L3=Food+Safety&amp;sid=Eeohhs2&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=dph_environmental_foodsafety_p_red_tide&amp;csid=Eeohhs2

===Biological decay===
Just as an algae bloom can lead to oxygen depletion, introduction of a large amount of [[Decomposition|decaying]] biological material in general to a body of water leads to oxygen depletion as [[microorganism]]s use up available oxygen in the process of breaking down [[organic matter]].  For example, a {{convert|10|mi|km}} fish kill in September, 2010, in the [[Sangamon River]] in Illinois was traced to discharge of animal waste into the river from a large dairy operation. The illegal discharge resulted in a complete kill of fish, frogs, [[mussel]]s and [[mudpuppy|mudpuppies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/contaminated-water-kills-fish-in-central-illinois/article_a64ef8bc-bf50-11df-9804-001cc4c002e0.html Contaminated Water Kills Fish in Central Illinois] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415154155/http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/contaminated-water-kills-fish-in-central-illinois/article_a64ef8bc-bf50-11df-9804-001cc4c002e0.html |date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrient pollution and eutrophication ===
Excessive [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] nutrient enrichment of phosphorus and nitrogen allow for rapid growth and multiplication of [[Algal bloom|phytoplankton]] in the [[Mississippi River]]. As phytoplankton continue to rapidly grow under optimal conditions, their biomass is almost doubled every 24 hours. In the water, higher concentrations of organic matter are present because of the high reproductive rate of the phytoplankton over a short period of time. The rapid growth of phytoplankton causes [[turbidity]] in the waters of the Mississippi and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Turbidity is defined as the measure of water clarity by how much the suspended material, such as algae and phytoplankton, constrict the passage of sunlight through water. Hence, as phytoplankton begin to multiply more rapidly, turbidity in the river and gulf increases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Environmental Science: Toward a Sustainable Future |last= Wright |first= Richard T. |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2014 |isbn = |location=Boston |pages=523–578 |last2=Boorse |first2=Dorothy F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing turbidity blocks plants from absorbing sunlight. The process of turbidity results in limited photosynthesis production, and sometimes even death from sunlight deprivation of the submerged aquatic vegetation that are affected by the opaque turbid water accumulating at the surface.

Furthermore, a significant detrimental outcome caused by [[eutrophication]] in the Mississippi River is the increased uptake of dissolved oxygen by bacteria, in response to higher concentrations of organic matter. After eutrophication starts and is in progress, the phytoplankton reach their maximum [[population density]] and begin to die.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As the dead phytoplankton accumulate, detritus, or organic matter waste, forms at the surface along with other bacteria and algae. As more phytoplankton die, the higher the concentration of organic matter becomes; and with a higher concentration of organic matter, more bacteria will reproduce.

Consequently, as more bacteria, phytoplankton, and algae exponentially grow and multiply, the more submerged aquatic vegetation die, because they do not have access to sunlight due to eutrophication. Once this snowball-like course of action is in full motion, a dead zone has been created. As a result of the excess nutrient enrichment in the Mississippi River, dead zones appear in the Gulf of Mexico, created from the process of eutrophication. The dead zones in the gulf are mainly created by the nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment of the Lower Mississippi River.

===Spawning fatalities===
[[File:Dead salmon in spawning season.jpg|thumb|right|A [[salmon]] which has died after spawning]]
Some species of fish exhibit mass simultaneous mortality as part of their natural life cycle.
Fish kill due to spawning fatalities can occur when fish are exhausted from [[Spawn (biology)|spawning activities]] such as courtship, nest building, and the release of eggs or [[milt]] (sperm). Fish are generally weaker after spawning and are less resilient than usual to smaller changes in the environment.  Examples include the [[Atlantic salmon]] and the [[Sockeye salmon]] where many of the females routinely die immediately after spawning.

===Water temperature===
A fish kill can occur with rapid fluctuations in temperature or sustained high temperatures. Generally, cooler water has the potential to hold more oxygen, so a period of sustained high temperatures can lead to decreased dissolved oxygen in a body of water.  An August, 2010, fish kill in [[Delaware Bay]] was attributed to low oxygen as a result of high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/fish-kill-in-delaware-bay-still-a-mystery-to-nj-dep August 2010 fish kill in Delaware Bay linked to high temperatures – low oxygen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818072307/http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/fish-kill-in-delaware-bay-still-a-mystery-to-nj-dep |date=18 August 2010 }}.

A massive (hundreds of thousands) fish kill at the mouth of the Mississippi River in [[Louisiana]], September, 2010, was attributed to a combination of high temperatures and low tide. Such kills are known to happen in this region in late summer and early fall, but this one was unusually large.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/news/pictures/slideshow?articleId=USRTR2IDT7 Slideshow: Massive fish kill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222203924/http://www.reuters.com/news/pictures/slideshow?articleId=USRTR2IDT7 |date=22 February 2014 }} Reuter’s News Service report of massive fish kill at the mouth of the Mississippi River in September, 2010. The Division of Wildlife stated that the fish kill was unrelated to the oil spill that had recently occurred in the Gulf of Mexico: [http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/16/massive-mississippi-river-fish-kill-not-bps-fault/ http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/16/massive-mississippi-river-fish-kill-not-bps-fault/ Massive Fish Kill Not BP's Fault]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007233913/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/16/massive-mississippi-river-fish-kill-not-bps-fault/ |date=7 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A short period of hot weather can increase temperatures in the surface layer of water, as the warmer water tends to stay near the surface and be further heated by the air.  In this case, the top warmer layer may have more oxygen than the lower, cooler layers because it has constant access to atmospheric oxygen. If a heavy wind or cold rain then occurs (usually during the autumn but sometimes in summer), the [[Stratification (water)|layers can mix]]. If the volume of low oxygen water is much greater than the volume in the warm surface layer, this mixing can reduce oxygen levels throughout the [[water column]] and lead to fish kill.

Fish kills can also result from a dramatic or prolonged drop in air (and thus, water) temperature. This kind of fish kill is selective – usually the dead fish are species that cannot tolerate cold. This has been observed in cases where a fish native to a more tropical region has been introduced to cooler waters, such as the introduction of the [[tilapia]] to bodies of water in Florida. Native to Africa’s [[Nile River]], the tilapia stop feeding when water temperatures drop below {{convert|60|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and die when it reaches {{convert|45|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. Thus, tilapia that have survived and successfully reproduced in Florida are occasionally killed by a winter cold front.&lt;ref name="BGWM"/&gt;

In January, 2011, a selective fish kill affecting an estimated 2 million juvenile [[Spot croaker|spot fish]] was attributed to a combination of cold stress and overpopulation after a particularly large spawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/01/06/maryland.fish.kill/index.html?iref=obinsite CNN story on Jan 6, 2011 Fish kill in Maryland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109035058/http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/01/06/maryland.fish.kill/index.html?iref=obinsite |date=9 November 2012 }}.

===Underwater explosions===
[[Underwater explosion]]s can lead to fish kill, and fish with [[swim bladder]]s are more susceptible. Sometimes underwater explosions are used on purpose to induce fish kills, a generally illegal practice known as [[blast fishing]]. Underwater explosions may be accidental or planned, such as for construction, [[seismic]] testing, mining or blast testing of structures under water.  In many places, an assessment of potential effects of underwater explosions on marine life must be completed and preventive measures taken before blasting.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 1996, Effects of Underwater Explosions on Life in the Sea, report DSTO-GD-0080 to the [[Australian Department of Defence]] [http://dspace.dsto.defence.gov.au/dspace/bitstream/1947/3763/1/DSTO-GD-0080%20PR.pdf read online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706121631/http://dspace.dsto.defence.gov.au/dspace/bitstream/1947/3763/1/DSTO-GD-0080%20PR.pdf |date=6 July 2011 }};  Govoni, et al., 2008, Effects of Underwater Explosions on Larval Fish: Implications for a Coastal Engineering Project, Journal of Coastal Research 2(S):228-233 {{doi|10.2112/05-0518.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Droughts and overstocking===
Droughts and overstocking can also result in inland fish kills.

A drought can lead to lower water volumes so that even if the water contains a high level of dissolved oxygen, the reduced volume may not be enough for the fish population.  Droughts often occur in conjunction with high temperatures so that the oxygen [[carrying capacity]] of the water may also be reduced. Low river flows also reduce the available dilution for permitted discharges of treated sewage or [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial waste]]. The reduced dilution increases the organic demand for oxygen further reducing the oxygen concentration available to fish

[[Fish stocking|Overstocking]] of fish (or an unusually large [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]]) can also result in inland fish kills. Fish kill due to insufficient oxygen is really a matter of too much demand and too little supply for whatever reason(s).  Recommended stocking densities are available from many sources for bodies of water ranging from a home [[aquarium]] or backyard pond to commercial [[aquaculture]] facilities.

==Estimation==
Estimating the magnitude of a kill presents a number of problems.&lt;ref name="Labay"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Labay |first1=Andrew A. |last2=Bizan |first2=Dave |year=1999 |title=A Comparison of Fish Kill Counting Procedures on a Small, Narrow Stream |journal=North American Journal of Fisheries Management |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=209–214 |publisher=American Fisheries Society |doi=10.1577/1548-8675(1999)019&lt;0209:ACOFKC&gt;2.0.CO;2  |url=http://afsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1577/1548-8675%281999%29019%3C0209:ACOFKC%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Polluted waters are often very [[turbidity|turbid]] or have low transparency making it difficult or impossible to see fish that have sunk
#Rivers and streams can move fish downstream out of the investigation area.
#Small fish and [[Fry (biology)|fry]] can decompose  or become buried in sediments very quickly and are lost from the count.
#[[Predator]]s and [[scavenger]]s remove and eat fish.
#Stressed fish may swim up tributaries and die there
#Many kills are reported only when dead fish resurface due to decompositional gas formation, often several hours after the kill has occurred.
Some very large fish kills may never be estimated because of these factors. The discharge of red aluminium [[sludge]] from a reservoir in [[Hungary]] into the Marcai River is acknowledged as causing environmental devastation,&lt;ref&gt;

==Prevention and investigation==
Fish kills are difficult to predict. Even when conditions that contribute to fish kill are known to exist, prevention is hard because often conditions cannot be improved and fish cannot be safely removed in time. In small ponds, mechanical [[water aeration|aeration]] and/or removal of decaying matter (such as fallen leaves or dead algae) may be reasonable and effective preventive measures.

Many countries in the developed world have specific provisions in place to encourage the public to report fish kills&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.myfwc.com/fishkill/submit.asp Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute - Submit A Fish Kill Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405022446/http://research.myfwc.com/fishkill/submit.asp |date=5 April 2011 }}.

'''Flirty Fishing (FFing)''' is a form of [[evangelism|evangelistic]] [[Sacred prostitution|religious prostitution]] practiced by female members of the Children of God, currently known as [[Family International]] (TFI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Flirty_Fishing Flirty Fishing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050712000929/http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Flirty_Fishing |date=2005-07-12 }}, xFamily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title='The Family' and Final Harvest |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/children_of_god/child1.htm |quote=Sure, Alexander concedes, plenty of people object that The Family's 'Law of Love' permits sex outside marriage and that the group once condoned a practice known as 'flirty fishing' – the use of sex to win converts. |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |date=June 2, 1993 |accessdate=2008-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325012912/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/children_of_god/child1.htm |archive-date=2012-03-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from around 1974 to 1987.  According to some sources, hundreds of thousands of men were "fished" before the practice was discontinued.&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;

==Etymology and definition==
The term is derived from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 4:19 from the [[New Testament]], in which [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] tells two fishermen that he will make them "fishers of men".&lt;ref name="matthew"&gt;Matthew 4:19 (KJV, NIV, NKJV). Retrieved from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204:19;&amp;version=9;31;50; ''BibleGateway.com''].&lt;/ref&gt;  Cult leader [[David Berg]] extrapolated from this that women in his movement should be "flirty fishers" (also called "bait" or "fisherwomen"). The targeted men were called "fish". The cult published several documents with exact instructions. Flirty Fishing was defined as using sex appeal for [[Proselytization|proselytizing]].

Berg noted that Flirty Fishing did not necessarily entail intercourse, but that this was by far the most efficient method of proselytizing.&lt;ref name="proselytism"&gt;In a 1982 family publication, Berg stated that only one-seventh (14%) of fish were "loved sexually", but he also noted that "loving sexually" was far and above the most effective method of witnessing in that it was 3,000 times more effective than conventional forms of proselytizing.

==Within the Family of God==

===Impact on members===
Women who objected to being what the cult itself bluntly described as "God's whores" or "hookers for Jesus" were admonished not to "let self and pride enter in",&lt;ref name="flirtyfishy"&gt;[http://xfamily.org/index.php/True_Komix_-_Little_Flirty_Fishy True Komix #293 DO "The Little Flirty Fishy"]&lt;/ref&gt; and reminded that their body did not really belong to them, as according to [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 6:19–20 it had been "bought" (by Jesus through his crucifixion) "with a price".&lt;ref name="corinthians"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%206:19-20;&amp;version=9; |title=1 Corinthians 19–20 (KJV) |access-date=2008-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501194731/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:19-20;&amp;version=9; |archive-date=2008-05-01 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After an initial phase, male members no longer partook in this drive, partially because of the cult's dismissive stance towards [[homosexuality]], but also because Berg thought it did not "pay off financially".&lt;ref name="reports" /&gt; Many of the flirty fishers had boyfriends, were married, or had children. In Family publications, flirty fishers and escort service practitioners (see below) frequently reported that they found their work hard, dangerous, and exhausting.

===ESing===
The financial benefit of Flirty Fishing soon led to a further degeneration of the practice from mere flirting into "loving sexually" to "escort servicing" (ESing)&amp;mdash;described as "making FFing pay" by Berg&amp;mdash;in which female cult members would work as regular [[call girl]]s for [[Escort agency|escort agencies]] or freelance, and merely "witness" (proselytize) to their clients when the occasion offered itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Escort_Servicing |title=Escort Servicing |access-date=2007-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103182746/http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Escort_Servicing |archive-date=2007-01-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
The Children of God practised flirty fishing and escort servicing from 1974 until 1987, when it was officially abandoned, in part because of the [[AIDS]] epidemic. As the women were expected to keep exact records of their "fruits" (successes), a 1988 statistic showed that more than 223,000 men had been "fished" since 1978&lt;ref name="statistics"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://xfamily.org/images/a/a8/FF-Stats-1988-10-01.jpg |title=FFing Statistics |access-date=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102110639/http://www.xfamily.org/images/a/a8/FF-Stats-1988-10-01.jpg |archive-date=2007-01-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;and that FFing had nevertheless continued into 1988. As the cult generally discourages [[birth control]], the practice also resulted in numerous pregnancies, the offspring of which were termed ''Jesus babies'' by the organization.&lt;ref name="jesusbabies"&gt;[http://xfamily.org/index.php/Jesus_baby "Jesus baby" article from xfamily.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Freedman''' ([[Brooklyn]], New York, USA, 6 March 1936 - Sydney, NSW, Australia, 21 July 2016) was Australia’s ''leading'' Interior Designer/ Interior Architect from 1970 until a younger generation became prominent in Sydney during the 1990s. Born in New York, where he studied architecture at Syracuse University, Freedman arrived in Sydney in 1968 and later designed many prestigious interiors, often including custom-made furniture. His notable interior schemes included executive suites for the Bank of New South Wales (1970) and the State Bank of NSW (1985), cultural institutions including Sydney’s Powerhouse Museum/Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (1988), businesses, government premises, restaurants, residences and historic monuments, including a refurbishment of the Queen Victoria Building shopping centre (2009)[3].

In 2005, Freedman was described by The Sydney Morning Herald as ‘the Godfather of Interior Design’. He was recognised by design and architecture industry experts for his daring and widely emulated combinations of colours, inventive uses of materials, attention to detail, and commitment to high-quality furnishings (often imported signature classics)[5]. He was respected also for his sophisticated understandings of optical perception and volumetric manipulations of interior space. For this reason he was highlighted by design writers as practising more like an architect than his colleagues who were educated as interior decorators and designers[6]. Although he never finalised his American degree studies to register as an architect, Freedman worked repeatedly with Sydney’s leading architects of the late-twentieth century—including Glenn Murcutt, Peter Stronach, Richard Johnson and Ken Woolley. He also trained some of Sydney’s outstanding younger architects and designers—including Iain Halliday, Sam Marshall, Stephen Varady, William MacMahon, Arthur Collin, Robert Puflett, Tim Allison and his late-career partner, Ralph Rembel. In 2005 the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (NSW Chapter) awarded Freedman Rembel an Interior Architecture commendation for its design of executive offices at the AMP Insurance building overlooking Circular Quay.

Freedman’s 1970s and 1980s furniture designs, often finished with luxury European veneers and eye-catching flourishes, were often promoted in Australia’s most stylish design magazines, especially Belle and Interior Design. His cocktail trolley for Bilson’s restaurant (1988) is in the collection of Sydney’s Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. He was a Fellow of the Design Institute of Australia and the Academy of Design Australia.

==Early life==

Freedman was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Nathan Freedman, a colour designer for an American paint manufacturer, and Rose Freedman (née Hirsch). His childhood memories included riding horses in Manhattan’s Central Park, and their home interior paint colour was changed every second year to challenging new colours.

==Education==

From 1949 to 1953, Freedman attended Manhattan High School, then studied architecture at Syracuse University and began working from 1960 with architects Kahn and Jacobs, where he worked on the American Airlines’ first class lounge at John F. Kennedy Airport. He abandoned the final year of his degree to travel to Europe; initially Ibiza, with a friend. During 1963 and 1964, he exhibited and sold artworks in Amsterdam and Brussels, then worked as an interior designer for architects Tandy Halford and Mills in London.
Returning to New York in 1968, Freedman joined the international planning unit of leading furniture manufacturers and interior designers Knoll and Associates. He worked with director Florence Knoll, who maintained close ties with many European and American leaders of modern design. Freedman’s projects with Knoll included the United States pavilion for the 1970 Osaka World Fair and offices for accountants Price Waterhouse in Buffalo, NY.

==Life in Australia==

In 1969, Knoll despatched Freedman to Sydney to ‘Manhattanise and Internationalise’ the executive and boardrooms for the Bank of New South Wales, one of Australia’s oldest banks (founded in 1817 and renamed Westpac in 1982).

While working on this project, Freedman began a personal relationship with prominent Sydney decorator Neville Marsh—who employed him as a designer with Neville Marsh Interiors in 1970. To exploit Freedman’s international experience, they agreed that the practice should ‘go modern’, and in 1973, the business was rebranded Marsh Freedman Associates (MFA).

As well as designing interiors for some of Sydney’s most prestigious and prosperous families, MFA created sophisticated fine dining rooms for some of Sydney’s outstanding restaurateurs, notably Anne Taylor (Taylors, 1984); Tony and Gay Bilson (Berowra Waters Inn, 1976; Kinselas, 1983; Tresury, 1992, and Ampersand, 1998; Damien and Josephine Pignolet (Claudes, 1981); Helen and Malcolm Spry (Chez Oz, 1985); Leon Fink (Bilsons and Quay, 1986, 1988), and Armando Percuoco (Buon Ricordo Ristorante refurbishment, 2007).

During the late 1980s, Neville Marsh retired from Marsh Freedman Associates and Freedman continued to practice as George Freedman Associates (with Robert Chester and Sam Marshall). In 2002 he appointed a younger architect, Ralph Rembel, as his business partner and renamed the practice 'Freedman Rembel'. This practice was dissolved in 2010, when Freedman joined architects Peddle Thorp and Walker as Head of Interior Design (but he continued consulting to his existing private clients).

==Personal life==

Freedman was widely known for his waspish wit, warm laugh, home cooking, Negroni's, and devotion to his dogs (owned in pairs shared). During the 1990s Freedman was caring for Neville Marsh and supported by Andrew Bryan. In 2005 he met and later exchanged vows in Paris with psychologist Peter O'Brien. In 2014 they had a formal same sex wedding in New Zealand. Freedman died from cancer in Sydney in 2016, aged 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amy|first1=Ripley|title=George Freedman, interior designer to the rich and famous of Sydney|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/george-freedman-interior-designer-to-the-rich-and-famous-of-sydney-20160811-gqqc4n.html|website=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hans Kilian and Lotte Köhler Center''' for Cultural Psychology and Historical Anthropology (KKC) was established in August 2014 at the Chair for Social Theory and Social Psychology, [[Ruhr-University Bochum]], Germany. It is mainly funded by the ''Köhler Foundation'', which is a member of the ''Stifterverband'', a German business community initiative advocating long-term improvement of the German education and research landscape. The KKC is named after two individuals whose biographies are closely linked, namely, Hans Kilian and Lotte Köhler.

[[:de: Hans Kilian|Hans Kilian]] (1921-2008), M.D., held the Chair for Social Psychology and Applied Psychoanalysis at the University of Kassel, Germany, from 1971 to 1984. His research interests included psychosomatic medicine, work psychology, cultural-evolutionary anthropology, and the interdisciplinary analysis of psychohistorical and psychosocial developments in individuals and their social environments. One of his specific interests was the lasting psychological effect of the Nazi system on post-war Germany.

[[:de: Lotte Köhler|Lotte Köhler]] (*1925), M.D., received her psychoanalytic training in Munich, Germany, and Zurich, Switzerland. As a scientist, she is known for her work on self psychology, early-childhood memory development, and attachment theory. As a businesswoman, she chaired the supervisory board and the shareholders’ meeting at Goebel, LLC, located in Darmstadt, Germany. She ended her business career in 1987 when she established the Köhler Foundation, which supports the advancement of the human sciences.

From the 1960s until Hans Kilian’s death, they shared a bond in both the private and scientific domain. As for the latter, they were decisive in introducing [[Heinz Kohut]]’s self psychology to Germany in the 1970s.

Following Hans Kilian’s and Lotte Köhler’s aim to advance psychological and psychoanalytical research through interdisciplinary efforts, the KKC invites input from scholars of manifold fields. In this regard, sociology, anthropology, history, education, and philosophy are considered as important as work in research fields like critical psychology, cultural and postcolonial studies, gender studies, and religious studies.

== Scientific Activities ==
The KKC resulted from a development that began when the [[Hans-Kilian-Award]] was given for the first time in 2011. Since then, its activities have increased and focus on the following areas:
* [[Hans-Kilian-Award]]
* Hans Kilian Lecture Series
* Hans Kilian symposia and workshops
* Hans Kilian fellowships
* Hans Kilian student program
* Collected Works of Hans Kilian
* Kilian-Köhler-Archive

[[File:Hassan Mourad .jpg|thumb|Hassan Mourad]]
'''Hassan Sobhi Mourad''' (January 3, 1942 – August 14, 2015) was an academic, a [[calligrapher]], an artist, a researcher, an author and a poet. He specialized in [[Arabic Calligraphy]], its development and teaching, drawing to all age groups, as well as contributing in writing art-related articles. Born in [[Syria]], Hassan Mourad lived abroad in various countries and continents for over thirty-five years due to his career in [[diplomatic service]]. Though living abroad for most of his adult life, he remained passionate about the [[Arabic Language]], its history and the art of Arabic Calligraphy. Mourad was influenced at the early age of 14 by a fellow Syrian writer without having ever met him; this artist, AbdulRahman Fakhoory, predicted a bright future in art for Mourad.

Mourad was also influenced by other great Arab artists, such as [[Hashem Muhammad al-Baghdadi|Hashim the Calligrapher]], the Turkish Hamid Alamady, Mostapha Raqim and Hamdallah Alamasy, as well as the Persian Meer Ali Tabreez, Abbas Akhaween and others.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Having so many historical figures to look up to built a foundation of an ever growing passion for Arabic Calligraphy, which encouraged Mourad to learn the principles and arts with patience, diligence, and willingness. For years thereafter, he continued studying and developing his skill, building on his talent, and learning secrets of the arts.

Mourad designed artworks and logos for various purposes, and a mural for [[King Fahd Academy (Germany)|King Fahd Academy]] in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]]. He participated in restoring artworks, scripts, and decorations of an old palace in his early years of practicing art. He also copied pages of the [[Quran]] in the [[Diwani Script]] that was never used for the Quran before.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabiangallery.com/hassan-smourad.html|title=Hassan S.Mourad|website=ArabianGallery.com Calligraphy by Hassan S.Mourad|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mourad used [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] and Ottoman scripts in decorations he designed for many pieces of his work, also copying many versus of the Quran.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The artist was the first to employ the Arabic letter, applying artistic value without distorting the letter, in creating an artwork for his 1986 exhibition in [[Utrecht]], the [[Netherlands]]. He created pieces of fine art with his individual touch of art, with variations in both color and black and white. Mourad was passionate about Arabic Calligraphy, the Arabic script, and its principles of beauty and the distribution of its letters, which in professional calligraphy follow meticulous rules and principles.  He is cited as a professional academic and calligrapher, and through extensive research of the history of Arabic Calligraphy, Mourad concludes that the Misnad style of Arabic Calligraphy is the original form of Arabic Calligraphy and has influenced future calligraphy styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://purescience.uobabylon.edu.iq/service_showrest.aspx?pubid=1088|title=كلية  التربية للعلوم الصرفة {{!}} جامعة بابل|website=purescience.uobabylon.edu.iq|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions, publications and font design ==

=== Publications ===
* "Innovated Arabic Letters&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabiangallery.com/publications.html|title=Publications by the Master Calligrapher Hassan S.Mourad|last=|first=|date=|website=ArabianGallery.com Calligraphy by Hassan S.Mourad|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;": A booklet in which Mourad exploits a collection of Arabic scripts he had innovated in letterpress style. It was published in 1979 for interested designers, calligraphers, and fans could benefit from it.
* "The History of Arabic Calligraphy Between Past and Present":&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A 625 page book, published in 2003, in which the author researches the origins of Arabic Calligraphy in ancient writings. He travels through time to discuss the journey of Arabic Calligraphy in scripts and letters of the Islamic prophet Mohammad to kings and princes.
* "The Story of Arabic Numbers":&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The author researches the Arabs' contributions to human civilizations and the origin of numbers. He discusses the need for numbers in ancient times, Arabic numbers, and the truth in the Arabic origins of numbers.

=== Font design – Hassan ===
[[File:Hassan Font Linotype.png|thumb|Hassan Font Family]]
In 1993, Hassan Mourad registered a custom Arabic font, Hassan, with [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linotype.com/522/hassan-family.html|title=Hassan® font family|last=Linotype|first=|date=|website=www.linotype.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This font, which followed an individual Naskh style, is now also available in [[OpenType]] format.

'''Heterosexism''' is a system of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[bias]], and [[discrimination]] in favor of opposite-sex [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and relationships.&lt;ref name="JungSmith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Patricia Beattie|author2=Smith, Ralph F.|title=Heterosexism: An Ethical Challenge|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1696-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can include the presumption that other people are [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the only [[Norm (social)|norm]]&lt;ref name="Cramer2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Cramer|title=Addressing Homophobia and Heterosexism on College Campuses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqAAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=5 March 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-82328-5|page=2|quote=The definition for heterosexism that I used for authors in the collection is: The expectation that all persons should be or are heterosexual. The belief that heterosexual relations are normal and the norm. These expectations and beliefs occur on individual, institutional, and cultural levels. ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore superior. Although heterosexism is defined in the online editions of the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' and the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary]]'' as anti-gay [[discrimination]] or prejudice "by heterosexual people"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/heterosexism|title=Yahoo|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "by heterosexuals",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heterosexism|title=Definition of HETEROSEXISM|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, people of any [[sexual orientation]] can hold such attitudes and bias, and can form a part of [[internalized homophobia|internalised hatred]] of one's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ego.thechicagoschool.edu/s/843/images/editor_documents/heterosexism.doc |title=Heterosexism and Internalized Heterosexism |author=Kira Weidner |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterosexism as discrimination ranks [[gay]] men, [[lesbian]]s, [[bisexual]]s and other sexual minorities as [[second-class citizen]]s with regard to various legal and [[civil rights]], economic opportunities, and [[social equality]] in many of the world's jurisdictions and societies. Heterosexism is often related to [[homophobia]].

== Background ==
While the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary]]'' notes first use of the term heterosexism as having occurred in 1972, the term was first published in 1971 by [[gay rights activist]], [[Craig Rodwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodwell, Craig. ' 'The Tarnished Golden Rule' ' pg. 5, QQ Magazine, Queen's Quarterly Publishing, New York. (January/February 1971 issue, Vol. 3, No. 1) Retrieved July 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology and usage===
Similar terms include "heterocentrism" and "heterosexualism".&lt;ref&gt;Corsini, Raymond J. (1992). ''The Dictionary of Psychology''. {{ISBN|1-58391-328-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the well-established term ''heterosexism'' is often explained as a [[Neologism|coinage]] modeled on ''[[sexism]]'', the derivation of its meaning points more to (1.) ''heterosex(ual)'' + ''-ism'' than (2.) ''hetero-'' + ''sexism''. In fact, the word ''heterosexualism'' has been used as an equivalent to sexism and racism.&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt;

Given this lack of [[Transparency (linguistic)#Descriptive|semantic transparency]], researchers, outreach workers, [[critical theorists]] and [[LGBT]] activists have proposed and use terms such as ''institutionalized homophobia'', ''state(-sponsored) homophobia'',&lt;ref&gt;International Lesbian and Gay Association. [http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1058&amp;FileCategory=10&amp;ZoneID=7 "State-sponsored Homophobia"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''sexual prejudice'', ''anti-gay [[bigotry]]'', ''[[straight privilege]]'', ''[[La pensée straight|The Straight Mind]]'' (a collection of essays by French writer [[Monique Wittig]]), ''heterosexual bias'', ''[[compulsory heterosexuality]]''&lt;ref&gt;LGBTQ on-line encyclopedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer culture&lt;/ref&gt; or the much lesser known terms ''heterocentrism'', ''[[homonegativity]]'', and from [[gender theory]] and [[queer theory]], ''[[heteronormativity]]''. However, not all of these descriptors are synonymous to ''heterosexism''.

===Contrast to homophobia===

''[[Homophobia]]'', a form of heterosexism, refers both to "unreasoning fear of or [[antipathy]] towards homosexuals and homosexuality"&lt;ref name=dictionary.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/homophobia|title=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2008-01-29|year=2008|publisher=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to "behavior based on such a feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia |title=homophobia - Dictionary definition and pronunciation - Yahoo! Education |publisher=Education.yahoo.com |accessdate=2014-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204061410/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia |archivedate=2013-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heterosexism'', however, more broadly denotes the "system of ideological thought that makes heterosexuality the sole norm to follow for sexual practices".&lt;ref name="granddictionnaire.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/ficheOqlf.aspx?Id_Fiche=8373795#eng |title=Accueil |publisher=Granddictionnaire.com |date=2013-05-13 |accessdate=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a bias favoring heterosexuals and heterosexuality, heterosexism has been described as being "encoded into and characteristic of the major social, cultural, and economic institutions of our society"&lt;ref&gt;Dines, Gail (2002). ''Gender, Race, and Class in Media: A Text-Reader''. {{ISBN|0-7619-2261-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and stems from the [[essentialist]] cultural notion that [[maleness]]-[[masculinity]] and femaleness-[[femininity]] are complementary.

Researcher, author, and psychology professor Gregory M. Herek states that "[Heterosexism] operates through a dual process of invisibility and attack. Homosexuality usually remains culturally invisible; when people who engage in homosexual behavior or who are identified as homosexual become visible, they are subject to attack by society."&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/prej_defn.html |author= Gregory M. Herek

"Inside the Minds of People Who Hate Gays" Retrieved May 29, 2008: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/franklin.html&lt;/ref&gt; She continues by saying that "assaults on homosexuals and other individuals who deviate from [[Gender role|sex role]] norms are viewed as a learned form of [[social control]] of deviance rather than a defensive response to personal threat."&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

===Parallels and intersections===
{{Rquote|right|Using the term heterosexism highlights the parallels between antigay sentiment and other forms of prejudice, such as [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], and [[sexism]].  |[[Gregory M. Herek]], researcher, author, and professor of psychology at [[University of California at Davis|UC Davis]].|&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt;}}

It has been argued that the concept of heterosexism is similar to the concept of [[racism]] in that both ideas promote privilege for dominant groups within a given society. For example, borrowing from the racial concept of [[white privilege]], the concept of [[heterosexual privilege]]&lt;ref name="genderknot149"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Allan J.|title=The Gender Knot|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|year=1997|page=149|isbn=1-56639-519-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been applied to benefits of (presumed) heterosexuality within society that heterosexuals take for granted. The analogy is that just as racism against non-white people places white people as superior to [[Person of color|people of color]], heterosexism places heterosexual people or relationships as superior to [[non-heterosexual]] ones. In trying to rebut this premise, some commentators point to differences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bet.com/news/youthvote/4-reasons-why-gay-is-not-the-new-black/4|title=Celebrities|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the categories of race and sexual orientation, claiming they are too complex to support any generalizations.  For example, "[[Diversity training|trainer on diversity]]" and consultant Jamie Washington has commented, although heterosexism and racism are "woven from the same fabric" they are "not the same thing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://susquehanna.edu/crusader/article.cfm?IssueID=59&amp;SectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=2573 Issues of race and sexuality discussed, Susquehanna Crusader Online, accessed Aug 29, 2009 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some American Conservative leaders such as [http://www.laprogressive.com/author/rev.-irene-monroe/ Rev. Irene Monroe] comment that those who suggest or state "gay is the new black", as in a cover story of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid65744.asp Gay is the New Black, accessed Aug 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; exploit [[black people]]'s suffering and experiences to legitimize their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irenemonroe.com/2008/12/16/gay-is-not-the-new-black/ Gay is NOT the new Black, accessed Aug 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a study presented at the [[British Psychological Society]]'s Division of Occupational Psychology 2009 Conference shows that heterosexist prejudice is more pervasive than racism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bps.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/releases$/division-of-occupational-psychology/prejudice-study-finds-gay-is-the-new-black.cfm Prejudice study finds gay is the new black, accessed Sept 3, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexism can also [[Intersectionality|intersect]] with racism by further emphasizing differences among arbitrary groups of people.&lt;ref name="tatum22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tatum|first=Beverly|title=Why are all the Black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?|publisher=Basic Books|year=1997|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, heterosexism can compound the effects of racism by:
* promoting injustices towards a person already facing injustices because of their race
* establishing [[social hierarchies]] that allow one group more privilege than other groups.

Likewise, racism can allow LGBT people to be subjected to additional discrimination or violence if they belong to or are considered a part of a socially devalued racial category.&lt;ref&gt;(2008) Heterosexism and Homophobia. Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, 2, 1–4. Retrieved March 31, 2008 from Gale Virtual Reference Library: http://find.galegroup.com/ips/start.do?prodId=IPS.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the privileges afforded to people falling into the categories of white people and (perceived) heterosexuals include, but are not limited to, social acceptance, prestige, freedom from negative [[stereotypes]], and the comfort of being within the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] and thereby not being [[marginalized]] or viewed as different.&lt;ref&gt;Simoni, J. M. &amp; Walters, K. L. (2001). Heterosexual Identity and Heterosexism: Recognizing Privilege to Reduce Prejudice. Journal of Homosexuality, 1(1), 157–173.

== As a set of beliefs and attitudes ==
{{See also|Religion and homosexuality|Homosexuality and psychology|Sexual orientation and medicine (disambiguation)|Social attitudes toward homosexuality}}

=== Individual and group level ===
Heterosexism as a set of beliefs and attitudes relies on a core [[wikt:tenet|tenet]] according to which [[heteronormativity|homosexuality and bisexuality do not normally exist]] and, as such, constitute [[mental disorder|mental illnesses]] or [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behaviors]].&lt;ref name="genderknot17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Allan J.|title=The Gender Knot|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|year=1997|page=17|isbn=1-56639-519-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a heterosexist ideology or [[mindset]], the concept of [[sexual orientation]] is rejected or deemed irrelevant. A set of more nuanced heterosexist views, which some may consider faith, [[dogma]], [[Moral absolutism|universal truths]], natural law, [[Appeal to authority|appeals to authority]], or popular beliefs, but others consider to be [[conventional wisdom]] or [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] knowledge can include, among others, the following:

[[File:Save Our Children From Homosexuality Brochure.jpg|thumb|upright|Brochure used by [[Save Our Children]] in 1977]]
* Non-heterosexual persons should keep their sexual orientations private (i.e., they should remain "[[closeted]]").&lt;ref name="JungSmith" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/sup&gt;
* The attitude that gay men aren't [[machismo|"real" men]] or lesbians aren't "real" women because of the socially pervasive view that heterosexual attractions or activities are the "norm" and therefore superior.&lt;ref name="genderknot149" /&gt;
* "God created [[Adam and Eve]], not [[Adam and Steve]] (or Madame and Eve)" and similar essentialist cultural notions that maleness-masculinity and femaleness-femininity are complementary;
* Homosexuality being wrong, ungodly, and against nature, it is therefore a [[sin]], [[evil]] or subhuman.&lt;ref name="JungSmith" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/sup&gt;
* Views identical or akin to [[Anita Bryant]]'s statement during her [[Save Our Children]] campaign in the U.S. (''See campaign brochure image at right''):
:"As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must [[Homosexual recruitment|recruit]] our children."
* Because of their lifestyle, homosexuals do not have families with children, so they undermine the survival of the human race ([[natalism]]).
* Homosexuality is an affectional or [[mental disorder]] or simply a social ill, therefore, it can be cured or stamped out. If it is not eradicated, it will lead to [[Social solidarity|social disintegration]] and [[societal collapse]].
* Homosexuals can be converted to heterosexuality.&lt;ref name="JungSmith" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;/sup&gt;

In an attempt to bring awareness to people who exhibit heterosexist views but are possibly not aware of it, Mark Rochlin constructed a set of questions in 1977 which are questions that non-heterosexual people are often exposed to, but not heterosexuals, such as "''What do you think caused your sexuality?''" This heterosexuality questionnaire is often distributed around college campuses to bring awareness of heterosexist sexual prejudice against LGBT persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkpractice.co.uk/quaire.htm|title=The Pink Practice - Heterosexuality Questionnaire|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional level===
As well as comprising attitudes held by an individual or a social group, heterosexism can also exist as the expression of attitudes within an institution. As a result, schools, hospitals, and correctional facilities can act as a showcase for heterosexist attitudes in various ways. First, schools may implement these attitudes and ideas through unequal and inconsistent disciplinary actions. One such example is meting out harsher punishment to a same-sex couple violating the school ground rules while allowing a heterosexual couple to pass with an easier and more subtle disciplinary action for an equal or identical violation. Also, hospitals may limit patient visiting only to immediate family, i.e., relatives, and exclude same sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;Heterosexism and Homophobia. Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, 2, 1–4. Retrieved March 31, 2008 from Gale Virtual Reference Library: http://find.galegroup.com/ips/start.do?prodId=IPS.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexism affects the family in several ways. For example, in many countries around the world, same-sex marriage is not allowed, so non-heterosexual persons must remain unmarried or enter into heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref name="TFDASJ" /&gt; Many countries also deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples, including custodial and adoption rights for children, Social Security benefits, and automatic durable power of attorney and hospital spousal rights.&lt;ref name="TFDASJ"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Maurianne |author2=Bell, Lee Anne |author3=Griffin, Pat|title=Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|edition=2|chapter=Appendix 9H|isbn=0-415-95200-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and measurements ==

===Measurements===

Psychologists have aimed to measure heterosexism using various methods. One particular method involves the use of a [[Likert scale]].  However, since heterosexism is perceived as something that is unseen it is difficult to determine if someone is heterosexist based on a [[Self-report study|self-report method.]] Researchers, thus, have constructed implicit measurements of heterosexism. An example of this would be an [[Implicit Association Test]]. A popular implicit association test measuring heterosexism that is open to the public is a virtual laboratory called [https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/ Project Implicit].

One limitation present in research on heterosexism is that there often isn’t a distinction between homophobia and heterosexism. Individuals are more likely to be aware of homophobic tendencies rather than heterosexist views, thus, researchers often measure homophobia instead of heterosexism.&lt;ref&gt;Herek, G. M. (2000). The psychology of sexual prejudice. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 9(1): 19-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

Research on heterosexism has focused on variables that may affect views of heterosexism. For instance, in a study by psychologist, [[Gregory M. Herek]], it was found that there was a gender difference between heterosexual attitudes toward lesbians and gay men.&lt;ref name="Herek, G. M. 1988"&gt;Herek, G. M. (1988). Heterosexual's attitudes toward lesbians and gay men: Correlates and gender differences. Journal of Sex Research. 25(4): 451-477.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the study reveals that heterosexual individuals all seem to have some heterosexist tendency, however, heterosexual males have a greater tendency than heterosexual females to exhibit negative attitudes towards non-heterosexual individuals (this includes gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals). Another notable finding of Herek's study was that heterosexual males showed a greater tendency to demonstrate hostility towards gay men rather than lesbians.&lt;ref name="Herek, G. M. 1988"/&gt; Other factors that Herek acknowledges to contribute to heterosexism include individual differences, religiosity, conforming to social norms, [[right-wing authoritarianism]], customs and beliefs regarding cultural tradition, and personal experience with non-heterosexual individuals.&lt;ref name="Herek, G. M. 1988"/&gt; Research has also recognized the effects of level of education on views of heterosexism.&lt;ref name="Wright L. W. 1999"&gt;Wright L. W., Jr., Adams, H. E., &amp; Bernat, J. (1999). Development and validation of the Homophobia scale. Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 21(4): 337-347.&lt;/ref&gt; Wright et al. revealed that higher levels of education, or having more years of education, is related to less homophobic tendencies.&lt;ref name="Wright L. W. 1999"/&gt;

* Lack or under-representation of homosexual or bisexual people in advertising to the general public;
* Censorship of homosexual or bisexual characters, themes, and issues in works of art, literature, entertainment; ''see also [[Postcards from Buster#Controversial episodes|"Sugar Time" episode of Postcards from Buster]]''
* Exclusion of historical and political figures’ and celebrities’ homosexuality or bisexuality; their portrayal as heterosexuals;
* Complete avoidance of mentioning these people and their positive contributions particularly in news media;
* In the context of sex education or professional advice, referring only to opposite-sex partners when discussing female or male [[sexual attraction]] and activity;
* Silence on issues affecting homosexual and bisexual people at school or work or absence of their discussion in a positive light;
* Implementation and use of [[content-control software]] (censorware) to filter out information and websites that focus on homosexuality or bisexuality;
* [[Postal censorship]] and border control or customs seizure of publications deemed obscene solely on the basis of them containing material related to homosexuality even when they contain no erotic or pornographic material; ''see also [[Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium]]''
* Work environments that tacitly require gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals not to reveal their sexual orientation via discussion of their relationship status while heterosexuals can discuss their relationships and [[marital status]] freely;
* At public libraries or bookstores: rejection, removal or destruction of [[Homosexuality in children's literature|books]] (e.g. ''[[Jenny lives with Eric and Martin]]''), films, and posters with homosexual themes;
* Refusal to include families headed by [[Same-sex parenting|same-sex parents]] at school events or to represent such family diversity in school curricula; ''see also [[anti-bias curriculum]]'';

== Effects ==

Heterosexism causes a range of effects on people of any sexual orientation. However, the main effects of heterosexism are marginalization, and anti-LGBT violence and abuse.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Marginalization ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

The main effect of heterosexism is the [[marginalization]] of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals within society. Heterosexism has led to [[Social stigma|stigmatization]] and persecution of not only these people but also those of other [[sexual diversity]] such as transgender, and transsexual people. Along with [[homophobia]], [[lesbophobia]], and [[internalized homophobia]], heterosexism continues to be a significant social reality that compels people to conceal their homosexual or bisexual orientation, or metaphorically, to remain in [[Closeted|the closet]] in an effort to [[Passing (sexual orientation)|pass]] for heterosexual.

Marginalization also occurs when marriage rights are heterosexist. More specifically, when marriage rights are exclusive to opposite-sex couples, all same-sex couples, be they gay, lesbian, straight or mixed, are prevented from enjoying marriage’s corresponding legal privileges, especially those regarding property rights, health benefits, and child custody. Moreover, such limitation prevents same-sex couples from receiving the inherent social respect of marriage and its cultural symbolism.

=== Anti-LGBT violence and abuse ===

Yolanda Dreyer, professor of practical theology at [[University of Pretoria]], has claimed that "Heterosexism leads to prejudice, discrimination, harassment, and [[Violence against LGBT people|violence]].  It is driven by fear and hatred (Dreyer 5)."&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer, Yolanda. "Hegemony and the Internalisation of Homophobia Caused by Heteronormativity." Department of Practical Theology. 2007. University of Pretoria.5 May 2008 [www.up.ac.za/dspace/bitstream/2263/2741/1/Dreyer_Hegemony(2007).pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines, forensic psychologist Karen Franklin explains violence caused by heterosexism toward both men and women, regardless of their sexual orientations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]hrough heterosexism, any male who refuses to accept the dominant culture's assignment of appropriate masculine behavior is labeled early on as a "[[Sissy#Pejorative|sissy]]" or "[[Fag (slang)|fag]]" and then subjected to [[bullying]]. Similarly, any woman who opposes male dominance and control can be labeled a lesbian and attacked. The potential of being ostracized as homosexual, regardless of actual sexual attractions and behaviors, puts pressure on all people to conform to a narrow standard of appropriate gender behavior, thereby maintaining and reinforcing our society's hierarchical gender structure.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another form of heterosexist violence as [[social control]] that most often targets lesbian women is [[corrective rape]]: a [[gang rape]] of a lesbian to "cure" her of her same-sex attractions. A notorious example from South Africa is the corrective rape and murder of [[Eudy Simelane]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT-rights]] activist and member of the [[South Africa women's national football team|women's national football team]].&lt;ref name="guardian120309"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/12/eudy-simelane-corrective-rape-south-africa|title=Raped and killed for being a lesbian: South Africa ignores 'corrective' attacks|last=Kelly|first=Annie|date=12 March 2009|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Frontline article titled Inside the Mind of People Who Hate Gays, bias-related violence against homosexuals is believed to be widespread in the United States, with perpetrators typically described by victims as young men in groups who assault targets of convenience. Victims accounts suggest that assailants possess tremendous rage and hatred; indeed, documentation of horrific levels of brutality has led gay activists to characterize the violence as political terrorism aimed at all gay men and lesbians. Other motives for antigay violence suggested in the literature include male bonding, proving heterosexuality, and purging secret homosexual desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Roots Of Homophobia - Inside The Mind Of People Who Hate Gays {{!}} Assault On Gay America {{!}} FRONTLINE {{!}} PBS|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/franklin.html|website = www.pbs.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article in the Howard Journal of Communications, some LGBT individuals have responded to heterosexism through direct confrontation and communication, or through the removal of self from the hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Camara|first = Sakile K.|date = December 2012|title = Heterosexism in Context: Qualitative Interaction Effects of Co-Cultural Responses|url =|journal = Howard Journal of Communications|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Postmodernism}}
'''Hypermodernism''' is a cultural, artistic, literary and architectural successor to [[modernism]] and [[postmodernism]] in which the form (attribute) of an object has no context distinct from its function.  Attributes can include shapes, colors, ratios, and even time.  Unlike postmodernism and modernism, hypermodernism exists in an era of fault-tolerant technological change and treats extraneous attributes (most conspicuously physical form) as discordant with function.  While modernism and post-modernism debate the value of the "box" or absolute reference point, hypermodernism focuses on improvising attributes of the box (reference point now an extraneous value rather than correct or incorrect value) so that all of its attributes are non-extraneous; it also excises attributes that are extraneous.  Hypermodernism is not a debate over truth or untruth as per modernism/postmodernism; rather it is a debate over what is and is not an extraneous attribute.  Synchrony between previously-clashing objects (now attributes) and amorphous self-identity coupled with allusions to a magical existence acknowledge the movement. Some theorists view hypermodernism as a form of resistance to traditional modernism; others as a supersedence of it.

==Relationship to modernism and postmodernism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}

Post-modernism and modernism debated each another in an industrial/physical context and were concerned with the social value of objects themselves.  Modernism focused on confining form within the limited function of a 1950s object while 1970's postmodernism focused on freeing form from its limited function ("there-is-no-box"). The modern/postmodern oversight of objects as a mediator between attribute and function led to redundant human-context thinking and false conflicts between objects such as ideas.

==Propelled by technological advances==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Technology has played a definitive role in function catching up to attribute.  An example is the touch-screen in which the attribute on the screen (ratio, shape, color, animation) becomes the focus of interaction as opposed to manipulation by an external tool i.e. cellphone keyboard.  In the long-term the object ceases to become the middleman between attribute (form) and function.

==Non-composability of objects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Hypermodernism holds that an object is by definition non-composable toward its attributes; and no one attribute of an object can act as a proxy for the object itself.  No whole, or object, is reducible to ONLY its attributes; and the attributes may not be mutually exclusive to the object itself.  Furthermore, an object may have extraneous functions independent of its composing attributes (postmodern theory); this potential supra-functionality is a key concern to hypermodernism's attempt to replace objects with attributes.  Attributes, while having the functions of an object, are not building blocks toward an object in hypermodernism.  No object is by definition hypermodern; however, an object can be more hypermodern or less hypermodern than another object.

[[File:Hypermodernism.jpg|thumb|2D aesthetic attributes projected as a 3D object.]]

==Long-term effects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Hypermodernism displays a deep bias against objects physical and non-physical. It can be described as anti-object; however it is NOT anti-materialistic.   Objects are viewed as an extraneous mediator between attribute and function.  Over time, hypermodernism employs attributes to perform the functions of objects, and only those extant objects that can adequately convey the properties of its attributes are allowed to survive.  Those objects that are irreducible to complete attributes will disappear as in the case of the physical keyboard.  Over time, the attribute-function relationship becomes synonymous.

==Human psychology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Hypermodernism compensates for the tendency of human thought to extract the attributes of an object and assign those same attributes to the functions of the object.  Rather than focusing on a debate over "truth" or non-truth and other high-context social considerations, hypermodernism focuses on questions of extraneous vs non-extraneous (In design terms, correctness and incorrectness).  Hypermodernism emphasizes correctness over completeness in design in order to guard against human intuitive leaps.

{{Information science}}
'''Information management''' ('''IM''') concerns a cycle of organizational activity: the acquisition of [[information]] from one or more sources, the custodianship and the distribution of that information to those who need it, and its ultimate [[disposition]] through [[archiving]] or deletion.

This cycle of organisational involvement with information involves a variety of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s, including those who are responsible for assuring the [[quality (business)|quality]], [[accessibility]] and [[utility]] of acquired information; those who are responsible for its safe [[Data storage device|storage]] and [[:wikt:disposal|disposal]]; and those who need it for [[decision making]]. Stakeholders might have rights to originate, change, distribute or delete information according to organisational information management [[policies]].

Information management embraces all the generic concepts of management, including the [[planning]], [[organizing (management)|organizing]], structuring, [[Business process|process]]ing, [[Internal control|control]]ling, [[evaluation]] and [[Data reporting|reporting]] of information activities, all of which is needed in order to meet the needs of those with organisational roles or functions that depend on information. These generic concepts allow the information to be presented to the audience or the correct group of people. After individuals are able to put that information to use, it then gains more value.

Information management is closely related to, and overlaps with, the management of ''[[data]]'', ''[[system]]s'', ''[[technology]]'', ''[[Business process|process]]es'' and – where the availability of information is critical to organisational success – ''[[strategy]]''. This broad view of the realm of information management contrasts with the earlier, more traditional view, that the [[Project life cycle|life cycle]] of managing information is an operational matter that requires specific procedures, organisational capabilities and standards that deal with information as a [[product (business)|product]] or a service.

==History==

===Emergent ideas out of data management===
In the 1970s, the management of information largely concerned matters closer to what would now be called [[data management]]: [[punched cards]], [[magnetic tape]]s and other record-keeping [[Digital media|media]], involving a life cycle of such formats requiring origination, distribution, backup, maintenance and disposal. At this time the huge potential of [[information technology]] began to be recognised: for example a single [[Integrated circuit|chip]] storing a whole [[book]], or [[electronic mail]] moving messages instantly around the world, remarkable ideas at the time.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, C., 1979. ''The Mighty Micro'', London: Victor Gollancz.&lt;/ref&gt; With the proliferation of information technology and the extending reach of information systems in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="Venkat0"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1994. IT-enabled business transformation: from automation to business scope redefinition. ''Sloan Management Review'', 35(2), pp.73–87&lt;/ref&gt; information management took on a new form. Progressive businesses such as [[British Petroleum]] transformed the vocabulary of what was then "[[IT management]]", so that “[[systems analyst]]s” became “[[business analyst]]s”, “monopoly supply” became a mixture of “[[insourcing]]” and “[[outsourcing]]”, and the large IT function was transformed into “lean teams” that began to allow some agility in the processes that harness information for [[business benefit]].&lt;ref name="Cross and Earl"&gt;Cross, J. &amp; Earl, M., 1997. Transformation of the IT function at British Petroleum. ''MIS Quarterly'', 21(4), page 403&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of [[senior management]] interest in information at British Petroleum extended from the creation of value through improved [[business process]]es, based upon the effective management of information, permitting the implementation of appropriate information systems (or “[[application software|applications]]”) that were operated on [[IT infrastructure]] that was [[outsource]]d.&lt;ref name="Cross and Earl" /&gt; In this way, information management was no longer a simple job that could be performed by anyone who had nothing else to do, it became highly strategic and a matter for [[senior management]] attention. An understanding of the technologies involved, an ability to manage information systems [[project]]s and [[business change]] well, and a willingness to align technology and business strategies all became necessary.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Peppard, J., 2002. ''Strategic Planning for Information Systems'' (3rd Edition), Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positioning information management in the bigger picture===
In the transitional period leading up to the strategic view of information management, Venkatraman (a strong advocate of this transition and transformation,&lt;ref name="Venkat2"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1994. IT-enabled business transformation: from automation to business scope redefinition. ''Sloan Management Review'', 35(2), pp.73–87.&lt;/ref&gt; proffered a simple arrangement of ideas that succinctly brought together the  managements [[Data management|of data]], information, and [[knowledge management|knowledge]] (see the figure)) argued that:

* Data that is maintained in IT infrastructure has to be ''interpreted'' in order to render information.
* The information in our information systems has to be ''understood'' in order to emerge as knowledge.
* Knowledge allows managers to ''take effective decisions''.
* Effective decisions have to lead to ''appropriate actions''. 
* Appropriate actions are expected to deliver ''meaningful results''.

[[File:DIKAR model.jpg|thumb|This simple model summarises a presentation by Venkatraman in 1996, as reported by Ward and Peppard (2002, page 207).&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;]]
This is often referred to as the [[DIKAR]] model: Data, Information, Knowledge, Action and Result,&lt;ref name="Venkat1"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1996. Managing IT resources as a value center, ''IS Executive Seminar Series, Cranfield School of Management''&lt;/ref&gt; it gives a strong clue as to the layers involved in aligning technology and organisational strategies, and it can be seen as a pivotal moment in changing attitudes to information management.  The recognition that information management is an investment that must deliver meaningful results is important to all modern organisations that depend on information and good decision-making for their success.&lt;ref name="Bytheway"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. [https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319119083 Investing in Information: the Information Management Body of Knowledge], Geneva: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical background==

===Behavioural and organisational theories===
It is commonly believed that good information management is crucial to the smooth working of organisations, and although there is no commonly accepted [[theory]] of information management ''per se'', behavioural and organisational theories help. Following the [[behavioural science]] theory of management, mainly developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and prominently supported by March and Simon,&lt;ref name="March and Simon" /&gt; most of what goes on in modern organizations is actually information handling and decision making. One crucial factor in information handling and decision making is an individual's ability to process information and to make decisions under limitations that might derive from the context: a person's age, the situational complexity, or a lack of requisite quality in the information that is at hand – all of which is exacerbated by the rapid advance of technology and the new kinds of [[system]] that it enables, especially as the [[social web]] emerges as a phenomenon that business cannot ignore. And yet, well before there was any general recognition of the importance of information management in organisations, March and Simon &lt;ref name="March and Simon"&gt;March, J.G. &amp; Simon, H.A., 1958. ''Organizations'', Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; argued that organizations have to be considered as [[cooperative systems]], with a high level of information processing and a vast need for decision making at various levels. Instead of using the model of the "[[economic man]]", as advocated in classical theory &lt;ref name="Opp"&gt;see Opp, K.-D., 1985. Sociology and economic man. ''Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft/Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics'', pp.213–243&lt;/ref&gt; they proposed "[[administrative man]]" as an alternative, based on their argumentation about the cognitive limits of rationality. Additionally they proposed the notion of [[satisficing]], which entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met - another idea that still has currency.&lt;ref name="Winter"&gt;Winter, S.G., 2000. The satisficing principle in capability learning. ''Strategic Management Journal'', 21(10-11), pp.981–996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic theory===
In addition to the organisational factors mentioned by March and Simon, there are other issues that stem from economic and environmental dynamics. There is the cost of collecting and evaluating the information needed to take a decision, including the time and effort required.&lt;ref name="Hedberg"&gt;Hedberg, Bo (1981), "How organizations learn and unlearn", in: Nyström, P.C. &amp; Starbuck, W.H., ''Handbook of Organizational Design'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The [[transaction cost]] associated with information processes can be high. In particular, established organizational rules and procedures can prevent the taking of the most appropriate decision, leading to sub-optimum outcomes 
.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;Mackenzie K.D. (1978), ''Organizational Structures'', AHM Publishing Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullins"&gt;Mullins, L.J (1993), ''Management and Organizational Behaviours'', 3rd ed., Pitman Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; This is an issue that has been presented as a major problem with bureaucratic organizations that lose the economies of strategic change because of entrenched attitudes.&lt;ref name="Wigand"&gt;Wigand, Rolf T., Picot, Arnold and Reichwald, Ralf (1997), ''Information, Organization and Management: Expanding Markets and Corporate Boundaries'', Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic information management==

===Background===
According to the Carnegie Mellon School an organization's ability to process information is at the core of organizational and managerial [[competence (human resources)|competency]], and an organization's strategies must be designed to improve information processing capability &lt;ref name="Cyert"&gt;Cyert, R.M. &amp; March, J.G., 1959. A behavioural theory of organizational objectives. ''Modern Organization Theory'', Wiley, New York, pp.76–90&lt;/ref&gt; and as information systems that provide that capability became formalised and automated, competencies were severely tested at many levels.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;Morton, M.S.S., 1991. ''The corporation of the 1990s: Information technology and organizational transformation'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It was recognised that organisations needed to be able to learn and adapt in ways that were never so evident before &lt;ref name="Senge"&gt;Senge, P.M., 1990. ''The fifth discipline'', Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt; and academics began to organise and publish definitive works concerning the strategic management of information, and information systems.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Peppard, J., 2002. ''Strategic Planning for Information Systems'' (3rd Edition), Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Earl"&gt;Earl, M.J., 1989. ''Management Strategies for Information Technology'', Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the ideas of [[business process]] management &lt;ref name="Hammer and Champy"&gt;Hammer, M. &amp; Champy, J., 2009. ''Reengineering the Corporation: Manifesto for Business Revolution'', A, Zondervan&lt;/ref&gt; and [[knowledge management]] &lt;ref name="Nonaka and Takeuchi"&gt;Nonaka, I. &amp; Takeuchi, H., 1995. ''The knowledge creating company: how Japanese companies create the dynamics of innovation'', New York, NY, USA: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; although much of the optimistic early thinking about [[business process redesign]] has since been discredited in the information management literature.&lt;ref name="Belmiro"&gt;Belmiro, T., Gardiner, P. &amp; Simmons, J., 1997. Business process re-engineering—A discredited vocabulary? ''International Journal of Information Management'', 17(1), pp.21–33&lt;/ref&gt; In the strategic studies field, it is considered of the highest priority the understanding of the information environment, conceived as the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information. This environment consists of three interrelated dimensions which continuously interact with individuals, organizations, and systems. These dimensions are the physical, informational, and cognitive.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012). Information Operations. Joint Publication 3-13. Joint Doctrine Support Division, 116 Lake View Parkway, Suffolk, VA., p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aligning technology and business strategy with information management===

Venkatraman has provided a simple view of the requisite capabilities of an organisation that wants to manage information well – the [[DIKAR]] model (see above). He also worked with others to understand how technology and business strategies could be appropriately aligned in order to identify specific capabilities that are needed.&lt;ref name="Henderson and Venkat"&gt;Henderson, J.C. &amp; Venkatraman, N., 1993. Strategic alignment: leveraging information technology for transforming organizations. ''IBM Systems Journal'', 32(1), pp.4–16&lt;/ref&gt; This work was paralleled by other writers in the world of consulting,&lt;ref name="Zachman"&gt;Zachman, J. A. (1987). A framework for information systems architecture. ''IBM Systems Journal'', 26(3), 590–616&lt;/ref&gt; practice &lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;Cross, J., 1995. IT outsourcing : British Petroleum’s competitive approach. ''Harvard Business Review'', 73(3), p.94&lt;/ref&gt; and academia.&lt;ref name="Ward2"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Daniel, E., 2005. ''Benefits Management: Delivering Value from IS and IT Investments'', Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

===A contemporary portfolio model for information===
Bytheway has collected and organised basic tools and techniques for information management in a single volume.&lt;ref name="Bytheway" /&gt;  At the heart of his view of information management is a portfolio model that takes account of the surging interest in external sources of information and the need to organise un-structured information external so as to make it useful (see the figure).

[[File:An Information Portfolio.jpg|thumb|This portfolio model organizes issues of internal and external sourcing and management of information, that may be either structured or unstructured.]]

Such an information portfolio as this shows how information can be gathered and usefully organised, in four stages:

'''Stage 1''': Taking advantage of [[public information]]: recognise and adopt well-structured external schemes of reference data, such as post codes, weather data, GPS positioning data and travel timetables, exemplified in the personal computing press.&lt;ref name="Ashbrook"&gt;Ashbrook, D. &amp; Starner, T., 2003. Using GPS to learn significant locations and predict movement across multiple users. ''Personal and Ubiquitous Computing'', 7(5), pp.275–286&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 2''': Tagging the noise on the [[world wide web]]: use existing schemes such as [[post code]]s and [[GPS]] data or more typically by adding “tags”, or construct a formal [[ontology]] that provides structure. Shirky provides an overview of these two approaches.&lt;ref name="Shirky"&gt;Shirky, C., 2005. Shirky: Ontology is Overrated -- Categories, Links, and Tags. ''Clay Shirky’s Writings About the Internet''. Available at: http://shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html [Accessed May 23, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 3''': Sifting and analysing: in the wider world the generalised ontologies that are under development extend to hundreds of entities and hundreds of relations between them and provide the means to elicit meaning from large volumes of data. Structured data in databases works best when that structure reflects a higher-level information model – an ontology, or an [[entity-relationship model]].&lt;ref name="Noy"&gt;Noy, N.F., McGuinness, D.L. &amp; others, 2001. Ontology development 101: A guide to creating your first ontology, ''Stanford knowledge systems laboratory technical report KSL-01-05 and Stanford medical informatics technical report SMI-2001-0880''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 4''': Structuring and archiving: with the large volume of data available from sources such as the [[social web]] and from the miniature [[telemetry]] systems used in personal [[health management]], new ways to archive and then trawl data for meaningful information. [[Map-reduce]] methods, originating from [[functional programming]], are a more recent way of eliciting information from large archival [[dataset]]s that is becoming interesting to regular businesses that have very large data resources to work with, but it requires advanced multi-processor resources.&lt;ref name="Chu"&gt;Chu, C. et al., 2007. Map-reduce for machine learning on multicore. ''Advances in neural information processing systems'', 19, p.281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competencies to manage information well===
The [[Information Management Body of Knowledge]] was made available on the world wide web in 2004 &lt;ref name="IMBOK"&gt;IMBOK, 2004. ''The Information Management Body of Knowledge''. Available at: http://www.imbok.org [Accessed May 12, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; 
and sets out to show that the required management competencies to derive real benefits from an investment in information are complex and multi-layered. The framework model that is the basis for understanding competencies comprises six “knowledge” areas and four “process” areas:

[[File:IMBOK Framework.jpg|thumb|This framework is the basis of organising the "Information Management Body of Knowledge" first made available in 2004. This version is adapted by the addition of "Business information" in 2014.]]
;The information management knowledge areas
The IMBOK is based on the argument that there are six areas of required management competency, two of which (“business process management” and “business information management”) are very closely related.&lt;ref name="Bytheway2"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. ''Investing in Information:  the Information Management Body of Knowledge'', Geneva: Springer,
 p29&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Information technology''': The pace of change of [[technology]] and the pressure to constantly acquire the newest technological products can undermine the stability of the [[infrastructure]] that supports systems, and thereby optimises [[business process]]es and delivers benefits. It is necessary to manage the “[[supply side]]” and recognise that technology is, increasingly, becoming a [[commodity]].&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;Carr, N., 2003. IT doesn’t matter. In ''Wringing real value from IT''. HBR OnPoint, pp. 3–10&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Information system''': While historically information systems were developed [[in-house]], over the years it has become possible to acquire most of the software systems that an organisation needs from the [[Application software|software package]] industry. However, there is still the potential for [[competitive advantage]] from the implementation of new systems ideas that deliver to the strategic intentions of organisations.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;
* '''Business processes and Business information''': [[Information system]]s are applied to [[business process]]es in order to improve them, and they bring data to the business that becomes useful as [[business information]]. [[Business process management]] is still seen as a relatively new idea because it is not universally adopted, and it has been difficult in many cases; business ''information'' management is even more of a challenge.&lt;ref name="Belmiro0"&gt;Belmiro, T.R. et al., 2000. Are BPR practitioners really addressing business processes? ''International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management'', 20(10), pp.1183–1203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davenport"&gt;Davenport, T.H. &amp; Short, J., 2003. Information technology and business process redesign. ''Operations management: critical perspectives on business and management'', 1, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business benefit''': What are the benefits that we are seeking? It is necessary not only to be brutally honest about what ''can'' be achieved, but also to ensure the active management and assessment of benefit delivery. Since the emergence and popularisation of the [[Balanced scorecard]] &lt;ref name="Kaplan and Norton"&gt;Kaplan, R. &amp; Norton, D., 1996. ''The balanced scorecard - translating stragegy into action'', Boston MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; there has been huge interest in business performance management but not much serious effort has been made to relate business performance management to the benefits of information technology investments and the introduction of new [[information system]]s until the turn of the [[millennium]].&lt;ref name="Ward2" /&gt;
* '''Business strategy''': Although a long way from the workaday issues of managing information in organisations, [[strategy]] in most organisations simply has to be informed by information technology and information systems opportunities, whether to address poor performance or to improve differentiation and [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]]. Strategic analysis tools such as the [[value chain]] and [[critical success factor]] analysis are directly dependent on proper attention to the information that is (or could be) managed &lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;

;The information management processes
Even with full capability and competency within the six knowledge areas, it is argued that things can still go wrong. The problem lies in the migration of ideas and information management value from one area of competency to another. Summarising what Bytheway explains in some detail (and supported by selected secondary references):&lt;ref name="Bytheway3"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. ''Investing in Information: the Information Management Body of Knowledge'', Geneva: Springer,
 p31&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Projects''': Information technology is without value until it is engineered into information systems that meet the needs of the business by means of good [[project management]].&lt;ref name="Schwalbe"&gt;Schwalbe, K., 2013. ''Information technology project management'', Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business change''': The best information systems succeed in delivering benefits through the achievement of change within the business systems, but people do not appreciate change that makes new demands upon their skills in the ways that new information systems often do. Contrary to common expectations, there is some evidence that the [[public sector]] has succeeded with information technology induced [[business change]].&lt;ref name="Scholl"&gt;Scholl, H.J., 2005. E-government-induced business process change (BPC): An empirical study of current practices. ''International Journal of Electronic Government Research'' (IJEGR), 1(2), pp.27–49&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business operations''': With new systems in place, with [[business process]]es and [[business information]] improved, and with staff finally ready and able to work with new processes, then the business can get to work, even when new systems extend far beyond the boundaries of a single business.&lt;ref name="Seed"&gt;Saeed, K.A., Malhotra, M.K. &amp; Grover, V., 2005. Examining the Impact of Interorganizational Systems on Process Efficiency and Sourcing Leverage in Buyer–Supplier Dyads. ''Decision Sciences'', 36(3), pp.365–396&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Performance management''': [[Investment]]s are no longer solely about financial results, financial success must be balanced with internal efficiency, [[customer satisfaction]], and with [[organisational learning]] and development.&lt;ref name="Kaplan and Norton" /&gt;

===Summary===
There are always many ways to see a business, and the information management viewpoint is only one way. It is important to remember that other areas of business activity will also contribute to strategy – it is not only good information management that moves a business forwards. [[Corporate governance]], [[human resource management]], [[product development]] and [[marketing]] will all have an important role to play in strategic ways, and we must not see one domain of activity alone as the sole source of strategic success. On the other hand, corporate governance, human resource management, product development and marketing are all dependent on effective information management, and so in the final analysis our competency to manage information well, on the broad basis that is offered here, can be said to be predominant.

==Operationalising information management==

===Managing requisite change===
Organizations are often confronted with many information management challenges and issues at the [[operational level]], especially when [[organisational change]] is engendered. The novelty of new [[systems architecture]]s and a lack of experience with new styles of information management requires a level of organisational [[change management]] that is notoriously difficult to deliver. As a result of a general organisational reluctance to change, to enable new forms of information management, there might be (for example): a shortfall in the requisite resources, a failure to acknowledge new classes of information and the new procedures that use them, a lack of support from senior management leading to a loss of strategic vision, and even political manoeuvring that undermines the operation of the whole organisation.&lt;ref name="Knights and Murray"&gt;Knights, D. &amp; Murray, F., 1994. ''Managers Divided'', Chichester: John Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; However, the implementation of new forms of information management should normally lead to operational benefits.

===The early work of Galbraith===
In early work, taking an information processing view of organisation design, Jay [[Galbraith]] has identified five tactical areas to increase information processing capacity and reduce the need for information processing.&lt;ref name="Galbraith"&gt;Galbraith, J.R., 1977. ''Organization design'', Addison Wesley&lt;/ref&gt;

* Developing, implementing, and monitoring all aspects of the “environment” of an organization.
* Creation of slack resources so as to decrease the load on the overall [[hierarchy]] of resources and to reduce information processing relating to overload.
* Creation of self-contained tasks with defined boundaries and that can achieve proper closure, and with all the [[resource]]s at hand required to perform the task.
* Recognition of lateral relations that cut across functional units, so as to move decision power to the [[Business process|process]] instead of fragmenting it within the [[hierarchy]].
* Investment in vertical information systems that route [[information flow]]s for a specific task (or set of tasks) in accordance to the applied [[business logic]].

===The matrix organisation===
The lateral relations concept leads to an organizational form that is different from the simple hierarchy, the “[[matrix organization]]”.  This brings together the vertical (hierarchical) view of an organisation and the horizontal (product or project) view of the work that it does visible to the outside world. The creation of a matrix organization is one management response to a persistent fluidity of external demand, avoiding multifarious and spurious responses to episodic demands that tend to be dealt with individually.

[[File:Institutsgebaeude ICBM Univ.Oldenburg OLWechloy.jpg|thumb| The ICBM main building in Oldenburg; Germany]]

The '''Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment''' of the [[University of Oldenburg|Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]] ({{lang-de|Institut für Chemie und Biologie des Meeres der Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg}}, abbreviated ICBM)
is one of the marine science institutes at the German coast and the only [[University of Oldenburg|university-based]] marine research institute in [[Lower Saxony]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-meeresforschung.de/en/icbm Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment ICBM) at the University of Oldenburg], at German Marine Research Consortium, retrieved 2014-07-08&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]].
The ICBM is located on the campus Wechloy in Oldenburg, with locations in Wilhelmshaven  and on the island of Spiekeroog (in relation to the national park centre Wittbülten on the area of the Hermann Lietz School). The ICBM operates the Wadden Sea time series station Spiekeroog (WSS) and several research vessels.

==Mission statement and research==
The ICBM carries out fundamental and applied research in [[Marine Sciences|marine]] and [[Environmental Sciences|environmental]] sciences. Interdisciplinary research will provide understanding of the various interactions of marine environmental systems. 
The research focuses on marine [[biogeochemical cycles]] and energy fluxes, as well as on the functional role of [[marine biodiversity]], especially in coastal zones worldwide, and in the oceans.
The mathematic modelling of different environmental systems is complemented by modern, high-resolution analytics and in-house marine sensor developments.
The institute is composed of three sections covering altogether 18 research groups:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbm.de/en/research-groups-at-the-icbm/ Research Groups at the ICBM], at icbm.de, retrieved 2014-07-08&lt;/ref&gt;
*Section Geochemistry and Analytics
*Section Biology and Ecology
*Section Physics and Modelling
For a better understanding of the complex relations the ICBM aims to foster interdisciplinary research.

==Academic training==
The courses of study are closely related to the research activities to provide interdisciplinary and research-oriented training.
The institute offers a broad bachelor programme with contents of marine, environmental and landscape-ecological sciences as well as four Master Programmes which are: Marine Environmental Sciences, Microbiology (held in English), Environmental Modelling and Marine Sensors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbm.de/en/study-and-teaching/courses-of-study/ Courses of study at the ICBM], at icbm.de, retrieved 2014-07-09&lt;/ref&gt; In cooperation with the ICBM, the Jade University of Applied Sciences offers a Bachelor Programme which is fundamental for marine engineering. The ICBM is ERASMUS exchange partner for students.

==History==
In July 1987, Lower Saxony’s minister of Science and Art approved the establishment of the ICBM as a cooperation of the university departments of mathematics, biology, physics and chemistry. In 1991, the ICBM was approved as a central organisation of the University of Oldenburg. The registered association „Centre for Research on Shallow seas, [[Coast|Coastal Zones]] and the Marine Environment – Research Centre Terramare” (Zentrum für Flachmeer-, Küsten- und Meeresumweltforschung e.V. – Forschungszentrum Terramare) which was founded in 1990 in Wilhelmshaven and financed through federal state resources was incorporated into the ICBM in 2008.
The former directors of the ICBM are Wolfgang Krumbein, Ulrich Kattmann, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Bruno Eckhardt, Wolfgang Ebenhöh, Heribert Cypionka, Meinhard Simon, Hans-Jürgen Brumsack, Ulrike Feudel and Jürgen Rullkötter. At the moment, the institute is headed by Helmut Hillebrand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-meeresforschung.de/en/icbm Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment ICBM) at the University of Oldenburg], at German Marine Research Consortium, retrieved 2014-07-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperations and Memberships==
The ICBM cooperates closely with the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology und MARUM, both located in Bremen; with the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, as well as with the Senckenberg Institute by the Sea and the Jade University of Applied Sciences, both located in Wilhelmshaven. The ICBM is a member of the German Marine Research Consortium (KDM) and of the Northwest Marine Research Association (NWMV).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbm.de/en/cooperations/scientific-cooperations/ Partnerships] at icbm.de, retrieved 2014-07-09&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kinetic military action''' is a [[euphemism]] for [[military]] action involving active warfare, usually including lethal force. "'''Kinetic'''" was used as a [[Retronym|retronymic]] euphemism for military action in ''Bush at War,'' a 2002 book by [[Bob Woodward]]. Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] used the words "kinetic" and "non-kinetic" often.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2002/11/birth_of_a_washington_word.html|title=Birth of a Washington Word|last=Noah|first=Timothy|date=November 20, 2002|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=October 30, 2017|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is now also commonly used as a contrast to [[cyber warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityweek.com/cyberwar-breaching-kinetic-barrier "Cyberwar: Breaching the Kinetic Barrier"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Cyber-Warfare.htm "A Brief Summary of Cyber Warfare"]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Kinetic military action" was used by White House aide [[Ben Rhodes (speechwriter)|Ben Rhodes]] on March 23, 2011 to describe U.S. military action in [[2011 military intervention in Libya|Libya]]:{{Quote|I think what we are doing is enforcing a resolution that has a very clear set of goals, which is protecting the Libyan people, averting a humanitarian crisis, and setting up a no-fly zone...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9040">{{Taxation}}
A '''landfill tax''' or '''levy''' is a form of [[tax]] that is applied in some countries to increase the cost of [[landfill]]. The tax is typically levied in units of currency per unit of weight or volume (£/t, €/t, $/yard³). The tax is in addition to the overall cost of landfill and forms a proportion of the [[gate fee]].

==Reasons for landfill tax==
A tax or fee may be imposed on landfills or other disposal facilities as a means of raising general revenues, to generate funds for inspection programs or long-term mitigation of environmental impacts related to disposal, or as a means of inhibiting disposal by raising the cost in comparison to preferable alternatives, in the same manner as an [[excise tax|excise]] or "[[sin tax]]".

Landfilling is discouraged due to a number of key reasons:

*[[Climate change]] caused by [[landfill gas]] from [[biodegradable waste]]
*Loss of resources
**Constraints on areas suitable for landfill sites
**Loss of recyclable components of waste landfilled
* [[Nimby]] objections causing political problems

==Landfill tax by country==
&lt;!--

Is it at a state rather than federal level?

see also Environmental Protection Regulations 1987 
===Australia===

 --&gt;

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]] the [[Waste Minimisation Act 2008]] allowed for the charging of a landfill levy. Half of the landfill levy goes to local authorities with the other half going into a Waste Minimisation Fund. As of 2010 it is set at $10 a tonne but it can be reviewed by the Minister for the Environment.&lt;ref name="mfe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/waste/waste-disposal-levy/faq.html|title=Waste Disposal Levy FAQs|date=22 September 2009|publisher=Ministry for the Environment|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Landfill Tax was introduced in 1996 by Conservative Secretary of State for the Environment, [[John Gummer]], and was the UK's first environmental tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00237/SN00237.pdf|title=Landfill tax : introduction &amp; early history|website=parliament.uk|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Landfill Tax Regulations 1996|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1527/introduction/made|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax is seen as a key mechanism in enabling the UK to meet its targets set out in the [[Landfill Directive]] for the landfilling of biodegradable waste. Through increasing the cost of landfill, other [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|advanced waste treatment technologies]] with higher gate fees are made to become more financially attractive.

The amount of tax levied is calculated according to the weight of the material disposed of and whether it is active or inactive waste.

*Inactive waste covers most materials used in a building's fabric as well as earth excavated for foundations. Most forms of concrete, brick, glass, soil, clay and gravel are classified as inactive.
*Active waste covers all other forms of waste such as wood, ductwork, piping and plastics.

Inevitably there will be some mixing of waste such as inert bricks and concrete mixed with small amounts of wood or mineral dust packaged in polythene bags. It is for the producer of the waste to decide what is reasonable and acceptable in terms of active waste contamination of inert waste.

The landfill site operator is responsible for paying the tax and will pass the cost on to businesses and local councils on top of normal landfill fees. VAT is charged on the landfill fees and the landfill tax.

Operators can reduce their tax liability by making payments to the Landfill Communities Fund under the [[Landfill Tax Credit Scheme]]. The fund aids community or environmental projects in the vicinity of a landfill site and is regulated by ENTRUST, a company limited by guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrust.org.uk/landfill-community-fund|title=Landfill Communities Fund|website=www.entrust.org.uk|publisher=ENTRUST|access-date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landfill tax rates 2013–2014'''

*Standard rate for active waste: £80 per tonne&lt;ref&gt;[[Finance Act 2012]], section 205.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lower rate for inactive waste: £2.50 per tonne

Sections from the coalition government's Emergency Budget 2010:
*2.128 The standard rate of landfill tax will increase by £8 per tonne each year from 1 April 2011 until at least 2014. There will be a floor under the standard rate at £80 per tonne, so that the rate will not fall below £80 per tonne from April 2014 until at least 2020.
*2.129 New qualifying criteria for lower rated wastes will be legislated in the Finance Bill introduced in the autumn (2010), to come into effect on 1 April 2011.

'''Landfill tax rates 2015–16'''

From 1 April 2015 to April 2016 the landfill tax rates were:
* Standard rate for active waste: £82.60 per tonne&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EfW, landfill, RDF - letsrecycle.com|url = http://www.letsrecycle.com/prices/efw-landfill-rdf-2/|website = letsrecycle.com|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lower rate for inactive waste: £2.60 per tonne

With the [[Scotland Act 2012]], the [[Scottish Government]] gained the devolved power to levy its own landfill tax. The [[Scottish Landfill Tax]] was introduced by the [[Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014]] and began to be payable on 1 April 2015.&lt;ref name="ZeroWaste"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/landfill-tax-scotland-0|title=A landfill tax for Scotland|website=zerowastescotland.org.uk|publisher=Zero Waste Scotland|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LegislationSCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/2/|title=Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014|website=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RevenueScotland"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.scot/scottish-landfill-tax|title=Scottish Landfill Tax|website=Revenue Scotland|publisher=The Scottish Government|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 and 2016, there were concerns that some companies disposing waste to landfill were wrongly putting waste with a biodegradable and non-inert content into landfills at the inactive waste taxation level. A new testing regime was introduced, where a small amount of the load is tested to ascertain its biodegradable content.

'''Landfill tax rates 2018-19'''

From 1 April 2018 to April 2019 the landfill tax rates are:
* Standard rate for active waste: £88.95 per tonne
* Lower rate for inactive waste: £2.80 per tonne

The [[Welsh Government]] will take responsibility for the tax in Wales from April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrust.org.uk/landfill-community-fund/wales/|title=The LCF in Wales|website=ENTRUST|access-date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The United States has numerous federal laws and regulations regarding the operation of landfills,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} but there is no national landfill tax or fee.  Many{{Which|date=October 2009}} states and local governments collect fees and taxes on the collection or disposal of solid waste.

==== California ====
Landfills in California are subject to fees and taxes levied by cities and counties, as well as by the state.  The Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 authorized a state fee (set at $1.40 per ton effective 2002-07-01) to fund the activities of the [[California Integrated Waste Management Board]] (CIWMB).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/agendas/mtgdocs/2001/06/00005641.doc California Integrated Waste Management Board, June 19–21, 2001, Agenda Item 28] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cities and counties collect fees from landfills within their jurisdiction to recover the costs of local solid waste planning and inspection programs, to operate programs for the collection and disposal of household [[hazardous wastes]], and to fund some costs of recycling and reuse programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=prc&amp;group=41001-42000&amp;file=41900-41904 California Public Resources Code, Section 41900 et seq.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Landfills in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] are subject to the highest disposal tax in California, with the Disposal Facility Tax set at $13.00 per ton in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=14367&amp;sid=5 San Jose Municipal Code, Chapter 4.78]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''licensed behavior analyst''' is a type of [[behavioral health]] [[professional]] in the United States. They have at least a master's degree, and sometimes a doctorate, in [[behavior analysis]] or a related field.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cautilli, J.D., &amp; Dziewolska, H.|year=2008|title=Licensing behavior analysts: General historical issues and why people oppose them|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy|volume=4|issue=1|pages=1–13|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bct/4/1/1.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|format=PDF|doi=10.1037/h0100827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysts apply [[radical behaviorism]] to people by performing [[applied behavior analysis]].&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt;

== Defining the scope of practice ==
The Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) defines behavior analysis as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacb.com BACB]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The field of behavior analysis grew out of the scientific study of principles of learning and behavior. It has two main branches: experimental and applied behavior analysis. The experimental analysis of behavior (EAB) is the basic science of this field and has over many decades accumulated a substantial and well-respected research literature. This literature provides the scientific foundation for applied behavior analysis (ABA), which is both an applied science that develops methods of changing behavior and a profession that provides services to meet diverse behavioral needs. Briefly, professionals in applied behavior analysis engage in the specific and comprehensive use of principles of learning, including [[operant]] and respondent learning, in order to address behavioral needs of widely varying individuals in diverse settings. Examples of these applications include: building the skills and achievements of children in school settings; enhancing the development, abilities, and choices of children and adults with different kinds of disabilities; and augmenting the performance and satisfaction of employees in organizations and businesses."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the above suggests, [[behavior analysis]] is based on the principles of [[operant]] and [[respondent conditioning]]. This places [[behavior analysis]] as one of the dominant models of [[behavior management]], [[behavioral engineering]] and [[behavior therapy]].  Behavior analysis is an active, environmental based approach and some behavior analytic procedures are considered highly restrictive (see [[least restrictive environment]]). For example, these service may make access to preferred items contingent on performance. This has led to abuses in the past, in particular where punishment programs have been involved.&lt;ref name=Cautilli/&gt; In addition, failure to be an independent profession often leads behavior analysts and other behavior modifiers to have their ethical codes supplanted by those of other professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cautilli, J.D. &amp; Weinberg, M.|year=2007|title=Editorial – Beholden To Other Professions|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=8|issue=2|pages=111–113|url=http://www.baojournal.com/|doi=10.1037/h0100606}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a behavior analyst working in the hospital setting might design a [[token economy]], a form of [[contingency management]]. He may desire to meet his ethical obligation to make the program habilitative and in the clients' best long-term interest. The physicians and nurses in the hospital who supervise him may decide that the [[token economy]] should instead create order in the nursing routines so clients get their medication quickly and efficiently. Instead of the ethical code of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board and the [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International's position that those receiving treatment have a right to effective treatment&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apps.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/treatment.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119073107/http://apps.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/treatment.asp|archivedate=November 19, 2008|deadurl=yes|title=Statement on the Right to Effective Behavioral Treatment, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a right to effective education.&lt;ref name=ABA/&gt; In addition, failure on the part of a behavior analyst to adequately supervise his or her workers could lead to abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bassett, J. E., &amp; Blanchard, E. B.|year=1977|title=The effect of the absence of close supervision on the use of response cost in a prison token economy|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=10|pages=375–380|doi=10.1901/jaba.1977.10-375|pmc=1311200|pmid=924912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, misrepresentations of the field and historical problems between academics has led to frequent calls to professionalize behavior analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cautilli, J. D. &amp; Rosenwasser, B.J.|year=2001|title=The Editors speak out on intellectual bigotry: Why We Need To Become A Profession|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=2|issue=1|pages=2–4|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/2/1/2.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, there is wide support within the profession for licensure.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt;

===Range of populations worked with===
{{Main article|Professional practice of behavior analysis}}

The professional practice of behavior analysis ranges from treatment of individuals with autism and developmental disabilities to behavioral coaching and behavioral psychotherapy. In addition to treatment of [[mental health]] problems and corrections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bednar, R. L., Zelhart, P. F., Greathouse, L., &amp; Weinberg, S.|year=1970|title=Operant conditioning principles in the treatment of learning and behavior problems with delinquent boys|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|volume=17|pages=492–497|doi=10.1037/h0029884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Braukmann, C. J., Fixsen, D. L., Phillips, E. L., &amp; Wolf, M. M.|year=1975|title=Behavioral approaches to treatment in the crime and delinquency field|journal=Criminology|volume=13|pages=299–331|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1975.tb00672.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McGuffin, P.W.|year=1991|title=The effect of timeout duration on frequency of aggression in hospitalized children with conduct disorders|journal=Behavioral Interventions|volume=6|issue=4|pages=279–288|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bin.2360060405/abstract|doi=10.1002/bin.2360060405}}&lt;/ref&gt; the professional practice of behavior analysis includes organizational behavioral management, behavioral safety and even maintaining the behavioral health of astronauts while within and beyond earth's orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Emurian, H.H. &amp; Brady, J.V.|year=2007|title=Behavioral Health Management of Space Dwelling Groups: Safe Passage Beyond Earth Orbit|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=8|issue=3|pages=113–135|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/8/2/113.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certification===
The Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) offers a technical [[Professional certification|certificate]] in behavior analysis. This certification is internationally recognized. This certification states the level of training and requires an exam to show a minimum level of [[competence (human resources)|competence]] to call oneself a board certified behavior analyst (BCBA). Certification came about because of many ethical issues with behavioral interventions being delivered including the use of aversive and humiliating treatments in the name of [[behavior modification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Bailey, J.S. &amp; Burch, M.R.|year=2005|title=Ethics for Behavior Analysts: A Practical Guide to the Behavior Analyst Certification Board Guidelines for Responsible Conduct|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|isbn=9780805851175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American psychological association offers a diplomate (post Ph.D. and licensed certification) in behavioral psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Dowd, E.T.|year=2001|title=Board Certification (Diplomate) in Behavioral Psychology|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=2|issue=1|pages=l5–28|url=http://www.personal.kent.edu/~edowd/ABPP/diplomate.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The meaning of certification===
BACB is a private non-profit organization without governmental powers to regulate behavior analytic practice. While the BACB certification means that candidates have satisfied entry-level requirements in behavior analytic training, certificants may require a government license for independent practice when treating behavioral health or medical problems. Licensed certificants must operate within the scope of their license and must practice within their areas of expertise. Where the government regulates behavior analytic services unlicensed certificants must be supervised by a licensed professional and operate within the scope of their supervisor’s license when treating disorders. Unlicensed certificants who provide behavior analytic training for educational or optimal performance purposes do not require licensed supervision. Where the government does not regulate the treatment of medical or psychological disorders certificants should practice in accord with the laws of their state, province, or country. All certificants must practice within their personal areas of expertise.

===Licensure===
Recently, a move has occurred to license behavior analysts.&lt;ref name=Cautilli&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cautilli, J.D., &amp; Weinberg, M.|year=2007|title=Editorial: To license or not to license? That is the question:  Or, if we make a profession, will they come?|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–8.[http://www.baojournal.com/]|doi=10.1037/h0100100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abapracticesig.org/pr01.htm|title=Proposed Regulation: Model Licensing Act for Behavior Analysts|year=2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905130810/http://www.abapracticesig.org/pr01.htm|deadurl=yes|archivedate= September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Licensure's purpose is to protect the public from employing unqualified practitioners.&lt;ref name=Hassert&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hassert, D.L, Kelly, A.N., Pritchard, J.K. &amp; Cautilli, J.D.|year=2008|title=The Licensing of Behavior Analysts: Protecting the profession and the public|journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention|volume=5|issue=2|pages=8–19|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/eib/5/2/8.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|doi=10.1037/h0100415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model licensing act states that a person is a behavior analyst by training and experience.  The person seeking licensure must have mastered behavior analysis by achieving a master's degree in behavior analysis or related subject matter. Like all other master level licensed professions (see [[counseling]] and [[licensed professional counselor]]) the model act sets the standard for a master's degree. This requirement states that the person has achieved textbook knowledge of behavior analysis which can be then tested through the exam offered by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board or the one offered by the World Center for Behavior Analysis. It also requires an internship in which a behavior analysts works under another master or Ph.D. level behavior analyst for a period of one year (750 hours) with at least two hours/week of supervision. Finally, those 750 hours are considered tutelage time. After that, the behavior analyst must engage in supervised practice under a behavior analyst for a period of another 2 years (2,000 hours).

Once this process is complete, the person applies to a state board who ensures that he or she has indeed met the above conditions.  Once the person is licensed public protection is still monitored by the licensing board, which makes sure that the person receives sufficient ongoing education, and the licensing board investigates ethical complaints. A licensed behavior analyst would have equal training, knowledge, skills and abilities in their discipline as would a [[mental health counselor]] or [[marriage and family therapist]] in their discipline. In February 2008, [[Indiana]], [[Arizona]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Vermont]], [[Oklahoma]] and other states now have legislation pending to create licensure for behavior analysts. [[Pennsylvania]] was the first state in 2008 to license "behavior specialists" to cover behavior analysts. Arizona, less than three weeks later, became the first state to license "behavior analysts." Other states such as [[Nevada]] and [[Wisconsin]] also have passed behavior analytic licensure.

==Other countries==
Recently{{when|date=October 2013}} licensure efforts have occurred in [[Canada]] for behavior analysts.

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International has a special interest group for practitioner issues, which focuses on key issues related to licensing behavior analysts. In addition, they have a practice board and a policy board to handle legislative issues [http://www.abainternational.org/ ABA:I]. Finally, the association has recently put out its own model licensing act for behavior analysts.

Association for behavior analysis international serves as the core intellectual home for behavior analysts.&lt;ref name=Hassert/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Twyman, J.S.|year=2007|title=A new era of science and practice in behavior analysis|journal=Association for Behavior Analysis International: Newsletter|volume=30|issue=3|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association for Behavior Analysis International sponsors 2 conferences per year – one in the U.S. and one international.

'''Logical positivism''' and '''logical empiricism''', which together formed '''neopositivism''', was a movement in [[Western philosophy]] whose central thesis was [[verificationism]], a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] which asserted that only statements verifiable through [[empirical]] observation are cognitively meaningful.  The movement flourished in the 1920s and 1930s in several European centers.  

Efforts to convert philosophy to this new "scientific philosophy", shared with [[empirical sciences]]' best examples, such as [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], sought to prevent confusion rooted in unclear language and unverifiable claims.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv/&gt; 

The [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and [[Vienna Circle]]—groups of philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians in Berlin and Vienna—propounded logical [[positivism]], starting in the late 1920s.

==Influences==
Logical positivists culled from [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Ludwig Wittgenstein's early philosophy of language]] the verifiability principle or criterion of meaningfulness.  As in [[Ernst Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]], whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience,&lt;ref name="dictcc"&gt;{{cite quote|url=www11.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&amp;lang=en&amp;s=sensory%20experience|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; verificationists took all sciences' basic content to be only sensory experience.  And some influence came from [[Percy Bridgman]]'s musings that others proclaimed as [[operationalism]], whereby a physical theory is understood by what laboratory procedures scientists perform to test its predictions.  In verificationism, only the ''verifiable'' was scientific, and thus meaningful (or ''cognitively meaningful''), whereas the unverifiable, being unscientific, were meaningless "pseudostatements" (just ''emotively meaningful'').  Unscientific discourse, as in ethics and metaphysics, would be unfit for discourse by philosophers, newly tasked to organize knowledge, not develop new knowledge.

==Definitions==
Logical positivism is sometimes stereotyped as forbidding talk of [[unobservable]]s, such as microscopic entities or such notions as causality and general principles,{{fact|date=January 2018}} but that is an exaggeration.  Rather, most neopositivists viewed talk of unobservables as [[metaphor]]ical or elliptical: direct observations phrased abstractly or indirectly.  So ''theoretical terms'' would garner meaning from ''observational terms'' via ''correspondence rules'', and thereby ''theoretical laws'' would be reduced to ''empirical laws''.  Via [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[logicism]], reducing mathematics to logic, physics' mathematical formulas would be converted to [[symbolic logic]].  Via Russell's [[logical atomism]], [[natural language|ordinary language]] would break into discrete units of meaning.  [[Rational reconstruction]], then, would convert ordinary statements into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a [[logical syntax]].  A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a [[logical calculus]] or [[operationalism|empirical operation]] could [[deductive inference|verify]] its [[truth-value|falsity or truth]].

==Development==
In the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and the United States.  By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[physicalism]], whereby science's content is not actual or potential sensations, but instead is entities publicly observable. [[Rudolf Carnap]], who had sparked logical positivism in the Vienna Circle, had sought to replace ''verification'' with simply ''confirmation''.  With [[World War II]]'s close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, ''logical empiricism'', led largely by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], in America, who expounded the [[covering law model]] of scientific explanation.  Logical positivism became a major underpinning of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and dominated philosophy in the [[English-speaking world]], including [[philosophy of science]], while influencing sciences, but especially social sciences, into the 1960s.  Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems,&lt;ref name="Smith1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=L.D. |last=Smith |year=1986 |title=Behaviorism and Logical Positivism: A Reassessment of the Alliance |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804713016 |lccn=85030366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ6aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 |page=314 |quote=The secondary and historical literature on logical positivism affords substantial grounds for concluding that logical positivism failed to solve many of the central problems it generated for itself. Prominent among the unsolved problems was the failure to find an acceptable statement of the verifiability (later confirmability) criterion of meaningfulness. Until a competing tradition emerged (about the late 1950's), the problems of logical positivism continued to be attacked from within that tradition. But as the new tradition in the philosophy of science began to demonstrate its effectiveness—by dissolving and rephrasing old problems as well as by generating new ones—philosophers began to shift allegiances to the new tradition, even though that tradition has yet to receive a canonical formulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300066067 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of [[Ptolemy]], [[David Hume|Hume]], d'Alembert, [[August Compte|Compte]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Ernst Mach]]. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—[[neo-Thomisism]], [[neo-Kantianism]], [[intuitionism]], dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and [[existentialism]]. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C. [Verifiability Criterion]—but for no defensible reason—or admitting that the V.C. requires a background language, etc., which opens the door to relativism, etc. In light of this dilemma, many folk—especially following Popper's "last-ditch" effort to "save" empiricism/positivism/realism with the falsifiability criterion—have agreed that positivism is a dead-end. |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107230818/http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |archivedate=7 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its doctrines were increasingly criticized, most trenchantly by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson|Norwood Hanson]], [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]], [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]], and [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]].

==Roots==

===Language===

''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', by the young [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], introduced the view of philosophy as "critique of language", offering the possibility of a theoretically principled distinction of intelligible versus nonsensical discourse.  ''Tractatus'' adhered to a [[correspondence theory of truth]] (versus a [[coherence theory of truth]]).  Wittgenstein's influence also shows in some versions of the [[verifiability principle]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, compare "Proposition 4.024" of ''Tractatus'', asserting that we understand a proposition when we know the outcome if it is true, with Schlick's asserting, "To state the circumstances under which a proposition is true is the same as stating its meaning".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Positivismus und realismus", ''Erkenntnis'' '''3''':1–31, English trans in Sarkar, Sahotra, ed, ''Logical Empiricism at its Peak: Schlick, Carnap, and Neurath'' (New York: Garland Publishing, 1996), p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  In tractarian doctrine, truths of logic are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], a view widely accepted by logical positivists who were also influenced by Wittgenstein's interpretation of [[probability]] although, according to Neurath, some logical positivists found ''Tractatus'' to contain too much metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;For summary of the effect of Tractatus on logical positivists, see the [http://www.pitt.edu/~philosop/images/doc4-full.jpg Entwicklung der Thesen des "Wiener Kreises"].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]] began the program of reducing mathematics to logic, continued it with [[Bertrand Russell]], but lost interest in this [[logicism]], and Russell continued it with [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', inspiring some of the more mathematical logical posivists, such as [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]].&lt;ref name=Hintikka/&gt;  (Carnap's early anti-metaphysical works employed Russell's [[type theory|theory of types]].)&lt;ref&gt;See Rudolf Carnap, "The elimination Of metaphysics through logical analysis of language", ''Erkenntnis'', 1932;'''2''', reprinted in ''Logical Positivism'', Alfred Jules Ayer, ed, (New York: Free Press, 1959), pp 60–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carnap envisioned a universal language that could reconstruct mathematics and thereby encode physics.&lt;ref name=Hintikka&gt;Jaako Hintikka, "Logicism", in Andrew D Irvine, ed, ''Philosophy of Mathematics'' (Burlington MA: North Holland, 2009),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=Logical+positivism+logicism pp 283–84].&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]] showed this impossible except in trivial cases, and [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[undefinability theorem]] shattered all hopes of reducing mathematics to logic.&lt;ref name=Hintikka/&gt;  Thus, a universal language failed to stem from Carnap's 1934 work ''Logische Syntax der Sprache'' (''Logical Syntax of Language'').&lt;ref name=Hintikka/&gt;  Still, some logical positivists, including [[Carl Hempel]], continued support of logicism.&lt;ref name=Hintikka/&gt;

===Empiricism===

In Germany, [[Hegelian metaphysics]] was a dominant movement, and Hegelian successors such as [[F H Bradley]] explained reality by postulating metaphysical entities lacking empirical basis, drawing reaction in the form of positivism.&lt;ref name="Suppe, Frederick 1999"&gt;Frederick Suppe, "The positivist model of scientific theories", in ''Scientific Inquiry'', Robert Klee, ed, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), pp 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in the late 19th century, there was a "back to Kant" movement.  [[Ernst Mach]]'s positivism and [[phenomenalism]] were a major influence.

==Origins==

===Vienna===

The [[Vienna Circle]], gathering around [[University of Vienna]] and [[Café Central]], was led principally by [[Moritz Schlick]].  Schlick had held a [[neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantian]] position, but later converted, via Carnap's 1928 book ''Der logische Aufbau der Welt'', that is, ''The Logical Structure of the World''.  A 1929 pamphlet written by [[Otto Neurath]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] summarized the Vienna Circle's positions.  Another member of Vienna Circle to later prove very influential was [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]].  A friendly but tenacious critic of the Circle was [[Karl Popper]], whom [[Otto Neurath|Neurath]] nicknamed the "Official Opposition".

[[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and other [[Vienna Circle]] members, including [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hahn]] and [[Otto Neurath|Neurath]], saw need for a weaker criterion of meaningfulness than verifiability.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  A radical "left" wing—led by Neurath and Carnap—began the program of "liberalization of empiricism", and they also emphasized [[fallibilism]] and [[pragmatics]], which latter Carnap even suggested as empiricism's basis.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  A conservative "right" wing—led by [[Moritz Schlick|Schlick]] and [[Friedrich Waismann|Waismann]]—rejected both the liberalization of empiricism and the epistemological nonfoundationalism of a move from [[phenomenalism]] to [[physicalism]].&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  As Neurath and somewhat Carnap posed science toward social reform, the split in Vienna Circle also reflected political views.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;

===Berlin===

The [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] was led principally by [[Hans Reichenbach]].

===Rivals===

Both [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] had been influenced by and sought to define logical positivism versus the neo-Kantianism of [[Ernst Cassirer]]—the then leading figure of [[Marburg school]], so called—and against [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].  Logical positivists especially opposed [[Martin Heidegger]]'s obscure metaphysics, the epitome of what logical positivism rejected.  In the early 1930s, Carnap debated Heidegger over "metaphysical pseudosentences".&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  Despite its revolutionary aims, logical positivism was but one view among many vying within Europe, and logical positivists initially spoke their language.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;

===Export===

As the movement's first emissary to the [[New World]], [[Moritz Schlick]] visited [[Stanford University]] in 1929, yet otherwise remained in Vienna and was murdered at the [[University of Vienna|University]], reportedly by a deranged student, in 1936.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  That year, a British attendee at some Vienna Circle meetings since 1933, [[A. J. Ayer]] saw his ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', written in English, import logical positivism to the [[English-speaking world]].  By then, the [[Nazi Party]]'s 1933 rise to power in Germany had triggered flight of intellectuals.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt; In exile in England, [[Otto Neurath]] died in 1945.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Hans Reichenbach]], and [[Carl Hempel]]—Carnap's [[protégé]] who had studied in [[Berlin]] with Reichenbach—settled permanently in America.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  Upon Germany's [[annexation of Austria]] in 1938, remaining logical positivists, many of whom were also Jewish, were targeted and continued flight.  Logical positivism thus became dominant in the English-speaking world.

==Principles==

===Analytic/synthetic gap===

Concerning [[metaphysics|reality]], the [[logical truth|necessary]] is a state true in all [[possible worlds]]—mere [[logical validity]]—whereas the [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] hinges on the way the particular world is.  Concerning [[epistemology|knowledge]], the ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'' is knowable before or without, whereas the ''[[a posteriori]]'' is knowable only after or through, relevant experience.  Concerning [[propositions|statements]], the ''[[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]]'' is true via terms' [[syntax|arrangement]] and [[semantics|meanings]], thus a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—true by logical necessity but uninformative about the world—whereas the ''[[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]]'' adds reference to a state of facts, a [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]].

In 1739, [[David Hume]] cast a [[Hume's fork|fork]] aggressively dividing "relations of ideas" from "matters of fact and real existence", such that all truths are of one type or the other.&lt;ref name=Flew&gt;Antony G Flew, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Hume's+fork "Hume's fork"], p 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen B Mitchell, ''Roots of Wisdom: A Tapestry of Philosophical Traditions: A Tapestry of Philosophical Traditions'', 6th edn (Boston: Wadsworth, 2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=P6o0OUzwmSAC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=logical+positivism+Hume's+fork "Hume's fork and logical positivism"], pp 249-50.&lt;/ref&gt;  By Hume's fork, truths by relations among ideas (abstract) all align on one side (analytic, necessary, ''a priori''), whereas truths by states of actualities (concrete) always align on the other side (synthetic, contingent, ''a posteriori'').&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;  At any treatises containing neither, Hume orders, "Commit it then to the flames, for it can contain nothing but [[sophistry]] and illusion".&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;

Thus awakened from "dogmatic slumber", [[Immanuel Kant]] quested to answer Hume's challenge—but by explaining how [[metaphysics]] is possible.  Eventually, in his [[Critique of Pure Reason|1781 work]], Kant crossed the tines of Hume's fork to identify another range of truths by necessity—[[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'']], statements claiming states of facts but known true before experience—by arriving at [[transcendental idealism]], attributing the mind a constructive role in [[phenomena]] by arranging [[sense data]] into the very experience ''space'', ''time'', and ''substance''.  Thus, Kant saved [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] from Hume's [[problem of induction]] by finding uniformity of nature to be ''a priori'' knowledge.  Logical positivists rejected Kant's [[synthetic a priori|synthethic ''a priori'']], and staked [[Hume's fork]], whereby a statement is either analytic and ''a priori'' (thus [[logical truth|necessary]] and verifiable logically) or synthetic and ''[[a posteriori]]'' (thus [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and verifiable empirically).&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;

===Observation/theory gap===

Early, most logical positivists proposed that all knowledge is based on logical inference from simple "protocol sentences" grounded in observable facts.  In the 1936 and 1937 papers "Testability and meaning", individual terms replace sentences as the units of meaning.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  Further, theoretical terms no longer need to acquire meaning by explicit definition from observational terms: the connection may be indirect, through a system of implicit definitions.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  (Carnap also provides an important, pioneering discussion of [[disposition predicate]]s.)&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;

===Cognitive meaningfulness===

====Verification====

The logical positivists' initial stance was that a statement is "cognitively meaningful" only if some finite procedure conclusively determines its truth.&lt;ref&gt;For a classic survey of other versions of verificationism, see Carl G Hempel, "Problems and changes in the empiricist criterion of meaning", ''Revue Internationale de Philosophie'', 1950;'''41''':41-63.&lt;/ref&gt;  By this [[verifiability principle]], only statements verifiable either by their [[analytic proposition|analyticity]] or by empiricism were ''cognitively meaningful''.  [[Metaphysics]], [[ontology]], as well as much of [[ethics]] failed this criterion, and so were found ''cognitively meaningless''.  Moritz Schlick, however, did not view ethical or aesthetic statements as [[meaning (philosophy of language)|cognitively meaningless]].&lt;ref&gt;See Moritz Schlick, "The future Of philosophy", in ''The Linguistic Turn'', Richard Rorty, ed, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), pp 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Cognitive meaningfulness'' was variously defined: having a [[truth value]]; corresponding to a possible state of affairs; intelligible or understandable as are scientific statements.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of these different views can be found in Scheffler's ''Anatomy of Inquiry'', Ayer's ''Language, Truth, and Logic'', Schlick's "Positivism and realism" (reprinted in Sarkar 1996 and Ayer 1959), and Carnap's ''Philosophy and Logical Syntax''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethics]] and [[aesthetics]] were subjective preferences, while [[theology]] and other [[metaphysics]] contained "pseudostatements", neither true nor false.  This meaningfulness was cognitive, although other types of meaningfulness—for instance, emotive, expressive, or figurative—occurred in metaphysical discourse, dismissed from further review.  Thus, logical positivism indirectly asserted [[Hume's law]], the principle that ''is'' statements cannot justify ''ought'' statements, but are separated by an unbridgeable gap.  [[A. J. Ayer]]'s 1936 book asserted an extreme variant—the [[emotivism|boo/hooray doctrine]]—whereby all evaluative judgments are but emotional reactions.

====Confirmation====

In an important pair of papers in 1936 and 1937, "Testability and meaning", Carnap replaced ''verification'' with ''confirmation'', on the view that although universal laws cannot be verified they can be confirmed.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  Later, Carnap employed abundant logical and mathematical methods in researching inductive logic while seeking to provide an account of probability as "degree of confirmation", but was never able to formulate a model.&lt;ref name=IEP-Carnap&gt;Mauro Murzi [http://www.iep.utm.edu/carnap "Rudolf Carnap (1891—1970)"], ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 12 Apr 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Carnap's inductive logic, every universal law's degree of confirmation is always zero.&lt;ref name=IEP-Carnap/&gt;  In any event, the precise formulation of what came to be called the "criterion of cognitive significance" took three decades (Hempel 1950, Carnap 1956, Carnap 1961).&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;

[[Carl Hempel]] became a major critic within the logical positivism movement.&lt;ref name="sep-hempel"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Fetzer |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2012 |title=Carl Hempel |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Summer 2012 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hempel/#SciRea |quote=It would fall to Hempel to become perhaps the most astute critic of that movement and to contribute to its refinement as logical empiricism... Hempel himself attained a certain degree of prominence as a critic of this movement... The analytic/synthetic distinction and the observational/theoretical distinction were tied together by the ''verifiability criterion of meaningfulness''... By this standard, sentences that are non-analytic but also non-verifiable, including various theological or metaphysical assertions concerning God or The Absolute, qualify as cognitively meaningless. This was viewed as a desirable result. But, as Hempel would demonstrate, its scope was far too sweeping, since it also rendered meaningless the distinctively scientific assertions made by laws and theories... The analytic/synthetic distinction took a decided hit when the noted logician, Willard van Orman Quine, published "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" (1953), challenging its adequacy... While the analytic/synthetic distinction appears to be justifiable in modeling important properties of languages, the observational/theoretical distinction does not fare equally well. Within logical positivism, observation language was assumed to consist of names and predicates whose applicability or not can be ascertained, under suitable conditions, by means of direct observation...  Karl Popper (1965, 1968), however, would carry the argument in a different direction by looking at the ontic nature of properties... Hempel (1950, 1951), meanwhile, demonstrated that the verifiability criterion could not be sustained. Since it restricts empirical knowledge to observation sentences and their deductive consequences, scientific theories are reduced to logical constructions from observables. In a series of studies about cognitive significance and empirical testability, he demonstrated that the verifiability criterion implies that existential generalizations are meaningful, but that universal generalizations are not, even though they include general laws, the principal objects of scientific discovery. Hypotheses about relative frequencies in finite sequences are meaningful, but hypotheses concerning limits in infinite sequences are not. The verifiability criterion thus imposed a standard that was too strong to accommodate the characteristic claims of science and was not justifiable... Both theoretical and dispositional predicates, which refer to non-observables, posed serious problems for the positivist position, since the verifiability criterion implies they must be reducible to observables or are empirically meaningless... The need to dismantle the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness together with the demise of the observational/theoretical distinction meant that logical positivism no longer represented a rationally defensible position. At least two of its defining tenets had been shown to be without merit. Since most philosophers believed that Quine had shown the analytic/synthetic distinction was also untenable, moreover, many concluded that the enterprise had been a total failure. Among the important benefits of Hempel's critique, however, was the production of more general and flexible criteria of cognitive significance... Hempel suggested multiple criteria for assessing the cognitive significance of different theoretical systems, where significance is not categorical but rather a matter of degree... The elegance of Hempel's study laid to rest any lingering aspirations for simple criteria of cognitive significance and signaled the demise of logical positivism as a philosophical movement. Precisely what remained, however, was in doubt. Presumably, anyone who rejected one or more of the three principles defining positivism—the analytic/synthetic distinction, the observational/theoretical distinction, and the verifiability criterion of significance—was not a logical positivist. The precise outlines of its philosophical successor, which would be known as "logical empiricism", were not entirely evident. Perhaps this study came the closest to defining its intellectual core. Those who accepted Hempel's four criteria and viewed cognitive significance as a matter of degree were members, at least in spirit. But some new problems were beginning to surface with respect to Hempel's covering-law explication of explanation and old problems remained from his studies of induction, the most remarkable of which was known as "the paradox of confirmation".}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hempel elucidated the [[paradox of the ravens|paradox of confirmation]].

====Weak verification====

The second edition of [[A. J. Ayer]]'s book arrived in 1946, and discerned ''strong'' versus ''weak'' forms of verification.  Ayer concluded, "A proposition is said to be verifiable, in the strong sense of the term, if, and only if, its truth could be conclusively established by experience", but is verifiable in the weak sense "if it is possible for experience to render it probable".&lt;ref name=Ayer-p50&gt;Ayer, ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', 1946, p 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  And yet, "no proposition, other than a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], can possibly be anything more than a probable [[hypothesis]]".&lt;ref name=Ayer-p50/&gt;  Thus, all are open to weak verification.

==Philosophy of science==

Upon the global defeat of [[Nazism]], and the removal from philosophy of rivals for radical reform—[[Marburg school|Marburg]] neo-Kantianism, [[Edmund Husserl|Husserlian]] phenomenology, [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s "existential hermeneutics"—and while hosted in the climate of American [[pragmatism]] and commonsense empiricism, the neopositivists shed much of their earlier, revolutionary zeal.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv/&gt;  No longer crusading to revise traditional philosophy into a new ''scientific philosophy'', they became respectable members of a new philosophy subdiscipline, ''[[philosophy of science]]''.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv&gt;Michael Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR14 p xiv].&lt;/ref&gt;  Receiving support from [[Ernest Nagel]], logical empiricists were especially influential in the social sciences.&lt;ref name=Novick-p546&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'' (Cambridge U P, 1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;pg=PA546&amp;dq=Carnap+Hempel+Nagel+social+sciences+natural+fact+value p 546].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explanation===

[[positivism|Comtean positivism]] had viewed science as ''description'', whereas the [[logical positivists]] posed science as ''explanation'', perhaps to better realize the envisioned [[unity of science]] by covering not only [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—but the [[special science]]s, too, for instance [[biology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background&gt;James Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"]—sec 1 "Background and introduction", in Zalta EN, ed,''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Winter 2011 edn&lt;/ref&gt;  The most widely accepted concept of scientific explanation, held even by neopositivist critic [[Karl Popper]], was the [[deductive-nomological model]] (DN model).&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction&gt;James Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"]—Article overview, Zalta EN, ed, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Winter 2011 edn&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet DN model received its greatest explication by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], first in his 1942 article "The function of general laws in history", and more explicitly with [[Paul Oppenheim]] in their 1948 article "Studies in the logic of explanation".&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction/&gt;

In the DN model, the stated phenomenon to be explained is the ''explanandum''—which can be an event, [[scientific law|law]], or [[scientific theory|theory]]—whereas premises stated to explain it are the ''explanans''.&lt;ref name=Suppe&gt;Suppe, ''Structure of Scientific Theories'' (U Illinois P, 1977), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC&amp;pg=PA619&amp;dq= pp 619–21].&lt;/ref&gt;  Explanans must be true or highly confirmed, contain at least one law, and entail the explanandum.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;   Thus, given initial conditions ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus general laws ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', event ''E'' is a deductive consequence and scientifically explained.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In the DN model, a law is an unrestricted generalization by conditional proposition—''If A, then B''—and has empirical content testable.&lt;ref&gt;Eleonora  Montuschi, ''Objects in Social Science'' (London &amp; New York: Continuum, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ24-BV8WSAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= pp 61–62].&lt;/ref&gt;  (Differing from a merely true regularity—for instance, ''George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet''—a law suggests what ''must'' be true,&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), p 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and is consequent of a [[scientific theory]]'s [[axiom]]atic structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), pp 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;)

By the [[David Hume|Humean]] empiricist view that humans observe sequences of events, (not cause and effect, as causality and causal mechanisms are unobservable), the DN model neglects causality beyond mere [[constant conjunction]], first event ''A'' and then always event ''B''.&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt;  Hempel's explication of the DN model held [[natural laws]]—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory and, if formulated realistically, approximating causal explanation.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In later articles, Hempel defended the DN model and proposed a probabilistic explanation, [[inductive-statistical model]] (IS model).&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  the DN and IS models together form the ''covering law model'',&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt; as named by a critic, [[William Dray]].&lt;ref&gt;Georg Henrik von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'' (Ithaca NY: Cornell University Press, 1971), [https://books.google.com/books?id=33wCi2bg5x0C&amp;pg=PA11 p 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  (Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to [[deductive-statistical model]] (DS model).)&lt;ref name=Glennan&gt;Stuart Glennan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq= p 276], in Sarkar S &amp; Pfeifer J, eds, ''The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia'', Volume 1: A–M (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], another critic, named it ''subsumption theory'',&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;Manfred Riedel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=It3ji_AuO3sC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Covering+subsumption pp 3–4], in Manninen J &amp; Tuomela R, eds, ''Essays on Explanation and Understanding: Studies in the Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences'' (Dordrecht: D Reidel Publishing, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; fitting the ambition of theory reduction.

===Unity of science===

Logical positivists were generally committed to "[[Unified Science]]", and sought a common language or, in Neurath's phrase, a "universal slang" whereby all scientific propositions could be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of "unity of science" to, see Gregory Frost-Arnold, [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00002005/01/PSA2004Short.rtf "The large-scale structure of logical empiricism: Unity of science and the rejection of metaphysics"].&lt;/ref&gt; The adequacy of proposals or fragments of proposals for such a language was often asserted on the basis of various "reductions" or "explications" of the terms of one [[special science]] to the terms of another, putatively more fundamental. Sometimes these reductions consisted of set-theoretic manipulations of a few logically primitive concepts (as in Carnap's ''Logical Structure of the World'' (1928)).  Sometimes, these reductions consisted of allegedly analytic or ''a priori'' deductive relationships (as in Carnap's "Testability and meaning"). A number of publications over a period of thirty years would attempt to elucidate this concept.

===Theory reduction===

As in [[positivism|Comtean positivism]]'s envisioned [[unity of science]], neopositivists aimed to network all [[special science]]s through the [[covering law model|covering law model of scientific explanation]].  And ultimately, by supplying [[boundary condition]]s and supplying bridge laws within the covering law model, all the special sciences' laws would reduce to [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]], the [[fundamental science]].

==Critics==

After [[World War II]], key tenets of logical positivism, including its atomistic philosophy of science, the verifiability principle, and the [[Hume's law|fact/value gap]], drew escalated criticism.  It was clear that empirical claims cannot be verified to be universally true.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005&gt;{{cite book |first=S |last=Sarkar |first2=J |last2=Pfeifer |year=2005 |title=The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia |volume=1 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415939270 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, as initially stated, the verifiability criterion made [[universal proposition|universal statement]]s meaningless, and even made statements beyond empiricism for technological but not conceptual reasons meaningless, which would pose significant problems for science.&lt;ref name="sep-hempel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sep-problem-of-induction"&gt;{{cite web |author=John Vicker |editor=Edward N Zalta |year=2011 |title=The problem of induction |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2011 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/induction-problem/#VerCon |quote=This initial formulation of the criterion was soon seen to be too strong; it counted as meaningless not only metaphysical statements but also statements that are clearly empirically meaningful, such as that all copper conducts electricity and, indeed, any universally quantified statement of infinite scope, as well as statements that were at the time beyond the reach of experience for technical, and not conceptual, reasons, such as that there are mountains on the back side of the moon. These difficulties led to modification of the criterion: The latter to allow empirical verification if not in fact then at least in principle, the former to soften verification to empirical confirmation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sep-vienna-circle"&gt;{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Uebel |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2008 |title=Vienna Circle |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/vienna-circle/ |quote=What Carnap later called the "liberalization of empiricism" was underway and different camps became discernible within the Circle... In the first place, this liberalization meant the accommodation of universally quantified statements and the return, as it were, to salient aspects of Carnap's 1928 conception. Everybody had noted that the Wittgensteinian verificationist criterion rendered universally quantified statements meaningless. Schlick (1931) thus followed Wittgenstein's own suggestion to treat them instead as representing rules for the formation of verifiable singular statements. (His abandonment of conclusive verifiability is indicated only in Schlick 1936a.) A second element that began to do so soon was the recognition of the problem of the irreducibility of disposition terms to observation terms... A third element was that disagreement arose as to whether the in-principle verifiability or support turned on what was merely logically possible or on what was nomologically possible, as a matter of physical law etc. A fourth element, finally, was that differences emerged as to whether the criterion of significance was to apply to all languages or whether it was to apply primarily to constructed, formal languages. Schlick retained the focus on logical possibility and natural languages throughout, but Carnap had firmly settled his focus on nomological possibility and constructed languages by the mid-thirties. Concerned with natural language, Schlick (1932, 1936a) deemed all statements meaningful for which it was logically possible to conceive of a procedure of verification; concerned with constructed languages only, Carnap (1936-37) deemed meaningful only statements for whom it was nomologically possible to conceive of a procedure of confirmation of disconfirmation.&lt;br&gt;Many of these issues were openly discussed at the Paris congress in 1935. Already in 1932 Carnap had sought to sharpen his previous criterion by stipulating that those statements were meaningful that were syntactically well-formed and whose non-logical terms were reducible to terms occurring in the basic observational evidence statements of science. While Carnap's focus on the reduction of descriptive terms allows for the conclusive verification of some statements, his criterion also allowed universally quantified statements to be meaningful, provided they were syntactically and terminologically correct (1932a, §2). It was not until one of his Paris addresses, however, that Carnap officially declared the meaning criterion to be mere confirmability. Carnap's new criterion required neither verification nor falsification but only partial testability so as now to include not only universal statements but also the disposition statements of science... Though plausible initially, the device of introducing non-observational terms in this way gave rise to a number of difficulties which impugned the supposedly clear distinctions between logical and empirical matters and analytic and synthetic statements (Hempel 1951). Independently, Carnap himself (1939) soon gave up the hope that all theoretical terms of science could be related to an observational base by such reduction chains. This admission raised a serious problem for the formulation of a meaning criterion: how was one to rule out unwanted metaphysical claims while admitting as significant highly abstract scientific claims?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These problems were recognized within the movement, which hosted attempted solutions—Carnap's move to ''confirmation'', Ayer's acceptance of ''weak verification''—but the program drew sustained criticism from a number of directions by the 1950s.  Even philosophers disagreeing among themselves on which direction general [[epistemology]] ought to take, as well as on [[philosophy of science]], agreed that the logical empiricist program was untenable, and it became viewed as self-contradictory.&lt;ref name=Putnam1985&gt;{{cite book |author=Hilary Putnam |year=1985 |title=Philosophical Papers: Volume 3, Realism and Reason |series=Philosophical Papers |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521313940 |lccn=lc82012903 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAjfSA3ir3kC&amp;pg=PA184 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The verifiability criterion of meaning was itself unverified.&lt;ref name=Putnam1985/&gt;  Notable critics included [[Nelson Goodman]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson|Norwood Hanson]], [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]], [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]], [[J. L. Austin|J L Austin]], [[Peter Strawson]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[Richard Rorty]].

===Quine===

Although quite empiricist, American logician [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] published the 1951 paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]",&lt;ref&gt;W V O Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism", ''Philosophical Review'' 1951;'''60''':20-43, collected in Quine, ''From a Logical Point of View'' (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; which challenged conventional empiricist presumptions.  Quine attacked the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic division]], which the verificationist program had been hinged upon in order to entail, by consequence of [[Hume's fork]], both [[logical truth|necessity]] and apriocity.  Quine's [[ontological relativity]] explained that every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker's conception of the entire world.  Quine later proposed [[naturalized epistemology]].

===Hanson===

In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson|Norwood Hanson]]'s ''Patterns of Discovery'' undermined the division of [[observation]] versus [[theory]],&lt;ref name=Novick-p527&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'' (Cambridge U P, 1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;pg=PA527&amp;dq=Hanson p 527].&lt;/ref&gt; as one can predict, collect, prioritize, and assess data only via some horizon of expectation set by a theory.  Thus, any [[dataset]]—the direct observations, the scientific facts—is [[theory-laden|laden with theory]].

===Popper===
An early, tenacious critic was [[Karl Popper]] whose 1934 book ''Logik der Forschung'', arriving in English in 1959 as ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', directly answered verificationism.  Popper heeded the [[problem of induction]] as rendering empirical verification logically impossible,&lt;ref&gt;Popper then denies that science requires [[inductive inference]] or that it actually exists, although most philosophers believe it exists and that science requires it [Samir Okasha, ''The Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction'' (NY: [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 2002), p 23],&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[deductive fallacy]] of [[affirming the consequent]] reveals any phenomenon's capacity to host more than one logically possible explanation.  Accepting [[scientific method]] as [[hypothetico-deductive model|hypotheticodeduction]], whose [[argument form|inference form]] is [[denying the consequent]], Popper finds scientific method unable to proceed without  [[falsifiable]] predictions.  Popper thus identifies [[falsifiability]] to [[problem of demarcation|demarcate]] not ''meaningful'' from ''[[meaningless statement|meaningless]]'' but simply ''scientific'' from  ''unscientific''—a label not in itself unfavorable.

Popper finds virtue in [[metaphysics]], required to develop new scientific theories.  And an unfalsifiable—thus unscientific, perhaps metaphysical—concept in one era can later, through evolving knowledge or technology, become falsifiable, thus scientific.  Popper also found science's quest for truth to rest on values.  Popper disparages the ''[[pseudoscientific]]'', which occurs when an unscientific theory is proclaimed true and coupled with seemingly scientific method by "testing" the unfalsifiable theory—whose predictions are confirmed by necessity—or when a scientific theory's falsifiable predictions are strongly falsified but the theory is persistently protected by "immunizing stratagems", such as the appendage of ''[[ad hoc]]'' clauses saving the theory or the recourse to increasingly speculative hypotheses shielding the theory.

Popper's ''scientific'' epistemology is [[falsificationism]], which finds that no number, degree, and variety of empirical successes can either verify or confirm scientific theory.  Falsificationism finds science's aim as ''corroboration'' of scientific theory, which strives for [[scientific realism]] but accepts the maximal status of strongly corroborated [[verisimilitude]] ("truthlikeness").  Explicitly denying the positivist view that all knowledge is scientific, Popper developed the ''general'' epistemology [[critical rationalism]], which finds human knowledge to evolve by ''conjectures and refutations''.  Popper thus acknowledged the value of the positivist movement, driving evolution of human understanding, but claimed that he had "killed positivism".

===Kuhn===

With his landmark, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] critically destabilized the verificationist program, which was presumed to call for [[foundationalism]].  (Actually, even in the 1930s, [[Otto Neurath]] had argued for nonfoundationalism via [[coherentism]] by likening science to a boat ([[Neurathian bootstrap|Neurath's boat]]) that scientists must rebuild at sea.&lt;ref name=ONPSP&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=Otto Neurath: Philosophy Between Science and Politics|volume=38|series=Ideas in Context|first1=Nancy|last1=Cartwright|authorlink1=Nancy Cartwright (philosopher) |first2=Jordi|last2=Cat|first3=Lola|last3=Fleck|first4=Thomas E.|last4=Uebel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521041119|chapter=On Neurath's Boat|pages=89–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Although Kuhn's thesis itself was attacked even by opponents of neopositivism, in the 1970 postscript to ''Structure'', Kuhn asserted, at least, that there was no [[algorithm]] to science—and, on that, even most of Kuhn's critics agreed.

Powerful and persuasive, Kuhn's book, unlike the vocabulary and symbols of logic's [[formal language]], was written in [[natural language]] open to the layperson.&lt;ref name=Novick-p526/&gt;  Ironically, Kuhn's book was first published in a volume of ''Encyclopedia of Unified Science''—a project begun by logical positivists—and some sense unified science, indeed, but by bringing it into the realm of historical and social assessment, rather than fitting it to the model of physics.&lt;ref name=Novick-p526/&gt;  Kuhn's ideas were rapidly adopted by scholars in disciplines well outside natural sciences,&lt;ref name=Novick-p526&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'' (Cambridge U P, 1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;pg=PA526&amp;dq=Kuhn's+logical+Unified pp 526-27].&lt;/ref&gt; and, as logical empiricists were extremely influential in the [[social science]]s,&lt;ref name=Novick-p546/&gt; ushered academia into [[postpositivism]] or postempiricism.&lt;ref name=Novick-p526/&gt;

===Putnam===

The "[[Received view of theories|received view]]" operates on the ''correspondence rule'' that states, "The observational terms are taken as referring to specified phenomena or phenomenal properties, and the only interpretation given to the theoretical terms is their explicit definition provided by the correspondence rules".&lt;ref name="Suppe, Frederick 1999"/&gt;  According to [[Hilary Putnam]], a former student of [[Hans Reichenbach|Reichenbach]] and of [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]], the dichotomy of observational terms versus theoretical terms introduced a problem within scientific discussion that was nonexistent until this dichotomy was stated by logical positivists.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Putnam, "Problems with the observational/theoretical distinction", in ''Scientific Inquiry,'' Robert Klee, ed (New York, USA: Oxford University Press, 1999), pp 25-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Putnam's four objections:

# Something is referred to as "observational" if it is observable directly with our senses. Then an observation term cannot be applied to something unobservable. If this is the case, there are no observation terms.
# With Carnap's classification, some unobservable terms are not even theoretical and belong to neither observation terms nor theoretical terms. Some theoretical terms refer primarily to observation terms.
# Reports of observation terms frequently contain theoretical terms.
# A scientific theory may not contain any theoretical terms (an example of this is Darwin's original theory of evolution).

Putnam also alleged that positivism was actually a form of [[idealism|metaphysical idealism]] by its rejecting scientific theory's ability to garner knowledge about nature's unobservable aspects.  With his "no miracles" argument, posed in 1974, Putnam asserted [[scientific realism]], the stance that science achieves true—or approximately true—knowledge of the world as it exists independently of humans' sensory experience.  In this, Putnam opposed not only the positivism but other [[instrumentalism]]—whereby scientific theory is but a human tool to predict human observations—filling the void left by positivism's decline.

==Retrospect==

By the late 1960s, logical positivism had become exhausted.&lt;ref name="Fotionarticle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nicholas G Fotion |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=508 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interviewed in the late 1970s, [[A. J. Ayer]] supposed that "the most important" defect "was that nearly all of it was false".&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cnRJGs08hE |title=Ayer on Logical Positivism: Section 4 |at=6:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some laughter, he says that "it was true in spirit."  Although logical positivism tends to be recalled as a pillar of [[scientism]],&lt;ref name=Stahl-etal-p180&gt;Stahl ''et al'', ''Webs of Reality'' (Rutgers U P, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GY6i84rSKMcC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=metaphysical+naturalism+logical+positivism+materialism+scientific+scientism p 180].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Hempel]] was key in establishing the philosophy subdiscipline [[philosophy of science]]&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Karl Popper]] brought in the era of [[postpositivism]].&lt;ref name=Novick-p526/&gt;  [[John Passmore]] found logical positivism to be "dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes".&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanfling|first=Oswald|chapter=Logical Positivism|title=Routledge History of Philosophy|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=193f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical positivism's fall reopened debate over the metaphysical merit of scientific theory, whether it can offer knowledge of the world beyond human experience ([[scientific realism]]) versus whether it is but a human tool to predict human experience ([[instrumentalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Putnam, "What is realism?", in Jarrett Leplin, ed, ''Scientific Realism'' (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=zhBeVFm8WuAC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=Realism+realists+positivism+opera-tionalism p 140].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Lane, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0951692896008003003 "Positivism, scientific realism and political science: Recent developments in the philosophy of science"], ''Journal of Theoretical Politics'', 1996 Jul'''8'''(3):361-82, abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, it became popular among philosophers to rehash the faults and failures of logical positivism without investigation of it.&lt;ref name=Friedman-p1&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=half+centry+bogeyman+faults+failings+dispassionate p 1].&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereby, logical positivism has been generally misrepresented, sometimes severely.&lt;ref name=Friedman-p2/&gt;  Arguing for their own views, often framed versus logical positivism, many philosophers have reduced logical positivism to simplisms and stereotypes, especially the notion of logical positivism as a type of [[foundationalism]].&lt;ref name=Friedman-p2&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=clear+critics+agendas+foundationalism p 2].&lt;/ref&gt;  In any event, the movement helped anchor [[analytic philosophy]] in the [[English-speaking world]], and returned Britain to [[empiricism]].  Without the logical positivists, who have been tremendously influential outside philosophy, especially in [[psychology]] and social [[sciences]], intellectual life of the 20th century would be unrecognizable.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;

The '''Longhua Temple''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|龙|华|寺}}|t={{linktext|龍|華|寺}}|p={{linktext|Lóng|húa| Sì}}''; &lt;small&gt;[[Shanghainese]]&lt;/small&gt;:'' Lon-ngu-zy}}, literally ''"[[Lustre (mineralogy)|Lustre]] of the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] Temple''") is a [[Buddhist temple]] dedicated to the [[Maitreya|Maitreya Buddha]] located in [[Shanghai]]. Although most of the present-day buildings date from later reconstructions, the temple preserves the architectural design of a [[Song dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) monastery of the [[Chinese Chán|Chan School]]. It is the largest, most authentic and complete ancient temple complex in the city of Shanghai.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

==History==
[[Image:Longhua temple1.JPG|right|thumb|Newly constructed front gate of Longhua. The site of the original gates, further in front, is now marked by two standing pillars and a set of original stone lions.]]

The temple was first built in 242 AD, during the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] (220&amp;ndash;165). According to a legend, [[Sun Quan]], King of the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]] (222&amp;ndash;280), had obtained [[Ringsel|Sharira]] relics, which are cremated remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. To house these precious relics, the king ordered the construction of 13 pagodas. Longhua Pagoda ({{zh|s=龙华塔|t=|labels=no}}), part of the Longhua temple complex, is said to have been one of them. Like the function of the pagoda, the name of the temple also has its origin in a local legend according to which a dragon once appeared on the site.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

The temple was destroyed by war towards the end of the [[Tang dynasty]] (618&amp;ndash;907) and rebuilt in 977 AD, under the autonomous Kingdom of [[Wuyue]] during the [[Song dynasty|Northern Song dynasty]] period (960&amp;ndash;1127). (According to another version of the story, as contained in [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) and [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271&amp;ndash;1368) local histories, the temple was first built by the King of [[Wuyue]].) Later in the Song dynasty, in 1064, it was renamed "Kongxiang Temple" ({{zh|s=空相寺|t=|labels=no}}), but the original name "Longhua Temple" was restored in the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368&amp;ndash;1644) during the reign of the [[Wanli Emperor]] (1573&amp;ndash;1620).

The present architectural design follows the [[Song dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) original. However, whereas the core of the present Longhua Pagoda survives from that period, most buildings in the temple proper were rebuilt during the reigns of the [[Tongzhi Emperor]] (1862&amp;ndash;1874) and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (1875&amp;ndash;1908) in the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644&amp;ndash;1911). A modern restoration of the entire temple complex was carried out in 1954.

The temple and monastery were originally surrounded by extensive gardens and orchards. Viewing of the peach blossom in the Longhua gardens was an annual attraction for people in surrounding cities.

The temple grounds have been used as a site for internment as well as for executions. Public executions were held on the site in the 19th century. In 1927, the [[Kuomintang]] carried out a purge of suspected communists in Shanghai. Thousands of victims of this purge were brought to the temple grounds to be executed. They are commemorated today by the Longhua Martyrs Cemetery behind the temple. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] operated their largest civilian internment camp in the area, where [[United States|American]], [[Great Britain|British]], as well as nationals of other [[Allies of World War II|allied countries]] were held under poor conditions.

The temple's extensive gardens have since been almost entirely absorbed into the neighbouring Longhua Martyrs Cemetery and have been extensively reconstructed in a contemporary monumental style. A small traditional garden remains immediately adjacent to the temple buildings.

==Architectural design and artwork==
[[Image:500lohan longhuatemple.jpg|right|thumb|Statues of the 500 arhats]]
[[Image:Longhua Pagoda.JPG|thumb|right|The exterior of the Longhua Pagoda]]

The Longhua Temple occupies an area of more than {{Convert|20000|m2|sqft|-3}} and the main axis of the compound is {{Convert|194|m|ft}} long. The tallest structure is the Longhua Pagoda which stands {{Convert|40.4|m|ftin}} high.

The layout of the temple is that of a Song dynasty monastery of the Buddhist Chan sect, known as the ''Sangharama Five-Hall Style''. Five main halls are arranged along a central north-south pointing axis. From the entrance, the buildings are:

===Maitreya Hall===
The Maitreya Hall housing a statue of [[Maitreya]] buddha and another in his manifestation as "[[Budai]]", or ''Cloth bag monk''.

===Four Heavenly Kings Hall===
The [[Four Heavenly Kings Hall]] housing statues of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]].

===Mahavira Hall===
The [[Mahavira Hall]] is the main hall, housing statues of the historical Buddha ([[Shakyamuni]]) and two disciples. At the back of the hall is a bas-relief carving, including a depiction of [[Guanyin]], or the Buddistava [[Avalokiteśvara]] in his female manifestation. Around the front portion are arranged the twenty Guardians of Buddhist Law, and around the back the sixteen principal [[arhat]]s. The hall also features an ancient bell cast in 1586, during the [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] era of the [[Ming dynasty]].

===Three Sages Hall===
The Three Sages Hall ({{zh|s=三圣殿|t=|labels=no}}) houses statues of the [[Amitabha]] buddha, and the Buddistavas [[Avalokiteśvara]] (male form) and Mahāsthāmaprāpta.

===Abbot's Hall===
The Abbot's Hall ({{zh|s=方丈室|t=|labels=no}}) is a place for lectures and formal meetings.

===Bell tower and Drum tower===
A Bell Tower and a Drum Tower are arranged off the central axis. The Bell Tower houses a copper [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] cast in 1382, the bell is {{convert|2|m|adj=on}} tall, has a maximum diameter of {{convert|1.3|m|adj=on}}, and weighs {{convert|5000|kg|adj=on}}. The bell is used in the ''Evening Bell-Striking Ceremony'' conducted on New Year's Eve. Also situated off the main axis is a shrine to [[Ksitigarbha]] (Dizang the King Bodhissatva).

===Buddhist Texts Library===
The [[Buddhist Texts Library]] houses various versions of Buddhist [[sutra]]s and other Buddhist works, as well as ceremonial instruments, antiques, and artefacts.

Artworks in the temple include statues of the Maitreya Buddha in his [[Bodhisattva]] form and in his ''Cloth Bag Monk'' incarnation, statues of the [[Eighteen Arhats]] and 20 Guardians of Buddhist Law, as well as statues of the 500 [[arhat]]s.

===Longhua Pagoda===
[[Image:Longhuata300x400.jpg|right|thumb|Longhua Pagoda]]

The Longhua Pagoda is best well-known of the 16 historic pagodas that still stand within the Shanghai municipality. It has an octagonal floor layout. The size of the seven storeys decreases from the bottom to the top. The pagoda consists of a hollow, tube-like brick core surrounded by a wooden staircase. On the outside, it is decorated with balconies, banisters, and upturned eaves. These outer decorations have been reconstructed in keeping with the original style.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

Although previous pagodas existed on the same site, the current brick base and body of the pagoda was built in 977 under the [[Wuyue]] kingdome (907&amp;ndash;978), with continuous renovations of its more fragile wooden components on the exterior. Because of its age, the pagoda is fragile and is not open to the public.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

==Temple fair==
The Longhua Temple Fair has been held since the [[Ming dynasty]] annually on the third day of the third month of the [[Lunar Calendar]], when - according to local legend - the dragons visit the temple to help grant the people's wishes. It coincides with the blossoming of the peach trees in Longhua Park. Since its inception, the fair has been an annual event interrupted only by the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS]] outbreak.

==Location==
The Longhua Temple is located on the Longhua area (formerly Longhua township) of Shanghai (named after the temple). Its street address is No. 2853 Longhua Road (Longhua Lu). It is open to the public for a fee (10 [[Renminbi|RMB]]) which includes incense.{{Citation needed|reason=I didn't get any incense! (2 January 2010)|date=January 2010}}

==In popular culture==
[[J.G. Ballard]] in his World War II-era autobiographical novel ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'' describes the Japanese military use of the Longhua pagoda as a flak cannon tower.  In Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of the book, the pagoda is clearly visible above the prison camp.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

An '''only child''' is a person with no [[sibling]]s, either [[biological]] or [[adoption|adopted]]. The term ''only child'' is generally applied only to those individuals who don't have siblings. 

Some children may have half-siblings or step-siblings, either living at the same house or a different house - especially those who were born considerably later - may have a similar family environment to only children, as may children who have younger siblings from both of the same parents (generally ten or more years).

== Overview ==
Throughout history, only children were relatively uncommon. From around the middle of the 20th century, [[birth rate]]s and average family sizes fell sharply, for a number of reasons including increasing costs of raising children and more women having their first child later in life. The proportion of families in the U.S. with only children increased during the [[Great Depression]] but fell during the [[Post–World War II baby boom]].&lt;ref name=onlies&gt;[http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/family/features/10290/ "The Onlies"]. ''New York Magazine''. May 21, 2005. Retrieved February 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Korean War]] ended in 1953, the South Korean government suggested citizens each have one or two children to boost economic prosperity, which resulted in significantly lowered birth rates and a larger number of only children to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecolocalizer.com/2008/09/27/korean-women-say-birth-control-not-my-job/ |title=Korean Women Say Birth Control is ‘Men’s Responsibility’ |website=Ecolocalizer.com |date=September 27, 2008 |accessdate=December 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002050413/http://ecolocalizer.com/2008/09/27/korean-women-say-birth-control-not-my-job/ |archivedate=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSEO35121820080404 "Illegal abortion, South Korea's open secret"]. ''Reuters''. January 27, 2009. Retrieved December 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1979 to 2015, the [[one-child policy]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] restricted most parents to having only one child, although it was subject to local relaxations and individual circumstances (for instance when twins were conceived).&lt;ref&gt;Rocha da Silva, Pascal (2006). "[http://www.sinoptic.ch/textes/recherche/2006/200608_Rocha.Pascal_memoire.pdf ''La politique de l'enfant unique en République populaire de Chine'']" ("The politics of one child in the People's Republic of China"). Université de Genève ([[University of Geneva]]). p. 22-8. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/english/2003/Jul/68937.htm "Marriage of the Only Child: Joys and Worries"].

Retrieved January 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Families may have an only child for a variety of reasons, including: personal preference, [[family planning]], financial and emotional or physical health issues, desire to travel, stress in the family, educational advantages, late marriage, stability, focus, time constraints, fears over pregnancy, advanced age, illegitimate birth, [[infertility]], [[divorce]], and death of a sibling or parent. The premature death of one parent also contributed to a small percentage of marriages producing just one child until around the mid 20th century, not to mention the then rare occurrence of divorce. 

Only children are sometimes said to be more likely to develop precocious interests (from spending more time with adults) and to feel [[loneliness|lonely]].&lt;ref name=onlies/&gt; Sometimes they compensate for the aloneness by developing a stronger relationship with themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/opinion/sunday/only-children-lonely-and-selfish.html |title=Only Children: Lonely and Selfish? |author=Sandler, Lauren |date=8 June 2013 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; or developing an active fantasy life that includes [[imaginary friend]]s. Children whose only siblings are much older than them sometimes report feeling like an only child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/05/wish-my-son-wasnt-an-only-child |author=Bradford, Kelly Rose |date=5 April 2014 |publisher=The Guardian |title=I wish my son wasn't an only child}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages cited of having an only child are the decreased financial burden, the absence of any [[sibling rivalry]], and that it becomes possible to take the child to an event suitable for their age without having to bring along a disinterested sibling. A disadvantage is that it can be harder for an only child to singlehandedly look after their aging parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/387579/The-rise-of-the-only-child-Happier-higher-achievers-or-just-more-lonely |title=The rise of the only child: Happier, higher achievers or just more lonely? |date=28 March 2013 |publisher=Express |author=Edge, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stereotypes ==
In Western countries, only children can be the subject of a stereotype that equates them with "[[spoiled brat]]s". [[G. Stanley Hall]] was one of the first commentators to give only children a bad reputation when he referred to their situation as "a disease in itself". Even today, only children are commonly stereotyped as "spoiled, selfish, and bratty".&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3488411&amp;page=1 The Only Child Myth], By Juju Chang and Sara Holmberg, ABC News, Retrieved on August 25th, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While many only children receive a lot of attention and resources for their development, it is not clear that as a class they are overindulged or differ significantly from children with siblings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2002382,00.html "The Only Child: Debunking the Myths"]. ''Time''. July 8, 2010. Retrieved July 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Newman, a social psychologist at [[Rutgers University]] and the author of ''Parenting an Only Child'', says that this is a myth. "People articulate that only children are spoiled, they're aggressive, they're bossy, they're lonely, they're maladjusted", she said. "There have been hundreds and hundreds of research studies that show that only children are no different from their peers."&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt; However, differences have been found.

In China, perceived behavioral problems in only children has been called the [[Little Emperor Syndrome]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2001/04/22/the-rise-of-the-only-child.html# "The Rise Of The Only Child"]. ''Newsweek''. April 23, 2001. Retrieved December 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and the lack of siblings has been blamed for a number of social ills such as materialism and crime. However, recent studies do not support these claims, and show no significant differences in personality between only children and children in larger families.&lt;ref&gt;Wan, et al. "Comparison of personality traits of only and sibling school children in Beijing." Journal of Genetic Psychology 155.4: 377(12).&lt;/ref&gt; The one child policy has also been speculated to be the underlying cause of forced [[abortion]]s, [[female infanticide]], underreporting&lt;ref name="abortions"&gt;For studies that reported underreporting or delayed reporting of female births, see the following:

The popular media often posit that it is more difficult for only children to cooperate in a conventional family environment, as they have no competitors for the attention of their parents and other relatives. It is suggested that confusion arises about the norms of ages and roles and that a similar effect exists in understanding during relationships with other peers and youth, all throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parents.com/parenting/better-parenting/style/10-tips-for-parenting-only-children/ "10 Tips for Parenting Only Children"].

A 1987 [[meta-analysis|quantitative review]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Polit |first=D. F. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Falbo |first2=T. |year=1987 |title=Only children and personality development: A quantitative review |journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family |volume=49 |issue= |pages=309–325 |doi=10.2307/352302 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; of 141 studies on 16 different personality traits failed to support the opinion, held by theorists including [[Alfred Adler]], that only children are more likely to be maladjusted due to pampering.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, A. (1964). ''Problems of neurosis''. New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; The study found no evidence of any greater prevalence of maladjustment in only children. The only statistically significant difference discovered was that only children possessed a higher achievement motivation, which Polit and Falbo attributed to their greater share of parental resources, expectations, and scrutiny exposing them to a greater degree of reward, and greater likelihood of punishment for falling short. A second analysis by the authors revealed that only children, children with only one sibling, and first-borns in general, score higher on tests of verbal ability than later-borns and children with multiple siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Polit |first=D. F. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Falbo |first2=T. |year=1988 |title=The intellectual achievement of only children |journal=Journal of Biosocial Science |volume=20 |issue= |pages=275–285 |doi=10.1017/S0021932000006611 |pmid=3063715}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Resource Dilution Model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Downey |first=D. B. |year=2001 |title=Number of siblings and intellectual development: The resource dilution explanation |journal=American Psychologist |volume=56 |issue= |pages=497–504 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.56.6-7.497 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; parental resources (e.g. time to read to the child) are important in development. Because these resources are finite, children with many siblings are thought to receive fewer resources.  However, the Confluence Model&lt;ref name="confluence"&gt;{{Citation |last=Zajonc |first=R. B. |last2=Markus |first2=Gregory B. |year=1975 |title=Birth Order and Intellectual Development |journal=Psychological Review |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=74–88 |doi=10.1037/h0076229 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests there is an opposing effect from the benefits to the non-youngest children of tutoring younger siblings, though being tutored does not make up the reduced share of parental resources. This provides one explanation for the poorer performance on tests of ability of only children compared to first-borns, commonly seen in the literature,&lt;ref name="confluence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tutoring"&gt;{{Citation |last=Falbo |first=Toni |year=1978 |title=Sibling Tutoring and Other Explanations for Intelligence Discontinuities of Only and Last Borns |journal=Journal of Population |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=349–363 |doi=10.2307/27507586}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though explanations such as the increased and earlier likelihood of experiencing parental separation or loss for last-born and only children have also been suggested, as this may be the cause of their very status.&lt;ref name="tutoring"/&gt;

In his book ''Maybe One'',&lt;ref name=McKibben&gt;{{Citation |last=McKibben |first=B. |year=1998 |title=Maybe one: A personal and environmental argument for single-child families |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-684-85281-0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the environmental campaigner [[Bill McKibben]] argues in favor of a voluntary one child policy on the grounds of climate change and overpopulation. He reassures the reader with a narrative constructed from interviews with researchers and writers on only children, combined with snippets from the research literature, that this would not be harmful to child development. He argues that most cultural stereotypes are false, that there are not many differences between only children and other children, and where there are differences, they are favorable to the only child.

Most research on only children has been [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and focused on the behaviour of only-children and on how others, for example teachers, assess that behaviour. Bernice Sorensen, in contrast, used [[qualitative methods]] in order to elicit meaning and to discover what only-children themselves understand, feel or sense about their lives that are lived without siblings. Her research showed that during their life span only children often become more aware of their only child status and are very much affected by society's stereotype of the only-child whether or not the stereotype is true or false. She argues in her book, ''Only Child Experience and Adulthood'', that growing up in a predominantly sibling society affects only children and that their lack of sibling relationships can have an important effect on both the way they see themselves and others and how they interact with the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sorensen |first=B. |year=2008 |title=Only Child Experience and Adulthood |location=Hampshire |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |pages=164–195 |isbn=0-230-52101-0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest research by Cameron et al. (2011) controls for endogeneity associated with being only children. Parents that choose to have only one child could differ systematically in their characteristics from parents who choose to have more than one child. The paper concludes that "those who grew up as only children as a consequence of the (one-child) policy (in China) are found to be less trusting, less trustworthy, less likely to take risks, and less competitive than if they had had siblings. They are also less optimistic, less conscientious, and more prone to neuroticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cameron |first=Lisa |last2=Erkal |first2=N. |last3=Gangadharan |first3=L. |lastauthoramp=yes |last4=Meng |first4=Xin |year=2011 |title=Little Emperors—Behavioral Impacts of China’s One-Child Policy (University of Melbourne)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Professor Cameron, it was found that "greater exposure to other children in childhood – for example, frequent interactions with cousins and/or attending childcare – was not a substitute for having siblings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=January 10, 2013|title=Effects of China's One Child Policy on its children |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130110142131.htm|newspaper=Science Daily |location= |access-date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Born to Rebel'', [[Frank Sulloway]] provides evidence that [[birth order]] influences the development of the "[[big five personality traits]]" (also known as the Five Factor Model). Sulloway suggests that firstborns and only children are more conscientious, more socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to laterborns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sulloway |first=F. J. |year=1996 |title=Born to rebel: Birth order, family dynamics and creative lives |location=New York |publisher=Pantheon Books |isbn=0-679-44232-4 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his conclusions have been challenged by other researchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harris |first=J. R. |year=2006 |title=No two alike: Human nature and human individuality |location=New York |publisher=WW Norton &amp; Company |isbn=0-393-05948-0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; who argue that birth order effects are weak and inconsistent. In one of the largest studies conducted on the effect of birth order on the Big Five, data from a national sample of 9,664 subjects found no association between birth order and scores on the [[NEO PI-R]] personality test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jefferson |first=T. |last2=Herbst |first2=J.

'''Out-of-Home Entertainment''' (also '''OOHE''' or '''OHE''') is a term coined by the amusement industry to collectively refer to experiences at regional attractions like theme parks and waterparks with their thrill rides and slides, and smaller community-based entertainment venues such as family entertainment and cultural venues.

In the US alone, there are nearly 30,000 attractions&amp;mdash;theme and amusement parks, attractions, water parks, family entertainment centers, zoos, aquariums, science centers, museums, and resorts, producing a total nationwide economic impact of $219 billion in 2011, according to leading international industry association, [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]] (IAAPA). The industry directly employs more than 1.3 million and indirectly generates 1 million jobs in the US, creating a total job impact of 2.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaapa.org/resources/by-park-type/amusement-parks-and-attractions/industry-statistics|title=Amusement Park and Attractions Industry Statistics|website=www.iaapa.org|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the use of this term has gained acceptance with and been popularized by amusement industry players, industry associations, trade magazines and even securities analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4062446-investors-play-dave-and-busters|title=Investors Should Play At Dave &amp; Buster's|last=Berner|first=Mike|date=2017-04-14|work=Seeking Alpha|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This stems from the desire to distinguish between the social, competitive atmosphere and dedicated hardware found in location-based entertainment venues from at-home consumer-game entertainment, [[mobile entertainment]] or even [[Augmented reality|augmented reality (AR)]] and [[Virtual reality|virtual reality (VR)]].  The reality is that the lines are increasingly blurred with today's sophisticated consumers and emerging technologies.

This term is not to be confused with [[Out-of-home advertising|out-of-home media advertising]] as used by the advertising industry, although the convergence of digital out-of-home advertising and the digital out-of-home entertainment is producing innovations in retail and hospitality, steeped in fundamentals of social gaming experiences defined by the video amusement industry during the 70’s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/damian-bazadona/a-new-way-to-view-social-_b_14691878.html|title=A New Way To View Social Gaming|last=Bazadona|first=Damian|date=2017-02-13|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{See also|History of video games}}
Digital out-of-home entertainment (also '''DOE''') is a sector that is understood by few but is a fast-growing technology sector with plenty of innovations transforming the sector.  Its roots lie in the popularity of [[coin-op]]erated [[arcade video game]]s such as racing, fighting, Japanese imports, or pinball that [[Generation X]] will vividly recall with fond memories of countless hours of their youth spent in dimly-lit video-game rooms (popularly known as 'arcades').

When [[Generation Y]] came along, an audience well-versed in digital gaming favored game consoles over arcade machines.  So while video amusement remains an integral part of the [[popular culture]] fabric today, its relevancy is diminished and even perceived as 'dead' partly due to the lack of coverage by consumer-game media even as the amusement industry transformed itself and research and development investments continue to pour into the sector, evolving and growing the out-of-home, pay-to-play experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=1h6rBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=out+of+home+entertainment+dave+and+busters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RcQoiWIrrM&amp;sig=MLxxfXmIfOk5I26_Xv8xrGA9rck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihyIaCh_DYAhXBs48KHejvC-EQ6AEIXDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=out%20of%20home%20entertainment%20dave%20and%20busters&amp;f=false|title=The Out-of-Home Immersive Entertainment Frontier: Expanding Interactive Boundaries in Leisure Facilities|last=Williams|first=Kevin|last2=Mascioni|first2=Michael|date=2014-06-27|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781472426956|edition= 1st|location=|pages=5|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the non-profit Digital Out-of-Home Interactive Entertainment Network Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dna-association.com/|title=DNA Association Website — Digital Out-of-home Interactive Entertainment Network Association|website=www.dna-association.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established to help "define these amorphous groups that comprise this vibrant industry and illustrate how they all interact" with groups spanning from "[[family entertainment center]]s (FEC), location-based entertainment sites, visitor attractions, theme parks as well as retail, shopping malls and the hospitality sector – and not forgetting museums, heritage sites, schools".

== Key Actors in Out-of-Home Entertainment ==
=== Family Entertainment Centers ===
{{See also|family entertainment center}}The traditional [[Family entertainment center|FECs]] is a classic form of OOHE that is easily understood by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehutchinson.com/leisure/familyctr.shtml|title=Family Entertainment Centers|website=www.whitehutchinson.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of [[theme restaurant]]s and the winning formula of combining food and entertainment as a business model has been around for more than 30 years.  The first [[Dave &amp; Buster's]] was opened in 1982 in [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas]], [[Texas]] after discovering this winning formula and is a highly-successful FEC chain today with their "Eat, Drink, Play, Watch" offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehutchinson.com/leisure/articles/thatseatertainment.shtml|title=That's Eatertainment! Everything you need to know about combining entertainment and food service to build profit and repeat business|website=www.whitehutchinson.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chuck E. Cheese's|Chuck E. Cheese]] first opened a store in 1977 and became the public embodiment of the typical children's party room combined with a pizza restaurant and arcade.  Other restaurants started to come round to seeing the importance of amusement games and "anchor" attractions ([[bowling alley]]s, [[miniature golf]], [[laser tag]]s, [[batting cage]]s, [[Roller rink|roller skating rinks]], etc.) to encourage dwell time of 1–2 hours and stimulating repeat visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=1h6rBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=out+of+home+entertainment+dave+and+busters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RcQoiWIrrM&amp;sig=MLxxfXmIfOk5I26_Xv8xrGA9rck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihyIaCh_DYAhXBs48KHejvC-EQ6AEIXDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=out%20of%20home%20entertainment%20dave%20and%20busters&amp;f=false|title=The Out-of-Home Immersive Entertainment Frontier: Expanding Interactive Boundaries in Leisure Facilities|last=Williams|first=Mr Kevin|last2=Mascioni|first2=Mr Michael|date=2014-06-28|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=|isbn=9781472426956|location=|pages=66|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arcade Video Game Developers ===
{{See also|Arcade game|Timeline of arcade video game history}}Probably known more by the [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] arcade video game titles they produced rather than by company names, these video game developers played a defining role in the birth of the video amusement industry. In 1972, [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Atari]] essentially created the first commercially successful video game ''[[Pong]],'' marking the beginning of the coin-operated [[video game industry]].  In 1978, the first blockbuster arcade video game, ''[[Space Invaders]]'' was produced by [[Taito|Taito Corporation]] and ushered in the [[golden age of arcade video games]]. [[Namco]] (of [[Pac-Man|''Pac-Man''']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s fame), [[Nintendo]] ([[Donkey Kong (video game)|''Donkey Kong'']]), [[Konami]] ([[Frogger's Adventures: The Rescue|''Frogger'']]), [[Capcom]] ([[Street Fighter|''Street Fighters'']]), [[Sega AM2]] (''[[Daytona USA (video game)|Daytona]]'') are among some of the most notable video game developers that remain active today in the video amusement scene.

[[Video game publisher]]s are also making inroads into the OOHE market by licensing iconic IPs ([[intellectual property]]) to experienced arcade game developers and manufacturers, such as the recent collaboration between [[Ubisoft]] and LAI Games to produce ''Virtual Rabbids: The Big Ride'', an attendant-free VR attraction based on the popular ''[[Rabbids]]'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.replaymag.com/lai-december-2017/|title=LAI Virtual Rabbids – December 2017 {{!}} RePlay Magazine|website=www.replaymag.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2017/11/ubisofts-rabbids-are-back-in-vr-with-virtual-rabbids-the-big-ride/|title=Ubisoft’s Rabbids Are Back In VR With Virtual Rabbids – The Big Ride|work=VRFocus|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blooloop.com/features/ubisoft-vr-rabbids-maze-lbe/|title=Ubisoft - Rabbids and Assassins Creed VR target new LBE audiences {{!}} blooloop|work=Blooloop|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redemption Game Manufacturers ===
{{See also|Redemption game}}A redemption game is an arcade amusement game involving skill that rewards the player (in gifts, tokens, etc.) proportionately to his or her score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/redemption-game|title=Redemption-game dictionary definition {{!}} redemption-game defined|website=www.yourdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Merchandiser|Merchandizers]] also fall in the redemption game category.)  One of the most popular redemption games, [[Skee-Ball|''Skee Ball'']], has more than 100,000 Skee-Ball branded alley games in use worldwide by some estimates and continue to endure after more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/why-skee-ball-doesnt-change/509117/|title=Why Skee-Ball Doesn't Change|last=Klin|first=Richard|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, BayTek Games (known for their hit game ''Big Bass Wheel'') bought the rights to ''Skee-Ball'' from Skee-Ball Amusement Games, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vendingtimes.com/articles/bay-tek-acquires-skeeball-the-worlds-oldest-and-re-1344?iid=24D69C2C3ECE4F6C8AA75ED13523F6EE|title=Bay Tek Acquires Skee-Ball, The World's Oldest And Renowned Arcade Alley Game Brand  {{!}} Articles {{!}} Vending Times|website=www.vendingtimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Innovative Concepts in Entertainment (ICE), another reputable manufacturer, produced hit [[midway (fair)|midway]]-style redemption games such as ''Down The Clown'' and ''Gold Fishin''.  LAI Games (formerly part of the Leisure and Allied Industries Group which founded [[Timezone (video arcades)|Timezone]]) produced hit games such as [[Stacker (game)|''Stacker'']] and ''Speed of Light,'' the latter in which was embedded in popular culture with its appearance in [[Nickelodeon]] TV show [[Game Shakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.intergameonline.com/coin-op/news/lai-games-debuts-on-nickelodeon|title=LAI Games debuts on Nickelodeon|last=|first=|date=2015-11-10|work=InterGame: iGaming, Casino &amp; Coin-Op News|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable players include Apple Industries, Inc., Coastal Amusements, Universal Space (UNIS), Adrenaline Amusements.

=== Simulator Video Game Manufacturers ===
{{See also|Simulation video game}}Another category of video amusement games are simulators. [[Raw Thrills]], best known for developing arcade video games based on films such as ''[[Jurassic Park Arcade]]'' and ''[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The]]'' [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|''Walking Dead'']] ''Arcade'', is a common name found in medium and larger-sized FECs.  Other established companies in this category are Triotech, maker of [[Typhoon (simulator)|''Typhoon'']] - a 3D arcade machine with 2 seats and delivers up to 2G Forces of acceleration, and [[CJ Group|CJ 4DPLEX]] with their ''Mini Rider 3D'' - a 2-seat simulator on an electric motion base with a choice of several 3D movies.

Over the years, it has created databases on [[Latin literature]], [[Bible]] texts, texts in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]], Ancient Greek [[papyri]] and inscriptions, [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]: [[Benjamin Franklin]] and others, and also [[Persian literature]] in translation. It also funds external projects such as the [[Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources]] and the complete works of [[C.P.E. Bach]].

PHI is also concerned with early education of children. The Institute is independent of the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]] and is not associated in any way with any Hewlett-Packard Company foundations.

Its current president is former professor [[David Woodley Packard]], who has served as a director, but never an officer, of Hewlett Packard.

In 1997 with the approval of the [[United States Congress]] the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]] purchased the former high-security storage facility operated by the [[Federal Reserve Board]].  The facility  is located inside Mount Pony in [[Culpeper, Virginia]]. With Congress and the [[Library of Congress]] the facility was transformed into the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center, which completed construction in mid-2007, called the Packard Campus (PCAVC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/the-library-of-congress-unlocks-the-ultimate-archive-system|title=Library of Congress Unlocks the Ultimate Archive System}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library of Congress Packard Campus for Audio Visual Conservation is a state-of-the-art facility funded as a gift to the nation by the Packard Humanities Institute. The Packard Campus is the site where the nation’s library acquires, preserves and provides access to the world’s largest and most comprehensive collection of motion pictures, television programs, radio broadcasts and sound recordings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/avconservation/ https://www.loc.gov/avconservation, Library of Congress AV webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; The Packard Campus is home to nearly 7 million collection items. It provides staff support for the Library of Congress National Film Preservation Board, the [[National Film Preservation Board]] and the national registries for film and recorded sound.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2013/13-165.html loc.gov, News from the Library of Congress, by Press contact: Sheryl Cannady]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''philosophy of environment''' is a trend of [[Freethought|free thought]] located between [[philosophy]], [[epistemology]] and [[anthropology]]. It combines various schools of philosophy such as humanist ecology, philosophy of evolution and environmental [[humanism]]. It is also meant to be a cultural trend having an influence in society.

==Environment and evolution==

The philosophical current indicated under the name philosophy of evolution has been developed since the 1970s by Humanist Ecology (also called Environmental or Evolutive Humanism) and by the [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-darwinian]] school. Its purpose is the long-term evolution of the complex [[Organism|living being]] in its universal environment, analysed through its Human cultural expression.

This trend is unique to the quasi religious Evolutionist Humanism advocated by [[Julian Huxley]], notably during the founders congress of the IHEU ([[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]) in 1952.

Further than the basic [[Theory|scientific theory]] of evolution (notably neo-[[darwinian]], Evolutive Humanism, developed by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]),  looks at the necessity for Man of a permanent adaptation of both his organism and his thoughts to his universal [[natural environment|environment]]. And from there to the relativized relation to belief and to uncertainty, because human ideas evolve and are transformed, as are physical qualities, in a universal process of [[evolution]] and adaptive improvement in their environment. But this does not suppose [[determinism]], genetic or cultural, it refers to the evolutive interactivity and reactivity, partly random, of the living being with his surroundings. According to [[Marc Carl]], "Man must necessarily learn to manage the insufficient appearance and the uncertainty of information to fit and to develop in his relational interactions with his environment, as well as physically and culturally". In a universal environment still as much as 90% unknown, this evolutive cogitation therefore tries not to be locked in premature schemata and answers. It encourages humility in proposals and intuitive boldness in investigations.
A subjacent humanist thought encourages human beings to deliberately take his destiny in his hands, in careful correlation with his environment, knowing that human thought is one of the most impacting manifestations of the living being, as an agent of transformation of the environment, and consequently not only of the Earth's environment. In terms of philosophy of evolution, the organized collective thought of humanity, and in general his evolutive culture, appears as the key to development of our [[species]] in its universal environment, and the key to a possibly significant interactive modification, in the long term, of this environment. It is principally a prospective step.

This cultural trend seems to have emerged because the concept of progressive permanent adaptation, which is no longer appreciated only by its scientific aspects, also took a metaphysical dimension (in a sense of research of the essence of the human), which consequently encourages analysis of [[human evolution]], an agent which potentially modifies our environment, in philosophical terms. The possibilities and the risks of this evolution, [[Nondeterministic algorithm|non-deterministic]] because of its integration into a dynamic complex living system, gives the human existence and destiny a new sense. And to be involved in such a cogitation opens a philosophical way in which curious minds could not miss advancing sooner or later, a way which rests on a regenerated [[metaphysics]], encouraging us to take back in an evolutive way Aristoteles original concept of physis and its substance, and to search with modern conceptual tools the essence and the sense of our life.

==Humanist ecology (environmental humanism)==

Supported by the philosophy of evolution, this international emerging concept has expressed since the 1970s an evolutive humanism, extending the naturalist tradition of ancient Greek philosophers. Humanist ecology encourages us to better understand and situate the place and the destiny of humanity in its environment in permanent evolution. Human destiny is put in perspective in a universal context where many things remain to be learned.  Because it encourages every human in a responsibility in front of his conscience, humanist ecology  can be defined too as a will of ethical responsibility of civilized humanity, favouring its permanent improvement and its happiness, in useful interaction with its evolutive environment, in a beneficial way as much for a human being particularly as for mankind in general, and in common symbiosis with their local and global bioscape in evolution. That serves to optimize [[Society|human society]] in its own interactions and in its interactions with its bioscape, notably by preserving the planetary equilibrium of the Earth. This solidarity of all of mankind is necessary to preserve its environment and its best development in this environment inspired a particular political expression of humanist ecology, taken up notably by Statesmen such as [[Jacques Chirac]] (France) or Mohammed VI (Morocco) in the main meetings of the United Nations.

==Evolution and its relativisation==

Humanist ecology naturally favours the permanent adaptation and the best possible development of humanity, and of the human being, in an uncertain universal environment in permanent evolution, with a mind open enough to consider all the possibilities. In humanist ecological comprehension, it is vain to want to freeze an arbitrary cultural schemata and choose the apparent equilibrium and the supposed future of one moment of evolution. A permanent evolutive adaptation is necessary, as much biologically as mentally. That requires relativity and a caution in the analysis. According to this concept, for the [[Mind|human mind]], any representation belongs to the domain of belief, considering the uncertainty of the relation of man to the universe, and the natural imperfection of his senses to represent his environment and his interactions with this environment; the reality perceived by Man being only one representation of reality, particular in mankind. Humanist ecology admits this relativized relation with [[belief]] but refutes any final and locking form, knowing that no truth can be final for the human mind without upsetting its natural evolutive necessity. This [[School (discipline)|school of thought]] accepts belief in the present, for want of anything better, but dictates that you must take care to verify and update beliefs.

The term '''postfeminism''' (alternatively rendered as '''post-feminism''') is used to describe reactions against contradictions and absences in [[feminism]], especially [[second-wave feminism]] and [[third-wave feminism]]. The term ''postfeminism'' is sometimes confused with subsequent feminisms such as [[Fourth-wave feminism|4th wave-feminism]], and "women of color feminism" (e.g. hooks, 1996; Spivak, 1999).

The ideology of postfeminism is recognized by its contrast with prevailing or preceding feminism. Postfeminism strives towards the next stage in gender-related progress, and as such is often conceived as in favor of a society that is no longer defined by [[gender binary]] and [[gender role]]s. A postfeminist is a person who believes in, promotes, or embodies any of various ideologies springing from the feminism of the 1970s, whether supportive of or antagonistic towards classical feminism.

Postfeminism can be considered a critical way of understanding the changed relations between feminism, [[popular culture]] and [[femininity]]. Postfeminism may also present a critique of second-wave feminism or third-wave feminism by questioning their binary thinking and essentialism, their vision of sexuality, and their perception of relationships between femininity and feminism. It may also complicate or even deny entirely the notion that absolute gender equality is necessary, desirable or realistically achievable.

Second-wave feminism is often critiqued for being too "white", too "straight", and too "liberal", thus resulting in the needs of women from marginalized groups and cultures being ignored. However, since [[intersectionality]] is a product of third-wave feminism, the references to such as postfeminist are open to challenge and may be more properly considered feminist.

==History of the term==
While ''postfeminism'' was first used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, it is now used as a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.  It may also be used to invoke the view that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gender.cawater-info.net/knowledge_base/rubricator/feminism_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the meaning of postfeminism has broadened in scope, encompassing many different meanings, as is the case with feminism. Within feminist literature, definitions tend to fall into two main categories: 1) “death of feminism”, “anti-feminism”, “feminism is irrelevant now” and 2) the next stage in feminism, or feminism that intersects with other “post-” philosophies/theories, such as [[postmodernism]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[postcolonialism]].

In 1919, a journal was launched in which "female literary radicals" stated "'we're interested in people now—not in men and women'", that "moral, social, economic, and political standards 'should not have anything to do with sex'", that it would "be 'pro-woman without being anti-man'", and that "their stance [is called] 'post-feminist'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy F. Cott|Cott, Nancy F.]], ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism'' (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, [2d printing?] pbk 1987 ({{ISBN|0-300-04228-0}})) (cloth {{ISBN|0-300-03892-5}}), p. 282 (author prof. American studies &amp; history, Yale Univ.) (book is largely on U.S. feminism in 1910s–1920s) (n. 23 (at end) omitted) (n. 23 (in full): "23. ''Judy'' 1:1 (Jun. 1919); 2:3 (1919), n.p., SL." ("SL" in small capitals &amp; abbreviating "The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts", per ''id.'', p. 285 (Abbreviations Used in Notes (Libraries)))).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against [[second-wave feminism]]. Postfeminism is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;Wright, Elizabeth, ''Lacan and Postfeminism'' (Icon Books, 2000), {{ISBN|978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;Modleski, Tania. Feminism without Women: Culture and Criticism in a "Postfeminist" Age. New York: Routledge, 1991, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and were overly generalizing in their criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Amelia. "Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art," New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action, Eds. Joana Frueh, Cassandra L. Langer and Arlene Raven. New York: HarperCollins, 1994. 16–41, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw the popularization of this term, in both the academic world as well as the media world. It was seen as a term of both commendation and scorn. [[Toril Moi]], a professor at Duke University, originally coined the term in 1985 in Sexual/Textual politics to advocate a feminism that would deconstruct the binary between equality based on "liberal" feminism and difference-based or "radical" feminism. There is confusion surrounding the intended meaning of "post" in the context of "postfeminism". This confusion has plagued the very meaning of "postfeminism" since the 1990s. While the term has seemed on the one hand to announce the end of feminism, on the other hand it has itself become a site of feminist politics.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 4149214|title = Feminism, Ethics, and History, or What is the "Post" in Postfeminism?|journal = Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 29–44|last1 = Kavka|first1 = Misha|year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, feminist history is characterized by the struggle to find out the present situation—often articulated as a concern about whether there is still such a thing called "feminism"—by writing in the past. It is here that the meaning of "post" as a historical break is troubling, for "post" offers to situate feminism in history by proclaiming the end of this history. It then confirms feminist history as a thing of the past. However, some claim that it is impossible that feminism could be aligned with "post" when it is unthinkable, as it would be the same as calling the current world a post racist, post-classist, and post-sexist society.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

==Characteristics==

The early part of the 1980s was when the media began labeling teenage women and women in their twenties the "postfeminist generation". After twenty years, the term postfeminist is still used to refer to young women, "who are thought to benefit from the women's movement through expanded access to employment and education and new family arrangements but at the same time do not push for further political change", Pamela Aronson, Professor of Sociology, asserts. Postfeminism is a highly debated topic since it implies that feminism is "dead" and "because the equality it assumes is largely a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Feminists or "Postfeminists"?: Young Women's Attitudes toward Feminism and Gender Relations | journal = Gender and Society | year = 2003 | first = Pamela | last = Aronson | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 903–22 | doi=10.1177/0891243203257145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Diane Davis|Prof. D. Diane Davis]], postfeminism is just a continuation of what first- and second-wave feminisms want.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Debra Diane, ''Breaking Up [at] Totality: A Rhetoric of Laughter'' (Carbondale: Southern Ill. Univ. Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|0-8093-2228-5}})), p. 141 n. 8 (brackets in title so in original) (author asst. prof. rhetoric, Univ. of Iowa).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted at Kent State University narrowed postfeminism to four main claims: support for feminism declined; women began hating feminism and feminists; society had already attained social equality, thus making feminism outdated; and the label "feminist" was disliked due to negative stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Elaine J.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Marnie Salupo|date=2003|title=The Myth of Postfeminism|jstor=3594675|journal=Gender and Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=878–902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PPp7dfrNTroC&amp;pg=PP1#v=snippet&amp;q=rodriguez&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives|last=Abbott|first=Pamela|last2=Tyler|first2=Melissa|last3=Wallace|first3=Claire|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781134382453|location=|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of postfeminist work==

In her 1994 book ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] considers much of modern academic [[feminist theory]] and the feminist movement to be [[gynocentrism|gynocentric]]. She labels this "[[gender feminism]]" and proposes "[[equity feminism]]"—an ideology that aims for full civil and legal equality. She argues that while the feminists she designates as gender feminists advocate preferential treatment and portray women as victims, equity feminism provides a viable alternative form of feminism.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;Hoff Sommers, Christina, Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions and her other work have caused Hoff Sommers to be described as an antifeminist by some other feminists.&lt;ref name=Flood&gt;Flood, Michael (7 July 2004). "Backlash: Angry men's movements", in Stacey Elin Rossi, ed.: The Battle and Backlash Rage On. N.p.: XLibris, 273. {{ISBN|1-4134-5934-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Uncovering the Right—Female Anti-Feminism for Fame and Profit |url=http://organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html |accessdate=2007-12-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215141226/http://www.organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary feminists, such as [[Katha Pollitt]] or [[Nadine Strossen]], consider feminism to hold simply that "women are people." Views that separate the sexes rather than unite them are considered by these writers to be ''sexist'' rather than ''feminist''.&lt;ref name=Pollitt&gt;Pollitt, Katha, ''Reasonable Creatures: Essays on Women and Feminism '' (Vintage, 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-679-76278-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strossen&gt;Strossen, Nadine, ''Defending Pornography: Free Speech, Sex, and the Fight for Women's Rights'' (Prentice Hall &amp; IBD, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-684-19749-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amelia Jones]] has authored post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s/1990s and portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and criticized it using generalizations.

One of the earliest modern uses of the term was in Susan Bolotin's 1982 article "Voices of the Post-Feminist Generation", published in ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''. This article was based on a number of interviews with women who largely agreed with the goals of feminism, but did not identify as feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Ruth. The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America. New York: Viking, 2000, 275, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Faludi]], in her 1991 book ''[[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]]'', argued that a backlash against second wave feminism in the 1980s had successfully re-defined feminism through its terms. She argued that it constructed the [[women's liberation movement]] as the source of many of the problems alleged to be plaguing women in the late 1980s. She also argued that many of these problems were illusory, constructed by the media without reliable evidence. According to her, this type of backlash is a historical trend, recurring when it appeared that women had made substantial gains in their efforts to obtain equal rights.&lt;ref name=Faludi_Backlash&gt;Faludi, Susan, ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women'' (Three Rivers Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angela McRobbie]] argued that adding the prefix ''post-'' to ''feminism'' undermined the strides that feminism made in achieving equality for everyone, including women. In McRobbie's opinion, postfeminism gave the impression that equality has been achieved and feminists could now focus on something else entirely. McRobbie believed that postfeminism was most clearly seen on so-called feminist media products, such as ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]], [[Sex and the City]]'', and ''[[Ally McBeal]]''. Female characters like Bridget Jones and [[Carrie Bradshaw]] claimed to be liberated and clearly enjoy their sexuality, but what they were constantly searching for was the one man who would make everything worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = McRobbie | first = Angela | author-link = Angela McRobbie | title = Post‐feminism and popular culture | journal = [[Feminist Media Studies]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 255&amp;ndash;264 | doi = 10.1080/1468077042000309937 | date = 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representations of post feminism can be found in pop culture. Postfeminism has been seen in media as a form of feminism that accepts popular culture instead of rejecting it, as was typical with second wave feminists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feasey|first=Rebecca|date=7 August 2010|title=Charmed: Why Teen Television Appeals to Women|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|volume=34:1|pages=2–9|doi=10.3200/JPFT.34.1.2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many popular shows from the 90s and early 2000s are considered to be postfeminist works because they tend to focus on women who are empowered by popular cultural representations of other women. Because of this, postfeminists claimed that such media was more accessible and inclusive than past representations of women in the media; however, some feminists believe that postfeminist works focus too much on white, middle-class women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such shows and movies include ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]], [[Xena: Warrior Princess]], [[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]],'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].'' Another example is ''Sex and the City''. Carrie Bradshaw from ''Sex and the City'' is an example of a character living a post feminist life. While her character attempts to live a sexually liberated lifestyle, Bradshaw is stuck endlessly pursuing the love and validation of a man. The balance between Bradshaw's independent life as a successful columnist and desire to find a husband exemplifies the tension of post feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerhard|first=Jane|date=August 2006|title=Sex and the City, Feminist Media Studies|url=|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=5|pages=37–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these works also involve women monitoring their appearance as a form of self-management, be it in the form of dieting, exercise, or—most popularly—makeover scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politicsandculture.org/2009/11/09/post-feminism-in-popular-culture-a-potential-for-critical-resistance/|title=Post feminism in popular culture: A potential for critical resistance?|date=2009-11-09|work=Politics and Culture|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist literature—also known as [[Chick lit|chicklit]]—has been criticized by feminists for similar themes and notions. However, the genre is also praised for being confident, witty, and complicated, bringing in feminist themes, revolving around women, and reinventing standards of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/writingpostfeminism/gutsy|title=What is chick-lit? {{!}} Electronic Book Review|website=www.electronicbookreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples can also be found in ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]''. The novels explore the complexity of girlhood in a society that assumes gender equality, which is in line with postfeminism. The constant surveillance and self policing of the series' protagonists depicts the performance of heterosexuality, hyperfemininity, and critical gaze forced upon girls. The materialism and performance from the girls in ''Pretty Little Liars'' critiques the notion that society has full gender equality, and thus offers a critique of postfeminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitney|first1=Sarah|title=Kisses, Bitches: Pretty Little Liars Frames Postfeminism's Adolescent Girl|journal=Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|date=11 November 2017|volume=36|issue=2|pages=353–377|doi=10.1353/tsw.2017.0026|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/677146|language=en|issn=1936-1645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on print jewelry advertisements in Singapore, Michelle Lazar analyses how the construction of 'postfeminist' femininity has given rise to a [[neo-liberal]] hybrid "pronounced sense of self or 'I-dentity'". She states that the increasing number of female wage earners has led to advertisers updating their image of women but that "through this hybrid postfeminist I-dentity, advertisers have found a way to reinstall a new normativity that coexists with the status quo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lazar | first = Michelle | title = Recuperating feminism, reclaiming femininity: Hybrid postfeminist I-dentity in consumer advertisements | journal = [[Gender and Language]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–224 | doi = 10.1558/genl.v8i2.205 | year = 2014 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist ads and fashion have been criticized for using femininity as a commodity veiled as liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanaejournal.hu/vol7no2/kulcsar|title=AMERICANA: "A Critique of Post-feminism" by Zsófia Kulcsár|website=americanaejournal.hu|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Power Shift''' is an annual youth summit which has been held in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1573629/20071106/index.jhtml |title=Youth Leaders Shift Attention To Environment At Power Shift Summit In D.C. |accessdate=2009-08-30 |date=2007-11-06 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Shift NZ-Pacific 2012 on Facebook|url=https://www.facebook.com/PowerShiftNZPacific|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Power Shift Conferences are also being organised by members of the International [[Youth Climate Movement]] including [[Africa]], [[Japan]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powershiftcanada.org/ |title=Power Shift Canada |accessdate=2009-08-30 |publisher=[[Canadian Youth Climate Coalition]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the events is on [[climate change policy]].

== History ==
[[File:PowerShift09.jpg|thumb|left | Logo of the 2009 Power Shift conference]]

The first Power Shift conference was held from November 2 to 5, 2007 in [[Washington D.C.]], and was organised by the [[Energy Action Coalition]].&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; The second [[United States|American]] conference occurred two years later on February 27 to March 2, 2009.

Following on from the success of the American format, the [[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]] organised a Power Shift event in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] on July 11 to July 13, 2009. Similarly, the [[UK Youth Climate Coalition]] has scheduled the first British version of the event to run from October 9 to October 12, 2009. The first [[New Zealand]] Power Shift will be run between the 7th and 9 December 2012 in [[Auckland]].

The aim of the Power Shift Conferences is to build the youth climate movement in their respective nations, which is achieved through workshops, expert panel discussions, keynote speakers, and a lobby day or a "Day of Action" as it is alternatively known.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Power Shift"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20071203/kamenetz |title=Climate Change Power Shift |accessdate=2009-08-30 |date=2007-11-15 |publisher=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Van Jones at Power Shift 2011 in Washington, DC - 20110415.jpg| thumb | [[Van Jones]] speaking after [[Al Gore]] at the Power Shift 2011 in D.C.]]
The first Power Shift Conference took place from November 2 to 5 in 2007 with between 5,000 and 6,000 students and young people in attendance.&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; It is claimed that due to the number of young people who attended the conference, it became the largest activist youth event on climate change in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehoot.net/articles/2114 |title=Powershift 07 |accessdate=2009-08-30 |date=2008-01-27 |publisher=[[The Hoot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], a rally of between 2,000 and 3,000 people on the steps of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] and a Lobby Day. The event was also attended by a number of keynote speakers which included [[Al Gore]]. The main aim of the first conference was to urge elected officials to pass legislation which would include three planks taken from the platform of the climate advocacy coalition [[1Sky]]:&lt;ref name="Climate Change Power Shift"/&gt;
*The creation of a 5 million-strong Clean Energy Job Corps
*The reduction of [[greenhouse gases]] to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, which scientists say is the baseline for mitigating the worst [[effects of global warming]]
*A moratorium on new coal plants and divestment from [[fossil fuel]] and highway subsidies.

On February 27 to March 2, 2009, the second American Power Shift Conference took place. Similarly to the first summit, it included workshops, panel discussions, and speakers focusing on addressing climate change and [[environmental justice]].  Casper ter Kuile the co-director of the UK Youth Climate Coalition states that it is more than a youth movement, it is "[[social movement]]" .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2009/feb/20/coal-protest-power-shift | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=Casper ter Kuile on Power Shift - a booming global youth climate movement comes of age | date=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, keynote speakers included [[Van Jones]], [[Bill McKibben]] of [[350.org]], [[Ralph Nader]], and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehoot.net/articles/2114 |title=The Brandeis Hoot |accessdate=2009-08-30 |date=2007-11-09 |publisher=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third American Power Shift took place April 15 to 18, 2011 in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the [[Walter E. Washington Convention Center]]. The conference had over 10,000 attenders.  People came to support various [[environmental movement]]s, many in protest of [[Presidency of Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]]'s alleged weakness on environmental issues.{{citation needed|reason=How do we know the motivation of the attenders? Where do the statistics on the number of attenders come from?|date=April 2011}} Guest speakers included former [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. vice-president]] Al Gore, [[Greenpeace]] Executive Director [[Phil Radford]], and environmental advocate [[Van Jones]].

The fourth Power Shift conference in the US was also the first outside of Washington. It was instead held in [[Pittsburgh, PA]] at the [[David L. Lawrence Convention Center]] on October 19–21, 2013. Keynote speakers included Gasland director [[Josh Fox]], [[Sierra Club]] director [[Michael Brune]], and Kandi Mossett of the [[Indigenous Environmental Network]]. The program included a rally against coal production and the organization of protests against the [[Keystone XL Pipeline]].

=== The 2006 PowerShift Conferences ===
In 2006, a series of student conferences on [[energy security]] were organized under the name PowerShift by the 20/20 Vision Education Fund, a [[501(c)3]] organization based out of [[Maryland]]. (They were not affiliated with the 2007 and later Power Shift conferences organized by the [[Energy Action Coalition]].) Over 250 people participated in the first conference which took place in [[Kalamazoo]], MI on April 1, 2006 and featured former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] director [[Jim Woolsey]] giving a keynote speech on U.S. [[oil dependence]] and [[national security]]. The conferences also featured a simulated energy wargame called [[Oil Shockwave]], developed by non-profit groups Securing America's Future Energy (SAFE) and the National Commission on Energy Policy{{Who|date=August 2011}}. The website for the conference series has been taken down, but is [https://web.archive.org/web/20060402205921/http://power-shift.org/ viewable using the Internet Wayback Machine].

== Australian Power Shift conferences ==
Two years later in 2009, the [[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]], in partnership with the [[University of Western Sydney]], [[GetUp]] and [[Greenpeace]], organised the Australian Power Shift Conference on July 11 to 13, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/global-warming/climate-warriors-march-behind-little-green-book-20090710-dg2t.html |title=Climate warriors march behind little green book |accessdate=2009-09-01 |date=2009-07-11 |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | first=Kelsey | last=Munro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1,500 young people attended the summit. Guests included former Vice President of the United States [[Al Gore]],  the swimmer [[Ian Thorpe]] and the actress [[Brooke Satchwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/national/youth-speak-out-on-climate-change-goals-20090607-bzix.html |title=Youth speak out on climate change goals |accessdate=2009-09-01 |date=2009-07-06 |publisher=[[WAtoday]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event concluded with a flashmob action outside the [[Sydney Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullstory.com.au/html/s02_article/article_view.asp?article_id=1730&amp;nav_cat_id=-1&amp;nav_top_id=-1 |title=Thousands meet in Sydney for climate change fight |accessdate=2009-09-01 |date=2009-07-10 |publisher=Full Story}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the AYCC held three regional Power Shift Conferences in [[Adelaide]], [[Canberra]] and [[Geelong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aycc.org.au/projects/power-shift-2010-2/ |title=Power Shift 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-29 |publisher=[[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724131616/http://www.aycc.org.au/projects/power-shift-2010-2/ |archivedate=2010-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the AYCC organised Power Shift Conferences in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Brisbane]] with over 1,000 young people. Speakers included [[Bill McKibben]], [[Kumi Naidoo]], [[Anna Rose]], [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]] and Dr. [[Karl Kruszelnicki]].

In 2013 the AYCC will hold Australia's largest ever Power Shift, in [[Melbourne]] from the 13–15 July.

== Canadian Power Shift conference ==
The first [[Canada|Canadian]] Power Shift event was held from October 23 to October 26, 2009 in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] by the Canadian Youth Climate Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://powershiftcanada.org/the-conference/ |title=The Conference |accessdate=2009-08-31 |publisher=[[Canadian Youth Climate Coalition]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830051719/http://powershiftcanada.org/the-conference/ |archivedate=2009-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent summits were held in Ottawa, ON in 2012; Victoria, BC in 2013; Halifax, NS in 2014; and Edmonton, AB in 2016.

== New Zealand Power Shift summit ==
A collaboration between [[350.org]] [[Aotearoa]] and [[Generation Zero (NZ Group)|Generation Zero]], a student environmental movement, and other individuals, will bring ''"Power Shift NZ-Pacific"'' to [[New Zealand]] for the first time between the 7th and 9 December 2012 at the [[University of Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Shift New Zealand Pacific 2012|url=http://www.powershift.org.nz|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confirmed speakers so far include; American Environmentalist [[Bill McKibben]], Mayor of Auckland [[Len Brown]] and [[Xena: Warrior Princess]] actress [[Lucy Lawless]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Shift New Zealand Pacific 2012 Event Details and Programme|url=http://powershift.org.nz/details/programme/#speakers|accessdate=22 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916111222/http://powershift.org.nz/details/programme/#speakers|archivedate=16 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UK Power Shift conferences ==
From 9–12 October 2009, the [[UK]] version of Power Shift was held at the [[Institute of Education]] in [[London]]. Modelled on a similar event to one organised by the [[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]] and carrying the same name as the [[Energy Action Coalition]] event in the USA, the event intended to develop the youth climate movement and provide young people with training on public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/feb/20/coal-protest-power-shift  |title=Power Shift: Global youth climate movement comes of age |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2009-05-27 |publisher= [[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The training was based on the techniques developed by [[Marshall Ganz]], a civil rights activist who is credited with devising the successful [[grassroots]] organizing model and public narrative training for [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/15/nation/na-ganz15 |title=Famed organizer sees history in the making |date=2008-06-15 |accessdate=2010-05-27 |publisher=[[LA Times]] | first=Scott | last=Martelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/oct/12/climate-change-dancers-parliament  |title=Shake your booty in Big Ben's shadow – teenagers dance to save the planet |date=2009-10-17 |accessdate=2009-05-27 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Power Shift event intended to serve as a feeder to the International Day of Action organised by [[350.org#International Day of Climate Action|350.org]] on October 24.

A PowerShift UK event scheduled in 2011 was cancelled, but large-scale youth climate movement events have been taking place annually under the name [https://web.archive.org/web/20120629044103/http://peopleandplanet.org/shared-planet Shared Planet] since 1999, organised by the UK's largest student-led climate campaigning network [[People &amp; Planet]].

On 3–4 May 2014 a Power Shift UK event was held in London, titled 'Breaking Down the Barriers and Diversifying the Climate Movement'.  Open to people from all walks of society who want to contribute to action on climate change, the event brought people across the UK together for a weekend of discussions and workshops, to share stories and ideas for action, and to challenge assumptions about diversifying the climate movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://world.350.org/uk-gps/2014/04/03/get-ready-for-action-at-power-shift-uk-2/|accessdate=2014-04-13 |publisher= Power Shift UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Bidston Hill - geograph.org.uk - 335675.jpg|thumb|right|A former home of POL, built at [[Bidston]], west of Liverpool, in 1975 and used until around 2004. Demolished 2013.]]
The former '''Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory''' (POL) is based in Brownlow Street, [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. In April 2010, POL merged with the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton (NOCS) to form the [[National Oceanography Centre]]. The Liverpool laboratory's scientific research focuses on [[oceanography]] encompassing global sea-levels and geodesy, numerical modelling of continental shelf seas and coastal sediment processes. This research alongside activities of surveying, monitoring, data management and forecasting provides strategic support for the wider mission of the Natural Environment Research Council.

A leading world centre in tidal prediction (with related interests in earth tides and storm surges) and a leading European centre in modelling and forecasting shelf sea dynamics, it is home to the [http://cobs.pol.ac.uk Coastal Observatory] in Liverpool Bay, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071118111344/http://www.pol.ac.uk/ntslf/ National Tidal and Sea Level Facility], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071024132938/http://www.pol.ac.uk/psmsl/ Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level] and the [http://www.bodc.ac.uk British Oceanographic Data Centre].

==History==
The story of tidal measurements taken at Liverpool starts with [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] (1619–1641). He was one of the great scientists of the 17th century, and a man even [[Isaac Newton]] held in high regard. He is most famous for predicting, and then observing, the transit of Venus in 1639 at [[Much Hoole]] near Preston. However, he also had a great interest in understanding ocean tides, and in particular in verifying that tidal changes were closely related to variations in the Moon's orbit. Horrocks was born and died at [[Toxteth]]. Shortly before his death, he is known to have made measurements of high waters (probably the times and perhaps also the heights of high tide) on the Mersey coast near his home for at least a month. Unfortunately, his tidal measurements (but not his astronomical records) were lost in the civil war or possibly in the Fire of London.

A second major figure is [[William Hutchinson (privateer)|William Hutchinson]] (1716–1801) who compiled the first extended set of sea level measurements in the UK, together with a comprehensive set of meteorological information. His measurements of the heights and times of every high water during 1764–1793 at the Liverpool Old Dock not only spanned many years but were of high quality and are still being used in scientific research today.

Hutchinson made many important contributions to Liverpool's history.  The first half of his life was spent as a mariner and privateer captain during the Seven Years' War. Only in the second half did he develop into becoming a dock master, entrepreneur, inventor, author, philanthropist and, what we would nowadays call, scientific researcher. To mark Liverpool 2007 and 2008, POL together with colleagues at Brock University, Canada will produce a CD containing copies of all Hutchinson's tidal and meteorological data sets and background information on his life.  Hutchinson's measurements of the tides during 1764–1767 were used by Richard and George Holden to derive the first reliable publicly accessible tide tables in the UK. They first appeared in 1770 and were published for over 200 years.

===19th century===
During the 19th century, the Mersey Docks &amp; Harbour Board (MDHB) established an impressive network of a dozen state-of-the-art sea level stations along the Mersey, Dee and neighbouring coasts. They were used to provide the best possible tidal information to what became one of the most important ports in the Empire, together with data for surveying and [[coastal engineering]]. The main Liverpool gauges were at George’s Pier (the present-day Pier Head), then Prince's Pier (next to the ocean liner landing stage) and now Gladstone Dock. Together these sites have provided data which make up the longest UK sea level record and one of the longest in the world. These data have been used to study long term changes in mean sea levels and in the sea level extreme levels which often result in flooding.

In 1845 the MDHB established the Liverpool Observatory at Waterloo Dock, to provide all the tidal, meteorological and astronomical information required by ship owners. The expanding port resulted in the Observatory being relocated in 1866 to [[Bidston Hill]] on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], where Hutchinson had established [[Bidston Hill#Bidston Lighthouse|Bidston Lighthouse]] in 1771. Its work became more focused on scientific research, rather than port operations, in 1929 when the Liverpool Observatory was merged with the Liverpool University Tidal Institute. This combined institute (with a number of name changes and official owners) was to become a world-famous centre for sea level and tidal research with no less than three Fellows of the Royal Society among its Directors: [[Joseph Proudman]], [[Arthur Doodson]] and David Cartwright.

===20th century===
In recent decades the institute has concentrated on sea level monitoring and prediction around UK coasts, and indeed on understanding sea level changes worldwide: the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level having been established at Bidston by Proudman in 1933 and as important as ever today. Such understanding informs government departments on policies for coastal protection, and contributes to international scientific study groups such as those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Thanks to the work of Doodson and other scientists in Liverpool, the tide can be predicted at any location around the UK with several centimetre accuracy.  Superimposed upon the ‘astronomical tide’, which is caused by the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun, is the ‘storm surge’ caused by strong winds and low air pressures. The major flood at [[Sea Palling]] and other parts of the north Norfolk coast in 1953 resulted from a large storm surge occurring at high tide. This disaster led to the development of the UK National Tide Gauge Network and the UK Storm Tide Forecasting System.  POL led the development of computer models to predict UK storm surges several days ahead based on forecast weather information.  Routine surge forecasts are now produced by the Met Office and result in Flood Warnings issued by the Environment Agency.

The institute was renamed the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory in 1987, a name which survived its move from Bidston to the campus of Liverpool University in 2004. Sea Level Science now constitutes one of the three main areas of expertise of POL research, the other two closely related fields being shelf sea science and numerical modelling of ocean processes. Although Sea Level Science has come a long way since Horrocks' measurements at Toxteth, the scientific importance of the subject is as great as ever, and Liverpool remains one of its main worldwide centres of excellence and its ‘UK home’.

'''Ramón Massó Tarruella''' (1928 - 2017) was a Spanish [[Communication|media and communications]] expert and a former [[Carlist]] politician.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Antiga Fabrica Borras i Masso.jpg|thumbnail|190px|left|Borràs &amp; Massó manufacture, [[Mataró]]]]
Ramón Massó Tarruella was born to an established, much branched and well-to-do [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[bourgeoisie]] family. His grandfather, [[Ramón Massó Marcer]], originated from the small seaside town of [[Sant Pere de Ribes]]. In 1885, during rapid expansion of the Catalan [[clothing]] manufacturing, he moved to Barcelona to set up his own business; he started a company specializing in [[dye]]s for the [[textile industry]] (his cousin, [[Ramón Oliveras Massó]], became an academic and taught [[chemistry]] in the Barcelona-based [[Escuela de Ingenieros Industriales]] until 1936). His son, [[Juan Massó Soler]], entered the family business in 1912 and developed it into a successful chemical company. Member of many Catalan commercial and trade institutions, he married Nuria Tarruella Riu.

The couple had 8 children, 3 sons (José Luis, Ramón, Juan Antonio) and 5 daughters (Montserrat, Isabel, Maria Amelia, Pilar and Nuria), all raised in a profoundly [[Catholic]] and traditional ambience. In the 1950s José Luis and Juan Antonio got engaged in the family company and later turned it into [[Comercial Química Massó Sociedad Anónima]], which expanded into new market sectors and remains active until today. In the early 1960s [[John Masso|Juan Antonio]] left the family enterprise and commenced studying [[canon law]], ordained as a [[priest]] in 1965; following his transfer to Australia he later became head ([[Vicar|Regional Vicar]]) of [[Opus Dei]] there, the position retained until his death.

As a child Ramón together with his family fled Barcelona, the city which fell under the [[CNT-FAI|anarchist]] control during the first months of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. The family settled in [[San Sebastián]] in the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|nationalist zone]]. The Massó boys joined [[Pelayos (Carlist Youth Organisation)|Pelayos]], the Carlist organization for older children animated mostly by the Catalan emigrees, but terminated their engagement following [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|amalgamation]] of the Carlist and [[Falangist]] juvenile organizations; as a kid Massó took part in the 1937 anti-unification demonstrations, allegedly shouting "death to Franco" and "death to Falange". Following the end of hostilities the family returned to Barcelona, where Ramón together with his brothers became a teenage member of the Catalan Opus Dei.

In late 1940s Massó moved to [[Madrid]] studying Filosofia y Letras to graduate in Philosophy (later he became also Técnico en Publicidad). During his university years he joined [[Agrupación de Estudiantes Tradicionalistas]], a technically illegal though tolerated Carlist student organization. Enraged by increasing marginalization of Carlism within the political realm of the [[Francoist Spain|regime]] he developed his childish anti-Falangist sentiments into a firm anti-Francoist outlook. Engaged in leafleting campaigns and skirmishes against the official [[:es:Sindicato Español Universitario|SEU]] organization, in 1954 Massó (recommended by the Carlist political leader [[Manuel Fal Conde]]) grew to the position of Delegado Nacional of AET.

==Aspiring Carlist==
[[File:Don Javier 1960.jpg|thumbnail|left|170px|Don Javier, 1960]]
Massó was increasingly disappointed by the perceived somnolent atmosphere of the movement's circulos, with the older generation trapped in recollections of the long gone days of glory. Highly emotional semi-clandestine 1956 attempts to dissuade the Carlist [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|claimant]] from a would-be dynastical union with the ''[[Alfonsism|Alfonsinos]]'' and to inspire him towards a decisive policy proved unsuccessful. The Massó-led ''aetistas'', upset with the diffident Don Javier, decided to focus on his eldest son [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Carlos Hugo]], with whom the group found common ground during his brief stay in Madrid en route to Portugal in 1955.
 
Carlos Hugo, at that time a [[French citizen]] completing PhD in economics in [[Oxford]], threw himself into the Spanish politics in liaison with Massó and his team. Following half a year spent quietly in [[Bilbao]] on improving his [[Castellano language|castellano]] and learning Spanish politics (his key tutor Massó just commenced teaching at the local [[Colegio Gaztelueta]]), the prince made a public debut during the annual Carlist amassment at [[Montejurra]] in May 1957. The entry, repeatedly rehearsed, meticulously planned and pre-agreed with the Carlist leadership, turned out to be a masterpiece of public appearance. The unexpected prince's presentation generated exploding enthusiasm of the crowd, excited by youth, optimism and royal firmness of the speaker (though the lecture contained only one reference to God and included phrases sounding like an offer to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]). Massó and his team ensured that ''La Proclama de Montejurra'' gets propagated in the Carlist circulos across Spain. In 1958 Carlos Hugo's speech – again carefully crafted by the prince, Massó and the team – called for profound change, put social issues on the forefront and contained a positive reference to Franco. During the following years the snowballing attendance at Montejurra transformed it from a Carlist-flavored local ''[[Via Crucis]]'' to the largest (save official, religious and football gatherings) public amassment in Francoist Spain. 
[[File:Charles-Hugues de Bourbon-Parme.jpg|thumbnail|180px|Carlos Hugo, 1964]]
The emergence of Carlos Hugo and the ''hugocarlistas'' coincided with the overall change in the Carlist strategy towards Francoism; in 1955 the intransigent Fal Conde was replaced as the movement's leader by a collective governing body, which initiated a new collaborative policy. Tactically Massó also opted for limited collaboration with Francoism (which cost him AET leadership in 1957), judging that gaining room for action is vital for his further aims.  However, while the new Carlist leader [[José María Valiente Soriano|José María Valiente]] sincerely hoped for some sort of prudent partnership between Francoism and Carlism, Massó aimed at dismantling the regime from within. Moreover, while Valiente oriented himself towards the army and bureaucracy, the hugocarlistas approached the hardcore [[syndicalist]] Falange sector, likewise promoting new social order and disdainful towards greedy capitalism.

The collaborative approach appeared to work: in the early 1960s the Carlists were granted a few media and organizational concessions. The ''hugocarlistas'' benefited the most, opening a number of new periodicals turned into their ideological tribunes (mostly ''Azada y asta'' and ''Montejurra''), galvanizing the chain of [[Círculos Culturales Vázquez de Mella]] and launching their own workers' organization, [[Movimiento Obrero Tradicionalista|MOT]], all of them becoming later dissemination channels of their political vision.

==Protagonist Carlist==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|210px|left|the Carlist standard]]
As Carlos Hugo moved to Madrid he organized the young collaborators, dubbed ''camarilla'' and headed by Massó, into his [[Secretaría Politica (of Carlos Hugo)|Secretaría Política]]. The partnership of the old and the young leaders seemed smooth, though some of the former started suspecting the latter of dangerously Leftist ideas. Backed by the aging claimant the ''hugocarlistas'' assumed more powers as the newly established [[Junta de Gobierno (Carlist body)|Junta de Gobierno]] diluted the authority of Valiente. Massó outplayed the chief opponent, [[José Luis Zamanillo González-Camino|José Luis Zamanillo]], marginalized him in 1962–1963 and finally got him expelled early 1964. From this moment on the ''hugocarlistas'' spelled out their vision of Carlism more openly; the same year they published ''Esquema doctrinal'', a lecture which avoided open challenge to Francoism and presented a monarchist [[Corporativism|corporative]] political organization combined with [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] principles. During the 1965 Montejurra the ''hugocarlistas'' voiced their praise of [[socialism]] and even [[Marxism]] at unprecedented levels.

It is not clear whether Massó intended to instaurate the Carlist dynasty by means of new social mobilization or he tried to promote profound transformation using Carlos Hugo as an agent of change; anyway, the two threads became intertwined. The immediate political objective of Massó was to prevent the Alfonsist restoration. The young Carlists dogged the ''juanista niño'', boycotting or jeering [[Juan Carlos]]; they publicly humiliated the royal prince and [[Sofia de Grecia|his wife]] a few times. At the same time, Massó engineered a campaign to promote Carlos Hugo across the country. The operation revealed much understanding of the media role in the [[consumer society]], as it exploited common [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] threads and kept feeding the press with new [[Scoop (term)|scoops]] (the prince as a miner in [[Asturias]], at a [[parachute]] course, at [[Sanfermines]]) and taking advantage of charm and youth of the prince's three sisters. The efforts proved fairly successful, as in the tightly [[Censorship|censured]] media the Borbon-Parmas gained sort of nationwide positive recognition.

The greatest scoop came in 1964, when Carlos Hugo married [[princess Irene of the Netherlands]]. At this point, however, the regime propaganda machine was firmly ordered to backtrack. Franco, though personally delighted that the [[House of Orange-Nassau|Dutch royal family]] (one of the harshest critics of his regime) was publicly humiliated by a Spanish royal hopeful, grew increasingly anxious that the popularity of Carlos Hugo might get him cornered when it comes to an inescapable dynastical decision. Despite wide TV coverage across Western Europe the Spanish media played down the event, which marked hard limits of Massó's strategy and got him bitterly disappointed.

In mid-1960s Massó realized that his strategy had failed; moreover, he realized that Leftist phraseology (with ''socialismo'' and ''autogestión'' most prominent catchwords) had divided and debilitated Carlism. In 1965 he loosened his ties with Carlos Hugo by moving from Madrid to [[Pamplona]], where he commenced teaching at the Opus Dei university. As opposition against his influence mounted from the orthodox [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] camp of Valiente and from the militantly Leftist group of [[José María de Zavala y Castella|José de Zavala]], in 1966 Massó ceased as head of Secretaría Política; in 1967 he and some of his collaborators handed their resignations and withdrew from politics. He remained loosely related to Carlism, e.g. shortly before death taking part in historical conference,

==Media pundit and academic==
[[File:IESE Campus.jpg|thumbnail|left|IESE (contemporary view)]]
In late 1960s Massó settled in Pamplona, working as an academic teacher at [[IESE Business School|Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa]] (IESE), a prestigious business school founded by Opus Dei back in 1958. It was there that he completed the Alta Dirección curriculum himself, a holistic leadership program offered to top corporate managers. Finally disillusioned with Opus Dei and with its role during the process of installing Juan Carlos as the future king of Spain, Massó broke with the organization and moved to Barcelona. In his native city he joined [[Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona]] (UAB), where he became ''catedratico'' in Departamento de publicidad at the Facultad de Ciencias de la Información.
[[File:Biblioteca Comunicacio UAB.JPG|thumbnail|UAB library]]
Massó's small booklet ''Estrategia para unas extrañas elecciones'' (1977) earned him local media recognition  and triggered co-operation with ''[[La Vanguardia]]''; he became its key politics and public affairs commentator (until 1984). Massó experienced most of the Spanish [[Transition to democracy (Spain)|transition to democracy]] not as a protagonist but as a witness, periodically having a regular column in the Sunday issue. As a press pundit he was careful to remain within the limits of political science and styled himself as an unbiased scholarly observer, though his hostility to Francoism and support for reforms remained evident. In general opposed to [[sectarian]] politics, he occasionally kept referring to [[Lenin]] as a political authority. His commentary suggested also that Massó sort of put up with the royal function of Juan Carlos and with his role in the Spanish transition. In late 1970s together with his former Carlist collaborator [[José Antonio Parilla]] he engaged in the Nono Art publishing house and co-ordinated work on a popular series ''Breu História de Catalunya'' (1979–81).

==Communication expert==
[[File:Sede La Caixa.png|thumbnail|left|''la Caixa'' brand]]
In mid-1970s Massó co-founded Alas, one of the first media agencies in Spain and became head of its Barcelona branch. About the same time he launched the term "politing", intended as a merger of "politics" and "marketing" and meant as a specialized knowledge (if not a science itself) on the crossroads of [[social sciences]], [[public relations]] and [[politics]]. His work ''Introducción al “politing”. Lanzamiento de un aspirante'' (1976), apart from gaining official prizes (Premio Markedit, Premio Instituto Nacional de Publicidad), generated also significant interest among the academics, politicians and commentators.  The book was formatted as a systematic theoretical lecture on the basics of [[political marketing]], though it contained many explicit and implicit references to the 1957–1967 political experiences of the author. Relative success of launching Carlos Hugo became one of Masso's key credentials as a scholar in public relations and as a businessman running commercial (he claims authorship of [[La Caixa]] brand) and social (e.g. cancer awareness) media campaigns. He followed with another book, ''De la magia a la artesanía: el politing del cambio español''  (1980), becoming a nationwide recognised scholar and giving courses organised by [[Sociedad Española de Anunciantes]], I[[nstituto Nacional de Publicidad]] or [[Escuela Oficial de Radio y Television]].
[[File:Alblog5.png|thumbnail|communication model (sample)]]
In the 1990s Massó switched his focus to media with ''El exito de la cultura light: Anuncios y noticias'' (1993) and ''Noticias frente a hechos: Entender la realidad despues de leer los periodicos'' (1997). Later on he broadened his interest into the wider realm of public communication, focusing on combined multidimensional holistic forms and channels of information exchange named "integral communication". He co-founded the Barcelona-based [[Institut de Comunicació Integral]], an independent college specializing in [[marketing]], [[Brand|brand communications]] and [[public relations]], and became its president. ICOMI turned out to be a commercial (though not necessarily scientific) success and became a fashionable educational institute (incorporated into [[Abat Oliba CEU University|Universidad Abad Oliva CEU]] in 2003). During the last decade Massó published successive books on culture, communications and politics: ''Otro rey para España: crónica del lanzamiento y fracaso de Carlos Hugo'' (2004), ''Los últimos días de la Telecracia'' (with Enrique Nebot, 2009), ''Nacimiento y muerte de las marcas'' (with Joaquín García-Lavernia Gil, 2010), ''Navegando por el cachondeo de la historia'' (2012) and even a children's book, ''La segunda vida de Don Jos Kintana'' (1999). He maintaied [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] accounts, scarcely active during last years of his life.

==Reception==
[[File:Formal dinner in honour of King Juan Carlos 2 (crop).jpg|thumbnail|180px|left|Juan Carlos de Borbón]]
In the 1990s, looking back on his political past, Massó admitted defeat at the hands of a competitive group of [[Machiavellian]] players coming from the same Opus Dei hotbed (especially [[Laureano López Rodó|López Rodó]]), who outplayed him by dismantling Francoism with technocratic strategy and with Juan Carlos as a better marketed and better designed version of Carlos Hugo. He denied charges that he had implanted Marxism within the Carlist realm; he rather pointed to the Juan Vázquez de Mella heritage, based on ''sociedalismo'' and the concept of [[:es:Democracia orgánica|organic society]].
 
In historiography Massó remains a rather divisive and ambiguous figure, with little agreement as to his role and intentions. Some historians (Payne, Bartyzel) maintain that he unleashed forces which either destroyed Carlism or turned it into its own [[antinomy]]. Some historians (Clemente, Martorell Pérez) claim that he helped to safeguard Carlist identity or at least contributed to emphasizing genuine Carlism and sidetracking its accidental threads.  Some historians (MacClancy, Caspistegui Gorasurreta) suggest that he commenced the process of redirecting Carlism from traditional and orthodox path to a new formula. Some historians (Perez-Nievas) do not consider Massó worth mentioning and present de Zavala as the leader of the group.

According to one group of studies (Martorell Pérez, MacClancy) Massó was primarily motivated by dynastical objectives, according to another (Clemente) he was not a monarchist at all. There are scholars (Bartyzel) who consider him a radical Leftist approximate to Marxism, there are others (Clemente) who consider him a "neocapitalist technocrat". Certain works (Martorell Pérez, in line with Masso's own later narration) present Carlos Hugo as a politician invented and created by Massó, certain works (Clemente) present Massó as Carlos Hugo's sidekick, useful at one political phase and to be replaced at the following one. Massó's departure from politics is explained by failure of his policy (Martorell Pérez), by Carlos Hugo's decision to replace him (Clemente), by his alleged falling in love with one of Carlos Hugo's sisters (Fraga), by pressure from Opus Dei (Lavardín), by combined efforts of enemies from the Right like Valiente and from the Left like de Zavala (Pérez Madrigal) or by pure greed (Zabala).
[[File:Carlism, Concepts, Context and Time.jpg|thumbnail|Carlist concepts over time]]
One thing most historians agree on is that Massó proved instrumental in dismantling Traditionalist Carlism (though they do not agree whether a non-Traditionalist Carlism can actually exist). None of the currently operating Carlist grouplets admits deference to Massó. Traditionalists ([[Carloctavismo|carloctavistas]], [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma|sixtinos]], [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista|CTC]]) tend to view him as a turncoat, the progressives ([[Carlist Party (1970)|Partido Carlista]], [[Carlos, Duke of Parma|javierocarlistas]]) tend to view him as merely a former [[:ru:Попутчик (жаргон)|fellow-traveller]].

Before death he dedicated his future corpse to scientific research, and hence there was no funeral arranged and there is no grave. His death was acknowledged on few websites related to Partido Carlista, though not by major Spanish media.

The '''right to the city''' is an idea and a slogan that was first proposed by [[Henri Lefebvre]] in his 1968 book ''Le Droit à la ville'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Purcell | first = Mark | title = Excavating Lefebvre: The right to the city and its urban politics of the inhabitant | journal = [[GeoJournal]], special issue: Social Transformation, Citizenship, and the Right to the City | volume = 58 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 99–108 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/B:GEJO.0000010829.62237.8f | jstor = 41147756 | date = October 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:GEJO.0000010829.62237.8f3 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://faculty.washington.edu/mpurcell/geojournal.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Unger | first = Knut | title =  "Right to the City" as a response to the crisis: "Convergence" or divergence of urban social movements? | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120310001029/http://www.reclaiming-spaces.org/crisis/archives/266 | archive-date = 10 March 2012 | url = http://www.reclaiming-spaces.org/crisis/archives/266 | publisher = Reclaiming Spaces | date = 14 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that has been reclaimed more recently by social movements, thinkers and several progressive local authorities alike as a call to action to reclaim the city as a co-created space—a place for life detached from the growing effects that [[commodification]] and [[capitalism]] has had over social interaction and the rise of [[Spatial inequality|spatial inequalities]] in worldwide cities throughout the last two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newleftreview.org/II/53/david-harvey-the-right-to-the-city|title=David Harvey: The Right to the City. New Left Review 53, September-October 2008.|website=newleftreview.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first inception of the concept, Lefevbre paid specific emphasis on the effects that capitalism had over “the city”, whereas urban life was downgraded into a commodity, social interaction became increasingly uprooted and urban space and governance were turned into exclusive goods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://capitanswing.com/libros/el-derecho-a-la-ciudad/|title=El derecho a la ciudad  {{!}}  Capitán Swing|last=Swing|first=Capitán|website=capitanswing.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to this trend, Lefevbre called to “''rescue the citizen as main element and protagonist of the city that he himself had built''” and to transform urban space into “''a meeting point for building collective life''”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to the inequalities produced by the rapid increase of world urban population in most regions of the world, the concept of the right to the city has been recalled on several occasions since the publication of Lefevbre’s book as a call to action by social movements and grassroots organizations. In their appeal for “their right to the city”, local mobilizations around the world usually refer to their struggle for social justice and a dignified access to urban life face to growing urban inequalities (especially in large metropolitan concepts). The right to the city has had a particular influence in [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]], where social movements have particularly appealed to the concept in their actions and promoted local instruments for advancing its concrete understanding in terms of policy-making at the local and even national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/reports/competitive-metropolises-and-prospects-spatial-justice|title=Competitive Metropolises and the Prospects for Spatial Justice {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rioonwatch.org/?p=11668|title=What Is The Right to the City? {{!}} RioOnWatch|website=www.rioonwatch.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good proof on how the notion of right to the city has gained international recognition in the last years could be seen in the [[United Nations]] [[Habitat III]] process, and how the [[New Urban Agenda]] (2016) recognized the concept as the vision of “cities for all”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/20/habitat-3-right-city-concrete-policies-ada-colau|title=After Habitat III: a stronger urban future must be based on the right to the city|last=Colau|first=Ada|date=2016-10-20|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing popularity of the concept has nonetheless raised some criticism and concerns on how the original vision of Henri Lefevbre could be reduced to a “citizenship vision”, focused on the mere implementation of social and economic rights in the city leaving aside its transformatory nature and the concept of social conflict behind the original concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/03/16/seres_urbanos/1521194122_492095.html|title=Elogio y rescate de Henri Lefebvre|last=Delgado|first=Manuel|date=2018-03-19|work=El País|access-date=2018-06-14|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Gorgens | first1 = Tristan | last2 = van Donk | first2 = Mirjam | title = From basic needs towards socio-spatial transformation: coming to grips with the 'Right to the City' for the urban poor in South Africa | url = http://isandla.org.za/publications/152/ | website = isandla.org.za | publisher = The Isandla Institute | date = 2011 }} [http://isandla.org.za/download/assets/gorgens_and_van_donk_isandla_institute_acc-cubes_conference_paper.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcelo Lopes de Souza]] has for instance argued that as the right to the city has become "''fashionable these days''", "''the price of this has often been the trivialisation and corruption of Lefebvre's concept''"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lopes de Souza | first = Marcelo | title = Which right to which city?

==Overview==
Lefebvre summarizes the idea as a "demand...[for] a transformed and renewed access to urban life".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lefebvre | first = Henri | author-link = Henri Lefebvre | contribution = The right to the city | editor-last1 = Kofman | editor-first1 = Eleonore | editor-last2 = Lebas | editor-first2 = Elizabeth | title = Writings on cities | page = 158 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]] | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780631191889 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Attoh | first = Kafui | title = What ''kind'' of right is the right to the city? | journal = [[Progress in Human Geography]] | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 669–685 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0309132510394706 | date = October 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0309132510394706 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] described it as follows:
{{quote|The right to the city is far more than the individual liberty to access urban resources: it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city. It is, moreover, a common rather than an individual right since this transformation inevitably depends upon the exercise of a collective power to reshape the processes of urbanization. The freedom to make and remake our cities and ourselves is, I want to argue, one of the most precious yet most neglected of our human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Harvey | first = David | authorlink = David Harvey (geographer) | title = The right to the city | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 53 | pages = 23–40 | publisher = New Left Review | date = September–October 2008 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/53/david-harvey-the-right-to-the-city | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A number of popular movements, such as the shack dwellers' movement [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Abahlali_3 | title = S’bu Zikode &amp; Richard Pithouse debating Pallo Jordan on the Record of the ANC – Oslo, 22 November 2012 | url = http://abahlali.org/node/9405/ | website = abahlali.org | publisher = [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] | date = 17 January 2013 }} (Campaigns and Statements on ''The Right to the City''.)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Right to the City Alliance]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Leavitt | first1 = Jackie | last2 = Roshan Samara | first2 = Tony | last3 = Brady | first3 = Marnie | title = The Right to the City Alliance: time to democratize urban governance (blog) | url = http://www.plannersnetwork.org/publications/2009_fall/leavitt_samara_brady.html | publisher = Progressive Planning, Planners Network | date = Fall 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100429105813/http://www.plannersnetwork.org/publications/2009_fall/leavitt_samara_brady.html | archivedate = 2010-04-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recht auf Stadt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title =  Congress theses on ''The Right to the City'' | url = http://wiki.rechtaufstadt.net/index.php/Congress_2011/Theses_to_the_Congress | website = wiki.rechtaufstadt.net | publisher = Recht Auf Stadt | date = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a network of squatters, tenants and artists in [[Hamburg]], and various movements in Asia and Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mayer | first = Margit | contribution = The "right to the city" in urban social movements | editor-last1 = Brenner | editor-first1 = Neil | editor-last2 = Marcuse | editor-first2 = Peter | editor-last3 = Mayer | editor-first3 = Margit | title = Cities for people not for profit: critical urban theory &amp; the right to the city | pages = 63–85 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780415601771 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; have incorporated the idea of the right to the city into their struggles.

In Brazil the 2001 [[City Statute]] wrote the Right to the City into federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Implementing the Right to the City in Brazil | url = http://sustainablecitiescollective.com/polis-blog/30417/implementing-right-city-brazil | website = sustainablecitiescollective.com | publisher = Sustainable Cities Collective | date = 14 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, scholars have proposed a 'Digital Right to the City',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Joe Shaw and Mark Graham | title = Our Digital Rights to the City | url = http://meatspacepress.org/ | website = meatspacepress.org | publisher = Meatspace Press | date = 15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foth|first1=Marcus|last2=Brynskov|first2=Martin|last3=Ojala|first3=Timo|title=Citizen's Right to the Digital City: Urban Interfaces, Activism, and Placemaking|date=2015|publisher=Springer|location=Singapore|isbn=9789812879172|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/78107/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involves thinking about the city as not just bricks and mortar, but also digital code and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shaw | first1 = Joe | last2 = Graham | first2 = Mark | title = An Informational Right to the City?

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Roland Barthes was born on 12 November in the town of [[Cherbourg]] in [[Normandy]]. His father, naval officer Louis Barthes, was killed in a battle during [[World War I]] in the [[North Sea]] before Barthes' first birthday. His mother, Henriette Barthes, and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of Urt and the city of [[Bayonne]]. When Barthes was eleven, his family moved to [[Paris]], though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life.

=== Student years ===
Barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he earned a ''[[Licentiate (degree)#France|licence]]'' in classical literature. He was plagued by ill health throughout this period, suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which often had to be treated in the isolation of [[sanatorium|sanatoria]].&lt;ref name=indep&gt;{{cite news|title=ROLAND BARTHES: A Biography by Louis-Jean Calvet|newspaper=The Independent|author=Ben Rogers|date=8 January 1995|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/death-of-the-author-roland-barthes-a-biography-by-louisjean-calvet-trs-sarah-wykes-polity-press-16325-1567120.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His repeated physical breakdowns disrupted his academic career, affecting his studies and his ability to take qualifying examinations. They also exempted him from military service during [[World War II]].

His life from 1939 to 1948 was largely spent obtaining a ''[[Licentiate (degree)#France|licence]]'' in grammar and [[philology]], publishing his first papers, taking part in a medical study, and continuing to struggle with his health. He received a ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] by thesis) from the [[University of Paris]] in 1941 for his work in [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Schrift, ''Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes and Thinkers'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Feb 4, 2009, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early academic career ===
In 1948, he returned to purely academic work, gaining numerous short-term positions at institutes in [[France]], [[Romania]], and [[Egypt]]. During this time, he contributed to the leftist Parisian paper ''Combat'', out of which grew his first full-length work, ''[[Writing Degree Zero]]'' (1953).

In 1952, Barthes settled at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]], where he studied [[lexicology]] and [[sociology]]. During his seven-year period there, he began to write a popular series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine ''Les Lettres Nouvelles'', in which he dismantled myths of [[popular culture]] (gathered in the ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' collection that was published in 1957). Consisting of fifty-four short essays, mostly written between 1954–1956, ''Mythologies'' were acute reflections of French popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huppatz|first=D.J.|year=2011|title=Roland Barthes, Mythologies|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=3|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing little English, Barthes taught at [[Middlebury College]] in 1957 and befriended the future English translator of much of his work, [[Richard Howard]], that summer in New York City.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Richard Howard.

=== Rise to prominence ===
Barthes spent the early 1960s exploring the fields of [[semiology]] and [[structuralism]], chairing various faculty positions around France, and continuing to produce more full-length studies. Many of his works challenged traditional academic views of [[literary criticism]] and of renowned figures of literature. His unorthodox thinking led to a conflict with a well-known Sorbonne professor of literature, [[Raymond Picard]], who attacked the French [[New Criticism]] (a label that he inaccurately applied to Barthes) for its obscurity and lack of respect towards France's literary roots. Barthes' rebuttal in ''Criticism and Truth'' (1966) accused the old, [[bourgeois]] criticism of a lack of concern with the finer points of language and of selective ignorance towards challenging theories, such as [[Marxism]].

By the late 1960s, Barthes had established a reputation for himself. He traveled to the [[United States|US]] and [[Japan]], delivering a presentation at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. During this time, he wrote his best-known work{{According to whom|date=August 2018}}, the 1967 essay "[[Death of the author|The Death of the Author]]," which, in light of the growing influence of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]], would prove to be a transitional piece in its investigation of the logical ends of [[Structuralism|structuralist]] thought.

=== Mature critical work ===
Barthes continued to contribute with [[Philippe Sollers]] to the [[avant-garde]] literary magazine ''[[Tel Quel]]'', which was developing similar kinds of theoretical inquiry to that pursued in Barthes' writings. In 1970, Barthes produced what many consider to be his most prodigious work,{{Who|date=September 2010}} the dense, critical reading of [[Balzac]]'s ''[[Sarrasine]]'' entitled ''[[S/Z]]''. Throughout the 1970s, Barthes continued to develop his literary criticism; he developed new ideals of [[textualism|textuality]] and novelistic neutrality. In 1971, he served as visiting professor at the [[University of Geneva]].

In 1975 he wrote an autobiography titled ''Roland Barthes'' and in 1977 he was elected to the chair of Sémiologie Littéraire at the [[Collège de France]]. In the same year, his mother, Henriette Barthes, to whom he had been devoted, died, aged 85. They had lived together for 60 years. The loss of the woman who had raised and cared for him was a serious blow to Barthes. His last major work, ''[[Camera Lucida (book)|Camera Lucida]]'', is partly an essay about the nature of [[photography]] and partly a meditation on photographs of his mother. The book contains many reproductions of photographs, though none of them are of Henriette.

=== Death ===
On 25 February 1980, Roland Barthes was knocked down by a laundry van while walking home through the streets of Paris. One month later, on March 26,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1980/03/28/le-plaisir-des-sens_2814902_1819218.html?xtmc=roland_barthes&amp;xtcr=436|title=Le plaisir des sens|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; he died from the chest injuries he sustained in that accident.&lt;ref name="wash"&gt;{{cite news|title=Roland Barthes, French Writer, dies at 64|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=27 March 1980|author=J. Y. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings and ideas==

===Early thought===
Barthes' earliest ideas reacted to the trend of [[existentialist]] philosophy that was prominent in France during the 1940s, specifically to the figurehead of existentialism, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Sartre's ''[[What Is Literature?]]'' (1947) expresses a disenchantment both with established forms of writing and more experimental, [[avant-garde]] forms, which he feels alienate readers. Barthes’ response was to try to discover that which may be considered unique and original in writing. In ''Writing Degree Zero'' (1953), Barthes argues that conventions inform both language and style, rendering neither purely creative. Instead, form, or what Barthes calls "writing" (the specific way an individual chooses to manipulate conventions of style for a desired effect), is the unique and creative act. A writer's form is vulnerable to becoming a convention, however, once it has been made available to the public. This means that creativity is an ongoing process of continual change and reaction.

In ''Michelet'', a critical analysis of the French historian [[Jules Michelet]], Barthes developed these notions, applying them to a broader range of fields. He argued that Michelet's views of history and society are obviously flawed. In studying his writings, he continued, one should not seek to learn from Michelet's claims; rather, one should maintain a critical distance and learn from his errors, since understanding how and why his thinking is flawed will show more about his period of history than his own observations. Similarly, Barthes felt that [[avant-garde]] writing should be praised for its maintenance of just such a distance between its audience and itself. In presenting an obvious artificiality rather than making claims to great subjective truths, Barthes argued, avant-garde writers ensure that their audiences maintain an objective perspective. In this sense, Barthes believed that art should be critical and should interrogate the world, rather than seek to explain it, as Michelet had done.

===Semiotics and myth===
Barthes' many monthly contributions, collected in his ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' (1957), frequently interrogated specific cultural materials in order to expose how [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society asserted its values through them. For example, the portrayal of wine in French society as a robust and healthy habit is a bourgeois ideal that is contradicted by certain realities (i.e., that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating). He found [[semiotics]], the study of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], useful in these interrogations. Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were "second-order signs," or "[[connotation (semiotics)|connotation]]s." A picture of a full, dark bottle is a [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]] that relates to a specific signified: a fermented, alcoholic beverage. However, the bourgeoisie relate it to a new signified: the idea of healthy, robust, relaxing experience. Motivations for such manipulations vary, from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the [[status quo]]. These insights brought Barthes in line with similar Marxist theory. Barthes used the term "myth" while analyzing the popular, consumer culture of post-war France in order to reveal that "objects were organized into meaningful relationships via narratives that expressed collective cultural values."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In ''The Fashion System'' Barthes showed how this adulteration of signs could easily be translated into words. In this work he explained how in the fashion world any word could be loaded with idealistic bourgeois emphasis. Thus, if popular fashion says that a ‘blouse’ is ideal for a certain situation or ensemble, this idea is immediately naturalized and accepted as truth, even though the actual sign could just as easily be interchangeable with ‘skirt’, ‘vest’ or any number of combinations. In the end Barthes' ''Mythologies'' became absorbed into bourgeois culture, as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon, being interested in his control over his readership. This turn of events caused him to question the overall utility of demystifying culture for the masses, thinking it might be a fruitless attempt, and drove him deeper in his search for individualistic meaning in art.

===Structuralism and its limits===
As Barthes' work with [[structuralism]] began to flourish around the time of his debates with Picard, his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing, which he felt was overlooked by old criticism. Barthes' "Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.uv.es/fores/Barthes_Structural_Narrative.pdf|title= An Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative|website=uv.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; is concerned with examining the correspondence between the structure of a sentence and that of a larger narrative, thus allowing narrative to be viewed along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] lines. Barthes split this work into three hierarchical levels: ‘functions’, ‘actions’ and ‘narrative’. ‘Functions’ are the elementary pieces of a work, such as a single descriptive word that can be used to identify a character. That character would be an ‘action’, and consequently one of the elements that make up the narrative. Barthes was able to use these distinctions to evaluate how certain key ‘functions’ work in forming characters. For example, key words like ‘dark’, ‘mysterious’ and ‘odd’, when integrated together, formulate a specific kind of character or ‘action’. By breaking down the work into such fundamental distinctions Barthes was able to judge the degree of realism given functions have in forming their actions and consequently with what authenticity a narrative can be said to reflect on reality. Thus, his structuralist theorizing became another exercise in his ongoing attempts to dissect and expose the misleading mechanisms of [[bourgeois]] culture.

While Barthes found [[structuralism]] to be a useful tool and believed that discourse of literature could be formalized, he did not believe it could become a strict scientific endeavour. In the late 1960s, radical movements were taking place in literary criticism. The [[post-structuralist]] movement and the [[deconstruction]]ism of [[Jacques Derrida]] were testing the bounds of the structuralist theory that Barthes' work exemplified. [[Derrida]] identified the flaw of structuralism as its reliance on a transcendental signifier; a symbol of constant, universal meaning would be essential as an orienting point in such a closed off system. This is to say that without some regular standard of measurement, a system of criticism that references nothing outside of the actual work itself could never prove useful. But since there are no symbols of constant and universal significance, the entire premise of structuralism as a means of evaluating writing (or anything) is hollow.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Transition===
Such thought led Barthes to consider the limitations not just of signs and symbols, but also of Western culture's dependency on beliefs of constancy and ultimate standards. He travelled to [[Japan]] in 1966 where he wrote ''Empire of Signs'' (published in 1970), a meditation on Japanese culture's contentment in the absence of a search for a transcendental signifier. He notes that in Japan there is no emphasis on a great focus point by which to judge all other standards, describing the centre of [[Tokyo]], the Emperor's Palace, as not a great overbearing entity, but a silent and nondescript presence, avoided and unconsidered. As such, Barthes reflects on the ability of signs in Japan to exist for their own merit, retaining only the [[Meaning (semiotics)|significance]] naturally imbued by their signifiers. Such a society contrasts greatly to the one he dissected in ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', which was revealed to be always asserting a greater, more complex significance on top of the natural one.

In the wake of this trip Barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work, the essay "[[The Death of the Author]]" (1968). Barthes saw the notion of the author, or authorial authority, in the criticism of literary text as the forced projection of an ultimate meaning of the text. By imagining an ultimate intended meaning of a piece of literature one could infer an ultimate explanation for it. But Barthes points out that the great proliferation of meaning in language and the unknowable state of the author's mind makes any such ultimate realization impossible. As such, the whole notion of the ‘knowable text’ acts as little more than another delusion of Western [[bourgeois]] culture. Indeed, the idea of giving a book or poem an ultimate end coincides with the notion of making it consumable, something that can be used up and replaced in a capitalist market. "The Death of the Author" is considered to be a [[post-structuralist]] work,&lt;ref&gt;Jay Clayton, Eric Rothstein, ''Influence and Intertextuality in Literary History'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1991, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; since it moves past the conventions of trying to quantify literature, but others see it as more of a transitional phase for Barthes in his continuing effort to find significance in culture outside of the [[bourgeois]] norms {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. Indeed, the notion of the author being irrelevant was already a factor of structuralist thinking.

===Textuality and ''S/Z''===
Since Barthes contends that there can be no originating anchor of meaning in the possible intentions of the author, he considers what other sources of meaning or significance can be found in literature. He concludes that since meaning can’t come from the author, it must be actively created by the reader through a process of textual analysis. In his ''[[S/Z]]'' (1970), Barthes applies this notion in an analysis of a short story by Balzac called ''[[Sarrasine]]''. The end result was a reading that established [[five major codes]] for determining various kinds of significance, with numerous lexias throughout the text – a "lexia" here being defined as a unit of the text chosen arbitrarily (to remain methodologically unbiased as possible) for further analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=S/V|last=Barthes|first=Roland|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1974|isbn=0631176071|location=New York|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codes led him to define the story as having a capacity for plurality of meaning, limited by its dependence upon strictly sequential elements (such as a definite timeline that has to be followed by the reader and thus restricts their freedom of analysis). From this project Barthes concludes that an ideal text is one that is reversible, or open to the greatest variety of independent interpretations and not restrictive in meaning. A text can be reversible by avoiding the restrictive devices that ''[[Sarrasine]]'' suffered from such as strict timelines and exact definitions of events. He describes this as the difference between the writerly text, in which the reader is active in a creative process, and a readerly text in which they are restricted to just reading. The project helped Barthes identify what it was he sought in literature: an openness for interpretation.

===Neutral and novelistic writing===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
In the late 1970s Barthes was increasingly concerned with the conflict of two types of language: that of popular culture, which he saw as limiting and pigeonholing in its titles and descriptions, and neutral, which he saw as open and noncommittal. He called these two conflicting modes the [[Doxa]] and the [[paradox|Para-doxa]]. While Barthes had shared sympathies with Marxist thought in the past (or at least parallel criticisms), he felt that, despite its anti-ideological stance, Marxist theory was just as guilty of using violent language with assertive meanings, as was [[bourgeois]] literature. In this way they were both Doxa and both culturally assimilating. As a reaction to this he wrote ''[[The Pleasure of the Text]]'' (1975), a study that focused on a subject matter he felt was equally outside the realm of both conservative society and militant leftist thinking: [[hedonism]]. By writing about a subject that was rejected by both social extremes of thought, Barthes felt he could avoid the dangers of the limiting language of the Doxa. The theory he developed out of this focus claimed that, while reading for pleasure is a kind of social act, through which the reader exposes him/herself to the ideas of the writer, the final [[catharsis|cathartic]] climax of this pleasurable reading, which he termed the bliss in reading or [[jouissance]], is a point in which one becomes lost within the text. This loss of self within the text or immersion in the text, signifies a final impact of reading that is experienced outside the social realm and free from the influence of culturally associative language and is thus neutral with regard to social progress.

Despite this newest theory of reading, Barthes remained concerned with the difficulty of achieving truly neutral writing, which required an avoidance of any labels that might carry an implied meaning or identity towards a given object. Even carefully crafted neutral writing could be taken in an assertive context through the incidental use of a word with a loaded social context. Barthes felt his past works, like ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', had suffered from this. He became interested in finding the best method for creating neutral writing, and he decided to try to create a novelistic form of rhetoric that would not seek to impose its meaning on the reader. One product of this endeavor was ''[[A Lover's Discourse: Fragments]]'' in 1977, in which he presents the fictionalized reflections of a lover seeking to identify and be identified by an anonymous amorous other. The unrequited lover's search for signs by which to show and receive love makes evident illusory myths involved in such a pursuit. The lover's attempts to assert himself into a false, ideal reality is involved in a delusion that exposes the contradictory logic inherent in such a search. Yet at the same time the novelistic character is a sympathetic one, and is thus open not just to criticism but also understanding from the reader. The end result is one that challenges the reader's views of social constructs of love, without trying to assert any definitive theory of meaning.

===Photography and Henriette Barthes===
Throughout his career, Barthes had an interest in photography and its potential to communicate actual events. Many of his monthly myth articles in the 50s had attempted to show how a photographic image could represent implied meanings and thus be used by bourgeois culture to infer 'naturalistic truths'. But he still considered the photograph to have a unique potential for presenting a completely real representation of the world. When his mother, Henriette Barthes, died in 1977 he began writing ''[[Camera Lucida (book)|Camera Lucida]]'' as an attempt to explain the unique significance a picture of her as a child carried for him. Reflecting on the relationship between the obvious symbolic meaning of a photograph (which he called the studium) and that which is purely personal and dependent on the individual, that which ‘pierces the viewer’ (which he called the punctum), Barthes was troubled by the fact that such distinctions collapse when personal significance is communicated to others and can have its symbolic logic rationalized. Barthes found the solution to this fine line of personal meaning in the form of his mother's picture. Barthes explained that a picture creates a falseness in the illusion of ‘what is’, where ‘what was’ would be a more accurate description. As had been made physical through Henriette Barthes' death, her childhood photograph is evidence of ‘what has ceased to be’. Instead of making reality solid, it reminds us of the world's ever changing nature. Because of this there is something uniquely personal contained in the photograph of Barthes' mother that cannot be removed from his subjective state: the recurrent feeling of loss experienced whenever he looks at it. As one of his final works before his death, ''Camera Lucida'' was both an ongoing reflection on the complicated relations between subjectivity, meaning and cultural society as well as a touching dedication to his mother and description of the depth of his grief.

===Posthumous publications===
A posthumous collection of essays was published in 1987 by [[François Wahl]], ''Incidents''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Culler]], ''Barthes: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford and New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1983, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; It contains fragments from his journals: his ''Soirées de Paris'' (a 1979 extract from his erotic diary of life in Paris); an earlier diary he kept (his erotic encounters with boys in Morocco); and ''Light of the Sud Ouest'' (his childhood memories of rural French life). In November 2007, [[Yale University Press]] published a new translation into English (by Richard Howard) of Barthes' little known work ''What is Sport''. This work bears a considerable resemblance to ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' and was originally commissioned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] as the text for a documentary film directed by [[Hubert Aquin]].

In February 2009, [[Éditions du Seuil]] published ''Journal de deuil'' (Journal of Mourning), based on Barthes' files written from 26 November 1977 (the day following his mother's death) up to 15 September 1979, intimate notes on his terrible loss:
{{quote|The (awesome but not painful) idea that she had not been everything to me. Otherwise I would never have written a work. Since my taking care of her for six months long, she actually had become everything for me, and I totally forgot of ever have written anything at all. I was nothing more than hopelessly hers. Before that she had made herself transparent so that I could write.... Mixing-up of roles. For months long I had been her mother. I felt like I had lost a daughter.}}

He grieved his mother's death for the rest of his life: "Do not say mourning. It's too psychoanalytic. I'm not in mourning. I'm suffering." and "In the corner of my room where she had been bedridden, where she had died and where I now sleep, in the wall where her headboard had stood against I hanged an icon—not out of faith. And I always put some flowers on a table. I do not wish to travel anymore so that I may stay here and prevent the flowers from withering away."

In 2012 the book ''Travels in China'' was published. It consists of his notes from a three-week trip to China he undertook with a group from the literary journal [[Tel Quel]] in 1974. The experience left him somewhat disappointed, as he found China "not at all exotic, not at all disorienting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Sideways Gaze: Roland Barthes' Travels in China|author=Dora Zhang|journal=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=23 June 2012|url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=714&amp;fulltext=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114183654/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=714&amp;fulltext=1|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Roland Barthes' incisive criticism contributed to the development of theoretical schools such as [[structuralism]], [[semiotics]], and [[post-structuralism]]. While his influence is mainly found in these theoretical fields with which his work brought him into contact, it is also felt in every field concerned with the representation of information and models of communication, including computers, photography, music, and literature. One consequence of Barthes' breadth of focus is that his legacy includes no following of thinkers dedicated to modeling themselves after him. The fact that Barthes’ work was ever adapting and refuting notions of stability and constancy means there is no canon of thought within his theory to model one's thoughts upon, and thus no "Barthesism".

==Key terms==
''Readerly'' and ''writerly'' are terms Barthes employs both to delineate one type of literature from another and to implicitly interrogate ways of reading, like positive or negative habits the modern reader brings into one's experience with the text itself. These terms are most explicitly fleshed out in ''[[S/Z]]'', while the essay "From Work to Text", from ''[[Image—Music—Text]]'' (1977), provides an analogous parallel look at the active–passive and postmodern–modern ways of interacting with a text.

===Readerly text===
A text that makes no requirement of the reader to "write" or "produce" their own meanings. The reader may passively locate "ready-made" meaning. Barthes writes that these sorts of texts are "controlled by the principle of non-contradiction" (156), that is, they do not disturb the "common sense," or "Doxa," of the surrounding culture. The "readerly texts," moreover, "are products [that] make up the enormous mass of our literature" (5). Within this category, there is a spectrum of "replete literature," which comprises "any classic (readerly) texts" that work "like a cupboard where meanings are shelved, stacked, [and] safeguarded" (200).&lt;ref name="S/Z"&gt;Barthes, Roland. S/Z: An Essay. Trans. Richard Miller. New York: Hill and Wang, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writerly text===
A text that aspires to the proper goal of literature and criticism: "... to make the reader no longer a consumer but a producer of the text" (4). Writerly texts and ways of reading constitute, in short, an active rather than passive way of interacting with a culture and its texts. A culture and its texts, Barthes writes, should never be accepted in their given forms and traditions. As opposed to the "readerly texts" as "product," the "writerly text is ourselves writing, before the infinite play of the world is traversed, intersected, stopped, plasticized by some singular system (Ideology, Genus, Criticism) which reduces the plurality of entrances, the opening of networks, the infinity of languages" (5). Thus reading becomes for Barthes "not a parasitical act, the reactive complement of a writing", but rather a "form of work" (10).

===The ''Author'' and the ''scriptor''===
''Author'' and ''scriptor'' are terms Barthes uses to describe different ways of thinking about the creators of texts. "The author" is our traditional concept of the lone genius creating a work of literature or other piece of writing by the powers of his/her original imagination. For Barthes, such a figure is no longer viable. The insights offered by an array of modern thought, including the insights of [[Surrealism]], have rendered the term obsolete. In place of the author, the modern world presents us with a figure Barthes calls the "scriptor," whose only power is to combine pre-existing texts in new ways. Barthes believes that all writing draws on previous texts, norms, and conventions, and that these are the things to which we must turn to understand a text. As a way of asserting the relative unimportance of the writer's biography compared to these textual and generic conventions, Barthes says that the scriptor has no past, but is born with the text. He also argues that, in the absence of the idea of an "author-God" to control the meaning of a work, interpretive horizons are opened up considerably for the active reader. As Barthes puts it, "the death of the author is the birth of the reader."&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland. ''Image—Music—Text''. Essays selected and translated by Stephen Heath. New York: Noonday, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 1964, Barthes wrote "The Last Happy Writer" ("''Le dernier des écrivains heureux''" in ''Essais critiques''), the title of which refers to [[Voltaire]]. In the essay he commented on the problems of the modern thinker after discovering the relativism in thought and philosophy, discrediting previous philosophers who avoided this difficulty. Disagreeing roundly with Barthes' description of Voltaire, Daniel Gordon, the translator and editor of ''[[Candide]]'' (The Bedford Series in History and Culture), wrote that "never has one brilliant writer so thoroughly misunderstood another."{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The sinologist [[Simon Leys]], in a review of Barthes' diary of a trip to China during the [[Cultural Revolution]], disparages Barthes for his seeming indifference to the situation of the Chinese people, and says that Barthes "has contrived—amazingly—to bestow an entirely new dignity upon the age-old activity, so long unjustly disparaged, of saying nothing at great length."&lt;ref&gt;[[Leys, Simon]] ''The Hall of Uselessness: Collected Essays'', New York, New York Review Books, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Barthes' ''[[A Lover's Discourse: Fragments]]'' was the inspiration for the name of 1980s [[new wave music|new wave]] duo [[The Lover Speaks]].

[[Jeffrey Eugenides]]' ''[[The Marriage Plot]]'' draws out excerpts from Barthes' ''A Lover's Discourse: Fragments'' as a way to depict the unique intricacies of love that one of the main characters, Madeleine Hanna, experiences throughout the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.publicbooks.org/fiction/the-euphoria-of-influence-jeffrey-eugenidess-the-marriage-plot |title=The Euphoria of Influence: Jeffrey Eugenides's The Marriage Plot |publisher=Publicbooks.org |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2012-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113065904/http://publicbooks.org/fiction/the-euphoria-of-influence-jeffrey-eugenidess-the-marriage-plot |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Elegy (film)|Elegy]]'', based on [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Dying Animal]]'', the character of Consuela (played by [[Penelope Cruz]]) is first depicted in the film carrying a copy of Barthes' ''[[The Pleasure of the Text]]'' on the campus of the university where she is a student.&lt;ref&gt;Manohla Dargis, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/movies/08eleg.html Extracurricular Lessons for Student and Teacher]," review of ''Elegy'', New York Times, August 8, 2008, accessed on 12-9-2015: Of the character of Consuela, Dargis writes, "She was his student and ripe for the plucking, especially in the film, where she enters clutching Roland Barthes's "Pleasure of the Text" to her lush bosom."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5351">The ''Secretum philosophorum'' was a popular [[Latin language|Latin]] text originating in England c.1300–1350.
Ostensibly a treatise on the Seven [[Liberal arts|Liberal Arts]], it merely uses them as a framework in which to describe and demystify practical tricks, ‘tricks of the trade’ and applied science. 

==Sections==
Prologue (''Iste liber quem per manibus habemus vocatur Secretum Philosophorum.'')

Book I is nominally on ‘[[Grammar]]’ which ‘teaches us to write correctly’ (''Grammatica docet recte scribere et recte loqui''). Explaining that no-one can write correctly without the proper instruments, the subsequent text consists of technical recipes for the materials required ‘for correct writing’, plus some recipes for concealing meanings by the use of [[invisible ink]] and [[cipher]]s. Book I is thus in fact an [[:Category:Art technological sources|artists' recipe book]]. Book I thus includes recipes for [[pigment]]s, tempering, [[adhesive]]s, varnish, writing tablets, artificial [[pumice]] and [[invisible ink]], and for writing on metal by [[etching]]; many of these technical  recipes are unique, rare, variant or unusually early witnesses to practices, or clarify obscure recipes in other treatises; the instructions appear to be for amateur use. Book I then ends with homilies on ‘correct speaking’ (discretion and the dangers of lying), taken from the pseudo-Aristotle ''[[Secretum secretorum]]'', with a note on ‘[[weasel words]]’ for concealing meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archetype.co.uk/ |title=Clarke, M. (2009) “Writing recipes for non-specialists c.1300: The Anglo-Latin Secretum Philosophorum, Glasgow MS Hunterian 110”, in '&amp;#39;Sources and Serendipity: Testimonies of Artists' Practice'&amp;#39; Edited by Erma Hermens and Joyce H Townsend, pp. 50-64 and Plate 18. London: Archetype Publications |publisher=Archetype.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Book II, ‘[[Rhetoric]]’ ‘teaches ornate speech’ (''Rethorica docet ornate loqui''). It collects [[riddle]]s.

Book III, ‘[[Dialectic]]’ ‘teaches to discern between true and false’ (''Dialetica docet discernere verum a falso et ab apparenti vero''). It collects various tricks for deceiving the five [[senses]], with mirrors and conjuring tricks.

Book IV, ‘[[Arithmetic]]’ ‘teaches numbers per se’ (''Arismetrica docet de numero per se''). It rejoices in the multiplication of chains of immense numbers.

Part V, ‘[[Medieval music|Music]]’ ‘teaches the numbers of sound’ (''Musica docet de numero sonoro''). It describes the [[monochord]], and a recipe for [[catgut|gut]] [[String instrument|strings]].

Book VI, ‘[[Geometry]]’ ‘teaches magnitudes, i.e. to measure’ (''Geometria docet de magnitudinibus id est de mensuris quantitatum''). It gives practical tricks for measuring, especially buildings.

Book VII, ‘[[Astrology and astronomy|Astronomy]]’ ‘teaches movements of the heavens and their effects on men’ (''Astronomia docet de magnitudine mobili hoc est de motibus firmamenti et planetarum et eorum effectibus''). It is principally astrology, but includes a very early illustrated treatise on [[hydraulics]].

==Manuscripts, editions and translations==
Nearly 30 [[manuscript]]s of the ''Secretum philosophorum'' survive,&lt;ref&gt;Most of which are listed in Clarke 2009 ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; making it something of a medieval 'bestseller', and [[Lynn Thorndike]] considered the ''Secretum philosophorum''  to have formed part of the general intellectual furniture of most even partially well-read individuals, and urged its publication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/224682 Thorndike, Lynn "Prospectus for a Corpus of Medieval Scientific Literature in Latin" ''Isis'' Vol. 14 No. 2 (Oct. 1930) pp.368-384: p. 379 item 120]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, as yet no complete edition or translation has been published.

Book I: An edition and translation of the recipes for [[scribe]]s and [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminators]], together with a technical commentary, has been published by Clarke (2009),&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; which see for a list of surviving manuscripts.

Book II: Some of the riddles are edited (with suggested solutions) by Galloway (1995).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2864706 Andrew Galloway, The Rhetoric of Riddling in Late-Medieval England: The "Oxford" Riddles, the Secretum philosophorum, and the Riddles in Piers Plowman, ''Speculum'' 70 (1995): 68-105]&lt;/ref&gt;

Book III: An edition, English translation, and commentary has been published by Goulding (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Goulding, Robert. “Deceiving the Senses in the Thirteenth Century: Trickery and Illusion in the Secretum Philosophorum” in ''Magic and the Classical Tradition'', ed. Charles S. F. Burnett and William F. Ryan, Warburg Institute Colloquia 7, London: Warburg Institute and Turin: Nino Aragono Editore (2006), pp. 135-162. &lt;/ref&gt;

Book V: The recipe for [[catgut|gut strings]] has been published by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques Handschin|de}} (1944-5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Handschin |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Handschin |title=Aus der alten Musiktheorie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2178">'''Smelfungus''' is a name given by [[Laurence Sterne]] to [[Tobias Smollett]] as author of a volume of ''[[Travels through France and Italy]],'' for the snarling abuse he heaps on the institutions and customs of the countries he visited. 

The term "[[wikt:smellfungus|smellfungus]]" (pl. "smellfungi") thereafter passed into broader use to describe a grumbling traveller, and might even be applied to a faultfinder in general.&lt;ref&gt;O. M. Brach ed., ''Tobias Smollett, Scotland's First Author'' (2007) pp. 76–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smollett in Europe==
Smollett's 1764 journey to the Continent took place in the wake of a family bereavement, and while he was in poor health—matters which may explain the sharp tone of many of his comments on people, things and places he saw.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 887 and p. 953&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example he described the [[Venus de Medici]] as having "no beauty in the features" and having an attitude which "is awkward and out of character"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in G. Petrie ed., ''Lawrence Sterne: A Sentimental Journey'' (1979) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;—prompting Sterne's remark that "he had fallen foul upon the goddess, and used her worse than a common strumpet".&lt;ref&gt;G. Petrie ed., ''Lawrence Sterne: A Sentimental Journey'' (1979) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; 

Revisionists have argued however that the "Smollett" in the ''Travels'' book is a character Smollett intentionally created, rather than him speaking in his own voice as Sterne (facetiously) implies.&lt;ref&gt;O. M. Brach ed., ''Tobias Smollett, Scotland's First Author'' (2007) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlyle's usage==

In the 19th century Smelfungus was adopted by [[Thomas Carlyle]] as a pen-name when he had any seriously severe criticisms to offer on things, particularly those that have gone or are going to the bad. Patrick Proctor Alexander also used the name in his book ''Mill and Carlyle'', which contrasted Carlyle's views with those of [[John Stuart Mill]]. Proctor's ''Occasional Discourse on Sauertieg by Smelfungus'' attacks Carlyle's more brutal ideas.

Vastu shastra (''{{IAST|vāstu śāstra}}'') is a traditional Hindu system of architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quack|first1=Johannes|title=Disenchanting India: Organized Rationalism and Criticism of Religion in India|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=119|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TNbxUwhS5RUC&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which literally translates to "science of architecture."&lt;ref name="narlikar_CUP"/&gt; These are texts found on the Indian subcontinent that describe principles of design, layout, measurements, ground preparation, space arrangement, and spatial geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vastukarta.com/principles_of_vastu.php|title=GOLDEN PRINCIPLES OF VASTU SHASTRA Vastukarta|website=www.vastukarta.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pka/&gt; Vastu Shastras incorporate traditional Hindu and in some cases Buddhist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vastushastra|first=Vijaya |last=Kumar|publisher=New Dawn/Sterling|year=2002|isbn=978-81-207-2199-9|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs are intended to integrate architecture with nature, the relative functions of various parts of the structure, and ancient beliefs utilizing geometric patterns ([[yantra]]), symmetry, and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|directional]] alignments.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;

Vastu Shastra are the textual part of ''Vastu Vidya'', the latter being the broader knowledge about architecture and design theories from ancient India.&lt;ref name=vsgt1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|date=2004|isbn=978-1861891372|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vastu Vidya knowledge is a collection of ideas and concepts, with or without the support of layout diagrams, that are not rigid. Rather, these ideas and concepts are models for the organization of space and form within a building or collection of buildings, based on their functions in relation to each other, their usage and to the overall fabric of the Vastu.&lt;ref name=vsgt1/&gt; Ancient Vastu Shastra principles include those for the design of ''Mandir'' ([[Hindu temple]]s),&lt;ref&gt;George Michell (1988), The Hindu Temple: An Introduction to Its Meaning and Forms, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226532301}}, pp 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; and the principles for the design and layout of houses, towns, cities, gardens, roads, water works, shops and other public areas.&lt;ref name=pka/&gt;&lt;ref name="GD Vasudev 2001 pp 74-92"&gt;GD Vasudev (2001), Vastu, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|81-208-1605-6}}, pp 74-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherri Silverman 2007"&gt;Sherri Silverman (2007), Vastu: Transcendental Home Design in Harmony with Nature, Gibbs Smith, Utah, {{ISBN|978-1423601326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The Sanskrit word ''vastu'' means a dwelling or house with a corresponding plot of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Latest Vastu Shastra (Some Secrets)|first=Jagdish|last= Gautum|page=17|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=2006|isbn=978-81-7017-449-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[vrddhi]], ''vāstu'', takes the meaning of "the site or foundation of a house, site, ground, building or dwelling-place, habitation, homestead, house". The underlying root is ''vas'' "to dwell, live, stay, reside".&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams (1899).&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[shastra]] may loosely be translated as  "doctrine, teaching".

''Vastu-Sastras'' (literally, science of dwelling) are ancient Sanskrit manuals of architecture. These contain Vastu-Vidya (literally, knowledge of dwelling).&lt;ref name=bbdutt&gt;BB Dutt (1925), {{Google books|J3jEJFNxdy4C|Town planning in Ancient India}}, {{ISBN|978-81-8205-487-5}}; See critical review by LD Barnett, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol 4, Issue 2, June 1926, pp 391&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Proposals tracing potential links of the principles of composition in ''Vastu Shastra'' and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] have been made, but [[Kapila Vatsyayan]] is reluctant to speculate on such links given the Indus Valley script remains undeciphered.&lt;ref name="Singer1991p117"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milton Singer|title=Semiotics of Cities, Selves, and Cultures: Explorations in Semiotic Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9G6h1EfTTwC&amp;pg=PA117 |year=1991|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-085775-7|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chakrabarti, Vastu Vidya is as old the Vedic period and linked to the ritual architecture.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2013p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vibhuti Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory and Practice: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgmakH37M0UC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77882-7|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael W. Meister]], the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' contains verses with mystic cosmogony which provide a paradigm for cosmic planning, but they did not represent architecture nor a developed practice.&lt;ref name="Buhnemann2003p251"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gudrun Bühnemann|title=Mandalas and Yantras in the Hindu Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQf2m8VaC_oC&amp;pg=PA251 |year=2003|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-12902-2|pages=251–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varahamihira]]'s ''Brihat Samhita'' dated to the sixth century CE, states Meister, is the first known Indian text that describes "something like a ''vastupurusamandala'' to plan cities and buildings".&lt;ref name="Buhnemann2003p251"/&gt; The emergence of Vastu vidya as a specialized field of science is speculated to have occurred significantly before the 1st-century CE.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2013p1"/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Plan of Kandariya Mahadeva temple.jpg|thumb|360px|Ancient India produced many Sanskrit manuals of architecture, called Vastu Sastra. Many of these are about Hindu temple layout (above), design and construction, along with chapters on design principles for houses, villages, towns. The architect and artists (Silpins) were given wide latitude to experiment and express their creativity.&lt;ref name=mmgeometry/&gt;]]
There exist many Vastu-Sastras on the art of building houses, temples, towns and cities. One such Vastu Sastra is by [[Thakkura Pheru]], describing where and how temples should be built.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1976), The Hindu Temple Volume 1 &amp; 2, {{ISBN|81-208-0223-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Hebner (2010), Architecture of the Vastu Sastra - According to Sacred Science, in Science of the Sacred (Editor: David Osborn), {{ISBN|978-0557277247}}, pp 85-92; N Lahiri (1996), Archaeological landscapes and textual images: a study of the sacred geography of late medieval Ballabgarh, World Archaeology, 28(2), pp 244-264&lt;/ref&gt; By 6th century AD, Sanskrit manuals for constructing palatial temples were in circulation in India.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Lewandowski (1984), Buildings and Society: Essays on the Social Development of the Built Environment, edited by Anthony D. King, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0710202345}}, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; Vastu-Sastra manuals included chapters on home construction, town planning,&lt;ref name=bbdutt/&gt; and how efficient villages, towns and kingdoms integrated temples, water bodies and gardens within them to achieve harmony with nature.&lt;ref name="GD Vasudev 2001 pp 74-92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherri Silverman 2007"/&gt; While it is unclear, states Barnett,&lt;ref&gt;LD Barnett, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol 4, Issue 2, June 1926, pp 391&lt;/ref&gt; as to whether these temple and town planning texts were theoretical studies and if or when they were properly implemented in practice, the manuals suggest that town planning and Hindu temples were conceived as ideals of art and integral part of Hindu social and spiritual life.&lt;ref name=bbdutt/&gt;

The ''Silpa Prakasa'' of Odisha, authored by Ramachandra Bhattaraka Kaulachara sometime in ninth or tenth century CE, is another Vastu Sastra.&lt;ref name=aliceboner66&gt;Alice Boner and Sadāśiva Rath Śarmā (1966), {{Google books|itQUAAAAIAAJ|Silpa Prakasa Medieval Orissan Sanskrit Text on Temple Architecture}}, E.J. Brill (Netherlands)&lt;/ref&gt; Silpa Prakasa describes the geometric principles in every aspect of the temple and symbolism such as 16 emotions of human beings carved as 16 types of female figures. These styles were perfected in Hindu temples prevalent in eastern states of India. Other ancient texts found expand these architectural principles, suggesting that different parts of India developed, invented and added their own interpretations. For example, in ''Saurastra'' tradition of temple building found in western states of India, the feminine form, expressions and emotions are depicted in 32 types of ''Nataka-stri'' compared to 16 types described in ''Silpa Prakasa''.&lt;ref name=aliceboner66/&gt; Silpa Prakasa provides brief introduction to 12 types of Hindu temples. Other texts, such as ''Pancaratra Prasada Prasadhana'' compiled by Daniel Smith&lt;ref&gt;H. Daniel Smith (1963), Ed. Pāncarātra prasāda prasādhapam, A Pancaratra Text on Temple-Building, Syracuse: University of Rochester, {{OCLC|68138877}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Silpa Ratnakara compiled by Narmada Sankara&lt;ref&gt;Mahanti and Mahanty (1995 Reprint), Śilpa Ratnākara, Orissa Akademi, {{OCLC|42718271}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide a more extensive list of Hindu temple types.

Ancient Sanskrit manuals for temple construction discovered in Rajasthan, in northwestern region of India, include Sutradhara Mandana’s ''Prasadamandana'' (literally, manual for planning and building a temple) with chapters on town building.&lt;ref&gt;Amita Sinha (1998), Design of Settlements in the Vaastu Shastras, Journal of Cultural Geography, 17(2), pp 27-41, {{doi|10.1080/08873639809478319}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manasara shilpa'' and ''Mayamata'', texts of South Indian origin, estimated to be in circulation by 5th to 7th century AD, is a guidebook on South Indian Vastu design and construction.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tillotson, G. H. R. (1997). Svastika Mansion: A Silpa-Sastra in the 1930s. South Asian Studies, 13(1), pp 87-97&lt;/ref&gt; ''Isanasivagurudeva paddhati'' is another Sanskrit text from the 9th century describing the art of building in India in south and central India.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ganapati Sastri (1920), Īśānaśivagurudeva paddhati, Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, {{OCLC|71801033}}&lt;/ref&gt; In north India, ''Brihat-samhita'' by [[Varāhamihira]] is the widely cited ancient Sanskrit manual from 6th century describing the design and construction of ''Nagara'' style of Hindu temples.&lt;ref name=mmgeometry&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meister |first=Michael W. |author-link=Michael W. Meister |date=1983 |title=Geometry and Measure in Indian Temple Plans: Rectangular Temples |journal=Artibus Asiae |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=266–296 |doi=10.2307/3249613 |jstor=3249613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hgood&gt;Heather Elgood (2000), Hinduism and the religious arts, {{ISBN|978-0304707393}}, Bloomsbury Academic, pp 121-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H Kern (1865), [http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/BrhatSamhitaSanskrit.pdf The Brhat Sanhita of Varaha-mihara], The Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;

These ancient ''Vastu Sastras'', often discuss and describe the principles of Hindu temple design, but do not limit themselves to the design of a Hindu temple.&lt;ref&gt;S Bafna, On the Idea of the Mandala as a Governing Device in Indian Architectural Tradition, Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 59, No. 1 (Mar., 2000), pp. 26-49&lt;/ref&gt; They describe the temple as a holistic part of its community, and lay out various principles and a diversity of alternate designs for home, village and city layout along with the temple, gardens, water bodies and nature.&lt;ref name="Sherri Silverman 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=stellakvolm1&gt;[[Stella Kramrisch]], The Hindu Temple, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0222-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandala types and properties==
[[File:64 grid Manduka design Hindu Temple Floor Plan Vastu Purusa Mandala Ancient Architecture.svg|thumb|220px|The 8x8 (64) grid Manduka Vastu Purusha Mandala layout for [[Hindu Temple]]s. It is one of 32 Vastu Purusha Mandala grid patterns described in Vastu sastras. In this grid structure of symmetry, each concentric layer has significance.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;]]
The central area in all [[mandala]] is the [[Brahmasthana]]. Mandala "circle-circumference" or "completion", is a concentric diagram having spiritual and ritual significance in both Hinduism and Buddhism. The space occupied by it varies in different [[mandala]] – in ''Pitha'' (9) and ''Upapitha'' (25) it occupies one square module, in ''Mahaapitha'' (16), ''Ugrapitha'' (36) and ''Manduka'' (64), four square modules and in ''Sthandila'' (49) and ''Paramasaayika'' (81), nine square modules.&lt;ref name=vcm/&gt; The Pitha is an amplified Prithvimandala in which, according to some texts, the central space is occupied by earth. The Sthandila mandala is used in a concentric manner.&lt;ref name=vcm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700711130|pages=86–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important [[mandala]] is the Manduka/ Chandita Mandala of 64 squares and the Paramasaayika Mandala of 81 squares. The normal position of the Vastu Purusha (head in the northeast, legs in the southwest) is as depicted in the Paramasaayika Mandala. However, in the Manduka Mandala the Vastu Purusha is depicted with the head facing east and the feet facing west. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Vastu direction chakar.jpg|thumb|vastu directional chakara]]
It is believed that every piece of a land or a building has a soul of its own and that soul is known as Vastu Purusha.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockingbaba.com/blog/index.php/2015/07/06/vastu-for-beginners-blog-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

A site of any shape can be divided using the Pada Vinyasa. Sites are known by the number of squares. They range from 1x1 to 32x32 (1024) square sites. Examples of mandalas with the corresponding names of sites include:&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;
* ''Sakala'' (1 square) corresponds to ''Eka-pada'' (single divided site)
* ''Pechaka'' (4 squares) corresponds to ''Dwi-pada'' (two divided site)
* ''Pitha'' (9 squares) corresponds to ''Tri-pada'' (three divided site)
* ''Mahaapitha'' (16 squares) corresponds to ''Chatush-pada'' (four divided site)
* ''Upapitha'' (25 squares) corresponds to ''Pancha-pada'' (five divided site)
* ''Ugrapitha'' (36 squares) corresponds to ''Shashtha-pada'' (six divided site)
* ''Sthandila'' (49 squares) corresponds to ''Sapta-pada'' (seven divided site)
* ''Manduka/ Chandita'' (64 square) corresponds to ''Ashta-pada'' (eight divided site))
* ''Paramasaayika'' (81 squares) corresponds to ''Nava-pada'' (nine divided site)
* ''Aasana'' (100 squares) corresponds to ''Dasa-pada'' (ten divided site)
* ''Bhadrmahasan'' (196 squares) corresponds to ''Chodah-pada'' (14 divided sites)

==Modern adaptations and usage==
[[File:Plan, Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur, Rajasthan.JPG|thumb|Vastu Shastra-inspired plan adapted and evolved by modern architect [[Charles Correa]] in the design of Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur, Rajasthan.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=kpg1/&gt;]]

Vastu sastra represents a body of ancient concepts and knowledge to many modern architects, a guideline but not a rigid code.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt; The square-grid mandala is viewed as a model of organization, not as a ground plan. The ancient Vastu sastra texts describe functional relations and adaptable alternate layouts for various rooms or buildings and utilities, but do not mandate a set compulsory architecture. Sachdev and Tillotson state that the mandala is a guideline, and employing the mandala concept of Vastu sastra does not mean every room or building has to be square.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt; The basic theme is around core elements of central space, peripheral zones, direction with respect to sunlight, and relative functions of the spaces.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;

The pink city [[Jaipur]] in Rajasthan was master planned by Rajput king [[Jai Singh II|Jai Singh]] and built by 1727 CE, in part around Vastu Shilpa Sastra principles.&lt;ref name=vsgt2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|date=2004|isbn=978-1861891372|pages=155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nus1&gt;[http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-07-jantar_mantar.pdf Jantar Mantar &amp; Jaipur - Section II] National University of Singapore, pp. 17-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nus1/&gt; Similarly, modern era projects such as the architect [[Charles Correa]]'s designed [[Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya]] in [[Ahmedabad]], Vidhan Bhavan in [[Bhopal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irena Murray|title=Charles Correa: India's Greatest Architect|date=2011|publisher=RIBA Publishing|isbn=978-1859465172}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jawahar Kala Kendra]] in Jaipur, adapt and apply concepts from the Vastu Shastra Vidya.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc1&gt;{{cite book|last1=V Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700711130|date=2013|pages=86–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the design of [[Chandigarh]] city, [[Le Corbusier]] incorporated modern architecture theories with those of Vastu Shastra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=SAJAH|date=2011|volume=26|issue=3|pages=45–56|author=Gerald Steyn|title=Le Corbusier’s research-based design approaches|url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/20055/Steyn_LeCorbusier(2011).pdf?sequence=1|publisher=Tshwane University of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=H Saini|title=Vaastu ordains a full flowering for Chandigarh|date=1996|publisher=The Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reena Patra|title=Vaastu Shastra: Towards Sustainable Development|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2009|volume=17|pages=244–256|publisher=Wiley InterScience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial rule period of India, town planning officials of the [[British Raj]] did not consider Vastu Vidya, but largely grafted Islamic Mughal era motifs and designs such as domes and arches onto Victorian-era style buildings without overall relationship layout.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anthony D'Costa|title=A New India?: Critical Reflections in the Long Twentieth Century|pages=165–168|isbn=978-0857285041}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement, later known as the Indo-Saracenic style, is found in chaotically laid out, but externally grand structures in the form of currently used major railway stations, harbors, tax collection buildings, and other colonial offices in South Asia.&lt;ref name=vsgt3&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|date=2004|isbn=978-1861891372|pages=149–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vastu sastra vidya was ignored, during colonial era construction, for several reasons. These texts were viewed by 19th and early 20th century architects as archaic, the literature was inaccessible being in an ancient language not spoken or read by the architects, and the ancient texts assumed space to be readily available.&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt; In contrast, public projects in the colonial era were forced into crowded spaces and local layout constraints, and the ancient Vastu sastra were viewed with prejudice as superstitious and rigid about a square grid or traditional materials of construction.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt; Sachdev and Tillotson state that these prejudices were flawed, as a scholarly and complete reading of the Vastu sastra literature amply suggests the architect is free to adapt the ideas to new materials of construction, local layout constraints and into a non-square space.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc2&gt;{{cite book|last1=V Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700711130|date=2013|pages=86–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and completion of a new city of [[Jaipur]] in early 1700s based on Vastu sastra texts, well before any colonial era public projects, was one of many proofs.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc2/&gt; Other examples include modern public projects designed by [[Charles Correa]] such as Jawahar Kala Kendra in Jaipur, and Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=kpg1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klaus-Peter Gast|title=Modern Traditions: Contemporary Architecture in India|page=11|isbn=978-3764377540|date=2011|publisher=Birkhäuser Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vastu Shastra remedies have also been applied by Khushdeep Bansal in 1997 to the Parliament complex of India, when he contented that the library being built next to the building is responsible for political instability in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/harmonising-homes-hearts/story-UR90utlqvNojXaolxBmtNN.html | title=‘Harmonising’ homes, hearts | publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] | date= 9 June 2012 | accessdate= 4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German architect Klaus-Peter Gast states that the principles of Vastu Shastras is witnessing a major revival and wide usage in the planning and design of individual homes, residential complexes, commercial and industrial campuses, and major public projects in India, along with the use of ancient iconography and mythological art work incorporated into the Vastu vidya architectures.&lt;ref name=kpg1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephen Marshall|title=Urban Coding and Planning|pages=83–103|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415441261|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vastu and superstition ===
{{see also|Superstition in India#Vastu Shastra}}
The use of ''Vastu shastra'' and ''Vastu consultants'' in modern home and public projects is controversial.&lt;ref name=vc2/&gt; Some architects, particularly during India's colonial era, considered it arcane and superstitious.&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt; Other architects state that critics have not read the texts and that most of the text is about flexible design guidelines for space, sunlight, flow and function.&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm1/&gt;

Vastu Shastra is considered as pseudoscience by rationalists like [[Narendra Nayak]] of [[Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations]].&lt;ref name=OUP-Johannes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quack|first1=Johannes|title=Disenchanting India: Organized Rationalism and Criticism of Religion in India|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=170|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TNbxUwhS5RUC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientist and astronomer [[Jayant Narlikar]] considers Vastu Shastra as pseudoscience and writes that Vastu does not have any "logical connection" to the environment.&lt;ref name="narlikar_CUP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narlikar|first1=Jayant V.|editor1-last=Percy|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Pasachoff|editor2-first=Jay|title=Teaching and Learning Astronomy: Effective Strategies for Educators Worldwide|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=165|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=mdzQ4uCnYfkC&amp;pg=PA165|chapter=Astronomy, pseudoscience and rational thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the examples cited by Narlikar arguing the absence of logical connection is the Vastu rule, "sites shaped like a triangle ... will lead to government harassment, ... parallelogram can lead to quarrels in the family." Narlikar notes that sometimes the building plans are changed and what has already been built is demolished to accommodate for Vastu rules.&lt;ref name="narlikar_CUP"/&gt; Regarding superstitious beliefs in Vastu, Science writer [[Meera Nanda]] cites the case of [[N.T.Rama Rao]], the ex-chief minister of [[Andhra Pradesh]], who sought the help of Vastu consultants for his political problems. Rama Rao was advised that his problems would be solved if he entered his office from an east facing gate. Accordingly, a slum on the east facing side of his office was ordered to be demolished, to make way for his car's entrance.&lt;ref name=Sokal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sokal|first1=Alan|title=Beyond the Hoax: Science, Philosophy and Culture|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=306–307|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=SjBdUTpf184C&amp;pg=PT407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge of Vastu consultants is questioned by Pramod Kumar (citation required), "Ask the Vaastu folks if they know civil engineering or architecture or the local government rules on construction or minimum standards of construction to advise people on buildings. They will get into a barrage of "ancient" texts and "science" that smack of the pseudo-science of astrology. Ask them where they were before the construction boom and if they will go to slum tenements to advise people or advise on low-cost community-housing—you draw a blank."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kumar|first1=Pramod|title=Akshaya Tritiya and the great Indian superstition industry|url=http://www.firstpost.com/business/akshaya-tritiya-and-the-great-indian-superstition-industry-781471.html|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Firstpost|date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanskrit treatises on architecture==
Of the numerous Sanskrit treatises mentioned in ancient Indian literature, some have been translated in English. Many Agamas, Puranas and Hindu scriptures include chapters on architecture of temples, homes, villages, towns, fortifications, streets, shop layout, public wells, public bathing, public halls, gardens, river fronts among other things.&lt;ref name=pka/&gt; In some cases, the manuscripts are partially lost, some are available only in Tibetan, Nepalese or South Indian languages, while in others original Sanskrit manuscripts are available in different parts of India. Some treatises, or books with chapters on Vaastu Shastra include:&lt;ref name=pka&gt;Acharya P.K.

[[File:Old College, University of Edinburgh courtyard facade detail.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Henry Playfair]], [[University of Edinburgh]]: beveled edges of each stone block emphasise the voussoirs.]]
A '''voussoir''' {{IPAc-en|v|u|ˈ|s|w|ɑr}} is a wedge-shaped element, typically a stone, which is used in building an [[arch]] or [[vault (architecture)|vault]].&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;{{cite web|author=Jane Vadnal|url=https://Pitt.edu/~medart/menuglossary/voussoir.htm|title=Glossary of Medieval Art and Architecture - voussoir|date=August 1997|website=Pitt.edu|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although each unit in an arch or vault is a voussoir, two units are of distinct functional importance: the [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] and the [[Springer (architecture)|springer]].  The keystone is the centre stone or masonry unit at the apex of an arch.  The springer is the lowest voussoir on each side, located where the curve of the arch springs from the vertical support or [[abutment]] of the wall or [[pier (architecture)|pier]].&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

The keystone is often decorated or enlarged.  An enlarged and sometimes slightly dropped keystone is often found in [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] arches of the 16th century, beginning with the works of [[Giulio Romano]], who also began the fashion for using voussoirs above rectangular openings, rather than a [[lintel]] (Palazzo Stati Maccarani, Rome, circa 1522).

The word is a [[Stonemasonry|mason's]] term borrowed in [[Middle English]] from French verbs connoting a 'turn' (''[[OED]]'').  Each wedge-shaped voussoir ''turns aside'' the thrust of the mass above, transferring it from stone to stone to the springer's bottom face ('impost'), which is horizontal and passes the thrust on to the supports.  Voussoir arches distribute weight efficiently, and take maximum advantage of the [[compressive strength]] of stone, as in an [[arch bridge]].

In [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic]] and [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] architectural traditions, the voussoirs are often in alternating colours, usually red and white. This is sometimes found in [[Romanesque architecture]] also.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, British bricklayers became aware that, by thickening the vertical mortar joint between regularly shaped bricks from bottom to top, they could construct an elliptical arch of useful strength{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} over either a standard 'former', or over specially constructed timber [[falsework]] (temporary structure to be removed once the construction is complete).  The bricks used in such an arch are often referred to as 'voussoirs'.

'''Wellcome Research Laboratories''' was a site in [[Beckenham]], south-east London, that was a main research centre for pharmaceuticals. Until 1965, this laboratory site was situated in [[Kent]].

==History==
In 1894 [[Henry Wellcome]] set up a laboratory in central London to investigate a treatment for [[diphtheria]]. In 1898 it moved to Brockwell Hall in [[Herne Hill]] (now in [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]]). In 1919 Henry Wellcome bought a 105-acre site in Beckenham, Kent, which cost £32,000. The site had belonged to the Langley family since 1350. Langley Court had been built in 1886 by James Bucknall, who lived in the house with his family until 1914.

It was named the Wellcome Research Laboratories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7DYvphaRhwC|title=New Scientist|first=Reed Business|last=Information|date=4 October 1984|publisher=Reed Business Information|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1946 after the Wellcome Chemical Research Laboratories moved to the site. The [[Wellcome Trust]] had been set up in 1936, after the death in that year of Sir Henry Wellcome.

===Closure===
It closed in 1995 after Wellcome had been taken over by Glaxo in March 1995 to form Glaxo Wellcome. In December 2000, Glaxo Wellcome became [[GlaxoSmithKline]], when it merged with SmithKline Beecham.
