'''''A Vedic Word Concordance''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|Vaidika-Padānukrama-Koṣa}}'' ) is a multi-volume [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] of the corpus of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] texts. It has been under preparation from 1930 and was published in 1935-1965 under the guidance of {{IAST|Viśvabandhu Śāstrī}} (d. 1973), with an introduction in Sanskrit and English. It aims to be "a universal vocabulary register" of "Vedic works, with complete textual reference and critical [[Commentary (philology)|commentary]] bearing on [[phonology]], [[Vedic accent|accent]], etymo-morphology, grammar, [[Vedic meter|metre]], text-criticism, and [[Proto-Indo-Iranian|Ur-Aryan]] philology".

==Contents==
The work covers 123,000 word-bases and 5,000,000 word forms found in about 400 Vedic and [[Vedanga]] texts, including [[Vedas|Samhitas]], [[Brahmanas]], [[Aranyakas]] and [[Upanishads]] (even very late ones). The Vedanga section does not cover all the published Shrauta or Grihya texts, however, while the Upanishad section also includes the [[Bhagavad Gita]].

The concordance extends to about  11,000 pages, published in 16 parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jamison |first= Stephanie W.|author2= [[Michael Witzel|Witzel, Michael]]|editor= Sharma, Arvind|title= The Study of Hinduism |year= 2003|publisher= University of S.

:Section: Samhitas (6 parts), 1942-63.
:Section II: Brahmanas and Aranyakas (2 parts), 1935,36
:Section III: Upanishads (2 parts), 1945
:Section IV: Vedangas (4 parts), 1958-61

A revised and enlarged edition was published 1973-1976.

==History of development==
[[Acharya Vishva Bandhu|Vishva Bandhu Shastri]] continued the work of Vishveshvaranand and Nityanand, who had published word indices to the four Vedic Samhitas in 1908-1910, leading the ''Vishveshvaranand Institute'' from 1924 until his death in 1973.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title = Education in Hoshiarpur |url = http://hoshiarpur.nic.in/html/education.htm| publisher = Hoshiarpur District Administration|accessdate = 2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[partition of India]], the institute moved to its present premises at Sadhu Ashram, [[Hoshiarpur]], [[Punjab, India]]. Most of the approximately 6000 Sanskrit manuscripts formerly located at the Dayanand College of Lahore were clandestinely brought to Hoshiarpur at the time. Since 1965, the institute has been incorporated in the [[Panjab University, Chandigarh]] as the ''Vishveshvaranand Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies'' (VISIS).&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Based on the ''Vedic Word Concordance'', the institute currently compiles a ''Dictionary of Vedic Interpretation'', of which the first volume, running up to the lemma ''Agni'', has been completed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18057">'''Accidental release source terms''' are the mathematical equations that quantify the flow rate at which accidental releases of liquid or gaseous  [[pollutant]]s into the ambient [[Natural environment|environment]] can occur at industrial facilities such as [[Oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[petrochemical]] plants, [[natural gas]] processing plants, oil and gas  transportation [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], chemical plants, and many other industrial activities. Governmental regulations in many countries require that the probability of such accidental releases be analyzed and their quantitative impact upon the environment and human health be determined so that mitigating steps can be planned and implemented. 

There are a number of mathematical calculation methods for determining the flow rate at which gaseous and liquid pollutants might be released from various types of accidents. Such calculational methods are referred to as ''source terms'', and this article on accidental release source terms explains some of the calculation methods used for determining the [[mass flow rate]] at which gaseous pollutants may be accidentally released.

==Accidental release of pressurized gas==
When gas stored under [[pressure]] in a closed vessel is discharged to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] through a hole or other opening, the gas [[velocity]] through that opening may be choked (i.e., it has attained a maximum) or it may be non-choked.

Choked velocity, also referred to as sonic velocity, occurs when the ratio of the absolute source pressure to the absolute downstream pressure is equal to or greater than '''[(''k'' + 1) / 2]&lt;sup&gt;''k'' / (''k'' − 1)&lt;/sup&gt;''', where ''k'' is the [[heat capacity ratio|specific heat ratio]] of the discharged gas (sometimes called the [[adiabatic index|isentropic expansion factor]] and sometimes denoted as &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;).

For many gases, ''k'' ranges from about 1.09 to about 1.41, and therefore '''[(''k'' + 1) / 2]&lt;sup&gt;''k'' / (''k'' − 1 )&lt;/sup&gt;''' ranges from 1.7 to about 1.9, which means that choked velocity usually occurs when the absolute source vessel pressure is at least 1.7 to 1.9 times as high as the absolute downstream ambient atmospheric pressure.

When the gas velocity is choked, the equation for the [[mass flow rate]] in SI metric units is:&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]'', Sixth Edition, McGraw-Hill Co., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hazards&gt;''Handbook of Chemical Hazard Analysis Procedures'', Appendix B, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1989.

: &lt;math&gt;Q \;=\; C\;A\; \sqrt{\;k\;\rho\;P\; \left(\frac{2}{k+ 1}\right)^\frac{k + 1}{k - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

or this equivalent form:

: &lt;math&gt;Q \;=\; C\;A\;P\;\sqrt{\left(\frac{\;\,k\;M}{Z\;R\;T}\right)\left(\frac{2}{k + 1}\right)^\frac{k + 1}{k - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

For the above equations, '''it is important to note that although the gas velocity reaches a maximum and becomes choked, the mass flow rate is not choked'''. The mass flow rate can still be increased if the source pressure is increased.

Whenever the ratio of the absolute source pressure to the absolute downstream ambient pressure is less than 
'''[ (''k'' + 1) / 2]&lt;sup&gt;''k'' / (''k'' − 1)&lt;/sup&gt;''', then the gas velocity is non-choked (i.e., sub-sonic) and the equation for mass flow rate is:

: &lt;math&gt;Q \;=\; C\;A\;\sqrt{\;2\;\rho\;P\;\left[\frac{k}{k - 1}\right]\left[\left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{2}{k}-\;\,\left(\frac{\;P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{k + 1}{k}\;\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

or this equivalent form:

: &lt;math&gt;Q \;=\; C\;A\;P\; \sqrt{\left[\frac{2\;M}{Z\;R\;T}\right]\left[\frac{k}{k - 1}\right]\left[\,\left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{2}{k} -\;\,\left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{k + 1}{k}\;\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

The above equations calculate the '''initial instantaneous''' mass flow rate for the pressure and temperature existing in the source vessel when a release first occurs. The initial instantaneous flow rate from a leak in a pressurized gas system or vessel is much higher than the average flow rate during the overall release period because the pressure and flow rate decrease with time as the system or vessel empties. Calculating the flow rate versus time since the initiation of the leak is much more complicated, but more accurate. Two equivalent methods for performing such calculations are presented and compared at [http://www.air-dispersion.com/feature2.html www.air-dispersion.com/feature2.html].

The technical literature can be very confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the universal gas law constant ''R'' which applies to any [[ideal gas]] or whether they are using the gas law constant ''R''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; which only applies to a specific individual gas.  The relationship between the two constants is ''R''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''/''M''.

Notes:
* The above equations are for a real gas.
* For an ideal gas, '''''Z''''' = 1 and '''''ρ''''' is the ideal gas density.
* 1{{nbsp}}kilomole (kmol) = 1000{{nbsp}}[[mole (unit)|moles]] = 1000 gram-moles = kilogram-mole.

===Ramskill's equation for non-choked mass flow===

P.K. Ramskill's equation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.che.utexas.edu/cache/newsletters/Spr_99.pdf CACHE Newsletter No.48, Spring 1999] Gierer, C. and Hyatt, N.,''Using Source Term Analysis Software for Calculating Fluid Flow Release Rates'' Dyadem International Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramskill, P.K. (1986), ''Discharge Rate Calculation Methods for Use In Plant Safety Assessments'', Safety and Reliability Directory, United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority&lt;/ref&gt;  for the non-choked flow of an ideal gas is shown below as equation (1):

: (1) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;Q = C \;\rho_A\;A\;\sqrt{\frac{\;\,2\;P}{\rho} \cdot \frac{k}{k-1} \cdot \left[\; 1 - {\left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{k - 1}{k}}\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

The gas density, '''''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''', in Ramskill's equation is the ideal gas density at the downstream  conditions of temperature and pressure and it is defined in equation (2) using the [[ideal gas law]]: 

: (2) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\rho_A = \frac{M\;P_A}{R \;T_A}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the downstream temperature '''''T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is not known, the isentropic expansion equation below &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/compexp.html Isentropic Compression or Expansion]&lt;/ref&gt; is used to determine '''''T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''' in terms of the known upstream temperature '''''T''''': 

: (3) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\frac{T_A}{T} = \left(\frac{P_A}{P}\right)^\frac{k - 1}{k}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining equations (2) and (3) results in equation (4) which defines '''''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''' in terms of the known upstream temperature '''''T''''':

: (4) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\rho_A = \frac{M \;P^\frac{k - 1}{k}}{R \;T \;P_A^{-\frac{1}{k}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using equation (4) with Ramskill's equation (1) to determine non-choked mass flow rates for ideal gases gives identical results to the results obtained using the non-choked flow equation presented in the previous section above.

==Evaporation of non-boiling liquid pool==
Three different methods of calculating the rate of evaporation from a non-boiling liquid pool are presented in this section. The results obtained by the three methods are somewhat different.

===The U.S. Air Force method===
The following equations are for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of liquid which is at or near the ambient temperature. The equations were derived from field tests performed by the U.S. Air Force with pools of liquid hydrazine. &lt;ref name=Hazards/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E = \left(4.161 \times 10^{-5}\right) \cdot u^{0.75} \cdot T_F \cdot M \cdot \frac{P_S}{P_H}&lt;/math&gt;

|-
! align=right | ''u''
| align=left  | = windspeed just above the liquid surface, m/s
|-
! align=right | ''T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
| align=left  | = absolute ambient temperature, K
|-
! align=right | ''T&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''

| align=left  | = pool liquid temperature, °C
|-

| align=left  | = pool liquid molecular weight, dimensionless
|-
! align=right | ''P&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''

|-
! align=right | ''P&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
| align=left  | = hydrazine vapor pressure at ambient temperature, mmHg (see equation below)
|}

'''If ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = 0{{nbsp}}°C or less, then ''T''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1.0'''

'''If ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0{{nbsp}}°C, then ''T''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1.0&amp;nbsp;+ 0.0043 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''

: &lt;math&gt;P_H = 760 \cdot e^{65.3319 - \frac{7245.2}{T_A} - 8.22\;\ln\left(T_a\right) + 0.0061557\;T_A}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"

| align=left  | = 2.7183, the base of the natural logarithm system
|-
| align=right | &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt;
| align=left  | = natural logarithm
|}

===The U.S. EPA method===
The following equations are for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of liquid which is at or near the ambient temperature. The equations were developed by the United States [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] using units which were a mixture of metric usage and United States usage.&lt;ref name=Risk/&gt; The non-metric units have been converted to metric units for this presentation.

: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{0.1288 \cdot A \cdot P \cdot M^{0.667} \cdot u^{0.78}}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

NB, the constant used here is 0.284 from the mixed unit formula/2.205{{nbsp}}lb/kg.  The 82.05 become 1.0 = (ft/m)² × mmHg/kPa.

The U.S. EPA also defined the pool depth as 0.01{{nbsp}}m (i.e., 1{{nbsp}}cm) so that the surface area of the pool liquid could be calculated as:

:'''''A''''' = (pool volume, in m³)/(0.01)

===Stiver and Mackay's method===
The following equations are for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of liquid which is at or near the ambient temperature. The equations were developed by Warren Stiver and Dennis Mackay of the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Toronto. &lt;ref name=Stiver&gt;Stiver, W. and Mackay, D., ''A Spill Hazard Ranking System For Chemicals'', Environment Canada First Technical Spills Seminar, Toronto, Canada, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaporation of boiling cold liquid pool==
The following equation is for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of cold liquid (i.e., at a liquid temperature of about 0{{nbsp}}°C or less).&lt;ref name=Hazards/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E = 0.0001\;M (7.7026 - 0.0288\;B)\; e^{-(0.0077\;B) - 0.1376}&lt;/math&gt;

==Adiabatic flash of liquefied gas release==
Liquefied gases such as ammonia or chlorine are often stored in cylinders or vessels at ambient temperatures and pressures well above atmospheric pressure. When such a liquefied gas is released into the ambient atmosphere, the resultant reduction of pressure causes some of the liquefied gas to vaporize immediately. This is known as [[flash evaporation|"adiabatic flashing"]] and the following equation, derived from a simple heat balance, is used to predict how much of the liquefied gas is vaporized. 

: &lt;math&gt;X = 100\;\frac{H_s^L - H_a^L}{H_a^V - H_a^L}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
| align=right | where:
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
! align=right | ''X''

| align=left  | = residual liquid enthalpy at atmospheric boiling point and pressure, J/kg
|}

If the enthalpy data required for the above equation is unavailable, then the following equation may be used.

: &lt;math&gt;X = 100 \cdot c_p \cdot \frac{T_s - T_b}{H}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1912">[[File:William Haggars Bioscope1902.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|[[William Haggar]]'s travelling Bioscope from 1902]]
A '''Bioscope''' show was a [[music hall]] and [[funfair|fairground]] attraction consisting of a travelling [[Movie theater|cinema]]. The heyday of the Bioscope was from the late 1890s until [[World War I]].

Bioscope shows were fronted by the largest [[fairground organ]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steamfairground.co.uk/l3_bioscope.html "Hollycombe Steam Museum bioscope show"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these formed the entire public face of the show. A stage was usually in front of the organ, and dancing girls would entertain the crowds between film shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/newsite/research/research-bioscopes.html "Fairground Heritage Trust"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703073622/http://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/newsite/research/research-bioscopes.html |date=July 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Films shown in the Bioscope were primitive, and the earliest of these were made by the showmen themselves. Later, films were commercially produced.

Bioscope shows were integrated, in Britain at least, into the Variety shows in the huge Music Halls which were built at the end of the nineteenth century.

After the Music Hall Strike of 1907 in London, bioscope operators set up a trade union to represent them. There were about seventy operators in London at this point.

==Modern use==
In South Africa "Bioscope" or in [[Afrikaans]] "bioskoop" is an archaic word for the cinema and some people (especially older generations) still use it regularly.

In modern day Dutch, "bioscoop" is a wide-spread term, and the equivalent of the English "movie theater" or "cinema".

'''Cas9''' ('''C'''RISPR '''as'''sociated protein '''9''') is an [[RNA]]-guided [[DNA]] [[endonuclease]] [[enzyme]] associated with the [[CRISPR]] (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) adaptive immunity system in ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', among other bacteria. ''S. pyogenes'' utilizes Cas9 to memorize&lt;ref name="Heler2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heler R, Samai P, Modell JW, Weiner C, Goldberg GW, Bikard D, Marraffini LA | title = Cas9 specifies functional viral targets during CRISPR-Cas adaptation | journal = Nature | volume = 519 | issue = 7542 | pages = 199–202 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25707807 | pmc = 4385744 | doi = 10.1038/nature14245 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7542/full/nature14245.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later interrogate and cleave foreign DNA,&lt;ref name="P22745249"/&gt; such as invading bacteriophage DNA or plasmid DNA.  Cas9 performs this interrogation by unwinding foreign DNA and checking for sites complementary to the 20 basepair spacer region of the guide RNA.  If the DNA substrate is complementary to the guide RNA, Cas9 cleaves the invading DNA. In this sense, the CRISPR-Cas9 mechanism has a number of parallels with the [[RNA interference]] (RNAi) mechanism in eukaryotes.

Apart from its original function in bacterial immunity, the Cas9 protein has been heavily utilized as a genome engineering tool to induce site-directed double strand breaks in DNA. These breaks can lead to gene inactivation or the introduction of heterologous genes through non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination respectively in many laboratory model organisms. Alongside [[zinc finger nuclease]]s and [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALEN]] proteins, Cas9 is becoming a prominent tool in the field of genome editing.

Cas9 has gained traction in recent years because it can cleave nearly any sequence complementary to the guide RNA.&lt;ref name="P22745249" /&gt; Because the target specificity of Cas9 stems from the guide RNA:DNA complementarity and not modifications to the protein itself (like TALENs and Zinc-fingers), engineering Cas9 to target new DNA is straightforward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mali P, Esvelt KM, Church GM | title = Cas9 as a versatile tool for engineering biology | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 957–63 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24076990 | pmc = 4051438 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of Cas9 that bind but do not cleave cognate DNA can be used to localize transcriptional [[activator (genetics)|activator]] or [[repressors]] to specific DNA sequences in order to control transcriptional activation and repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mali P, Aach J, Stranges PB, Esvelt KM, Moosburner M, Kosuri S, Yang L, Church GM | title = CAS9 transcriptional activators for target specificity screening and paired nickases for cooperative genome engineering | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pages = 833–8 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23907171 | pmc = 3818127 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2675 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P23849981"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert LA, Larson MH, Morsut L, Liu Z, Brar GA, Torres SE, Stern-Ginossar N, Brandman O, Whitehead EH, Doudna JA, Lim WA, Weissman JS, Qi LS | title = CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes | journal = Cell | volume = 154 | issue = 2 | pages = 442–51 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23849981 | pmc = 3770145 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.06.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While native Cas9 requires a guide RNA composed of two disparate RNAs that associate to make the guide – the CRISPR RNA (crRNA), and the trans-activating RNA ([[tracrRNA]]).,&lt;ref name="P22745249"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jinek M, Chylinski K, Fonfara I, Hauer M, Doudna JA, Charpentier E | title = A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity | journal = Science | volume = 337 | issue = 6096 | pages = 816–21 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22745249 | doi = 10.1126/science.1225829 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 targeting has been simplified through the engineering of a chimeric single guide RNA (chiRNA).

== CRISPR-mediated immunity ==

=== Introduction ===
To survive in a variety of challenging, inhospitable habitats that are filled with [[bacteriophage]]s, bacteria and archea have evolved methods to evade and fend off predatory [[virus]]es. This includes the CRISPR system of adaptive immunity. In practice, CRISPR acts as a self-programmable restriction enzyme. CRISPR loci are composed of short, palindromic repeats that occur at regular intervals composed of alternate CRISPR repeats and variable CRISPR spacers between 24-48 nucleotides long. These CRISPR loci are usually accompanied by adjacent CRISPR-associated (cas) genes. In 2005, it was discovered by three separate groups that the spacer regions were homologous to foreign DNA elements, including [[plasmid]]s and viruses. These reports provided the first biological evidence that CRISPRs might function as an immune system.

Cas9 has been used often as a genome-editing tool. Cas9 has been used in recent developments in preventing viruses from manipulating hosts’ DNA. Since the CRISPR-Cas9 was developed from bacterial genome systems, it can be used to target the genetic material in viruses. The use of the enzyme Cas9 can be a solution to many viral infections. Cas9 possesses the ability to target specific viruses by the targeting of specific strands of the viral genetic information. More specifically the Cas9 enzyme targets certain sections of the viral genome that prevents the virus from carrying out its normal function.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=CRISPR-Cas : a laboratory manual|others=Doudna, Jennifer A.,, Mali, Prashant|isbn=9781621821304|location=Cold Spring Harbor, New York|oclc=922914104|last1=Doudna|first1=Jennifer A.|last2=Mali|first2=Prashant|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 has also been used to disrupt the detrimental strand of DNA and RNA that cause diseases and mutated strands of DNA. Cas9 has already showed promise in disrupting the effects of HIV-1. Cas9 has been shown to suppress the expression of the long terminal repeats in HIV-1. When introduced into the HIV-1 genome Cas9 has shown the ability to mutate strands of HIV-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing|doi=10.1036/1097-8542.yb150927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebina H, Misawa N, Kanemura Y, Koyanagi Y | title = Harnessing the CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt latent HIV-1 provirus | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 2510 | date = 2013-08-26 | pmid = 23974631 | pmc = 3752613 | doi = 10.1038/srep02510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 has also been used in the treatment of hepatitis b through targeting of the ends of certain of long terminal repeats in the hepatitis b viral genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li H, Sheng C, Wang S, Yang L, Liang Y, Huang Y, Liu H, Li P, Yang C, Yang X, Jia L, Xie J, Wang L, Hao R, Du X, Xu D, Zhou J, Li M, Sun Y, Tong Y, Li Q, Qiu S, Song H | title = Removal of Integrated Hepatitis B Virus DNA Using CRISPR-Cas9 | journal = Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | volume = 7 | pages = 91 | date = 2017-03-22 | pmid = 28382278 | pmc = 5360708 | doi = 10.3389/fcimb.2017.00091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Cas9 has already been used in human trials in the treatment of cystic fibrosis and oncogenic mutations in human pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bogdanovich|first=Sasha | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-02-10|title=Gene Editing With Crispr/Cas9: A New Therapeutic Hope for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy |journal=MOJ Cell Science &amp; Report|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.15406/mojcsr.2016.03.00050|issn=2374-6912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 has used to repair the mutations causing cataracts in mice.

=== Overview of CRISPR-Cas types and function ===
[[File:The Stages of CRISPR immunity.svg|border|right|Fig. 2: The Stages of CRISPR immunity]]
CRISPR-Cas systems are divided into three major types (type I, type II, and type III) and twelve subtypes, which are based on their genetic content and structural differences. However, the core defining features of all CRISPR-Cas systems are the cas genes and their proteins: cas1 and cas2 are universal across types and subtypes, while cas3, cas9, and cas10 are signature genes for type I, type II, and type III, respectively.

===CRISPR-Cas defense stages===
# '''Adaptation''' – [[Adaptation]] involves recognition and integration of spacers between two adjacent repeats in the CRISPR locus. The “Protospacer” refers to the sequence on the viral genome that corresponds to the spacer. A short stretch of conserved nucleotides exists proximal to the protospacer, which is called the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). The PAM is a recognition motif that is used to acquire the DNA fragment.&lt;ref name="Garneau2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garneau JE, Dupuis MÈ, Villion M, Romero DA, Barrangou R, Boyaval P, Fremaux C, Horvath P, Magadán AH, Moineau S | title = The CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system cleaves bacteriophage and plasmid DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7320 | pages = 67–71 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21048762 | doi = 10.1038/nature09523 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.451.9645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In type II, Cas9 recognizes the PAM during adaptation in order to ensure the acquisition of functional spacers.&lt;ref name="Heler2015" /&gt;
# '''CRISPR Processing''' –  CRISPR expression includes the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a primary transcript called a CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA), which is transcribed from the CRISPR locus by RNA polymerase. Specific [[endoribonuclease]]s then cleave the pre-crRNAs into small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs).&lt;ref name="Horvath2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath P, Barrangou R | title = CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 167–70 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20056882 | doi = 10.1126/science.1179555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Interference / Immunity''' – Interference involves the crRNAs within a multi-protein complex called CASCADE, which can recognize and specifically base-pair with regions of inserting complementary foreign DNA. The crRNA-foreign nucleic acid complex is then cleaved, however if there are mismatches between the spacer and the target DNA, or if there are mutations in the PAM, then cleavage will not be initiated. In the latter scenario, the foreign DNA is not targeted for attack by the cell, thus the replication of the virus proceeds and the host is not immune to viral infection. The interference stage can be mechanistically and temporally distinct from CRISPR acquisition and expression, yet for complete function as a defense system, all three phases must be functional.&lt;ref name="Karginov2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karginov FV, Hannon GJ | title = The CRISPR system: small RNA-guided defense in bacteria and archaea | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–19 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20129051 | pmc = 2819186 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2009.12.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage 1: CRISPR spacer integration. Protospacers and protospacer-associated motifs (shown in red) are acquired at the “leader” end of a CRISPR array in the host DNA. The CRISPR array is composed of spacer sequences (shown in colored boxes) flanked by repeats (black diamonds). This process requires Cas1 and Cas2 (and Cas9 in type II&lt;ref name="Heler2015" /&gt;), which are encoded in the cas locus, which are usually located near the CRISPR array.

Stage 2: CRISPR expression. Pre-crRNA is transcribed starting at the leader region by the host RNA polymerase and then cleaved by Cas proteins into smaller crRNAs containing a single spacer and a partial repeat (shown as hairpin structure with colored spacers).

Stage 3: CRISPR interference. crRNA with a spacer that has strong complementarity to the incoming foreign DNA begins a cleavage event (depicted with scissors), which requires Cas proteins. DNA cleavage interferes with viral replication and provides immunity to the host. The interference stage can be functionally and temporarily distinct from CRISPR acquisition and expression (depicted by white line dividing the cell).

==== Transcription deactivation using dCas9 ====
dCas9, also referred to as endonuclease deficient Cas9 can be utilized to edit gene expression when applied to the transcription binding site of the desired section of a gene. The optimal function of dCas9 is attributed to its mode of action. Gene expression is inhibited when nucleotides are no longer added to the RNA chain and therefore terminating elongation of that chain, and as a result affects the transcription process. This process occurs when dCas9 is mass-produced so it is able to affect the most amount of genes at any given time via a sequence specific guide RNA molecule. Since dCas9 appears to down regulate gene expression, this action is amplified even more when it is used in conjunction with repressive chromatin modifier domains.&lt;ref name="pmid28298224"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jensen ED, Ferreira R, Jakočiūnas T, Arsovska D, Zhang J, Ding L, Smith JD, David F, Nielsen J, Jensen MK, Keasling JD | display-authors = 6 | title = Transcriptional reprogramming in yeast using dCas9 and combinatorial gRNA strategies | journal = Microbial Cell Factories | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 46 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28298224 | pmc = 5353793 | doi = 10.1186/s12934-017-0664-2 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dCas9 protein has other functions outside of the regulation of gene expression. A promoter can be added to the dCas9 protein which allows them to work with each other to become efficient at beginning or stopping transcription at different sequences along a strand of DNA. These two proteins are specific in where they act on a gene. This is prevalent in certain types of prokaryotes when a promoter and dCas9 align themselves together to impede the ability of elongation of polymer of nucleotides coming together to form a transcripted piece of DNA. Without the promoter, the dCas9 protein does not have the same effect by itself or with a gene body.&lt;ref name="pmid29056323"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinto BS, Saxena T, Oliveira R, Méndez-Gómez HR, Cleary JD, Denes LT, McConnell O, Arboleda J, Xia G, Swanson MS, Wang ET | title = Impeding Transcription of Expanded Microsatellite Repeats by Deactivated Cas9 | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 479–490.e5 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29056323 | pmc = 6013302 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2017.09.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When examining the effects of repression of transcription further, H3K27, an amino acid component of a histone, becomes methylated through the interaction of dCas9 and a peptide called FOG1. Essentially, this interaction causes gene repression on the C + N terminal section of the amino acid complex at the specific junction of the gene, and as a result, terminates transcription.&lt;ref name="pmid28973434"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Geen H, Ren C, Nicolet CM, Perez AA, Halmai J, Le VM, Mackay JP, Farnham PJ, Segal DJ | title = dCas9-based epigenome editing suggests acquisition of histone methylation is not sufficient for target gene repression | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 45 | issue = 17 | pages = 9901–9916 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28973434 | pmc = 5622328 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkx578 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

dCas9 also proves to be efficient when it comes to altering certain proteins that can create diseases. When the dCas9 attaches to a form of RNA called guide-RNA, it prevents the proliferation of repeating codons and DNA sequences that might be harmful to an organism's genome. Essentially, when multiple repeat codons are produced, it elicits a response, or recruits an abundance of dCas9 to combat the overproduction of those codons and results in the shut-down of transcription. dCas9 works synergistically with gRNA and directly affects the DNA polymerase II from continuing transcription.

Further explanation of how the dCas9 protein works can be found in their utilization of plant genomes by the regulation of gene production in plants to either increase or decrease certain characteristics. The CRISPR-CAS9 system has the ability to either upregulate or downregulate genes. The dCas9 proteins are a component of the CRISPR-CAS9 system and these proteins can repress certain areas of a plant gene. This happens when dCAS9 binds to repressor domains, and in the case of the plants, deactivation of a regulatory gene such as AtCSTF64, does occur.&lt;ref name="pmid28623586"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lowder LG, Paul JW, Qi Y | title = Multiplexed Transcriptional Activation or Repression in Plants Using CRISPR-dCas9-Based Systems | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 1629 | issue = | pages = 167–184 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28623586 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4939-7125-1_12 | isbn = 978-1-4939-7124-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacteria are another focus of the usage of dCas9 proteins as well. Since eukaryotes have a larger DNA makeup and genome; the much smaller bacteria are easy to manipulate. As a result, eukaryotes use dCas9 to inhibit RNA polymerase from continuing the process of transcription of genetic material.&lt;ref name="pmid28581505"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R, Horvath P | title = A decade of discovery: CRISPR functions and applications | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 17092 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28581505 | doi = 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genomic editing in eukaryotic cells ===
While genomic editing in eukaryotic cells has been possible using various methods since the 1980's the methods employed had proved to be inefficient and impractical to implement on a larger scale. Genomic editing leads to irreversible changes to the gene. Working like genetic scissors, the Cas9 nuclease opens both strands of the targeted sequence of DNA to introduce the modification by one of two methods. Knock-in mutations, facilitated via Homology Directed Repair, is the traditional pathway of targeted genomic editing approaches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang JH, Adikaram P, Pandey M, Genis A, Simonds WF | title = Optimization of genome editing through CRISPR-Cas9 engineering | journal = Bioengineered | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 166–74 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27340770 | pmc = 4927198 | doi = 10.1080/21655979.2016.1189039 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for the introduction of targeted DNA damage and repair. HDR employs the use of similar DNA sequences to drive the repair of the break via the incorporation of exogenous DNA to function as the repair template.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This method relies on the periodic and isolated occurrence of DNA damage at the target site in order for a repair to commence. Knock-out mutations caused by Cas9/CRISPR results in the repair of the double-strand break by means of NHEJ (Non-Homologous End Joining). NHEJ can often result random deletions or insertions at the repair site disrupting or altering gene functionality. Therefore, genomic engineering by CRISPR/Cas9 gives researches the ability to generated targeted random gene disruption. Because of this, the precision of genomic editing is a great concern. With the discovery of CRISPR and specifically the Cas9 nuclease molecule, efficient and highly selective editing is now a reality. Cas9 allows for a reliable method of creating a targeted break at a specific location as designated by the crRNA and tracrRna guide strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang JH, Pandey M, Kahler JF, Loshakov A, Harris B, Dagur PK, Mo YY, Simonds WF | title = Improving the specificity and efficacy of CRISPR/CAS9 and gRNA through target specific DNA reporter | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 189 | pages = 1–8 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25193712 | pmc = 4252756 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.08.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 derived from ''S. pyogenes'' has facilitated the targeted genomic modification in eukaryotic cells. The ease by which researches can insert Cas9 and template RNA in order to silence or cause point mutations on specific loci has proved invaluable to the quick and efficient mapping of genomic models and biological processes associated with various genes in a variety of eukaryotes. New engineered variant of the Cas9 nuclease have been developed that significantly reduce off-target manipulation. Called spCas9-HF1 (Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 High Fidelity 1), has a success rate of modification in vivo of 85% and undetectable off-target manipulations as measured by genome wide break capture and targeted sequencing methods used to measure total genomic changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kleinstiver BP, Pattanayak V, Prew MS, Tsai SQ, Nguyen NT, Zheng Z, Joung JK | title = High-fidelity CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases with no detectable genome-wide off-target effects | journal = Nature | volume = 529 | issue = 7587 | pages = 490–5 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26735016 | pmc = 4851738 | doi = 10.1038/nature16526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu PD, Lander ES, Zhang F | title = Development and applications of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome engineering | journal = Cell | volume = 157 | issue = 6 | pages = 1262–78 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24906146 | pmc = 4343198 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cellular modeling ===
Cas9 genomic modification has allowed for the quick and efficient generation of transgenic models within the field of genetics. Cas9 can be easily introduced into the target cells via plasmid transfection along with sgRNA in order to model the spread of diseases and the cell's response and defense to infection.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dow LE | title = Modeling Disease In Vivo With CRISPR/Cas9 | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 609–621 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26432018 | pmc = 4592741 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2015.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of Cas9 to be introduced in vivo allows for the creation of more accurate models of gene function, mutation effects, all while avoiding the of off-target mutations typically observed with older methods of genetic engineering. The CRISPR and Cas9 revolution in genomic modeling doesn’t only extent to mammals. Traditional genomic models such as ''Drosophila Melanogaster,'' one of the first model species, have seen further refinement in their resolution with the use of Cas9.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cas9 uses cell-specific promoters allowing the a controlled use of the Cas9. Cas9 is an accurate method of treating diseases due to the targeting of the Cas9 enzyme only affecting certain cell types. The cells undergoing the Cas9 therapy can also be removed and reintroduced to provide amplified effects of the therapy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Structural studies of Cas9 ==

=== Overview ===
Cas9 features a bi-lobed architecture with the guide RNA nestled between the alpha-helical lobe (blue; Fig. 2) and the nuclease lobe (cyan, orange and gray). These two lobes are connected through a single bridge helix. There are two nuclease domains located in the multi-domain nuclease lobe, the RuvC (gray) which cleaves the non-target DNA strand, and the HNH nuclease domain (cyan) that cleaves the target strand of DNA. The RuvC domain is encoded by sequentially disparate sites that interact in the tertiary structure to form the RuvC cleavage domain (See Figure 3).
[[File:Cas9 Apo Structure.png|thumb|left|Cas9 Apo Structure|Fig. 3: Crystal structure of Cas9 in the Apo form, as solved by M Jinek ''et al.'' in their 2014 ''Science'' paper. Structural rendition was performed using UCSF Chimera software.]]

A key feature of the target DNA is that it must contain a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) consisting of the three-nucleotide sequence- NGG. This PAM is recognized by the PAM-interacting domain (PI domain, orange) located near the C-terminal end of Cas9. Cas9 undergoes distinct conformational changes between the apo, guide RNA bound, and guide RNA:DNA bound states, which are detailed below.

=== Crystal structures in detail ===
Cas9 recognizes the [[stem-loop]] architecture inherent in the CRISPR locus, which mediates the maturation of crRNA-tracrRNA [[ribonucleoprotein]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiedenheft B, Sternberg SH, Doudna JA | title = RNA-guided genetic silencing systems in bacteria and archaea | journal = Nature | volume = 482 | issue = 7385 | pages = 331–8 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22337052 | doi = 10.1038/nature10886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 in complex with CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) further recognizes and degrades the target dsDNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ran FA, Hsu PD, Wright J, Agarwala V, Scott DA, Zhang F | title = Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 2281–2308 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24157548 | pmc = 3969860 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2013.143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the co-crystal structure shown here (Fig. 4), the crRNA-tracrRNA complex is replaced by a [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] single-guide RNA (sgRNA, in red) which has been proved to have the same function as the natural RNA complex.&lt;ref name="P22745249"/&gt; The sgRNA base paired with target ssDNA is anchored by Cas9 as a T-shaped architecture. This crystal structure of the DNA-bound Cas9 enzyme reveals distinct conformational changes in the alpha-helical lobe with respect to the nuclease lobe, as well as the location of the HNH domain. The protein consists of a recognition lobe (REC) and a nuclease lobe (NUC). It should be noted that all regions except the HNH form tight interactions with each other and sgRNA-ssDNA complex, while the HNH domain forms few contacts with the rest of the protein. In another conformation of Cas9 complex observed in the crystal, the HNH domain is not visible. These structures suggest the conformational flexibility of HNH domain.

So far, three crystal structures have been studied and published. One representing a conformation of Cas9 in the apo state, and two representing Cas9 in the DNA bound state.

=== The interactions between sgRNA and Cas9 ===
[[File:GRNA-Cas9.png|thumb|306x306px|CRISPR/Cas9]]
In sgRNA-Cas9 complex, based on the crystal structure, REC1, BH and PI domains have important contacts with backbone or bases in both repeat and spacer region.&lt;ref name="P24529477"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P25079318"/&gt; Several Cas9 mutants including REC1 or REC2 domains deletion and residues mutations in BH have been tested. REC1 and BH related mutants show lower or none activity compared with wild type, which indicate these two domains are crucial for the sgRNA recognition at repeat sequence and stabilization of the whole complex. Although the interactions between spacer sequence and Cas9 as well as PI domain and repeat region need further studies, the co-crystal demonstrates clear interface between Cas9 and sgRNA.

=== Target digestion ===
Previous sequence analysis and biochemical studies have suggested Cas9 contain RNase H and HNH endonuclease homologous domains which are responsible for cleavages of two target DNA strands, respectively. These results are finally proved in the structure. Although the low sequence similarity, the sequence similar to RNase H has a RuvC fold (one member of RNase H family) and the HNH region folds as T4 Endo VII (one member of HNH endonuclease family). Previous works on Cas9 have demonstrated that HNH domain is responsible for complementary sequence cleavage of target DNA and RuvC is responsible for the non-complementary sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid26912877"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen H, Bailey S | title = Structural biology. Cas9, poised for DNA cleavage | journal = Science | volume = 351 | issue = 6275 | pages = 811–2 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26912877 | doi = 10.1126/science.aaf2089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problems Bacteria Pose to Cas-9 Editing ===
Most Archea and Bacteria stubbornly refuse to allow a cas-9 to edit their genome. This is due to the fact that they are able to attach foreign DNA, that does not affect them, into their genome. Another way that these cells defy cas-9 is by process of “Restriction Modification System”. When a bacteriophage, a virus that infects bacteria and archaea and uses them to replicate itself, enters a bacteria or archea cell it is targeted by the RM system. The RM system then cuts the bacteriophages DNA into separate pieces by restriction enzymes and uses endonucleases to further destroy the strands of DNA. This poses a problem to cas-9 editing because the RM system also targets the foreign genes added by the cas-9 process.&lt;ref name="pmid7479944"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kusano K, Naito T, Handa N, Kobayashi I | title = Restriction-modification systems as genomic parasites in competition for specific sequences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 24 | pages = 11095–9 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 7479944 | pmc = 40578 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.92.24.11095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of Cas9 to transcription tuning ==

=== Interference of transcription by dCas9 ===
Due to the unique ability of Cas9 to bind to essentially any complement sequence in any [[genome]], researchers wanted to use this enzyme to repress [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of various genomic [[locus (genetics)|loci]]. To accomplish this, the two crucial catalytic residues of the RuvC and HNH domain can be mutated to [[alanine]] abolishing all endonuclease activity of Cas9. The resulting protein coined ‘dead’ Cas9 or ‘dCas9’ for short, can still tightly bind to dsDNA. This [[catalytic]]ally inactive Cas9 variant has been used for both mechanistic studies into Cas9 DNA interrogative binding and as a general programmable DNA binding RNA-Protein complex.

The interaction of dCas9 with target dsDNA is so tight that high [[molar concentration|molarity]] [[urea]] protein denaturant can not fully dissociate the dCas9 RNA-protein complex from dsDNA target.&lt;ref name="Sternberg2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sternberg SH, Redding S, Jinek M, Greene EC, Doudna JA | title = DNA interrogation by the CRISPR RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 | journal = Nature | volume = 507 | issue = 7490 | pages = 62–7 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24476820 | pmc = 4106473 | doi = 10.1038/nature13011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; dCas9 has been targeted with engineered single guide RNAs to transcription initiation sites of any loci where dCas9 can compete with RNA polymerase at promoters to halt transcription.&lt;ref name="pmid23761437" /&gt; Also, dCas9 can be targeted to the coding region of loci such that inhibition of RNA Polymerase occurs during the elongation phase of transcription.&lt;ref name="pmid23761437"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bikard D, Jiang W, Samai P, Hochschild A, Zhang F, Marraffini LA | title = Programmable repression and activation of bacterial gene expression using an engineered CRISPR-Cas system | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 41 | issue = 15 | pages = 7429–37 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23761437 | pmc = 3753641 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Eukaryotes, silencing of gene expression can be extented by targeting dCas9 to enhancer sequences, where dCas9 can block assembly of transcription factors leading to silencing of specific gene expression.&lt;ref name="P23849981" /&gt; Moreover, the guide RNAs provided to dCas9 can be designed to include specific mismatches to its complementary cognate sequence that will quantitatively weaken the interaction of dCas9 for its programmed cognate sequence allowing a researcher to tune the extent of gene silencing applied to a gene of interest.&lt;ref name="pmid23761437" /&gt;
This technology is similar in principle to [[RNAi]] such that gene expression is being modulated at the RNA level. However, the dCas9 approach has gained much traction as there exist less off-target effects and in general larger and more reproducible silencing effects through the use of dCas9 compared to RNAi screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heintze J, Luft C, Ketteler R | title = A CRISPR CASe for high-throughput silencing | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 4 | pages = 193 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24109485 | pmc = 3791873 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2013.00193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, because the dCas9 approach to gene silencing can be quantitatively controlled, a researcher can now precisely control the extent to which a gene of interest is repressed allowing more questions about gene regulation and gene [[stoichiometry]] to be answered.

Beyond direct binding of dCas9 to transcriptionally sensitive positions of loci, dCas9 can be fused to a variety of modulatory protein domains to carry out a myriad of functions. Recently, dCas9 has been fused to [[chromatin]] remodeling proteins(HDACs/HATs) to reorganize the chromatin structure around various loci.&lt;ref name="pmid23761437" /&gt; This is an important in targeting various eukaryotic genes of interest as heterochromatin structures hinder Cas9 binding. Furthermore, because Cas9 can react to [[heterochromatin]], it is theorized that this enzyme can be further applied to studying the chromatin structure of various loci.&lt;ref name="pmid23761437" /&gt; Additionally, dCas9 has been employed in genome wide screens of gene repression. By employing large libraries of guide RNAs capable of targeting thousands of genes, genome wide genetic screens using dCas9 have been conducted.&lt;ref name="pmid25307932"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert LA, Horlbeck MA, Adamson B, Villalta JE, Chen Y, Whitehead EH, Guimaraes C, Panning B, Ploegh HL, Bassik MC, Qi LS, Kampmann M, Weissman JS | title = Genome-Scale CRISPR-Mediated Control of Gene Repression and Activation | journal = Cell | volume = 159 | issue = 3 | pages = 647–61 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25307932 | pmc = 4253859 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method for silencing transcription with Cas9 is to directly cleave mRNA products with the catalytically active Cas9 enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Connell MR, Oakes BL, Sternberg SH, East-Seletsky A, Kaplan M, Doudna JA | title = Programmable RNA recognition and cleavage by CRISPR/Cas9 | journal = Nature | volume = 516 | issue = 7530 | pages = 263–6 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25274302 | pmc = 4268322 | doi = 10.1038/nature13769 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is made possible by hybridizing ssDNA with a PAM complement sequence to ssRNA allowing for a dsDNA-RNA PAM site for Cas9 binding. This technology makes available the ability to isolate endogenous RNA transcripts in cells without the need to induce chemical modifications to RNA or RNA tagging methods.

=== Transcription activation by dCas9 fusion proteins ===
In contrast to silencing genes, dCas9 can also be used to activate genes when fused to transcription activating factors.&lt;ref name="pmid23761437" /&gt; These factors include subunits of bacterial RNA Polymerase II and traditional transcription factors in eukaryotes. Recently, genome-wide screens of transcription activation have also been accomplished using dCas9 fusions named ‘CRISPRa’ for activation.&lt;ref name="pmid25307932" /&gt;

=== Possible Solutions to Bacterium Cas-9 Editing ===
Recent studies have shown that with some minor modification to the cas-9 protein it is possible to bypass the “Restriction Modification System”. The process that achieves this is called “Photospacing” which means that the cas-9 system will copy a section of DNA from the host and insert it as a spacer gene into its own genome.&lt;ref&gt;Barrangou R, Fremaux C, Deveau H, Richards M, Boyaval P, Moineau S, Romero DA, Horvath P. 2007 CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes. Science 315, 1709–1712.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though we do not fully understand why “photospacers” work we do understand what they do. When a prokaryote “senses” a part of its own genetic coding inside the foreign entity it is less likely to destroy the cas-9 insertion. This is known as the beginning of cas-9 immunity.&lt;ref name="Fineran_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fineran PC, Charpentier E | title = Memory of viral infections by CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems: acquisition of new information | journal = Virology | volume = 434 | issue = 2 | pages = 202–9 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23123013 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2012.10.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;big&gt;Patent Landscape&lt;/big&gt; ==
As of November 2018, CRISPR-Cas9 patent landscape is dominated by universities and research institutes over commercial companies. US and Chinese academic institutions are actively pursuing research activities in CRISPR domain. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) holds the largest patent portfolio in CRISPR-Cas9 technology with 103 IP assets. Several new Chinese players like University of China Agricultural, University of Shanghai Jiao Tong, University of Northwest A&amp;F, and Institute of Genetics &amp; Developmental Biology, CAS have been key applicants from 2015 onward.

The '''Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology''' (CEH) is the [[United Kingdom]]'s Centre of Excellence for integrated research in [[hydrology]], terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and their interaction with the atmosphere. As part of the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC), it provides services based on innovative, independent and interdisciplinary science and long-term environmental monitoring, forming an integral part of NERC's strategy.

The Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology is one of four environmental research organisations wholly owned by NERC, along with the [[British Geological Survey]], the [[British Antarctic Survey]] and the [[National Oceanography Centre]]. The single organisation CEH was established in 2000 from the combination of four existing NERC research centres. &lt;ref name="peer.eu1" /&gt;

The Centre operates from four sites across the UK: [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] (headquarters), [[Edinburgh]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] (jointly with the [[Lancaster Environment Centre]]) and [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]] (jointly with [[Bangor University]]).

The current director is Mark J. Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=How CEH operates |url=http://www.ceh.ac.uk/science/operate.html |publisher=[[Natural Environment Research Council]] |work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology website |accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319192933/http://ceh.ac.uk/science/operate.html |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past directors include [[Pat Nuttall]] (2001–11).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= |title=Professor Mark Bailey becomes acting Director of the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology |url=http://www.ceh.ac.uk/news/news_archive/acting-director-ceh_2011_07.html |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=[[Natural Environment Research Council]] |work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology website |accessdate=16 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723165002/http://ceh.ac.uk/news/news_archive/acting-director-ceh_2011_07.html |archivedate=23 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4496">The '''Centre for Human Bioethics''' is a research and teaching centre at [[Monash University]], based in the Faculty of [[Monash University Faculty of Arts|Arts]]. It focusses on the branch of [[ethics]] known as [[bioethics]], a field relating to biological science and medicine. It was founded in October 1980 by Professors [[Peter Singer]] and [[Helga Kuhse]],&lt;ref name="books.publishing.monash.edu"&gt;http://books.publishing.monash.edu/apps/bookworm/view/A+Companion+to+Philosophy+in+Australia+and+New+Zealand/51/xhtml/chapter12a.html#chapter12sec16{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the first centre in Australia devoted to bioethics, and one of the first in the world.&lt;ref name=artsmonash&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became well known during the 1980s as one of the leading bodies studying the ethical implications of the rapid advances in science and technology, such as [[in-vitro fertilisation]]. The Centre's founder, [[Peter Singer]], is probably the world's best-known bioethicist, and while Director of the Centre, he produced a number of ground-breaking publications in the field. This included ''The Reproduction Revolution'', ''Should the Baby Live?'' and ''[[Practical Ethics]]''. He also founded the journal [[Bioethics (journal)|''Bioethics'']] with [[Helga Kuhse]], and established the [[International Association for Bioethics]].&lt;ref name=artsmonash/&gt;

Today, it continues its strong focus on research, but also provides undergraduate, postgraduate and industry-based education. It undertakes extensive teaching to health professionals. It is particularly well known for its Master of Bioethics degree, founded in 1989 as one of the first of its kind in the world. In June 2014, the length of this course was increased to become a two-year full-time course. The current Director of the Centre is Professor [[Michael Selgelid]]. Previous to this, Dr [[Justin Oakley]], a [[virtue ethicist]] who was one of the first graduates of the Centre's Master of Bioethics program, was Director, but become Deputy Director in the 2010s to spend more time on his research.

In addition to their teaching and research commitments, staff from the Centre also carry out consultancy work for numerous government bodies and law reform agencies, including the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name=monashwho&gt;{{cite web

The Centre is also home to the ''Monash Bioethics Review'', the only peer-reviewed bioethics journal in Australia.&lt;ref name=artsmonash/&gt;

The Centre is part of an international network established by the [[University of Tokyo]] to promote collaborative research and teaching links between eight of the world's leading bioethics centres, including the Hastings Centre in New York and the Ethox Centre at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="books.publishing.monash.edu"/&gt;

In '''computing with words and perceptions (CWP)''', the [[object (computer science)|objects of computation]] are [[words]], [[perception]]s, and [[proposition]]s drawn from a [[natural language]].  The central theme of CWP is the concept of a [[Constraint (mathematics)|generalised constraint]].  The meaning of a proposition is expressed as a generalised constraint.

CWP is a necessary tool when the available information is perception-based or not precise enough to use numbers.

[[File:52-aspetti di vita quotidiana, amore,Taccuino Sanitatis, Cas.jpg|thumb|240px|Illustration from ''[[Tacuinum Sanitatis]]'', a medieval handbook on wellness.]]
In many traditions and statutes of civil or religious law, the '''consummation of a marriage''', often called simply ''consummation'', is the first (or first officially credited) act of [[sexual intercourse]] between two people, either following their [[marriage]] to each other or after a prolonged romantic attraction. The definition of consummation usually refers to penile-vaginal sexual penetration, but some religious doctrines hold that there is an additional requirement that there must ''not'' be any [[contraception]] used.&lt;ref name="pcd"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hardon, S.J. | first=John | authorlink=John Hardon | isbn=0-385-23238-1 | title=Pocket Catholic Dictionary | page=91 | publisher=Image Books | contribution=Consummated Marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious, cultural, or legal significance of consummation may arise from theories of marriage as having the purpose of producing legally recognized descendants of the partners, or of providing sanction to their sexual acts together, or both, and its absence may amount to treating a marriage ''ceremony'' as falling short of ''completing'' the state of being married, or as creating a marriage which may later be repudiated. Thus in some legal systems a marriage may be [[annulled]] if it has not been consummated. Consummation is also relevant in the case of a [[common law marriage]]. The importance of consummation has led to the development of various [[bedding ritual]]s.

In addition to these formal and literal usages, the term also exists in informal and less precise usage to refer to a sexual landmark in relationships of varying intensity and duration.

==Legislation==

===Civil marriage===

The relevance of consummation in a [[civil marriage]] varies by jurisdiction. For example, under section 12 of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]], a refusal or inability to consummate a marriage is a ground of [[Annulment#Annulment in England and Wales|annulment in England and Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18?view=extent#section-12 Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (c. 18), s. 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511201916/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18?view=extent |date=2018-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this only applies to heterosexual marriage, because Paragraph 4 of schedule 4 of the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]] specifically excludes non-consummation as a ground for the annulment of a [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/30/schedule/4/paragraph/4|title=Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315132422/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/30/schedule/4/paragraph/4|archivedate=2016-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[common law]] jurisdictions, such as [[Australia]], have abolished the legal concept of consummation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Publications/Family+Court+of+Australia+publications/FCOA_Applying_decree_nullity |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527114938/http://familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Publications/Family+Court+of+Australia+publications/FCOA_Applying_decree_nullity |archivedate=2015-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Note''': in Australia non-consummation as ground of annulment was abolished in 1975; see Dickey, A. (2007) ''Family Law'' (5th Ed) Also in 1975, Australia introduced no-fault divorce, so specific grounds of divorce such as adultery, cruelty, desertion, have all been abolished.{{cite web |url=http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Family+Law+Principles/No+fault+divorce/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316232908/http://www.familylawcourts.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/FLC/Home/Family+Law+Principles/No+fault+divorce/ |archivedate=2015-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law marriage===

{{Main article|Common-law marriage|Common-law marriage in the United States}}
In this case, usually, consummation, as well as cohabitation, are important, they are needed - together with the presentation of the parties to society as spouses - in order to create the marriage itself.

===Religious marriage===

A religious marriage without civil registration may or may not be legally binding. However, in some (mostly [[Muslim]]-majority) countries such as Israel, Egypt, Syria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = UNHCR | url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,464db4f52,465161be2,3ae6ad796b,0.html | title = Syria: Social repercussions of a marriage between a male Druze and a Muslim woman | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121019190012/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,464db4f52,465161be2,3ae6ad796b,0.html | archivedate = 2012-10-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://jordan.usembassy.gov/acs_marriage_in_jordan2.html |title=Marriage in Jordan |publisher=Jordan embassy |place=USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006030656/http://jordan.usembassy.gov/acs_marriage_in_jordan2.html |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; UAE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.dubaifaqs.com/marriage-in-dubai.php | title = Marriage and weddings | publisher = Dubai, UAE FAQs | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110903010415/http://www.dubaifaqs.com/marriage-in-dubai.php | archivedate = 2011-09-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Libya, Mauritania and Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://bccvisalaw.com/marriage/marriage_in_indonesia.php | title = Marriage in Indonesia | publisher = BCC Visa Law | deadurl = no | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110920040604/http://bccvisalaw.com/marriage/marriage_in_indonesia.php | archivedate = 2011-09-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  religious marriage is the only legally binding marriage.

Consummation is in particular relevant in a [[Marriage in  the Catholic Church|Catholic marriage]]. Within the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]], if a matrimonial celebration takes place (ratification) but the spouses have not yet engaged in intercourse (consummation), then the marriage is said to be a marriage ''[[ratum sed non consummatum]]''. Such a marriage, regardless of the reason for non-consummation, can be dissolved by the [[pope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P6R.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105060902/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P6R.HTM|archivedate=2007-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an inability or an intentional refusal to consummate the marriage is probable grounds for an [[Declaration of nullity|annulment]]. [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] defines a marriage as consummated when the "spouses have performed between themselves in a human fashion a conjugal act which is suitable in itself for the procreation of offspring, to which marriage is ordered by its nature and by which the spouses become one flesh."&lt;ref&gt;canon 1061 §1&lt;/ref&gt; Thus some theologians, such as [[John Hardon|Fr. John A. Hardon, S.J.]], state that intercourse with [[contraception]] does not consummate a marriage.&lt;ref name="pcd"/&gt;

==Traditions==
Traditionally, in many cultures, for example in Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures (where Islam and Hinduism is followed and sex before marriage is not allowed), consummation was an important act because it was the act which proved the bride's [[virginity]]; the presence of blood was erroneously taken as definitive confirmation that the woman was indeed a virgin.&lt;ref&gt;''Marriage Customs of the World: From Henna to Honeymoons'', by George Monger, pp 82-84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In the [[family law]] defining [[civil marriage]] in some jurisdictions, particularly those where the civil [[marriage law]]s remain influenced by [[religion]] (albeit they are officially secular) non-consummation of a marriage may be a ground for [[annulment]] (an annulment is different from a [[divorce]] because it usually acts retrospectively). This stipulation has been in recent years heavily criticized on a wide variety of grounds, ranging from the mixing of religious doctrine into secular law, to being degrading to women given its negative historical connotations of ownership of the wife.&lt;ref name="Family Law pp. 96-99"&gt;''Family Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'', by Sonia Harris-Short, Joanna Miles, pp. 96-99&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the purpose of this ground is not clear: it is neither procreation (the act need not end in pregnancy, and neither is there a need of the ''possibility'' of it, given the fact the consummation is legally valid even if one or both parties is sterile), neither is it the expectation of sexual satisfaction in marriage (one single act of sexual intercourse is sufficient, even if the spouse following the consummation says he/she will never again engage in intercourse).&lt;ref&gt;''Body Lore and Laws Essays on Law and the Human Body'', edited by: Andrew Bainham, Shelley Day Sclater, Martin Richards, pp 171- 182&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Bainham argues that this law (in [[England and Wales]]) is outdated and must be abolished "in a modern society committed to equality and human rights in personal relationships".&lt;ref&gt;''Body Lore and Laws Essays on Law and the Human Body'', edited by: Andrew Bainham, Shelley Day Sclater, Martin Richards, pp 175&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 report, the Law Society’s Law Reform Committee of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] advocated abolishing the concept of a [[voidable marriage]] altogether (since divorce had been introduced in 1996) and criticized the consummation ground, writing the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawsociety.ie/Documents/committees/lawreform/Nullity2.pdf|title=Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=www.lawsociety.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092125/https://www.lawsociety.ie/Documents/committees/lawreform/Nullity2.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The rationale behind this ground is not immediately apparent. It is not concerned with the capacity of either or both parties to procreate, still less with the ability of the parties to satisfy each other sexually during the marriage. [...] It remains a rather curious anomaly in the law, a relic perhaps of medieval times, when the first act of intercourse was thought to 'mark' a new bride as the 'property' of her husband. Whatever its origins, it is not entirely clear what modern purpose this ground serves and it is suggested that it should be dispensed with.

Another concern is [[sexual violence]], especially since in most countries the criminalization of [[marital rape]] is recent, having occurred from the 1970s onwards; the maintaining in law of the concept of consummation is argued to foster cultural and societal attitudes and understandings of marriage that make it more difficult to acknowledge these violations; and to be a remainder of an oppressive tradition.&lt;ref name="Family Law pp. 96-99"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solicitorsjournal.com/blog/case-point-consummation-legal-oddity|title=Case in point - Is consummation a legal oddity? - Solicitors Journal|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100405/http://www.solicitorsjournal.com/blog/case-point-consummation-legal-oddity|archivedate=2015-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the case of ''R v R'', which criminalised marital rape in England and Wales, Harris-Short and Miles write:

:[A] historical view again throws useful light on the matter: until 1991, husbands were permitted to have sexual intercourse with their wives regardless of whether they were then actually consenting, the husband to sexual relations thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;''Family Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'', by Sonia Harris-Short, Joanna Miles, pp. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html|title=R. v R [1991] UKHL 12 (23 October 1991)|website=Bailii.org|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Fallows''' (born 20 December 1945)&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;Rosemary Williamson; {{GroveMusic|id=47084|label=Fallows, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an English [[Musicology|musicologist]] specializing in music of the [[ars nova|late Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and the [[performance practice]] of music. He is a leader in fifteenth-century music studies, particularly [[Guillaume Dufay]]&lt;!-- Do not change to Du Fay, since Dufay is Fallows's preferred spelling--&gt;, [[Josquin des Prez]], and secular song.

==Biography==
Fallows was born in [[Buxton]]. He received his [[Bachelors of Arts|BA]] from [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], his Masters of Music from [[King's College, London]], and his Ph.D. (1978) from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/David.fallows/|title=Research page at University of Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an early music performer as a [[viol]] player and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|continuo]] [[harpsichord]]ist, performing with the [[Studio der frühen Musik]], [[Musica Mundana]], and [[Musica Reservata (group)|Musica Reservata]].&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt;

He taught at the [[University of Manchester]] starting in 1976, where he is now Emeritus Professor of Musicology. Visiting appointments include [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]], [[University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]], [[École Normale Supérieure]], [[University of Basel]], [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of Vienna]]. He received the [[Dent Medal]] in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rma.ac.uk/awards/dent_medal.htm|title=RMA Awards and Grants: The Dent Medal}}&lt;/ref&gt; became [[Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] in 1994, a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] in 1997, a Corresponding Member of the [[American Musicological Society]] in 1999, and an Honorary Member of the [[Royal Musical Association]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rma.ac.uk/awards/honorary_members.htm|title=Honorary Members of the Royal Musical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2002–2007, he was president of the [[International Musicological Society]].

His contributions were honoured with a [[Festschrift]], ''Essays on Renaissance Music in Honour of David Fallows: Bon jour, bon mois, et bonne estrenne.''&lt;ref name="festschrift"&gt;Fabrice Fitch and Jacobijn Kiel, editors, ''Essays on Renaissance Music in Honour of David Fallows: Bon jour, bon mois, et bonne estrenne.'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
David Fallows's work has been called "pioneering" on the lives of composers and of the ensembles that performed music,&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt; and having covered "just about every aspect of fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century music."&lt;ref&gt;Noel O'Regan, review of the Festschrift in ''Music and Letters,'' 93.3 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Among Fallows's first publications was, "Ciconia padre e figlio" (Ciconia: father and son; 1976), which theorized that the current biography of [[Johannes Ciconia]] was primarily that of his father, and that the composer himself was born about thirty-five years later.&lt;ref&gt;Giuliano Di Bacco and John Nádas, "Ciconia, Johannes: 1. Life" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 2nd Edition (London: Macmillan, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has become the accepted biography of the composer. Also during his doctoral studies he reconstructed the origins of the important fourteenth-century polyphonic manuscripts in [[Cambrai]] ("L'origine du MS. 1328 de Cambrai"). His 1978 dissertation, "[[Robert Morton (composer)|Robert Morton]]'s Songs" was among Fallows's first works on English Renaissance music and fifteenth-century song, repertories that have concerned him throughout his life (including in his 2014 [[Musica Britannica]] volume on English song, 1380–1480). These studies formed the basis for his comprehensive ''A Catalogue of Polyphonic Songs, 1415–1480'' (Oxford 1999). A major article on the life of [[Johannes Regis]] (1989) also had a transformative impact on the understanding of the composer. His 2009 study of the life and works of [[Josquin des Prez]] (Brepols) has been praised for understanding the conflicting information recently unearthed about the composer as well as presenting new hypotheses and understanding of the composer's music in light of new discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D. Fallows, ''Josquin''|url=http://www.brepols.net/Pages/ShowProduct.aspx?prod_id=IS-9782503530659-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallows's 1982 monograph ''Dufay'' is the principal reference work on the life and works of the composer [[Guillaume Dufay]]. He has edited and introduced facsimile publications of the Songbook of [[Henry VIII]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item101064.html|title=Songs written by Henry VIII|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the manuscript [[Bodleian Library|Oxford]], Canon. Misc 213, the [[Chansonnier Cordiforme]], and others. As senior consulting editor for [[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]], Fallows contributed many major articles along with many small articles on musical diacritics (tempo and expression marks) and miscellany such as "Spoof Articles."&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows, "{{GroveMusic|id=53081|label=Spoof articles|linkonly=t}}," in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 2nd Edition (London: Macmillan, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David S. Muir''' (born 4 January 1971) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] marketing and [[political communications]] professional. He was Director of Political Strategy for [[British prime minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] between 2008 and 2010.

==Biography==
Muir was born in Falkirk and attended his local comprehensive [[Falkirk High School]]. In 1988 attended the [[University of Glasgow]]. In 1992 he graduated with a MA Hons 1st Class in Politics and Economics. He also won the Alistair Reid Prize for Politics for the outstanding study of politics and an ESU Scholarship to work with the US politician [[Byron Dorgan]]. He later graduated from [[London Business School]] with a [[Master of Business Administration]].

==Career==
In 1992 Muir joined the advertising agency [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], becoming New Business Director until taking a leave of absence to complete his MBA in 1999. In 2001 he returned to Ogilvy where he focussed on expanding the group through organic growth and acquisitions. In 2003 he wrote with Jon Miller ''The Business of Brands'', looking at how businesses could nurture and value their brands.

In 2005 he moved over to [[WPP plc|WPP]] to take over "The Channel" from Mandy Pooler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Tylee |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/233834/Muir-takes-Channel/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH |title=Muir takes over at The Channel - advertising news - Campaign |publisher=Campaignlive.co.uk |date=2005-01-28 |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he helped develop WPP's research tool Brandz where he developed the BrandZ Top 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.brandrepublic.com/blogs/ritson_on_brand/archive/2006/03/08/millward-brown-optimors-valuation-of-brands.aspx |title=Millward Brown Optimor's Valuation of Brands - Ritson on Brand - Blogs - Brand Republic |publisher=Community.brandrepublic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at The Channel he also developed Sportz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/press/default.htm?guid={1ea68e94-3aec-45c4-b8f8-a4dc6928d17e} |title=sports specialist companies launch global sports brands study: SportZ |publisher=WPP |date=2003-03-11 |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows global brands to evaluate sponsorship opportunities.

===Downing Street===
In 2008 Muir left WPP to become the British prime minister, [[Gordon Brown]]'s, Director of Political Strategy, replacing [[Spencer Livermore]] who had left&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/536926/team-brown-strengthens.thtml |title=Team Brown strengthens |publisher=The Spectator |date= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Downing Street Muir was the Prime Ministers leading political adviser after Stephen Carter left. He along with Kirsty McNeill developed Brown's "No time for a novice speech" at the 2008 Labour Party Conference which was "warmly received".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7630567.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK Politics &amp;#124; No time for a novice, says Brown |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4813281.ece ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513035509/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4813281.ece |date=13 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muir worked closely with [[Peter Mandelson]] and [[Philip Gould]] on the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] campaign. He was the lead negotiator of the historic British TV Election Debates and was an early proponent of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100418101319/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/election_2010/article7018474.ece ]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is believed to have argued for a hard edged attack on the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and their threat to middle income earners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Wintour, political editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/15/peter-mandelson-memoirs-brown-economy |title=Peter Mandelson on Brown: 'We were in a pit of debt. And we kept on digging' &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=The Guardian |date= 15 July 2010|accessdate=2011-05-26 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular he pushed for the campaign to focus on the threat the Conservative's posed to child tax credits. It is also believed that he supported Gordon Brown's decision not to serve a full term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Wintour, political editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/18/gordon-brown-ed-balls-resignation |title=Gordon Brown tried to announce resignation before election &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=The Guardian |date= 18 May 2010|accessdate=2011-05-26 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign denied the Conservatives an overall majority and Muir was part of small team that spent the next five days in discussions with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Muir left Downing Street when Gordon Brown resigned in May 2010.

Its yellow color owing to the large amount of [[incandescent]] soot particles in the incomplete combustion reaction of the flame.The definitive yellow colour is largely due to the excitation of the CH radicals in the flame.&lt;ref&gt;Glassman,I., Yetter, R.A. (2008) Combustion. 4th Edition&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
[[File:Fire breathing 2 Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|300px|right|In a '''diffusion flame''', combustion takes place at the flame surface only, where the fuel meets oxygen in the [[flammability limit|right concentration]] - the interior of the flame contains unburnt fuel.  This is opposite to combustion in a [[premixed flame]].  The fire breather's spurting of fuel (likely [[kerosene]]), combined with strong [[convection]] flows due to intense heat gives a [[turbulent]] diffusion flame.]]

In [[combustion]], a '''diffusion flame''' is a [[flame]] in which the [[oxidizer]] combines with the [[fuel]] by [[diffusion]]. As a result, the flame speed is limited by the rate of diffusion.{{cn|date=October 2011}} Diffusion flames tend to burn slower and to produce more soot than [[premixed flame]]s because there may not be sufficient oxidizer for the reaction to go to completion, although there are some exceptions to the rule. The soot typically produced in a diffusion flame becomes [[incandescent]] from the heat of the flame and lends the flame its readily identifiable orange-yellow color. Diffusion flames tend to have a less-localized flame front than premixed flames.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

The contexts for diffusion may vary somewhat. For instance, a [[candle]] uses the heat of the flame itself to [[vaporize]] its [[wax]] fuel and the oxidizer ([[oxygen]]) diffuses into the flame from the surrounding air, while a [[Gas lighting|gaslight]] flame (or the safety flame of a [[bunsen burner]]) uses fuel already in the form of a vapor. 

Diffusion flames are often studied in [[Counter flow burner|counter flow]] (also called opposed jet) burners.{{cn|date=October 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glassman|first=Irvin|last2=Yetter|first2=Richard A.|title=Combustion|publisher=Academic Press|location=Burlington|year=2008|chapter=6. Diffusion Flames|isbn=978-0-12-088573-2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780120885732000063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their interest is due to possible application in the flamelet model for turbulent combustion. Furthermore they provide a convenient way to examine strained flames and flames with holes. These are also known under the name of "edge flames", characterized by a local extinction on their axis because of the high strain rates in the vicinity of the stagnation point.

Diffusion flames have an entirely different appearance in a [[microgravity]] environment.  There is no convection to carry the hot combustion products away from the fuel source, which results in a spherical flame front, such as in the candle seen here. This is a rare example of a diffusion flame which does not produce much soot and does not therefore have a typical yellow flame.

'''Directory-based coherence''' is a mechanism to handle [[Cache coherence]] problem in [[Distributed shared memory]] (DSM) a.k.a. [[Non-uniform memory access|Non-Uniform Memory Access]] (NUMA). Another popular way is to use a special type of computer [[Bus (computing)|bus]] between all the nodes as a "shared bus" (a.k.a. [[System bus]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of parallel computer architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=319–360|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directory-based coherence uses a special [[Directory (computing)|directory]] to serve instead of the shared bus in the bus-based coherence protocols. Both of these designs use the corresponding medium (i.e. directory or bus) as tool to facilitate the communication between different [[Node (networking)|nodes]], and to guarantee that the coherence protocol is working properly along all the communicating nodes. In directory based cache coherence, this is done by using this directory to keep track of the status of all [[Cache memory|cache]] blocks, the status of each block includes in which cache coherence "[[State (computer science)|state]]" that block is, and which nodes are sharing that block at that time, which can be used to eliminate the need to [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] all the signals to all nodes, and only send it to the nodes that are interested in this single block.

Following are a few advantages and disadvantages of the directory based cache coherence protocol:
* '''Scalability''': This is one of the strongest motivations for going to directory based designs. What we mean by [[scalability]], in short,  is how good a specific system is in handling the growing amount of work that it is responsible to do . For this criteria, Bus based systems cannot do well due to the limitation caused when having a shared bus that all nodes are using in the same time. For a relatively small number of nodes, bus systems can do well. However, while the number of nodes is growing, some problems may occur in this regard. Especially since only one node is allowed to use the bus at a time, which will significantly harm the performance of the overall system. On the other hand, using directory-based systems, there will be no such bottleneck to constrain the scalability of the system.
* '''Simplicity''': This is one of the points where bus-system is superior. Since the bus structure itself can serve as an organizer for all the traffic that goes through the system, and ensure the [[Atomicity (database systems)|atomicity]] of all the signals passed through. Thus, there will be no need to put more effort in ensuring atomicity and ordering between signals as the case in directory based systems, which leads to several overhead faced in the later system design when dealing with issues like [[Consistency model|consistency]].
According to the above discussion, it is clear that using bus based systems seems more attractive for relatively small systems. However, directory based systems become crucial when the system scale up and the number of nodes grows. So there is a kind of [[trade-off]] between the simplicity and the scalability when comparing between Bus-based and Directory-based cache coherence designs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The idea of Directory-based cache coherence systems begun long time ago. Although the idea of '''DASH''' ('''D'''irectory '''A'''rchitecture for '''SH'''ared-memory) was first proposed by C.K. Tang&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=C.K.|title=Cache system design in the tightly coupled multiprocessor system|journal=AFIPS '76 Proceedings of the June 7–10, 1976, national computer conference and exposition|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid 1970s. However, applying it to cache coherence was proposed a few years later, specifically in 1978, when researchers at [[Stanford University|Stanford university]] proposed the first version of this coherence systems called [[Stanford DASH]], in a paper&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Directory-Based Cache Coherence Protocol for the DASH Multiprocessor|url=http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kubitron/cs258/handouts/papers/p148-lenoski.pdf|journal=Computer Systems Laboratory|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that described the system with the difficulties and improvements that come with such designs. Beside this approach, several attempts were done to provide a scalable systems. For instance, [[BBN Butterfly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=G.E.|title=The Butterfly Parallel Processor|journal=In proc. of ICS|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was introduced in 1985, and IBM PR3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The IBM research parallel processor prototype PR3: Introduction and architicture|journal=In proceeding of the 1985 International conference of Parallel processing|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was introduced in 1987, are some examples of [[Multiprocessor system-on-chip|multiprocessor systems]] that are scalable. However, both of these systems have a drawback; For example, BBN Butterfly does not have caches. Similarly, IBM PR3 does not provide hardware cache coherence, which limits the performance of both of these designs, especially when employing high performance processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Design of Scalable Shared-Memory Multiprocessors: The DASH approach|journal=Computer system laboratory, Stanford University|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This limitation in the other competitors, made it easier for DASH based systems to get chosen for design cache coherence systems and all other systems that need scalabality in cache-based nodes. In 1985, James Archibald&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ece.byu.edu/faculty/jka|title=James Archibald|website=ece.byu.edu|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean-Loup Baer]] from the [[University of Washington]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|title=An economical solution to the cache coherence problem|journal=ISCA '84 Proceedings of the 11th annual international symposium on Computer architecture|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that proposes a more economical, expandable, and modular variation of the "global directory" approach in the term of hardware use in the design.

In 1992, Daniel Lenoski from Stanford university published a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenoski|first=Daniel|last2=Laudon|first2=James|last3=Gharachorloo|first3=Kourosh|last4=Weber|first4=Wolf-Dietrich|last5=Gupta|first5=Anoop|last6=Hennessy|first6=John|last7=Horowitz|first7=Mark|last8=Lam|first8=Monica S.|date=1992-03-01|title=The Stanford Dash Multiprocessor|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/2.121510|journal=Computer|volume=25|issue=3|pages=63–79|doi=10.1109/2.121510|issn=0018-9162}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposing advances in cache coherence protocols for directory-based systems. In a 1996 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laudon|first=James|last2=Lenoski|first2=Daniel|date=1997-01-01|title=The SGI Origin: A ccNUMA Highly Scalable Server|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/264107.264206|journal=Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture|series=ISCA '97|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=241–251|doi=10.1145/264107.264206|isbn=0897919017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he introduced the design of the [[SGI Origin 2000]], a family of server computers employing directory based cache coherence. The subsequent [[Origin 3000]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support1-sgi.custhelp.com/|title=Support Home Page|last=Corp.|first=Silicon Graphics International|website=support1-sgi.custhelp.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in July 2000.

== Protocols ==
Unlike [[Snoopy cache|Snoopy]] coherence protocols, in a directory based coherence approach, the information about which caches have a copy of a block is maintained in a structure called ''Directory''. In a directory based scheme, participating caches do not broadcast requests to all other sharing caches of the block in order to locate cached copies, instead it queries the directory to retrieve the information about which block have cached copies and sends only to those particular processors and hence traffic saving compared to a snoopy protocol is large. In well optimized applications, most data sharing is only for data that is read only, and there is little sharing for data that is frequently read and written. A directory approach can result in a substantial traffic saving compared to broadcast/snoopy approach in such applications.

[[File:Directory Scheme.png|thumb|&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Parallel Multicore Architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=319–361|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directory-based coherence scheme overview diagram showing various actors and messages.|538x538px]]

As shown in the data flow diagram, the actors involved in a distributed shared memory system implementing directory based coherence protocol are:
* '''Requestor Node''' : This node is the processor who is requesting for a read/write of a memory block.
* '''Directory Node''' : This node maintains the information of the state of each cache block in the system and requestor directs its requests to the directory node. 
* '''Owner Node:''' An owner node owns the most recent state of the cache block, note that directory might not be always up to date with latest data.
* '''Sharer Node''': One or many node which are sharing a copy of the cache block.
[[File:Directory Protocol State transtion diagram.png|thumb|Image 1: State transition diagram for directory based protocol|353x353px]]Requestor and Owner nodes maintain their state transition similar to a snoopy coherence protocols like [[MESI protocol]]. However, unlike a bus based implementation where nodes communicate using a common bus, directory based implementation uses [[Message Passing Interface|message passing]] model to exchange information required for maintaining [[cache coherence]].

Directory node acts as a serializing point and all communications are directed through this node to maintain correctness.

== Directory Node ==
A directory node keeps track of the overall state of a cache block in the entire cache system for all processors. It can be in three states :
* '''Uncached (U):''' No processor has data cached, memory up-to-date .
* '''Shared (S)''': one or more processors have data cached, memory up-to-date. In this state directory and sharers have clean copy of the cached block. 
* '''Exclusive/Modified (EM):''' one processor (owner) has data cached; memory out-of-date. Note that directory can not distinguish a block cached in an exclusive or modified state at the processor as processors can transition from an exclusive state to modified state with out any bus transaction.
Explanation of the Directory state transition [[Finite-state machine|Finite State Machine]] (refer image 1) is captured below in the table:
{| class="wikitable"
!Initial State
!Bus Request
!Response/ Action
!New State
|-
|'''U'''
|'''BusRd'''  or 
'''BusRdX'''
|
* Fetch block from memory as the directory is having the updated copy of the block.
* send the memory block to requestor using the message ('''ReplyD).'''
* if there are no sharers : requestor = first sharer, directory transitions into EM state.
|EM
|-
|'''EM'''
|'''BusRd'''
|
* Send intervention('''Int''') to the Owner
|S
|-
|
|'''BusRdX'''
|
* Send Invalidation('''Inv''') to the current owner.
| -
|-
|'''S'''
|'''BusRd'''
|

| -
|-
|
|'''BusRdX'''
|
* Reply to the requestor with the memory block ('''ReplyD''')
* Invalidate('''Inv''') all sharers.
|EM
|-
|
|'''BusUpgr'''
|
* Invalidate('''Inv''') all sharers.
* Reply to the requestor that he can upgrade .('''Reply''')
|EM
|}

In addition to cache state, a directory must track which processors have data when in the shared state. This is required to for sending invalidation and intervention requests to the individual processor caches which have the cache block in shared state. Few of the popular implementation approaches are: 
* '''Full bit-vector''': A bit field for each processor at the directory node are maintained. The storage overhead scales with the number of processors. 
* '''Limited pointer:''' In this approach directory information of limited number of blocks is kept at the directory to reduce storage overhead.

Please note that the protocol described above is the basic implementation and [[race condition]]s can occur due to the fact that directory can be out of sync with the caches and also messages between processors can be overlapping. More complex implementations are available like [[Scalable Coherent Interface]] which have multiple states.

DASH&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; cache coherence protocol is another protocol that uses directory-based coherence scheme. DASH protocol uses a clustered approach, where processors inside a cluster are kept coherent using bus based snooping scheme, while the clusters are connected in a directory approach. Even though various protocols use different implementations for tracking cache blocks, however the concept of directory remains same.

'''Electric motorsport''' (also known as '''electric racing''' or '''electric motor racing''') is a category of motor sport that consists of the racing of electric powered vehicles for competition, either in all-electric series, or in open-series against vehicles with different power trains. Very early in the history of automobiles, electric cars held several performance records over [[internal combustion engine]] cars, such as [[Land speed record#1898.E2.80.931965 .28wheel-driven.29|land speed records]], but fell behind in performance during the first decade of the 20th century. With the renaissance of electric vehicles during the early 21st century, notable electric-only racing series have been developed, for both cars and motorcycles, including for example, the [[FIA Formula E Championship]]. In other racing events, electric vehicles are competing alongside combustion engine vehicles, for example in the [[Isle of Man TT]] and the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]], and in some cases winning outright.

==History==

===Background and early powertrains===
{{Overly detailed|section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Goldsworthy Gurney steam carriage - Project Gutenberg eText 12496.png|thumb|The [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] [[Steam bus]], in an 1827 illustration.]]
see also: [[History of the steam engine]] and [[Locomotive#Origins|Origins of the locomotive]]

Early mechanically powered vehicles used steam power, a technology first developed for static applications (notably, [[Thomas Newcomen]] 1712 and [[James Watt]] 1765) (see [[History of the steam engine]]). Steam for vehicle traction was taken up both for road vehicles and for rail by [[Richard Trevithick]] who creating the [[Richard Trevithick#Puffing Devil|Puffing devil]] for transporting passengers by road in 1801, and later rail transport, initially for coal (1804) and then for people (Trevethick 1808, [[George Stephenson]] 1824 onwards).  By the 1830s steam began to be more widely adopted for transportation, with steam carriages for road (e.g. the 1827 [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] [[Steam bus]]) and for rail, although the latter quickly became more established for medium and longer distance travel. Mechanically powered road vehicles were largely limited to utilitarian vehicles such as [[traction engine]]s during this period (especially 1850s onwards, see [[History of steam road vehicles#Victorian Age of Steam|History of steam road vehicles]]).

[[File:Thomas Parker Electric car.jpg|thumb|Electric car built by [[Thomas Parker (inventor)|Thomas Parker]] ]]

During the 1860s diverse small experiments with personal transportation and different powertrains blossomed, with steam buggies (e.g. [[History of steam road vehicles#Henry Taylor.27s steam buggy|Henry Taylor]] 1867) and even steam motorcycles ([[History of steam road vehicles#Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede|Michaex-Perreux]] and [[History of steam road vehicles#Sylvester H. Roper|Sylvester Roper]], both around 1867-69). [[Amédée Bollée]] developed several long distance (Le Mans to Paris, 210&amp;nbsp;km) steam vehicles from 1873 onwards, including the 1878 [[Amédée Bollée#La Mancelle|La Mancelle]] of which 50 were produced, and the 1881 [[Amédée Bollée#La Rapide|La Rapide]] capable of 62&amp;nbsp;km/h (39&amp;nbsp;mph). An early electric powertrain was exhibited in November 1881 by French inventor [[Gustave Trouvé]] at the [[International Exposition of Electricity, Paris|International Exhibition of Electricity in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wakefield|first=Ernest H.|title=History of the Electric Automobile|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers|year=1994|isbn=978-1-56091-299-6|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English inventor [[Thomas Parker (inventor)|Thomas Parker]], who was responsible for innovations such as electrifying the [[London Underground]], overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel [[coalite]], built the first production electric car in [[London]] in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5212278/Worlds-first-electric-car-built-by-Victorian-inventor-in-1884.html  |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |title=World's first electric car built by Victorian inventor in 1884 |date=2009-04-24 |access-date=2009-07-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects [[smoke]] and [[pollution]] were having in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/hybrid-technology/history-of-electric-cars1.htm |title=What is the history of electric cars? |last=Fuller |first=John |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2009-04-09 |access-date=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[petrol engine|petrol/gasoline-powered]] internal combustion engine automobiles were completed almost simultaneously by several German inventors working independently: Karl Benz built his first automobile in 1885 in [[Mannheim]].  Benz was granted a patent for his automobile on 29 January 1886, and began the first production of automobiles in 1888, after [[Bertha Benz]], his wife, had proved - with the first long-distance trip in August 1888, from Mannheim to Pforzheim and back (194&amp;nbsp;km) - that the horseless coach was absolutely suitable for daily use.

Overall, there were a variety of powertrains and vehicle forms experimented with during this period, each with different advantages and disadvantages, range, reliability and speed. In terms of outright performance, different powertrains competed for the land speed record through the turn of the 20th century (see below), and it was not until 1924 onwards that internal combustion powertrains began to dominate this aspect.

===Early land speed records===
[[File:Jamais contente.jpg|thumb|[[La Jamais Contente]] electric, 1899]]
{{Main|Land speed record}}

The table below details the early history of land speed records from 1898 into the early decades of the 20th century. ''[[La Jamais Contente]]'' ({{lang-en|The Never Satisfied}}) was the first road vehicle to go over {{convert|100|km/h}}. It was an [[electric car|electric vehicle]] with a [[light alloy]] [[torpedo]] shaped bodywork and with Fulmen [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. The vehicle established the [[land speed record]] on April 29 or May 1, 1899 at [[Achères, Yvelines]] near [[Paris]], [[France]].  The vehicle had two direct drive Postel-Vinay 25&amp;nbsp;kW motors, running at 200 V drawing 124 Amperes each&lt;ref name=pdf1&gt;{{cite web | title= La Jamais Contente | url = http://www.e-mobile.ch/pdf/2005/Fact-Sheet_LaJamaisContente_FW.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EV Zero? |publisher=EV1 Club |url=http://ev1-club.power.net/torpedo.htm |accessdate=2006-10-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012220024/http://ev1-club.power.net/torpedo.htm |archivedate=2006-10-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for about 68&amp;nbsp;hp, and was equipped with [[Michelin]] [[tires]].

As of 1900, 38% of US automobiles, 33,842 cars, were powered by electricity (40% by steam, and 22% by gasoline).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Evolution of Electric Cars |first=Zachary |last=Shahan |publisher=Sustainnovate |url=http://sustainnovate.ae/en/innovators-blog/detail/evolution-of-electric-cars |access-date=2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as combustion powertrains developed, they offered a superior range than electrics, and (especially after the 1908 [[Ford Model T]], and its mass production from 1913 onwards) a much lower purchase price. In 1912 the electric starter motor was invented by [[Charles F. Kettering|Charles Kettering]] leading to easier and faster starting of internal combustion powertrains, and removing what had been perceived as one of their main drawbacks (having to use a hand crank). Electric and subsequently steam still had some performance advantages and dominated the outright speed record until 1924.  Yet the combustion engine technology benefitted from much greater market penetration and thus more development, and began to achieve greater speed performance than electrics and stream from 1924 onwards.

===21st century renaissance===
{{Main|History of the electric vehicle}}
The emergence of higher volume manufacturing of electric powertrain vehicles has allowed for economies of scale and increased research and development of electrical batteries, the critical technology in electric powertrains. Battery power density (the amount of energy stored per unit weight) has typically been the greatest drawback of electric powertrains in comparison to gasoline combustion engine powertrains. Steady advances in battery technology, [[Research in lithium-ion batteries|especially lithium-ion battery technologies]] first commercialized in the early 1990s have driven innovations in electric powertrains, and further battery advances allow them to once again compete with the combustion engine powertrains in motorsports events.

[[Electric drag racing]] is a sport where electric vehicles start from standstill and attempt the highest possible speed over a short given distance.&lt;ref name="0EX1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.0-60mag.com/news/2010/12/cars-peugeot-ex1-sets-new-electric-records/ |title=Concept Or Not, Peugeot EX1 Is One Fast EV |work=0-60mag |date=December 2010|accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes race and usually beat gasoline sports cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MythBuster: Why Electric Vehicles Beat Gas in 5 Extreme Tests |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a3244/4264025/ |publisher=Popular Mechanics |accessdate=2016-05-24 |date=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as [[NEDRA]] keep track of records worldwide using certified equipment.

At the [[Formula Student]] competition at the [[Silverstone Circuit]] in July 2013, the electric powered car of the [[ETH Zurich]] won against all cars with internal combustion engines. It is believed to be the first time that an electric vehicle has beaten cars powered by combustion engines in any accredited motorsport competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electric vehicle storms to victory in Formula Student 2013 |url=http://www.imeche.org/news/archives/2013/07/08/Electric_vehicle_storms_to_victory_in_Formula_Student_2013 |publisher=Institution of Mechanical Engineers |accessdate=2013-07-12 |date=2013-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515111913/http://www.imeche.org/news/archives/2013/07/08/Electric_vehicle_storms_to_victory_in_Formula_Student_2013 |archivedate=2016-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pikes Peak International Hill Climb===
{{main|Pikes Peak International Hill Climb}}

The [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]], also known as ''The Race to the Clouds'', is an annual automobile and motorcycle [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] to the summit of [[Pikes Peak]] in Colorado, USA. The track measures {{convert|12.42|mi|km}} over 156 turns, climbing {{convert|4720|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the start at Mile 7 on Pikes Peak Highway, to the finish at {{convert|14110|ft|m|abbr=on}}, on grades averaging 7.2%.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;''PPIHC race overview'', {{cite web |url=http://www.ppihc.com/2014-spectator-guide/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727131916/http://www.ppihc.com/2014-spectator-guide/ |archivedate=2014-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race is self sanctioned and has taken place since 1916, making it the second oldest motorsport event in the Western Hemisphere behind the Indianapolis 500.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; It is currently contested by a variety of classes of cars, trucks, motorcycles and quads. There are often numerous new classes tried and discarded year-to-year. In the modern era, electric vehicles have competed in the event since 1983 (Joe Balls, Sears Electric car). In the 2-wheeled divisions, the electric powertrains are already able to outcompete the combustion engines; the 2013 overall winner was an electric bike, the [[Lightning Motorcycle]] [[Lightning LS-218|LS-218 electric Superbike]] ridden by Carlin Dunne in a time of 10:00.694 minutes, a new course record for the 2-wheeled class.

In the 4-Wheeled Divisions, the results of recent years show that the relative improvements in race time are advancing at different rates in the electric classes compared to the unlimited/combustion engine classes. Unlimited class vehicles, with combustion engines, broke the 16 minute barrier in 1938, and have steadily improved over the subsequent decades, breaking the 10-minute barrier in 2011.&lt;ref name="ppihc.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppihc.com/race_winners_by_year/ |title=Race winners by year |website=Pikes Peak International Hill Climb |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the electric vehicle class broke the 16 minute barrier in 1994 (Katy Endicott, Honda Civic Shuttle finishing in 15:44:71 minutes), and the 10-minute barrier in 2013 (Nabuhiro 'Monster' Tajima, E-Runner finishing in 9:46:53 minutes).&lt;ref name="ppihc.com"/&gt; In the 2014 event, the Mitsubishi team ([[Mitsubishi MiEV Evolution|MiEV Evolution III]]) achieved 2nd (Greg Tracey, 9:08.188 minutes) and 3rd position (Hiroshi Masuoka, 9:12:204 minutes) - within 3 seconds and 7 seconds (respectively) of the overall fastest vehicle, a gasoline powered Norma race car.&lt;ref name="LiveTiming.net PPIHC results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://livetiming.net/ppihc/?Class= |website=Live Timing |publisher=North Country Timing &amp; Scoring and LiveTiming.net |location=US |access-date=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716194314/http://livetiming.net/ppihc/?Class= |archivedate=2014-07-16 |df= |title=Pikes Peak International Hill Climb 2018&lt;br&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The graph to the right shows the relative rates of improvement of these two classes since the 1980s.

2015 for the first time in the history of the race was an electric car to win the race outright. The winning car was the Latvian team [[Drive eO]]'s 3rd generation vehicle, eO PP03 with peak power of 1020&amp;nbsp;kW and peak torque of 2160 Nm, weighing 1200&amp;nbsp;kg. The time achieved was 9:07.222 minutes, just faster than Greg Tracey's 9:08.188 time in 2014. Second place was also earned by an electric car, the Tajima [[Rimac Automobili]] [[Rimac E-Runner Concept One|E-Runner Concept_One]] with peak power of 1100&amp;nbsp;kW, peak torque of 1500 Nm, and weighing 1500&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.electricautosport.com/2015/06/tajima-and-rimac-reveal-1100kw-electric-pikes-peak-racer-photos-and-specs/ |title=Tajima and Rimac reveal 1100kW electric Pikes Peak racer + photos and specs |first=Tim |last=Biesbrouck |work=Electric Autosport |date=2015-06-01 |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winning driver [[Rhys Millen]] said in an interview that the vehicle had lost half its tractive power (due to heat) from around the halfway point. Based on testing the team had expected a run 30 seconds faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMjsAMlXGBI |title=Rhys Millen Wins Pikes Peak First Electric Car Victory |via=YouTube |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the two above teams and drivers raced again in 2016, with evolutions of the vehicles, and were joined by a prototype '4-motor EV' from Acura based on the 2016 NSX production car, with heavy modifications to all-electric drive. The Acura, driven by Tetsuya Yamano, achieved a remarkable time for its first outing, finishing in 9:06:015 minutes, and third place overall. [[Drive eO]]'s 4th generation vehicle, eO PP100 achieved a time of 8:57:118 minutes, improving on the previous year's time and coming second overall. The winning 2016 vehicle was a combustion engine Norma driven by [[Romain Dumas]] with a time 8:51:445 minutes. The Norma has similar power to weight ratio to the PP100, but weighs half as much and as a result has better traction in corners. Dumas' team also won in an earlier version of the same vehicle in 2014 with a time of 9:05:801 minutes, thus improving by some 14 seconds over 2 years technological evolution. The Drive eO vehicle improved by some 10 seconds in one year, over its 2015 time.

In 2018, the outright winner was the all electric I.D. R Pikes Peak Prototype driven by Romain Dumas, in new overall record time 7:57.148 minutes. The previous track record stood at 8:13.878 minutes, driven by Sébastien Loeb in the 2013 [[Peugeot 208]] T16 Pikes Peak. Now that electrics have overtaken the performance of gasoline cars on Pike's Peak, it seems likely that electric cars will continue to dominate this race from 2018 onwards. Electric cars are still relatively early in their motorsport development with much room for further improvement, whereas gasoline powered cars have had over a century of development, with only incremental improvements likely to come in the future.

===Isle of Man TT===
{{main|Isle of Man TT|TT Zero}}

TT Zero is part of the [[Isle of Man TT]] and races for 1 lap (37.733 miles) of the [[Snaefell Mountain Course]]. The TT Zero event as an officially sanctioned [[Isle of Man TT]] race is for [[racing motorcycle]]s where "''The technical concept is for motorcycles (two wheeled) to be powered without the use of carbon based fuels and have zero toxic/noxious emissions''."&lt;ref&gt;''REGULATIONS TT ZERO – 2010 International Tourist Trophy – Isle of Man 29 May – 11 June'' p27 ACU Events Ltd (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural 2010 TT Zero race was won by [[Mark Miller (TT motorcycle racer)|Mark Miller]] riding a [[MotoCzysz E1pc]] motor-cycle in 23 minutes and 22.89 seconds at an average race speed of 96.820&amp;nbsp;mph for 1 lap (37.733 miles) of the Mountain Course and the first [[United States]] winner since Dave Roper won the 1984 Historic TT riding a 500cc [[Matchless]]. The TT Zero race replaced the [[TTXGP]] franchise with the simplification of the regulations&lt;ref&gt;''Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Races – Official Programme May 29–11 June 2010'' page 14 Isle of Man Department of Community, Culture &amp; Leisure – ACU Events Ltd (2010) Mannin Media Group Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; and the emphasis on electric powered motor-cycles.&lt;ref&gt;''REGULATIONS TT ZERO – 2010 International Tourist Trophy – Isle of Man 29 May – 11 June'' Appendix C page 25–27 ACU Events Ltd (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[MotoCzysz]] [[MotoCzysz E1pc|E1pc]] was also the first [[United States|American]] manufactured motor-cycle to win an Isle of Man TT Race since Oliver Godfrey won the [[1911 Isle of Man TT|1911]] [[Senior TT]] with an [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]] V-Twin motor-cycle.

The riders of the TT Zero bikes are typically those that also compete in the combustion engine classes and are very experienced on the circuit. Comparing the experience of the different powertrains, Lee Johnston said as he climbed off his electric bike in the 2015 practice sessions: “That was just mint. It feels so stable, it’s unbelievable. It’s just so peaceful. No revving.” Asked for what was memorable, he responded “I think just the peace and quiet and riding over the mountain, no noise and seeing the sunset..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cycleworld.com/2015/06/06/iomtt-victory-motorcycles-tt-qualifying-report/ |title=Victory Racing Breaks the 100mph Average Lap Speed Barrier on its First TT Practice Session |work=Cycle World |location=US |date=2015-06-06 |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TT Zero lap speeds have been improving at an average rate of around 2&amp;nbsp;mph in recent years (121.824&amp;nbsp;mph as of 2018). With more mature technology, the combustion engine bikes' [[Isle of Man TT#Fastest race lap by year|lap speeds]] in the mainstream TT have been improving at a lower rate of around 1&amp;nbsp;mph each year in recent years (135.452&amp;nbsp;mph as of 2018). It's likely that the electric bikes will surpass the combustion bikes at some point, but it may not happen until the mid to late 2020s.

===FIA World Endurance Championship===
[[File:Nissan Zeod RC.JPG|thumb|Nissan ZEOD RC, first electric vehicle to complete a lap of Le Mans]]
{{main|FIA World Endurance Championship}}

The [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] is an [[auto racing]] [[world championship]] organized by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) and sanctioned by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA).  The series usurps the ACO's former [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] which began in [[2010 Intercontinental Le Mans Cup|2010]], and is the first endurance series of world championship status since the demise of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] at the end of [[1992 World Sportscar Championship season|1992]].  The World Endurance Championship name was previously used by the FIA from [[World Sportscar Championship|1981 to 1985]].

The series feature multiple classes of cars competing in [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance races]], with [[sports prototype]]s competing in the [[Le Mans Prototype]] categories, and production-based [[grand tourer]]s competing in the [[LM GTE]] categories.  World champion titles are awarded to the top scoring manufacturers and drivers over the season,&lt;ref name="FIA WEC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/fiasport/2011/Pages/fia-wec.aspx | title = 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship | publisher = [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] | work = fia.com | date = 2011-06-03 | accessdate = 2011-06-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063434/http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/fiasport/2011/Pages/fia-wec.aspx | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIA WMSC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2011/Pages/wmsc-030611.aspx | title = World Motor Sport Council | publisher = [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] | work = fia.com | date = 2011-06-03 | accessdate = 2011-06-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063414/http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2011/Pages/wmsc-030611.aspx | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other cups and trophies will be awarded for drivers and [[privateer (motorsport)|private teams]].&lt;ref name="ACO WEC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/update/The-FIA-World-Endurance-Championship-is-unveiled--_4068.html | title = The FIA World Endurance Championship is unveiled! | publisher = [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] | work = lemans.org | date = 2011-06-09 | accessdate = 2011-06-09 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110616155004/http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/update/The-FIA-World-Endurance-Championship-is-unveiled--_4068.html | archivedate = 2011-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nissan ZEOD RC]] was designed by Ben Bowlby, who previously designed the [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]] Garage 56 entry [[DeltaWing]] as an employee for DeltaWing Project 56 LLC, a consortium led by Don Panoz. He previously worked for DeltaWing LLC, a Chip Ganassi company created to develop a DeltaWing concept race car for IndyCar. Nissan provided an engine and received naming rights on the Garage 56 entry at the 2012 Le Mans race, as well as and other 2012 American Le Mans Series races

The ZEOD RC had a [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid electric drivetrain]] with [[lithium ion]] battery packs in a chassis similar in design to the DeltaWing.&lt;ref name="ZEOD RC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/108176/ |title=Nissan unveils electric Le Mans Garage 56 car |publisher=[[Haymarket Press]] |work=[[Autosport]] |last=O'Leary |first=Jamie |date=2013-06-21 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a June 22, 2013 article at Autosport.com, Bowlby said: "This is a new car, but it uses the narrow track technology of the DeltaWing and that gives us great efficiency. It is something we understand and it is an efficient way of getting around Le Mans."

At the [[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans]], the car had to retire during the race's early hours due to a gearbox failure. However it managed to achieve its goals of reaching a speed above 300&amp;nbsp;km/h and completing a lap in [[Circuit de la Sarthe|Le Mans]] using electric power only.

===Rally Paris-Dakar===
{{main|Dakar Rally}}

In January [[2017 Dakar Rally|2017]], a pure electric car participated in the Paris-Dakar Rally and completed the entire route of 9000&amp;nbsp;km through Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. The vehicle had been specially designed and built for the race. The car had a 250&amp;nbsp;kW engine (340&amp;nbsp;hp) and a 150 kWh battery. The battery consisted of several modules. Each module could be charged separately by power cable to speed up the charging process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://oekonews.at/?mdoc_id=1112013 |title=Dakar Rallye: Erstmals 100% elektrisch im Ziel |trans-title=Dakar Rallye: First 100% electric in the finish |work=oekonews [[Süddeutsche Zeitung|Süddeutschen Zeitung]] |date=2017-01-17 |access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future prospects==

Electric powertrains have advantages over combustion engines in power delivery and vehicle dynamics (especially on motorbikes), but still have range disadvantages in longer races (note that combustion engine vehicle often have to refill energy supply also, e.g. Isle of Man TT bikes refill every two laps). Early electric challengers to combustion engine vehicles are therefore typically in shorter more intensive races such as hill climbs or other limited distance races, or simply in fastest lap times (e.g. around the Isle of Man Snaefell circuit). Nevertheless, for endurance racing, hybrid electric powertrains have also proven their advantages over pure combustion engine powertrains, with recent years at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] all won by the hybrid electric [[Audi R18 e-tron quattro]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2400">{{about|the Apple II software program|the 2000 video game|Fantavision (video game)}}

'''Fantavision''' is an animation program by Scott Anderson and published by [[Brøderbund]] for the [[Apple II series]] in 1985. It was ported to the [[Amiga]] (1988), [[Apple IIGS]] (1987), and [[MS-DOS]] (1988).

Advertisements claim that Fantavision is a revolutionary software breakthrough that, for the ''first'' time, brings to home computers the special powers known to computer animators as "[[tweening]]" and "transforming".&lt;ref name="cgw198602"/&gt; It allows the user to create short [[vector graphics]] animations frame-by-frame using a [[computer mouse|mouse]], [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], or other device. The software then uses a primitive [[morphing]] technology to generate frames in-between the user-created frames, allowing complex animations to be created without the requirement that every frame be drawn by the user. Because this is done in real-time, it allows for creative exploration and quick changes.

The [[user interface|interface]] is a [[GUI]]—similar to the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] of the day—with [[pull-down menus]] and black text on a white background.

==Reception==
''[[Compute!]]'' in 1989 called ''Fantavision'' the best animation program for the IBM PC, although it noted the inability to draw curves.&lt;ref name=anzovin198902/&gt;

First-class functions are a necessity for the [[functional programming]] style, in which the use of [[higher-order function]]s is a standard practice. A simple example of a higher-ordered function is the ''[[map (higher-order function)|map]]'' function, which takes, as its arguments, a function and a list, and returns the list formed by applying the function to each member of the list. For a language to support ''map'', it must support passing a function as an argument.

There are certain implementation difficulties in passing functions as arguments or returning them as results, especially in the presence of [[non-local variable]]s introduced in [[nested function|nested]] and [[anonymous function]]s. Historically, these were termed the [[funarg problem]]s, the name coming from "function argument".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joel Moses]]. [https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5854 "The Function of FUNCTION in LISP, or Why the FUNARG Problem Should be Called the Environment Problem"]. MIT AI Memo 199, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; In early imperative languages these problems were avoided by either not supporting functions as result types (e.g. [[ALGOL 60]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]) or omitting nested functions and thus non-local variables (e.g. [[C (programming language)|C]]). The early functional language [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] took the approach of [[dynamic scoping]], where non-local variables refer to the closest definition of that variable at the point where the function is executed, instead of where it was defined. Proper support for [[lexically scoped]] first-class functions was introduced in [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and requires handling references to functions as [[closure (computer science)|closure]]s instead of bare [[function pointer]]s,&lt;ref name="strachey"/&gt; which in turn makes [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] a necessity.

== Concepts ==

In this section we compare how particular programming idioms are handled in a functional language with first-class functions ([[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) compared to an imperative language where functions are second-class citizens ([[C (programming language)|C]]).

=== Higher-order functions: passing functions as arguments ===
{{further information|Higher-order function}}
In languages where functions are first-class citizens, functions can be passed as arguments to other functions in the same way as other values (a function taking another function as argument is called a higher-order function). In the language [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map f []     = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
&lt;/source&gt;

Languages where functions are not first-class often still allow one to write higher-order functions through the use of features such as [[function pointer]]s or [[Delegate (CLI)|delegate]]s. In the language [[C (programming language)|C]]:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
void map(int (*f)(int), int x[], size_t n) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
        x[i] = f(x[i]);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

When comparing the two samples, one should note that there are a number of differences between the two approaches that are ''not'' directly related to the support of first-class functions. The Haskell sample operates on [[List (computing)|list]]s, while the C sample operates on [[Array data structure|arrays]]. Both are the most natural compound data structures in the respective languages and making the C sample operate on linked lists would have made it unnecessarily complex. This also accounts for the fact that the C function needs an additional parameter (giving the size of the array.) The C function updates the array [[in-place]], returning no value, whereas in Haskell data structures are [[persistent data structure|persistent]] (a new list is returned while the old is left intact.) The Haskell sample uses [[recursion]] to traverse the list, while the C sample uses [[iteration]]. Again, this is the most natural way to express this function in both languages, but the Haskell sample could easily have been expressed in terms of a [[fold (higher-order function)|fold]] and the C sample in terms of recursion. Finally, the Haskell function has a [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic]] type, as this is not supported by C we have fixed all type variables to the type constant &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Anonymous and nested functions ===
{{further information|Anonymous function|Nested function}}
In languages supporting anonymous functions, we can pass such a function as an argument to a higher-order function:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
main = map (\x -&gt; 3 * x + 1) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&lt;/source&gt;

In a language which does not support anonymous functions, we have to bind it to a name instead:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int f(int x) {
    return 3 * x + 1;
}

int main() {
    int list[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    map(f, list, 5);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Non-local variables and closures ===
{{further information|Non-local variable|Closure (computer science)}}

Once we have anonymous or nested functions, it becomes natural for them to refer to variables outside of their body (called ''non-local variables''):
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
main = let a = 3
           b = 1
        in map (\x -&gt; a * x + b) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&lt;/source&gt;

If functions are represented with bare function pointers, we can not know anymore how the value that is outside of the function's body should be passed to it, and because of that a closure needs to be built manually. Therefore we can not speak of "first-class" functions here.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
typedef struct {
    int (*f)(int, int, int);
    int *a;
    int *b;
} closure_t;

void map(closure_t *closure, int x[], size_t n) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
        x[i] = (*closure-&gt;f)(*closure-&gt;a, *closure-&gt;b, x[i]);
}

int f(int a, int b, int x) {
    return a * x + b;
}

void main() {
    int l[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int a = 3;
    int b = 1;
    closure_t closure = {f, &amp;a, &amp;b};
    map(&amp;closure, l, 5);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Also note that the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; is now specialized to functions referring to two &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s outside of their environment. This can be set up more generally, but requires more [[boilerplate code]]. If &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; would have been a [[nested function]] we would still have run into the same problem and this is the reason they are not supported in C.&lt;ref&gt;"If you try to call the nested function through its address after the containing function has exited, all hell will break loose." ([https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.2/gcc/Nested-Functions.html#Nested-Functions GNU Compiler Collection: Nested Functions])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher-order functions: returning functions as results ===
When returning a function, we are in fact returning its closure. In the C example any local variables captured by the closure will go out of scope once we return from the function that builds the closure. Forcing the closure at a later point will result in undefined behaviour, possibly corrupting the stack. This is known as the [[upwards funarg problem]].

=== Assigning functions to variables ===
[[Assignment (computer science)|Assigning]] functions to [[variable (computer science)|variables]] and storing them inside (global) datastructures potentially suffers from the same difficulties as returning functions.
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
f :: [[Integer] -&gt; [Integer]]
f = let a = 3
        b = 1
     in [map (\x -&gt; a * x + b), map (\x -&gt; b * x + a)]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Equality of functions ===
{{further information|Function equality}}

As one can test most literals and values for equality, it is natural to ask whether a programming language can support testing functions for equality. On further inspection, this question appears more difficult and one has to distinguish between several types of function equality:&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew W. Appel]] (1995). [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/conteq.pdf "Intensional Equality ;=) for Continuations"].&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Extensional equality]]: Two functions ''f'' and ''g'' are considered extensionally equal if they agree on their outputs for all inputs (∀''x''. ''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'')). Under this definition of equality, for example, any two implementations of a [[stable sorting algorithm]], such as [[insertion sort]] and [[merge sort]], would be considered equal. Deciding on extensional equality is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] in general and even for functions with finite domains often intractable. For this reason no programming language implements function equality as extensional equality.

; [[Intensional equality]]: Under intensional equality, two functions ''f'' and ''g'' are considered equal if they have the same "internal structure". This kind of equality could be implemented in [[interpreted language]]s by comparing the [[source code]] of the function bodies (such as in Interpreted Lisp 1.5) or the [[object code]] in [[compiled language]]s. Intensional equality implies extensional equality (under the assumption that the functions do not depend on the value of the [[program counter]].)

; [[Reference equality]]: Given the impracticality of implementing extensional and intensional equality, most languages supporting testing functions for equality use reference equality. All functions or closures are assigned a unique identifier (usually the address of the function body or the closure) and equality is decided based on equality of the identifier. Two separately defined, but otherwise identical function definitions will be considered unequal. Referential equality implies intensional and extensional equality. Referential equality breaks [[referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]] and is therefore not supported in [[purity (computer science)|pure]] languages, such as Haskell.

== Type theory ==
{{main article|Function type}}
In [[type theory]], the type of functions accepting values of type ''A'' and returning values of type ''B'' may be written as ''A'' → ''B'' or ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;. In the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]], [[function type]]s are related to [[logical implication]]; lambda abstraction corresponds to discharging hypothetical assumptions and function application corresponds to the [[modus ponens]] inference rule. Besides the usual case of programming functions, type theory also uses first-class functions to model [[associative array]]s and similar [[data structure]]s.

In [[category theory|category-theoretical]] accounts of programming, the availability of first-class functions corresponds to the [[closed category]] assumption. For instance, the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] corresponds to the internal language of [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed categories]].

== Language support ==
Functional programming languages, such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[ML (programming language)|ML]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], all have first-class functions. When [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], one of the earliest functional languages, was designed, not all aspects of first-class functions were then properly understood, resulting in functions being dynamically scoped. The later [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Common Lisp]] dialects do have lexically scoped first-class functions.

Many scripting languages, including [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[PHP]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[Tcl]]/Tk, [[JavaScript]] and [[Io (programming language)|Io]], have first-class functions.

For imperative languages, a distinction has to be made between Algol and its descendants such as Pascal, the traditional C family, and the modern garbage-collected variants. The Algol family has allowed nested functions and higher-order taking function as arguments, but not higher-order functions that return functions as results (except Algol 68, which allows this). The reason for this was that it was not known how to deal with non-local variables if a nested-function was returned as a result (and Algol 68 produces runtime errors in such cases).

The C family allowed both passing functions as arguments and returning them as results, but avoided any problems by not supporting nested functions. (The gcc compiler allows them as an extension.) As the usefulness of returning functions primarily lies in the ability to return nested functions that have captured non-local variables, instead of top-level functions, these languages are generally not considered to have first-class functions.

Modern imperative languages often support garbage-collection making the implementation of first-class functions feasible. First-class functions have often only been supported in later revisions of the language, including C# 2.0 and Apple's Blocks extension to C, C++ and Objective-C. C++11 has added support for anonymous functions and closures to the language, but because of the non-garbage collected nature of the language, special care has to be taken for non-local variables in functions to be returned as results (see below).

; C++: [[C++11]] closures can capture non-local variables by reference (without extending their lifetime), by copy construction or by [[C++11#Rvalue references and move constructors|move construction]] (the variable lives as long as the closure does). The former potentially avoids an expensive copy and allows to modify the original variable but is unsafe in case the closure is returned (see [[dangling reference]]s). The second is safe if the closure is returned but requires a copy and cannot be used to modify the original variable (which might not exist any more at the time the closure is called). The latter is safe if the closure is returned and does not require a copy but cannot be used to modify the original variable either.
; Java: [[Java 8]] closures can only capture final or "effectively final" non-local variables. Java's [[function type]]s are represented as Classes.  Anonymous functions take the type inferred from the context.  Method references are limited.  For more details, see [[Anonymous function#Java Limitations|Anonymous Functions: Java Limitations]]
; Lisp
: [[Lexically scoped]] Lisp variants support closures. [[Dynamically scoped]] variants do not support closures or need a special construct to create closures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://common-lisp.net/project/bknr/static/lmman/fd-clo.xml Closures in ZetaLisp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319071329/http://common-lisp.net/project/bknr/static/lmman/fd-clo.xml |date=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: In [[Common Lisp]], the identifier of a function in the function namespace cannot be used as a reference to a first-class value. The special operator &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; must be used to retrieve the function as a value: &lt;code&gt;(function foo)&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to a function object. &lt;code&gt;#'foo&lt;/code&gt; exists as a shorthand notation. To apply such a function object, one must use the &lt;code&gt;funcall&lt;/code&gt; function: &lt;code&gt;(funcall #'foo bar baz)&lt;/code&gt;.
; Python
: Explicit partial application with &lt;code&gt;[https://docs.python.org/library/functools.html#functools.partial functools.partial]&lt;/code&gt; since version 2.5, and &lt;code&gt;[https://docs.python.org/library/operator.html#operator.methodcaller operator.methodcaller]&lt;/code&gt; since version 2.6.
; Ruby
: The identifier of a regular "function" in Ruby (which is really a method) cannot be used as a value or passed. It must first be retrieved into a &lt;code&gt;Method&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Proc&lt;/code&gt; object to be used as first-class data. The syntax for calling such a function object differs from calling regular methods.
: Nested method definitions do not actually nest the scope.
: Explicit currying with &lt;code&gt;[http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Proc.html#method-i-curry]&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Gender mainstreaming in mine action''' is the application of [[gender mainstreaming]] to [[mine action]]. It is increasingly being adopted by international and state mine action organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?lang=en&amp;id=117659|title=Resources|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==

Gender mainstreaming in [[mine action]] is derived from the fact that women and men often have different roles and responsibilities within their communities or families and consequently different decision-making power, mobility patterns, information and control over resources.&lt;ref&gt;A guide to Mine Action. GICHD, 2014. Chapter 4, p.110: http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/GICHD-resources/rec-documents/Guide-to-mine-action-2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The different positions of men and women have an influence on their exposure to [[Land mine|landmines]] and [[Unexploded ordnance|explosive remnants of war (ERW)]], their ability to access medical and psychological services once they have been injured by [[Land mine|mines]], their chances of long term reintegration in society, and the likelihood of them to be included in risk education.&lt;ref&gt;Livelihoods Analysis of Landmine/ERW Affected Communities. Third Survey: Badakhshan Province, Afghanistan. Qudous Ziaee, Samim Hashimi and Shapur Qayyumi, 2013: p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, organizations employ gender mainstreaming in mine action by assessing the implications for women and men in all aspects of the mine action activities.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Gender Mainstreaming in Mine Action – a Critical Background Analysis. Hilde Wallacher, Assistance to Mine-Affected Communities (AMAC), 2007, p.2: http://file.prio.no/Publication_files/Prio/Gender_mainstreaming_in_mine_action_nov_07_background_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming in mine action attempts to ensure women and men benefit equally from mine action and that gender inequality is not perpetuated which might impede the overall effectiveness of mine action programmes.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;UNMAS and Gender Mainstreaming in Mine Action. Aaron J. Buckley and Akiko Ikeda, The Journal of ERW and Mine Action. Issue 13.3, Winter 2009: http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/13.3/notes/buckley_ikeda/buckley.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Women's advancement instruments in national bureaucracies started in the mid-1970s. While the concept of gender mainstreaming appeared in the mid-1980s, it was formalised in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Gender mainstreaming in mine action was first mentioned in 1995 at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Platform for Action]] in the section on armed conflict, by stating that "women and children are particularly affected by the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel land-mines".&lt;ref&gt;Beijing Platform for Action, 1995. Strategic objective E.2. Reduce excessive military expenditures and control the availability of armaments. Actions to be taken: 143.e.: http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/armed.htm&lt;/ref&gt;Gender mainstreaming in mine action was part of a larger movement to end discrimination and [[Gender and security sector reform|mainstream gender in security sector reform]]. Before guidelines on how to integrate gender into mine action were standardised, several documents were published to highlight the importance of gender mainstreaming in that domain.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;A Guide to Mine Action. GICHD, 2013: p.113 to 115: http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/GICHD-resources/rec-documents/Guide-to-mine-action-2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It later gained more support thanks to the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325|UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000)]] on "Women, Peace and Security" which emphasised "the need for all parties to ensure that mine clearance and mine awareness programmes take into account the special needs of women and girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undocs.org/S/RES/1325(2000) |title=Resolution 1325 (2000) |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the UN Gender Guidelines for Mine Action Programmes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/437354a14.html%7Ctitle=Refworld%20-%20Gender%20Guidelines%20for%20Mine%20Action%20Programmes%7Cauthor=United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees%7Cwork=Refworld|title=Refworld - Gender Guidelines for Mine Action Programmes|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided the first comprehensive description of how to mainstream gender in mine action, afterwards revised in 2010.&lt;ref name="mineaction.org"&gt;http://www.mineaction.org/sites/default/files/publications/MA-Guidelines-WEB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This guide is a manual destined to be used by the UN mine action field-based personnel and headquarters' staff and other actors involved in the sector.&lt;ref name="mineaction.org" /&gt;

=== '''Convention and Normative Documents on Gender Mainstreaming in Mine Action''' ===
[[Convention on Cluster Munitions|The Convention on Cluster Munition]] (2008) underlines that "Each State Party with respect to cluster munition victims (…) shall (…) adequately provide age- and gender-sensitive assistance".&lt;ref&gt;Convention on Cluster Munitions. Article 5, Victim assistance, p.9: http://www.clusterconvention.org/files/2011/01/Convention-ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Vientiane Action Plan 2010-2015 (2010),&lt;ref name="clusterconvention.org"&gt;http://www.clusterconvention.org/files/2011/01/VIENTIANE-ACTION-PLAN-Final2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; adopted at the First Meeting of States Parties to  the Convention on Cluster Munition in Lao PDR also includes gender issues in several action points, such as on Clearance and destruction of cluster munition remnants and risk reduction activities. For instance, Action 14 writes that there should be "gender-sensitive participation of the community to the development of national clearance plans, planning and prioritisation of clearance activities and land release". Action 17 states that "mine risk education should be tailored to the needs of affected communities, gender sensitive and age appropriate". In addition to the previous two, Action 22 requires states to collect sex and age disaggregated data on victims, and Action 30 that victims should be fully included in the work of the convention in a gender and age sensitive way.&lt;ref name="clusterconvention.org" /&gt;

The Strategy of the United Nation on Mine Action 2013-2018 (2013) encourages "further efforts (…)  dedicated to strengthening and mainstreaming gender perspectives in mine action planning, implementation and evaluation".&lt;ref&gt;The Strategy of the United Nation on Mine Action 2013-2018, 2013, p.10: http://www.mineaction.org/sites/default/files/publications/mine_action_strategy_mar15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maputo Action Plan 2014-2019 (2014)&lt;ref name="maputoreviewconference.org"&gt;http://www.maputoreviewconference.org/fileadmin/APMBC-RC3/3RC-Maputo-action-plan-adopted-27Jun2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted during the Third Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction (APMBC 1997). In its introduction, it stresses that States Parties will implement the Maputo Action Plan in a cooperative, inclusive, age-appropriate and gender-sensitive manner. In the section on mine clearance, gender-sensitive mine risk education (paragraph 10), opportunities and social protection measures for all mine victims, regardless of their gender and age (paragraph 10) and gender sensitive awareness raising (paragraph 17) are mentioned. The section on International cooperation and assistance encourages State parties to articulate age- and gender-sensitive time-bound objectives and targets (paragraph 21) and to support programmes that provide  accurate gender sensitive information and that promote gender mainstreaming (paragraph 22).&lt;ref name="maputoreviewconference.org" /&gt;

The International Mine Action Standards (IMAS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mineactionstandards.org/about/about-imas/|title=International Mine Action Standards: About IMAS|work=mineactionstandards.org|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; were created in 2001 and are under constant revision. They provide procedures and concrete steps to follow all UN mine action operations. However, they are also the main guide for operators and national mine action programmes to establish their own National Mine Action Standards (NMAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mineactionstandards.org/standards/national-mine-action-standards-nmas/about-nmas/|title=International Mine Action Standards: About NMAS|work=mineactionstandards.org|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revision of IMAS in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mineactionstandards.org/fileadmin/MAS/documents/review-board/others/Main-report-gender-review-IMAS-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the dimension of gender was included in several of them, concerning [[Mine action#Clearance of Mines and Explosive Remnants of War|land release and handover]] (IMAS 07.11);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mineactionstandards.org/fileadmin/MAS/documents/imas-international-standards/english/series-07/IMAS-07.11-Ed.1-Am2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Mine Risk Education (IMAS 04.10&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mineactionstandards.org/fileadmin/MAS/documents/imas-international-standards/english/series-04/IMAS_04.10_Glossary_of_mine_action_terms__definitions_and_abbreviations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and IMAS 12.10);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mineactionstandards.org/fileadmin/MAS/documents/imas-international-standards/english/series-12/IMAS-12-10-Ed2-Am2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mine action#Surveying|non-technical surveys]] (IMAS 08.10).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mineactionstandards.org/fileadmin/MAS/documents/imas-international-standards/english/series-08/IMAS-08.10-Ed.1-Am2.pd&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of Gender Mainstreaming in Mine Action===

Since 2006 the [[United Nations Mine Action Service]] (UNMAS) has been conducting workshops on gender mainstreaming in mine action both in the field and in Geneva at the presence of representatives of mine action organisation, focused on explaining what gender mainstreaming is and helping countries implementing the UN guidelines.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The [[Swiss Campaign to Ban Landmines]] created the Gender and Mine Action Programme in 2006 to specifically focus on the implementation of gender mainstreaming in mine action.&lt;ref name="gmap.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmap.ch/|title=Gender &amp; Mine Action Programme – Gmap.ch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)]] in 2013 reviewed the work of the [[Danish demining group|Danish Demining Group]] (DDG) in Afghanistan, assessing positively the progress made in gender mainstreaming, in terms of the collection of disaggregated qualitative and quantitative data, in spite of some cultural limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Review of the DDG Humanitarian Mine Action Support to the National Strategy through Clearance and Enhanced Quality Project in Afghanistan (October 2010 – September 2013). Final Report. SIDA, p.8: http://www.oecd.org/derec/sweden/SIDAReviewDDG%20HumanitarianMineActionSupportNationalStrategyAfghanistan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The Mine Action Programme of Afghanistan (MAPA) has developed a Gender Mainstreaming Strategy for the period 2014-2016 with the assistance of the [[#Gender and Mine Action Programme|Gender and Mine Action Programme (GMAP)]]. In order to share the strategy, the Mine Action Coordination Centre of Afghanistan (MACCA) organised two gender mainstreaming workshops at the end of 2014 attended by 17 partner organisations&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmap.ch/fileadmin/GMAP_Articles_and_Papers/2014_Outcomes_of_Gender_Mainstreaming_in_the_Mine_Action_Programmes_of_Afghanistan_and_South_Sudan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of a grant provided by [[Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining|the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD)]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macca.org.af/macca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MAPA-2014-Newsletter-English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mines Advisory Group|The Mine Advisory Group (MAG)]] – Lao PDR, through a funding from MAG and Irish Aid, conducted an assessment as part of gender mainstreaming on the priority actions to be carried out in integrating gender in mine action.&lt;ref&gt;Gender Issue: An Example from Lao PDR. Jo Durham, MAG Lao. The Journal of ERW and Mine Action, Issue 12.2, Winter 2008/2009: http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/12.2/focus/durham/durham.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

UN, 2010, p. 13: http://www.mineaction.org/sites/default/files/publications/MA-Guidelines-WEB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; explain how to integrate gender into four of the five pillars of [[mine action]].&lt;ref&gt;Gender Mainstreaming in Mine Action in Conflict Situations.

PRIO, Policy Brief 10/2008: http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?ots591=0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233&amp;lng=en&amp;id=117659&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DPKO Practices in Gender Mainstreaming. Kateland Shane. The Journal of ERW and Mine Action. Issue 12.2, Winter 2008-2009: http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/12.2/profiles/shane/shane.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Mine action#Clearance of Mines and Explosive Remnants of War|Mine clearance]]===

The UN Gender Guidelines state that men, women, boys and girls differ in their exposure to and knowledge of the mine contamination. The Guidelines write that [[Mine clearance agency|mine-action operators]] should obtain information about the mine situation from both sexes in all age groups in order for information to be complete and accurate before [[demining]]. Having more accurate information before can reduce costs because less time and money are spent on [[demining]] uncontaminated areas. Its concrete recommendations are:

* Gather data at the best times and locations for all individuals.
* Gather data from both men and women about the location of explosive devices and the projected use of cleared land.
* Also include women into the survey and clearance teams.&lt;ref name="mineaction.org"/&gt;

===[[Mine action#Mine Risk Education .28MRE.29|Mine-risk education (MRE)]]===

The UN Gender Guidelines say that men, women, boys and girls differ in their behaviours and their response to mine-risk education. Its recommendations are: 
* Gather data that illustrate the behaviours that put at risk people of both genders.
* Gather data that indicates how people of both genders would react to potential mine and [[Unexploded ordnance|UXO]] threats.
* Determine the best instructor for both genders. 
* Hold MRE meetings at the most convenient times and places for recipients.
* Ensure that both genders understand properly MRE messages.
* Have women as instructors.&lt;ref name="mineaction.org"/&gt;

===[[Mine action#Mine Victim Assistance|Victim assistance]]===

For victim assistance, the guidelines explains that women and men have often different access to victim assistance due to cultural barriers and other obstacles. It states that mine action organisations should consider these barriers and their vulnerability to the economic, psychological and social implications of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://victim-assistance.org/advocacy/gender-and-victim-assistance|title=Gender &amp; Victim Assistance|date=8 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guidelines' recommendations are: 
 
* Collect age- and sex-disaggregated data about victims, their needs and the level of access to services.
* Support survivor advocacy and awareness.
* Include women into victim assistance teams to ensure access to female victims in conservative contexts.&lt;ref name="mineaction.org"/&gt;

===Advocacy===

In terms of advocacy, the guidelines state that women and men have different sensibilities to messages and access to communication channels. Mine action organisations have to consider these peculiarities in planning advocacy activities. Its recommendations are:

* Tailor advocacy initiatives to women, girls, boys and men
* Convey information on the benefits of compliance with international legal norms addressing the mine/ERW problem and victim assistance
* Encourage advocacy activities among women, girls, boys and men in mine/ERW-affected communities &lt;ref name="mineaction.org"/&gt;

==Gender and Mine Action Programme==

The Gender and Mine Action Programme (GMAP) was created in December 2006 by the [[Swiss Campaign to Ban Landmines]]. Its purpose is to promote [[gender mainstreaming]] in [[mine action]] by trying to make mine action include the needs, priorities, and knowledge of everyone (including women, children, and other marginalized groups) in the community at risk of landmines or other [[Unexploded ordnance|UXO]]. The goal of gender mainstreaming is to make mine action more inclusive, efficient and effective.&lt;ref name="gmap.ch"/&gt; The goal of the Programme is to research, provide training and consultation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/en-gb/about-us/what-we-do/2015-campaign-action-plan.aspx|title=404 -  CMC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; create guidelines and strategies,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macca.org.af/macca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAPA-gender-mainstreaming-strategy-FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/documents/femm/dv/gbv_toolkit_book_01_20_2015_/gbv_toolkit_book_01_20_2015_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; create awareness,&lt;ref&gt;http://2013.pressclub.ch/fr/conference/convention-dottawa-des-principes-dun-traite-aux-actions-sur-le-terrain&lt;/ref&gt; and publish material related to gender and diversity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mineaction.org/issues/genderandmineaction|title=UN Mine Action Gateway - Gender &amp; Mine Action|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/13.2/focus/nilsson/nilsson.shtml|title=Gender and Land Release: The Responsibility of the Mine-action Community, by Marie Nilsson, Virginie RozÃ¨s and Juliane Garcia (13.2)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in mine action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmap.ch/index.php?id=49|title=Gender &amp; Mine Action Programme – Gmap.ch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbnews.ch/english/filling-a-niche-gender-and-mine-action-programme|title=Filling a niche: Gender and Mine Action Programme|date=4 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also support hiring more women in mine action including mine clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/12/141212-women-land-mines-war-mozambique-africa-culture/|title=Clearing Land Mines Becomes Women's Work in Mozambique and Beyond|date=13 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hosted in the offices of the [[Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining#Partners|Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD)]] in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gichd.org/mine-action-topics/gender-and-diversity/#.VZFZUdKqpBc|title=Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining: Gender and diversity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are part of a [[Gender and security sector reform|Gender and Diversity in Security]] Hub with other security organizations at the [[Maison de la paix|Maison de la Paix]] in Geneva: [[Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces|Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)]], [[Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining|Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD)]], [[Geneva Centre for Security Policy|Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP)]], and [[Small Arms Survey|Small Arms Survey (SAS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/GenderDiversityHUB|title=MdP Gender &amp; Diversity Hub - Facebook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Like many [[Gender mainstreaming#Criticism|criticisms of the gender mainstreaming movement]] in general, gender mainstreaming in mine action has faced similar problems such as ineffective results, poor implementation, those using it to hinder progress, and being primarily western dominated.  Asa Massleberg, for the [[#Gender and Mine Action Programme|Gender and Mine Action Programme]], wrote that the common measurements of success in mine action, such as meters squared of land cleared of mines and number of people who received a service, are insufficient because they do not take into account the overall and long term impact of a community. She argues it can only be done by assessing all the processes and procedures in a project cycle which are adapted to the needs of women, girls, boy and men in a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/14.2/focus/massleberg/massleberg.shtml|title=Redefining Success: Whose Reality Counts?|author=Åsa Massleberg|volume=14|issue=2|publisher=|journal=The Journal of ERW &amp; Mine Action }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[#Gender and Mine Action Programme|Gender and Mine Action Programme]], the effects of gender mainstreaming are still largely undocumented, not understood by those implementing it, and require further research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/18.1/focus/calza.shtml|title=Effects of Mixed Teams on Land Release|author1=Arianna Calza Bini|author2=Nyske Janssen|author3=Abigail Jones|volume=18|issue=1|publisher=|journal=The Journal of ERW &amp; Mine Action }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to deal with other biases not included in gender mainstreaming, the [[#Gender and Mine Action Programme|Gender and Mine Action Programme]] has also expanded gender mainstreaming to include the term [[Cultural diversity|diversity]]. Gender and diversity mainstreaming includes other factors in the demographics of a community that may hinder or help the long term impact of mine action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmap.ch/index.php?id=325|title=Gender &amp; Mine Action Programme – Gmap.ch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23453">The [[fair trade]] movement has undergone several important changes since its early days following [[World War II]]. Fair trade, first seen as a form of charity advocated by religious organizations, has radically changed in structure, philosophy and approach. The past fifty years have witnessed massive changes in the diversity of fair trade proponents, the products traded and their distribution networks.

==The origins of fair trade==

Fair trade principles have deep roots in European societies long before the first structured [[alternative trading organization]]s (ATOs) emerged following World War II. Many of the fundamental concepts behind fair trade actually show a great resemblance with pre-capitalist ideas about the organization of the economy and society.

The notion of the ‘old moral economy’ is a fitting example of such conceptions. [[E. P. Thompson]], in his  work on 18th century England, described a society where "notions of common well being, often supported by paternalistic traditional authorities, imposed some limits on the free operations of the market".&lt;ref name="Fridell, Gavin 2003"&gt;Fridell, Gavin (2003). ''Fair Trade and the International Moral Economy: Within and Against the Market.'' CERLAC Working Paper Series.&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers were then not allowed to manipulate prices by withholding their products to wait for price increases. The actions of the middlemen were always considered legally suspect, were severely restricted and the poor were provided opportunities to buy staple foods in small parcels. Fair trade was already seen as a way to address market failures; although the concept mainly revolved around consumer, rather than producer, rights.&lt;ref name="Fridell, Gavin 2003"/&gt;

In 1827 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], a moral and economic [[boycott]] of slave-derived goods began with the formation of the "Free Produce Society", founded by [[Thomas M'Clintock]] and other [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). In the [[Free produce movement]], they sought to fight against slavery with a new tactic, one that emphasized the value of the honest labor of free men and women, and to try to determine the unseen added costs to goods such as cotton and sugar which came from the toil of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxN8GXEKspQC&amp;pg=PA266 ''Freedom's Prophet: Bishop Richard Allen, the AME Church, and the Black Founding Fathers''], NYU Press, 2008, p. 266. {{ISBN|0-8147-5826-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830, African Americans formed the "Colored Free Produce Society", and women formed their own branch in 1831. In 1838, supporters from a number of states came together in the American Free Produce Association, which promoted their cause by seeking non-slave alternates to products from slaveholders, forming non-slave distribution channels, and publishing a number of pamphlets, tracts, and the journal ''Non-Slaveholder''. The movement did not grow large enough to gain the benefit of the [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]], and the cost of "free produce" was always higher than competing goods. The national association disbanded in 1847, but Quakers in Philadelphia continued until 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Hinks, Peter and McKivigan, John, editors. Williams, R. Owen, assistant editor. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_SeZrcBqt-YC&amp;pg=PA267 ''Encyclopedia of antislavery and abolition''], Greenwood Press, 2007, pp. 267–268. {{ISBN|0-313-33142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Havelaar 9e druk.jpg|right|thumb|Front cover of ''Max Havelaar'', 9th edition (1891).]]
There have been a few instances in which fair trade in the 'old moral economy' was focused on producer rights: as early as 1859, Dutch author [[Multatuli]] (the pen name of Eduard Douwes Dekker) questioned the injustice of the colonial and capitalist system towards commodity producers in his novel ''[[Max Havelaar]]''. The fictional tale recounts the story of Max Havelaar, a Nederlandse Trade Company employee, who leaves everything to work in solidarity with local Indonesian workers. This account draws a direct correlation between the wealth and the prosperity of Europe and the poverty of the suffering of other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P.

==Early fair trade initiatives==

In 1897 [[The Salvation Army]] launched the [[Hamodava]] Tea Company. Hamodava pioneered a fair trade model which sought to pay fair prices to the tea farmers, whilst also offering a scheme by which they could purchase plantation land on a co-operative giving them financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salvationarmy.org.nz/our-community/faith-in-life/our-people-our-stories/the-social-cup|title=The social cup|website=www.salvationarmy.org.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The fair trade movement was shaped in the years following [[World War II]]. Early attempts to commercialize in Northern markets goods produced by marginalised producers were initiated by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs).

The [[Mennonite Central Committee]] (MCC) and [[SERRV International]] were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade supply chains in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml Crafts and Food]. Accessed August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The products, almost exclusively [[handicrafts]] ranging from [[jute]] goods to [[cross-stitch]] work, were mostly sold by volunteers in 'charity stores' or 'ethnic shops'. The goods themselves had often no other function than to indicate that a donation had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Hockerts, K. (2005). [http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf The Fair Trade Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823071706/http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf |date=2006-08-23 }}. p1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solidarity trade==
[[File:Fair Trade Products.jpg|thumb|left|Fair Trade goods sold in Worldshops]]
The modern fair trade movement was shaped in Europe in the 1960s. Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against [[neo-imperialism]]: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The global free market economic model came under attack during that period and fair trade ideals, built on a [[Post Keynesian economics]] approach to economies where price is directly linked to the actual production costs and where all producers are given fair and equal access to the markets, gained in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p4&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan at the time, "Trade not Aid", gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the [[developing world]].&lt;ref&gt;International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history2.shtml Where did it all begin?] URL accessed on August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the first ATO was created: British NGO [[Oxfam]] launched "[[Helping-by-Selling]]", a program which later developed into [[Bridge (program)|Bridge]]. The scheme sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the [[United Kingdom]] and from mail-order catalogues with a circulation of almost 100,000 copies. The program was created to support the work of [[cooperative]]s and community enterprises in the developing world. The program was highly successful: it remained one of the largest and most influential in the sector and then changed in 2002 as more mainstream retailers were persuaded to carry fair trade products. Globally Oxfam still works in many countries on fair trade programs and runs hundreds of shops across Europe and Australia selling and promoting fair trade goods.

In 1969, the first Worldshop opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods such as handcrafts produced under fair trade terms in "underdeveloped regions". The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Germany]] and in other Western European countries.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from [[Angola]] and [[Nicaragua]] in Worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world’s market, and you support their self-determined sustainable development. The alternative trade movement blossomed, if not in sales, then at least in terms of dozens of ATOs being established on both sides of the Atlantic, of scores of Worldshops being set up, and of well-organized actions and campaigns attacking exploitation and foreign domination, and promoting the ideals of [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Julius Nyerere]] and the Nicaraguan [[Sandinistas]]: the right to independence and self-determination, to equitable access to the world’s markets and consumers.

==Handcrafts vs. agricultural goods==
In the early 1980s, Alternative Trading Organizations faced a major challenge: the novelty of some fair trade products started wearing off, demand reached a plateau and some handicrafts began to look "tired and old fashioned" in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Redfern A. 2002 p6"&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p6&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, fair trade supporters during this period became increasingly worried by the impact of the fall of agricultural [[commodity]] prices on poor producers. Many then believed it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and to find innovative remedies to address the ongoing crisis in the industry.

In the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations the perfect substitute to the stagnating handicrafts market. The collapse of the [[International Coffee Agreement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/25/business/coffee-price-talks-foreseen.html |title=Coffee Price Talks Foreseen - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-11-25 |accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989 fueled the extraordinary growth of the [[fair trade coffee]] market, providing a powerful narrative for a new breed of fair trade brand that engaged producers directly in consumer operations. Cafédirect is a good example of this new thinking and was the first fair trade brand to be found in UK supermarkets. Dedicated to the mainstream, Cafédirect created focused on consumer engagement and language and built a reputation for quality, justifying its premium positioning with the tag-line "We pay more, so you get the pick of the crop".

The first fair trade agricultural products were [[coffee]] and [[tea]], quickly followed by dried [[fruits]], cocoa, sugar, [[fruit juices]], [[rice]], [[spices]] and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Coffee quickly became the main growth engine behind fair trade: between 25 and 50% of the total alternative trading organization turnover in 2005 came from coffee sales.&lt;ref&gt;International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history4.shtml Market Access and Fair Trade Labeling]. URL accessed on August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

While a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm in 1992, in 2002 handcrafts accounted for 25.4% of sales while commodity food lines were up at 69.4%.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. &amp; Opal, C. (2004). Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition to agricultural commodities was further highlighted in 2002, when Oxfam decided to abandon its loss-making handcrafts trading program after 27 years of existence. Oxfam’s move had significant consequences on the entire fair trade movement. Some ATOs saw this as an opportunity to restructure and partner up with mainstream businesses in an effort to find economic efficiencies and broaden their appeal, while others (such as Alternativ Handel in [[Norway]]), unable to adjust to the market and plagued by financial difficulties, were forced to close.

Today, many ATOs still exclusively sell handcrafts - which they judge culturally and economically preferable to agricultural commodities. While these are still considered fair trade flagship products, academics have described them as a [[niche market]] that now only appeals to relatively small segments of the population, mostly fair trade core supporters who buy products on the basis of the story behind the product.&lt;ref name="Redfern A. 2002 p6"/&gt;

==Rise of labelling initiatives==
''Note: Customary spelling of Fairtrade is one word when referring to product labelling''
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]] --&gt;&lt;!-- FAIR USE of Oldftlogos2.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Oldftlogos2.jpg for rationale --&gt;Sales of fair trade products however only really took off with the arrival of the first [[Fairtrade labelling]] initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small Worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, [[North America]]. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, M.-C., (2003). Fair Trade: quality, market and conventions. Journal of Rural Studies, 19, 87-96.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.

A solution was found in 1988, when the first Fairtrade label, Max Havelaar, was launched under the initiative of [[Nico Roozen]], [[Frans van der Hoff]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[ecumenical]] [[development agency]] [[Solidaridad]]. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the [[worldshops]] and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The [[Fairtrade labelling|labeling initiative]] also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the [[supply chain]].&lt;ref&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p7&lt;/ref&gt;

On the producer end, the Max Havelaar initiative offered disadvantaged producers following various social and environmental standards a fair price, significantly above the market price, for their crop. The coffee, originating from the [[UCIRI]] cooperative in Mexico, was imported by Dutch company [[Van Weely]], roasted by [[Neuteboom]], sold directly to [[world shops]] and, for the first time, to mainstream retailers across the [[Netherlands]].

The initiative was groundbreaking as for the first time Fairtrade coffee was sold in supermarkets and mass-retailers, therefore reaching a larger consumer segment. Fairtrade labelling also allowed consumers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the farmers at the end of the [[supply chain]].
The initiative was a great success and was replicated in several other markets: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America, called "Max Havelaar" (in [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[France]]), "Transfair" (in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Italy]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Japan]]), or carrying a national name: "Fairtrade  Mark" in the UK and [[Ireland]], "Rättvisemärkt" in [[Sweden]], and "Reilu Kauppa" in [[Finland]].

|}Initially, the Max Havelaars and the Transfairs each had their own Fairtrade standards, product committees and monitoring systems. In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations – or "LIs" (for "Labelling Initiatives") – started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]] (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.

In 2002, FLO launched a new [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade and simplify export procedures for both producers and exporters.

The Fairtrade Certification Mark harmonization process is still under way – today, all but two labelling initiatives ([[Transfair USA]] &amp; [[TransFair Canada]]) have adopted the new International Fairtrade Certification Mark. Full transition to the new Fairtrade Mark should become reality as it gradually replaces the old certification marks at various speeds in various countries.

In January 2004, FLO was divided into two independent organizations: [[FLO International]], which sets Fairtrade standards and provides producer business support, and [[FLO-CERT]], which inspects and certifies producer organizations. The aim of the split was to ensure the impartiality, the independence of the certification process and compliance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 65 standards for product certification bodies.

At present, over 20 Labelling Initiatives are members of FLO International. There are now Fairtrade Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO’s certification for [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[rice]], [[banana]]s, [[mangoes]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[fruit juices]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit|fresh fruit]], [[quinoa]], [[herbs]] and [[spices]], [[wine]] and [[Football (ball)|footballs]] etc.

== WFTO and the FTO Mark ==
In an effort to complement the Fairtrade certification system and allow for example handcraft producers to also sell their products outside [[worldshops]], the [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), formerly the International Fair Trade Association (founded 1989), launched a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations in 2004 (as opposed to products in the case of Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark, it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and guarantees that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour and the environment.

The FTO Mark gave for the first time Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable recognition amongst consumers, existing and new business partners, governments and donors.

==Fair trade today==
Global fair trade sales have soared over the past decade. The increase has been particularly spectacular among Fairtrade labelled goods:  In 2007, [[Fairtrade certification|Fair trade certified]] sales amounted to approximately €2.3 billion (US $3.62 billion) worldwide, a 47% year-to-year increase.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2008). http://www.fairtrade.net/single_view.html?&amp;cHash=d6f2e27d2c&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=104&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=41.

== Research ==
Fiez is known for her research in neuroscience, specifically on the [[cerebellum]] and how it is involved in processing information separately and in unison with the [[Frontal lobe|frontal lobes]], and its functions that extend beyond [[motor control]].  Fiez's research on the role of the cerebellum and its influence on non-motor behavior has focused on how the cerebellum interacts with non-motor areas of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strick|first=Peter L.|last2=Dum|first2=Richard P.|last3=Fiez|first3=Julie A.|date=2009|title=Cerebellum and Nonmotor Function|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125606|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=413–434|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125606|issn=0147-006X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[neuroimaging]], Fiez and her colleagues found evidence for closed-loop circuits in cerebro-cerebellar interactions that indicate the role of the cerebellum not only in movement, but also in [[cognition]]. In her research, she uses behavioral, [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological]],and neuroimaging methods to discover how the brain gives rise to the mind. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/people/julie-fiez|title=Julie A.

Fiez and her colleagues have used [[positron emission tomography]] to study distinct functions of the cerebellum and non-motor cortical areas of the frontal lobe, also known as the [[fronto-cerebellar dissociation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strick|first=Peter L.|last2=Dum|first2=Richard P.|last3=Fiez|first3=Julie A.|date=2009|title=Cerebellum and Nonmotor Function|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125606|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=413–434|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125606|issn=0147-006X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies have identified differences in brain activity in the left-frontal and right-cerebellar parts of the brain when research participants are given simple verbal response tasks, such as generating associations between nouns and verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raichle|first=Marcus E.|last2=Fiez|first2=Julie A.|last3=Videen|first3=Tom O.|last4=MacLeod|first4=Ann-Mary K.|last5=Pardo|first5=Jose V.|last6=Fox|first6=Peter T.|last7=Petersen|first7=Steven E.|date=1994|title=Practice-related Changes in Human Brain Functional Anatomy during Nonmotor Learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/4.1.8|journal=Cerebral Cortex|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=8–26|doi=10.1093/cercor/4.1.8|issn=1047-3211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research team also used positron emission [[tomography]] to study [[short-term memory]] and discovered the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] to be active in short-term maintenance of verbal and nonverbal information while the left frontal opercular regions were only linked to [[Verbal memory|verbal memory.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fiez|first=JA|last2=Raife|first2=EA|last3=Balota|first3=DA|last4=Schwarz|first4=JP|last5=Raichle|first5=ME|last6=Petersen|first6=SE|date=1996-01-15|title=A positron emission tomography study of the short-term maintenance of verbal information|url=https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/8551361|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=808–822|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.16-02-00808.1996|issn=0270-6474}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fiez and Petersen used neuroimaging to identify the involvement of multiple brain areas in word reading, including left-lateralized regions in occipital and occipitotemporal cortex, the left frontal operculum, bilateral regions in the cerebellum, [[primary motor cortex]], and the superior and middle [[Temporal lobe|temporal cortex]], and medial regions in the supplementary motor area and [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fiez|first=Julie A.|last2=Petersen|first2=Steven E.|date=1998|title=Neuroimaging studies of word reading|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/95/3/914|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=95|issue=3|pages=914–921|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.914|issn=0027-8424|pmid=9448259|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other research, Fiez and her colleagues used mixed methods, including [[Electrical brain stimulation|electrical brain simulation]], to elaborate on the long debated [[Visual word form area#Pre-lexical Visual Word Form Hypothesis|visual word form hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirshorn|first=Elizabeth A.|last2=Li|first2=Yuanning|last3=Ward|first3=Michael J.|last4=Richardson|first4=R.

[[Image:Black Latex Catsuit 777.jpg|thumb|300px|A woman wearing a black [[latex]] [[catsuit]] and [[thigh-high boot]]s.]]    

'''Latex''' [[rubber]] is used in many types of '''clothing'''. Rubber has traditionally been used in protective clothing, including [[gas mask]]s and [[Wellington boot]]s. Rubber is now generally being replaced in these application by plastics. [[Mackintosh]]es have traditionally been made from rubberized [[cloth]]. 

[[Latex]] rubber as a [[clothing]] material is common in [[fetish fashion]] and among [[BDSM]] practitioners, and is often seen worn at [[fetish club]]s. Latex is sometimes also used by [[couturier]]s for its dramatic appearance. Latex clothing tends to be [[skin-tight]]. There are several magazines dedicated to the use and wearing of it. Less commonly, latex clothing can be loose-fitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.picturepush.com/photo/a/2192822/img/2192822.jpg |title=Image of loose latex clothing |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a handful of companies around the world which manufacture latex rated as suitable for contact with human skin. These firms supply sheet (in the vast majority) to a larger number of smaller fashion clothing companies. In the past, some marketplaces suffered from de facto monopoly [[Supply (economics)|supply]] conditions, where a sheet supplier could impose restrictive ordering requirements. Only being able to order half-kilometre long batches of sheet in the colour and thickness they wanted, meant that designers and clothing producers often had to co-operate, or face long delays in supplying their customers, if they wanted to be in the rubber clothing business.

Since 2000, however, the sheet market has been exposed to competition from international suppliers courtesy of the Internet. This has produced an explosion in [[cottage industry]] scale latex fetish clothing manufacturers.

Latex sheet-based clothing is constructed by a three-stage process. First a pattern for a specific garment is selected, and adjusted carefully to suit the measurements supplied by the customer. Then the sheet latex is cut out on a flat board, by hand: lastly latex glue (generally rubber cement solvent-based adhesives) is used to join seams together. Skilled latex makers can build a stocking, shaped to match the contours of a specific person's leg, made from latex only 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm thick, in under an hour.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} It is possible to use water-based glues such as Copydex to make latex clothes; however, the long-term durability of items made this way is somewhat dubious.

Latex moulded clothing is produced by dipping a mould into a vat of liquid rubber. Dealing with raw liquid latex is more difficult because of the extra effort that must be put in to keep the thickness of the latex itself consistent.  Because of this, improper molding techniques can lead to inconsistent thickness in the latex, causing it to fail at the weak points faster than items made from sheet latex.  This has led to a major stigma against molded latex garments, in favor of sheet latex versions.  Unfortunately, this stigma has been detrimental to those few latex providers who have proper mold-making techniques.  When done properly, a molded latex garment is just as durable as sheet latex, and it is a preferred method for skilled individuals making items with heavy contours like hoods or gloves.  Despite any attempt to use sheet latex to make hoods and gloves, it is impossible to get solid sheets to fit complex contours as well as a molded latex item can.  The belief that all sheet latex is superior to all molded latex is completely false, and ultimately it depends on the abilities of the creator, as even poorly made sheet latex can fall apart easily.  Sheet latex is the preferred method for items like catsuits, that do not need such perfect form fitting, and are easier to create with sheets compared to the large molds required for body suits.

While there is little difference in latex clothing made from liquid latex versus sheet latex in the hands of a skilled artisan, it should be noted liquid latex is cured via air drying while sheet latex is cured by being vulcanized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.com/ArticlesP/art52064.asp|title=body art 186 - Body Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V98YjsZsJ8IC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=how%20is%20%22sheet%20latex%22%20made%20vulcanization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8em8V5rqlC&amp;sig=v59T5ZzW6RtyWJrWOGM9AkHeNbY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xY_ZUO3pNYr9qQHkmID4Cw&amp;ved=0CG8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20is%20%22sheet%20latex%22%20made%20vulcanization&amp;f=false|title=Latex 2002|date=24 February 2017|publisher=iSmithers Rapra Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does make the two forms slightly different. Due to the difference in curing, liquid latex can be applied to sheet latex clothing to add unique patterns and designs which can be peeled off the sheet latex afterwards.

Neither moulded, nor sheet-based, latex is amenable to large-scale mass production. Skilled manual artistry is an integral part of the process; this means that made-to-measure and special designs are much more accessible to the general buyer, in looking at fetish latex, than is the case with regular textiles.{{fact|date=March 2017}}

== Use in clothing ==

Latex has been used to make [[leotard]]s, [[bodysuit]]s, [[stocking]]s and [[glove]]s, besides other garments. Latex is also often used to make specialist fetishistic garments like hoods and rubber cloaks.

Latex clothing is generally made from large sheets of latex which are delivered in rolls. The "classic" colour for fetishistic latex clothing is black, but latex is naturally translucent and may be dyed any colour, including metallic shades or white. It can come in thicknesses which generally range from about 0.18&amp;nbsp;mm to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm. Instead of being sewn, latex clothing is generally glued along its seams.

Because latex sheet is relatively weak, latex clothing needs special care to avoid tearing. While latex can be repaired using materials similar to those provided in a bicycle repair kit, the result is rarely as attractive as the original appearance of the garment.

Latex clothing is often polished to preserve and improve its shiny appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.otleyrunfancydress.co.uk/2012/03/01/latex-care/|title=Latex Care Guide by Otley Run Fancy Dress|date=1 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Putting on latex clothing can be difficult, because latex has high friction against dry skin. To make it easier to put on, wearers often use [[talc]] to reduce friction against the skin when putting the clothes on; then, because stray talc is very visible against the rubber, wearers generally polish off any visible talc. Another method of dressing is using lubricant (or 'lube') which provides a slippery surface for the latex to glide over.  A third method of reducing or eliminating the high friction of latex when dressing is to chlorinate the rubber.  [[Chlorine]] in gaseous form is generated by the reaction of hydrochloric acid and sodium hypochlorite.  This chlorine bonds to the first few molecules on the surface of the [[isoprene]] (latex) and transforms them into [[neoprene]].{{fact|date=July 2016}} This process affects metallic colours, but does not affect strength.

Latex may also be painted directly onto the body as latex in liquid form, which is also sometimes used to close seams in the creation of latex clothing. Removal of a painted on liquid latex garment can result in painful hair removal.  Wearers avoid this by preparing the skin by prior hair removal, the use of release agents to prevent the latex adhering to the hair, or using products such as [[orange oil]] to weaken the latex during removal.

Use of latex clothing has been popularized by media appearances, such as the outfit of [[Catwoman]], a [[cat burglar]], in ''[[Batman Returns]]'' or the outfits in [[The Matrix]] which are mostly made of latex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevedietgoedde.com/bloggy/2008/05/catwoman.html|title=The Artistic Pursuits of Steve Diet Goedde: Catwoman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Use in fetish community ==

Latex clothing is a popular feature of the [[BDSM]] community. Pioneered by prominent [[Dominatrix|dominatrixes]] such as [[Saffron Taylor]].

'''Los Alamos National Laboratory''' ('''Los Alamos''' or '''LANL''' for short) is a [[United States Department of Energy National Labs|United States Department of Energy national laboratory]] initially organized during [[World War II]] for the design of [[nuclear weapon]]s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. It is located a short distance northwest of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] in the southwestern [[United States]].

Los Alamos was selected as the top secret location for bomb design in late 1942, and officially commissioned the next year. At the time it was known as [[Project Y]], one of a series of laboratories located across the United States given letter names to maintain their secrecy. Los Alamos was the centre for design and overall coordination, while the other labs, today known as [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne]], concentrated on the production of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] bomb fuels. Los Alamos was the heart of the project, collecting together some of the world's most famous scientists, among them numerous [[Nobel Prize]] winners. The site was known variously as Project Y,  Los Alamos Laboratory, and Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory through this period.

The lab's existence was announced to the world in the post-WWII era, when it became known universally as Los Alamos. In 1952, the Department of Energy formed a second design lab under the direction of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], becoming the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL). Since that date the two labs have competed on a wide variety of bomb designs. With the ending of the [[Cold War]], both labs turned their focus increasingly to civilian missions. Today, Los Alamos is one of the largest science and technology institutions in the world. It conducts multidisciplinary research in fields such as [[national security]], [[space exploration]], [[nuclear fusion]], [[renewable energy]],&lt;ref&gt;

After several reorganizations, the LANL is currently managed and operated by [[Triad National Security|Triad National Security, LLC]].

==History==

===The Manhattan Project===
{{Main|Project Y}}
The laboratory was founded during [[World War II]] as a secret, centralized facility to coordinate the scientific research of the [[Manhattan Project]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] project to develop the first [[nuclear weapon]]s. In September 1942, the difficulties encountered in conducting preliminary studies on [[nuclear weapon]]s at universities scattered across the country indicated the need for a laboratory dedicated solely to that purpose.

General [[Leslie Groves]] wanted a central laboratory at an isolated location for safety, and to keep the scientists away from the populace. It should be at least 200 miles from international boundaries and west of the Mississippi. Major John Dudley suggested [[Oak City, Utah|Oak City]], Utah or [[Jemez Springs, New Mexico|Jemez Springs]], New Mexico but both were rejected. Jemez Springs was only a short distance from the current site. Manhattan Project scientific director [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] had spent much time in his youth in the New Mexico area, and suggested the [[Los Alamos Ranch School]] on the [[mesa]]. Dudley had rejected the school as not meeting Groves’ criteria, but as soon as Groves saw it he said in effect "This is the place".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppenheimer became the laboratory's first director.

During the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos hosted thousands of employees, including many [[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientists. The location was a total secret. Its only mailing address was a post office box, number 1663, in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], New Mexico. Eventually two other post office boxes were used, 180 and 1539, also in Santa Fe.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though its contract with the [[University of California]] was initially intended to be temporary,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} the relationship was maintained long after the war. Until the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], University of California president [[Robert Gordon Sproul|Robert Sproul]] did not know what the purpose of the laboratory was and thought it might be producing a "[[death ray]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cstms.berkeley.edu/archive/oppenheimer/exhibit/chapter3.html Cstms.berkeley.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019071050/http://cstms.berkeley.edu/archive/oppenheimer/exhibit/chapter3.html |date=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only member of the UC administration who knew its true purpose—indeed, the only one who knew its exact physical location—was the Secretary-Treasurer Robert Underhill, who was in charge of wartime contracts and liabilities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

[[Image:Trinity Test Fireball 16ms.jpg|left|thumb|The first stages of the explosion of the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]].]]
The work of the laboratory culminated in the creation of several atomic devices, one of which was used in the first [[nuclear testing|nuclear test]] near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]], codenamed "[[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]", on July 16, 1945. The other two were weapons, "[[Little Boy]]" and "[[Fat Man]]", which were used in the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Laboratory received the [[Army-Navy ‘E’ Award]] for Excellence in production on October 16, 1945.

===Post-war===
After the war, Oppenheimer retired from the directorship, and it was taken over by [[Norris Bradbury]], whose initial mission was to make the previously hand-assembled atomic bombs "G.I. proof" so that they could be mass-produced and used without the assistance of highly trained scientists. Many of the original Los Alamos "luminaries" chose to leave the laboratory, and some even became outspoken opponents to the further development of nuclear weapons.

The name officially changed to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory on January 1, 1947. By this time, Argonne had already been made the first National Laboratory the previous year. Los Alamos would not become a National Laboratory in name until 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Plans and Practices for Groundwater Protection at the Los Alamos National Laboratory |publisher= National Research Council |page=5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=smObAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years since the 1940s, Los Alamos was responsible for the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]], and many other variants of nuclear weapons. In 1952, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was founded to act as Los Alamos' "competitor", with the hope that two laboratories for the design of nuclear weapons would spur innovation. Los Alamos and Livermore served as the primary classified laboratories in the U.S. national laboratory system, designing all the country's nuclear arsenal. Additional work included basic scientific research, [[particle accelerator]] development, health physics, and fusion power research as part of [[Project Sherwood]]. Many nuclear tests were undertaken in the [[Marshall Islands]] and at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. During the late-1950s, a number of scientists including [[John Robert Beyster|Dr. J. Robert "Bob" Beyster]] left Los Alamos to work for [[General Atomics]] (GA) in [[San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;

Three major nuclear-related accidents have occurred at LANL. [[Criticality accident]]s occurred in August 1945 and May 1946, and a third accident occurred during an annual physical inventory in December 1958.&lt;ref name=unsc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/11-80076_Report_2008_Annex_C.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation – 2008 Report to the General Assembly |volume=II Scientific Annexes C, D, and E - Annex C: Radiation exposures in accidents |website=[[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] |pages=2–3 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several buildings associated with the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos were declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{cite web |url={{NHLS url|id=66000893}} |format=pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form / Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory |date=January 14, 1974 |first=Richard |last=Greenwood |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=June 21, 2009}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url={{NHLS url|id=66000893|photos=y}} |title=Accompanying photos |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Cold War===
At the end of the [[Cold War]], both labs went through a process of intense scientific diversification in their research programs to adapt to the changing political conditions that no longer required as much research towards developing new nuclear weapons and has led the lab to increase research for "non-war" science and technology. Los Alamos' nuclear work is currently thought to relate primarily to computer simulations and [[stockpile stewardship]]. The development of the [[Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility]] will allow complex simulations of nuclear tests to take place without full explosive yields.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The lab has made intense efforts for [[humanitarian]] causes through its scientific research in medicine. Three vaccines for the [[AIDS virus]] are being tested by lab scientist Bette Korber and her team. "These vaccines might finally deal a lethal blow to the [[HIV|AIDS virus]]", says Chang-Shung Tung, leader of the Lab's Theoretical Biology and Biophysics group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanl.gov/news/releases/hiv_vaccine_strategy_expands_immune_responses_news_release.html |title=HIV Vaccine Strategy Expands Immune Responses |first=Bette |last=Korber |date=March 3, 2010 |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021050027/http://www.lanl.gov/news/releases/hiv_vaccine_strategy_expands_immune_responses_news_release.html |archivedate=October 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also development for a safer, more comfortable and accurate test for [[breast cancer]] by Lab scientists Lianjie Huang and Kenneth M. Hanson and collaborators. The new technique, called ultrasound-computed tomography (ultrasound CT), uses sound waves to accurately detect small tumors that traditional mammography cannot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Lianjie|last2=Hanson|first2=Kenneth M.|last3=Quan|first3=Youli|last4=Li|first4=Cuiping|last5=Duric|first5=Neb|chapter=Globally optimized Fourier finite-difference method for ultrasound breast imaging|title=Medical Imaging 2008: Ultrasonic Imaging and Signal Processing |series=Proceedings of SPIE|volume=692007|doi=10.1117/12.771024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laboratory contributed to the early development of the [[flow cytometry]] technology. In the 1950s, researcher Mack Fulwyler developed a technique for sorting [[erythrocytes]] that combined the Coulter Principle of [[Coulter counter]] technologies, which measures the presence of cells and their size, with ink jet technology, which produces a laminar flow of liquid that breaks up into separate, fine drops. In 1969, Los Alamos reported the first fluorescence detector apparatus, which accurately measured the number and size of ovarian cells and blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=sYZuiy4BbvUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=flow+cytometry+principles&amp;ots=jcxa4lXAek&amp;sig=3-AR7OFH6ZplN9eUhVDMNS7UYDw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Flow Cytometry First Principles | first = Alice | last = Givan |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research performed at the lab includes developing cheaper, cleaner bio-fuels and advancing scientific understanding around renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanl.gov/science-innovation/science-programs/applied-energy-programs/index.php|title=Applied Energy Program|website=Los Alamos National Laboratory|access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-nuclear [[national security]] and defense development is also a priority at the lab. This includes preventing outbreaks of deadly diseases by improving detection tools and the monitoring the effectiveness of the United States’ [[vaccine]] distribution infrastructure. Additional advancements include the ASPECT airplane that can detect bio threats from the sky.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The laboratory has attracted negative publicity from a number of events.  In 1999, Los Alamos scientist [[Wen Ho Lee]] was accused of 59 counts of mishandling classified information by downloading nuclear secrets—"weapons codes" used for computer simulations of nuclear weapons tests—to data tapes and removing them from the lab. After ten months in jail, Lee pleaded guilty to a single count and the other 58 were dismissed with an apology from U.S. District Judge [[James Aubrey Parker|James Parker]] for his incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, two computer hard drives containing classified data were announced to have gone missing from a secure area within the laboratory, but were later found behind a photocopier; in 2003, the laboratory's director [[John C. Browne (physicist)|John Browne]], and deputy director, resigned following accusations that they had improperly dismissed two [[whistleblower]]s who had alleged widespread theft at the lab. The year 2000 brought additional hardship for the laboratory in the form of the [[Cerro Grande Fire]], a severe [[Wildfire|forest fire]] that destroyed several buildings (and employees' homes) and forced the laboratory to close for two weeks.

In July 2004, an inventory of classified weapons data revealed that four [[hard disk drive]]s were missing:  two of the drives were subsequently found to have been improperly moved to a different building, but another two remained unaccounted for.  In response, director [[Peter Nanos]] shut down large parts of the laboratory and publicly rebuked scientists working there for a lax attitude to security procedures. In the laboratory's August 2004 newsletter he wrote, "This willful flouting of the rules must stop, and I don't care how many people I have to fire to make it stop". Nanos is also quoted as saying, "If I have to restart the laboratory with 10 people, I will". However, a report released in January 2005 found that the drives were in fact an artifact of an inconsistent inventory system: the report concludes that 12 barcodes were issued to a group of disk drives that needed only 10, but the two surplus barcodes nevertheless appeared on a master list. Thus, auditors wrongly concluded that two disks were missing. The report states, "The allegedly missing disks never existed and no compromise of classified material has occurred". This incident is widely reported as contributing to continuing distrust of management at the lab. In May 2005, Nanos stepped down as director.

== Science mission ==
Los Alamos National Laboratory's mission is to solve national security challenges through scientific excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanl.gov/mission/index.php|title=Mission|last=Energy|first=Los Alamos National Laboratory, Operated by Los Alamos National Security, LLC, for the U.S. Department of|website=www.lanl.gov|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory's strategic plan reflects U.S. priorities spanning nuclear security, intelligence, defense, emergency response, nonproliferation, counterterrorism, energy security, emerging threats, and environmental management. This strategy is aligned with priorities set by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE), the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] (NNSA), and national strategy guidance documents, such as the [[Nuclear Posture Review]], the [[National Security Strategy (United States)|National Security Strategy]], and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160815011713/https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/blueprint-secure-energy-future Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future]

Los Alamos is the senior laboratory in the [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|DOE system]], and executes work in all areas of the DOE mission: national security, science, energy, and environmental management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/mission|title=Mission {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.energy.gov|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory also performs work for the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] (IC), and [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), among others.
The laboratory's multidisciplinary scientific capabilities and activities are organized into four Science Pillars:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanl.gov/science-innovation/pillars/index.php|title=Capabilities: Science Pillars|last=Energy|first=Los Alamos National Laboratory, Operated by Los Alamos National Security, LLC, for the U.S. Department of|website=www.lanl.gov|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Information, Science, and Technology Pillar''' leverages advances in theory, algorithms, and the exponential growth of high-performance computing to accelerate the integrative and predictive capability of the scientific method.
* '''The Materials for the Future Pillar''' seeks to optimize materials for national security applications by predicting and controlling their performance and functionality through discovery science and engineering.
* '''The Nuclear and Particle Futures Pillar''' applies science and technology to intransigent problems of system identification and characterization in areas of global security, nuclear defense, energy, and health.
* '''The Science of Signatures Pillar''' integrates nuclear experiments, theory, and simulation to understand and engineer complex nuclear phenomena.
Through partnerships across government agencies, laboratories, universities, and industry, Los Alamos integrates science, technology, research and development solutions to achieve the maximum impact on strategic national security priorities. To further these collaborative efforts, Los Alamos operates three main user facilities:
# [http://cint.lanl.gov/ The Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies]: The Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies is a DOE/Office of Science National User Facility operated jointly by Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories with facilities at both Laboratories.

==Laboratory management and operations==
Around LANL's 43-square-mile property are 2,000 dumpsites which have permanently contaminated the environment. It also contributed to thousands of dumpsites at 108 locations in 29 US states.&lt;ref name=sf&gt;{{cite news|author1=Staci Matlock|title=TRINITY: 70 YEARS LATER 'Los Alamos will never be clean'|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/los-alamos-will-never-be-clean/article_a3cc7ce1-8af0-5113-8f38-5d4aa673fd7a.html|accessdate=July 18, 2015|work=The Santa Fe New Mexican|date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract changes===
Continuing efforts to make the laboratory more efficient led the Department of Energy to open its contract with the University of California to bids from other vendors in 2003. Though the university and the laboratory had difficult relations many times since their first World War II contract, this was the first time that the university ever had to compete for management of the laboratory. The University of California decided to create a private company with the [[Bechtel]] Corporation, [[Washington Group International]], and the [[BWX Technologies]] to bid on the contract to operate the laboratory. The UC/Bechtel led corporation—[[Los Alamos National Security, LLC]] (LANS)—was pitted against a team formed by the [[University of Texas System]] partnered with [[Lockheed-Martin]]. In December 2005, the Department of Energy announced that LANS had won the next seven-year contract to manage and operate the laboratory.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

On June 1, 2006, the University of California ended its sixty years of direct involvement in operating Los Alamos National Laboratory, and management control of the laboratory was taken over by [[Los Alamos National Security, LLC]] with effect October 1, 2007. Approximately 95% of the former 10,000 plus UC employees at LANL were rehired by LANS to continue working at LANL. Other than UC appointing three members to the eleven member board of directors that oversees LANS, UC now has virtually no responsibility or direct involvement in LANL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and its two national laboratories in California ([[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Lawrence Berkeley]] and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore]]) no longer apply to LANL, and the LANL director no longer reports to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President. Also, LANL employees were removed from the UC's [[403(b)]] retirement savings and defined benefits [[pension]] program and placed in a LANS run program. While the LANS retirement program provides rehired UC employees with pensions similar to those UC would have given them, LANS no longer guarantees full pensions to newly hired LANL employees. It now provides basic [[401(k)]] retirement saving options.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

On June 8, 2018, the NNSA announced that [[Triad National Security|Triad National Security, LLC]], a joint venture between Batelle Memorial Institute, the University of California, and Texas A&amp;M University, would assume operation and management of LANL beginning November 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=National Nuclear Security Administration |date=2018-06-08 |title=NNSA awards Los Alamos National Laboratory Management &amp; Operating Contract |url=https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/articles/nnsa-awards-los-alamos-national-laboratory-management-operating-contract |location=Washington, D.C |access-date=2018-07-29 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety Management===

In August 2011, a near criticality incident happened with eight rods of plutonium placed close to each other to take a photo. In the aftermath, 12 of 14 of the lab's safety staff left in anger about their advice being dismissed by the management. Without safety management, the Plutonium Facility PF-4 was shut down in 2013 and is still closed in 2017 because the lab fails to meet expectations.&lt;ref&gt;The Center for Public Integrity, Patrick Malone: [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/near-disaster-federal-nuclear-weapons-laboratory-takes-hidden-toll-america-s-arsenal ''Repeated safety lapses hobble Los Alamos National Laboratory’s work on the cores of U.S. nuclear warheads'']. Science 356, 2017, [[doi:10.1126/science.aan7026]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the U.S. Department of Energy, sought alternative suppliers the LANL's management contract.&lt;ref name=sciencemag-20180119/&gt;

The lab was penalized with a $57 million reduction in its 2014 budget over the February 14, 2014 accident at the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]] for which it was partly responsible.&lt;ref&gt;W.J.

Until 1999, The Los Alamos National Laboratory hosted the [[arXiv]] e-print archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/e-access/Articles/ginsparg.html|title=Los Alamos loses physics archive as preprint pioneer heads east.|date=June 5, 2001 |accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arXiv is currently operated and funded by [[Cornell University]].

The [[coreboot]] project was initially developed at LANL.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coreboot.org/FAQ#Who_is_working_on_coreboot.3F&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recent years, the Laboratory has developed a major research program in [[systems biology modeling]], known at LANL under the name [[q-bio]].

==Controversy and criticism==
In 2005, Congress held new hearings on lingering security issues at Los Alamos National Weapons Laboratory in New Mexico. But documented problems continued to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The investigation found that the "missing plutonium" was a result of miscalculation by LANL's statisticians and did not actually exist; but, the investigation did lead to heavy criticism of the laboratory by the DOE for security flaws and weaknesses that the DOE claimed to have found.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4554">The '''MSU Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics''' (also known as '''Department of Mechanics and Mathematics''') is one of the most esteemed [[faculty (division)|faculties]] of [[Moscow State University]], widely regarded by students as one of the toughest faculties in the university.

==Brief history==
Although lectures in [[mathematics]] have been delivered since [[Moscow State University]] was founded in 1755, the separate mathematical and physical department was founded only in 1804.  The Mathematics and Mechanics Department was founded on 1 May 1933 and comprised [[mathematics]], [[mechanics]] and [[astronomy]] departments (the latter passed to the [[Physics]] Department in 1956). An extensive development of the department began after [[World War II]]. In 1953 the department moved to the new building on the [[Sparrow Hills]] and the current division in [[mathematics]] and [[mechanics]] branches was settled. In 1970 the [[MSU Department of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics|Department of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics]] broke off the department due to the extensive research in [[computer science]].

==Current state==
Today the Mathematics and Mechanics Department comprises 26 chairs (17 in the [[mathematical]] and 9 in the [[mechanics]] branch) and 14 research laboratories. Around 350 professors, assistant professors and leading researchers work at the department, some of them working also in different institutions of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. Around 2000 students and 450 postgraduates study at the department getting professions “[[Mathematics]]. [[Applied mathematics]]” and “[[Mechanics]]. [[Applied mathematics]]”. The education lasts 5 years (6 years from 2011) and students choose their chair at 3rd year.

[[Image:111807y.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Fox Business Network]]'s Master Control]]

'''Master control''' is the technical hub of a [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] operation common among most over-the-air [[television station]]s and [[television network]]s.  It is distinct from a [[production control room]] (PCR) in [[television studio]]s where the activities such as switching from camera to camera are coordinated. It is also vastly different from the studio where the talent are located.  A [[transmission control room]] (TCR) is usually smaller in size and is a scaled down version of [[centralcasting]].

Master control is the final point before a signal is transmitted over-the-air for [[terrestrial television]] or [[cablecast]], [[satellite]] provider for broadcast, or sent on to a [[cable television]] operator.  Television master control rooms include banks of [[video monitor]]s, satellite [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], [[videotape]] machines, [[video server]]s, transmission equipment, and, more recently, computer [[broadcast automation]] equipment for recording and playback of [[television program]]ming.

Master control is generally staffed with one or two master control operators around-the-clock, every day to ensure continuous operation.  Master control operators are responsible for monitoring the quality and accuracy of the on-air product, ensuring the transmission meets government regulations, troubleshooting equipment malfunctions, and preparing programming for [[playout]].  Regulations include both technical ones (such as those against over-modulation and [[dead air]]), as well as content ones (such as [[indecency]] and [[station ID]]).

Many [[television network]]s and [[radio network]]s or station groups have consolidated facilities and now operate multiple stations from one regional master control or [[centralcasting]] center.  As an example of this centralized [[broadcast programming]] system on a large scale is  [[NBC]]'s "hub-spoke project" that enables "hub" cities such as [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Miami, Florida]] to originate [[television commercial]]s, breaks and programming for many of its smaller individual stations, thus reducing or eliminating some responsibilities and employees of the local master control at NBC, ABC, FOX, '''[[Televisión Pública Argentina]] (Argentina)''', '''[[Channel 13 (Argentina)]] (Argentina)''', '''[[Telefe]] (Argentina)''' '''[[Rede Globo]] (Brazil)''', '''[[RecordTV]] (Brazil)''', '''[[Rede Bandeirantes]] (Brazil)''' [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] (O&amp;O) stations.

Outside the [[United States]], the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) manages four radio networks, two broadcast television networks, and several more cable/satellite radio and television services out of just two master control points ([[Canadian English|English language]] services at the [[Canadian Broadcasting Centre]] in [[Toronto]] and [[Canadian French|French language]] at [[Maison Radio-Canada]] in [[Montreal]]).  Many other public and private broadcasters have taken a similar approach (although the CBC's operation is arguably more complicated than most, with local breakaways on radio and local advertisements on television).

The '''Max Planck Institute for Coal Research''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für Kohlenforschung}}) is an institute located in [[Mülheim|Mülheim an der Ruhr]], [[Germany]] specializing in [[chemistry|chemical research]] on [[catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |URL=http://kofo.mpg.de/en/institute/general-information|title=General information |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (''Max-Planck-Gesellschaft''). Founded in 1912 as the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Coal Research]] (''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Kohlenforschung'') in [[Mülheim an der Ruhr]] to study the chemistry and uses of coal, it became an independent Max Planck Institute in 1949.

==Research==
The Institute carries out basic research in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[organometallic chemistry]], in [[homogeneous catalysis|homogeneous]] and [[heterogeneous catalysis]] as well as in [[theoretical chemistry]]. The principal aim is to develop new methods for the selective and environmentally benign preparation of new compounds and materials.

The MPI KoFo has been at the forefront of research in chemistry since its formation. One of these is the development of the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] through the efforts of [[Franz Joseph Emil Fischer|Franz Fischer]] and [[Hans Tropsch]] in 1925 when the institute was still organized as the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Kohlenforschung''. [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Karl Ziegler]] also worked at the institute alongside [[Hans-Georg Gellert]], one of his former students, to discover aufbau reaction (''Aufbaureaktion'') or growth reaction among [[Organoaluminium chemistry|aluminum alkyl compounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |URL=http://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/institute/history |title=History of the institute |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departments==

===Organic Synthesis===
Research in the Organic Synthesis Department, led by [[Manfred T. Reetz]], involves the introduction of [[molecular biology]] into [[Organic chemistry#Organic synthesis|synthetic organic chemistry]] in the quest to exploit directed evolution of [[stereoselectivity|stereoselective]] [[enzymes]] as catalysts in [[enantioselective synthesis|asymmetric reactions]]. The goals include the implementation of efficient molecular biological strategies and techniques for probing [[Protein sequencing|protein sequence]] [[Sequence space (evolution)|space]] rapidly and the development of high-throughput screening systems for evaluating stereoselectivity and [[thermostability]] of [[enzyme]] [[mutation|mutants]]. Current challenges include selective C-C and C-H activating oxidations of simple and complex organic compounds as well as hydrolytic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/research/organic-synthesis |title=Organic synthesis |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homogeneous Catalysis===
The Homogeneous Catalysis Department, led by {{ill|Benjamin List|de}}, focuses on the development of new catalysis concepts within the areas of [[organocatalysis]], [[transition metals|transition metal]] catalysis, and, to some extent, [[biocatalysis]]. Since 1999, the group concentrates on [[Enantioselective synthesis#Enantioselective catalysis|enantioselective organocatalysis]] as a fundamental approach complementing biocatalysis and transition metal catalysis. They have a profound interest in developing “new reactions”, designing and identifying new principles for the development of organocatalysts, expanding the scope of already developed catalysts such as [[proline]], using organocatalysis in the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals, and also investigating the mechanism by which organocatalysts activate their substrates. Furthermore, in 2005 the department has first conceptualized another approach to asymmetric catalysis, namely [[Asymmetric counteranion-directed catalysis|Asymmetric Counteranion-Directed Catalysis]] (ACDC). This idea has not only progressed within the department but also at other institutions around the globe into a general strategy for asymmetric synthesis applied in organocatalysis as well as in transition metal catalysis and [[Lewis acids and bases#Lewis acids|Lewis acid]] catalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/research/homogeneous-catalysis- |title=Homogeneous catalysis |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterogeneous Catalysis===
The Heterogeneous Catalysis Department, led by [[Ferdi Schüth]], is concentrated on the [[Inorganic chemistry|synthesis and characterization of inorganic materials]] with an application focus in heterogeneous catalysis. Especially important are high surface area materials with controlled [[porosity]] and nanostructured catalysts. Reactions studied include model reactions, such as [[carbon monoxide]] [[carbon monoxide#Bond polarity and oxidation state|oxidation]], and energy relevant conversions, i.e. methane activation, biomass conversion, ammonia decomposition and catalyzed hydrogen storage. This research is supported by studies into the fundamental processes governing solids formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/research/heterogeneous-catalysis |title=Heterogeneous catalysis |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organometallic Chemistry===
The Organometallic Chemistry Department, led by [[Alois Fürstner]], is focused on the development and understanding of organometallic reagents and catalysts, as well as on their application to the synthesis of structurally complex targets of biological significance. Particular attention is paid to the development and validation of catalytic methods for [[Carbon–carbon bond]] formation. Long term projects of current interest concern [[Olefin metathesis|alkene]] and [[Alkyne metathesis|alkyne]] metathesis, the development and use of pi-acids (platinum, gold etc.), iron catalysis and [[Coupling reaction|cross coupling]] in general. Moreover, the group is engaged in the development of novel donor [[ligands]], including [[carbenes]] and compounds containing formally "zerovalent" carbon atoms. All methods are scrutinized by applications to the total synthesis and "diverted total synthesis" of natural products and pharmaceutically active compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/research/organometallic-chemistry |title=Organometallic chemistry |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical Chemistry===
The Theoretical Chemistry Department, led by [[Walter Thiel]], focuses on theoretical developments that extend the scope of [[computational chemistry|computational methodology]], especially for large molecules, and applies theoretical methods to study specific chemical problems, mostly in close cooperation with experimental partners. The activities of the group cover a broad methodological spectrum such as [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio methods]], [[density functional theory]], [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry method|semiempirical methods]] and combined [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]]/[[Molecular mechanics|molecular mechanical]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/research/theoretical-chemistry |title=Theoretical chemistry |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==

MEST was announced in 2007, when [[Meltwater Group|Meltwater]] announced plans to establish an entrepreneurial training program in Africa. The school opened in February 2008 with the first class of Entrepreneurs in Training (EITs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconafrica.com/meltwater-incubator-a-year-in-review/|title=A Year in Review at Meltwater Incubator in Accra - Ghana|publisher=Silicon Africa|first=Monica|last=Jamaluddin|date=23 January 2013|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, the first class of EITs graduated and the MEST [[Business incubator|Incubator]] was launched with [[seed funding]] for incubator companies started by the first group of EITs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/14/out-of-africa-a-whole-mest-of-startups-emerges-in-ghana/|title=Out of Africa - A Whole MEST of Startups Emerges in Ghana|publisher=TechCrunch|first=Mike|last=Butcher|date=14 June 2012|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, MEST partnered with [[Vodafone Ghana]] to sponsor a 48-hour hackathon to help develop access to information, simplify transactions and shorten business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2015/01/mest-partners-vodafone-ghana-hackathon/|title=MEST Partners Vodafone Ghana for Hackathon|first=Tom|last=Jackson|date=28 January 2015 |access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/social/vodafone-mest-hackathon-app-developer-competition-finalised--101941|title=Vodafone, MEST Hackathon App Developer Competition Finalised|publisher=Ghana News Agency|date= 24 March 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, the school was recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative companies of Africa by [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]].&lt;ref name=fast&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3041821/most-innovative-companies-2015/the-worlds-top-10-most-innovative-companies-of-2015-in-africa|title=The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies of 2015 in Africa|publisher=Fast Company|date=9 February 2015|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEST announced a partnership with [[Samsung]] in April 2015. As part of the agreement, Samsung provided subsidized devices and internship positions, as well as marketing services and mobile application distribution, in exchange for the opportunity to invest in MEST companies through its Samsung Enterprise Business Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2015/04/mest-partners-samsung-to-support-west-african-startups/|title=MEST Partners Samsung to Support West African Startups|publisher=Disrupt Africa|first=Tom|last=Jackson|date=23 April 2015|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEST hosted the first Africa Technology Summit in November 2015 in Accra, Ghana, the event featured panels and keynote presentations from a variety of global and African businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyafrique.com/african-technology-summit-ats-2015-accra-ghana/|title=African Technology Summit (ATS) 2015, Accra Ghana|publisher=Tech Afrique|date=12 August 2015|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, MEST began recruiting EITs from the French-speaking [[Ivory Coast]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2016/11/30/l-incubateur-ghaneen-mest-lance-a-abidjan-son-erasmus-des-start-up-africaines_5041115_3212.html|title=L’incubateur Ghanéen MEST Lance à Abidjan son " Erasmus " des Start-up Africaines|publisher=Le Monde|first=Samir|last=Abdelkrim|date=30 November 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened an additional business incubator in [[Lagos]] while planning to open an additional location in [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/654380/ghanas-start-up-incubator-mest-is-rolling-out-its-network-to-kenya-nigeria-and-south-africa/|title=Ghana's Startup Hub Pioneer is Going Pan-African With a $50 Million Fund|publisher=Quartz Africa|first=Yinka|last=Adegoke|date=13 April 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techcabal.com/2016/08/02/neku-atawodi-has-taken-the-reins-at-mests-new-lagos-incubator/|title=Neku Atawodi Has Taken the Reins at MEST's New Lagos Incubator|publisher=TechCabal|first=Osarumen|last=Osamuyi|date=2 August 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Techcab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techcabal.com/2016/03/22/the-mest-training-programme-is-recruiting-in-south-africa-and-expanding-to-kenya-and-nigeria/|title=The MEST Training Programme Is Recruiting In South Africa And Expanding to Kenya and Nigeria|publisher=TechCabal|first=Eric|last=Mugendi|date=22 March 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, MEST entered a partnership with [[Kosmos Energy]] to form the Kosmos Innovation Centre to focus on creating agriculture solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yen.com.gh/40975-kosmos-energy-partners-mest-launch-corporate-social-investment-programme.html|title=Kosmos Innovation Centre Launched in Accra|publisher=Yen|first=Ameyaw|last=Debrah|date=April 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citifmonline.com/2016/06/21/kosmos-makes-strides-in-addressing-challenges-in-agric-sector/|title=Kosmos Makes Strides in Addressing Challenges in Agric Sector|publisher=Citifm Online|date=21 June 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, MEST hosted the second Africa Tech Summit in Lagos, Nigeria, including speakers from [[Google]], [[Uber (company)|Uber]], [[Interswitch]], [[Vodacom]] and [[Samsung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2016/10/mest-to-host-tech-summit-in-lagos/|title=MEST to Host Tech Summit in Lagos|publisher=Disrupt Africa|first=Tom|last=Jackson|date=20 October 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://africabusiness2020.com/2016/11/05/mest-take-africa-tech-summit-nigeria/|title=MEST Take Africa Tech Summit to Nigeria - AB2020|date=2016-11-05|work=AB2020|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''meniscal cyst''' is a  well-defined [[cystic]] [[lesion]] located along the [[peripheral]] margin of the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]], a part of the knee, nearly always associated with horizontal [[meniscal tears]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Pain and swelling or [[focal mass]] at the level of the joint. The pain may be related to a meniscal tear or distension of the knee capsule or both. The mass varies in consistency from soft/[[fluctuan]]t to hard. Size is variable, and meniscal cysts are known to change in size with knee flexion/extension.

==Cause==
Various [[etiology|etiologies]] have been proposed, including [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[hemorrhage]], chronic [[infection]], and [[mucus|mucoid]] degeneration. The most widely accepted theory describes meniscal cysts resulting from extrusion of [[synovial fluid|synovial]] fluid through a peripherally extended horizontal meniscal tear, accumulating outside the joint capsule. They arise more commonly from the [[medial joint]] margin, and occur most often in 20- to 40-year-old males.

==Diagnosis==
[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] is the [[Medical imaging|modality]] of choice for diagnosis of meniscal cysts. In their most subtle form, meniscal cysts present as focal areas of high signal intensity within a swollen meniscus. It is not uncommon for [[radiologists]] to miss this type of meniscal cyst because the signal intensity is not quite as great as fluid on T2 weighted sequences.2 When this fluid is extruded into the adjacent soft tissues, the swollen meniscus subsequently assumes a more normal shape, and the extruded fluid demonstrates a higher T2 signal typical of [[parameniscal]] [[cysts]].

==Treatment==
Treatment of meniscal cysts consists of a combination of cyst decompression ([[intraarticular]] decompression versus open [[cystectomy]]) and [[arthroscopic]] repair of any meniscal abnormalities. Success rates are significantly higher when both the cyst and meniscal tear are treated compared to treating only one disease process.

The '''Mercedes-Benz Bionic''' was a [[concept car]] created by [[DaimlerChrysler AG]] under the [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] Group. It was first introduced in 2005 at the DaimlerChrysler Innovation Symposium in [[Washington, D. C.]] The Bionic was modeled after a type of [[fish]], the [[yellow boxfish]], ''Ostracion cubicus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Bionic" Car Fueled by Fishy Ideas|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2005/06/0615_050615_fishcar.html|work=National Geographic|accessdate=18 October 2013|date=15 June 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019205924/http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2005/06/0615_050615_fishcar.html|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also has 80% lower [[nitrogen]] [[nitrogen oxide|oxide]] emissions with its [[selective catalytic reduction]] technology.

==Engine and performance==
The Bionic is powered by a 103&amp;nbsp;kW direct-injection [[diesel engine]] that gives out around 70 [[Miles per gallon|MPG (US)]] (~3.36 L/100&amp;nbsp;km). This engine also gives out around a total of {{convert|140|hp||0|abbr=on}} and a little over {{convert|221|ft·lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at around 1600 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]. The Bionic can go from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in about 8 seconds and has a top speed of a little over {{convert|190|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} .

==Design==
The exterior design was modeled after the yellow boxfish (''[[Ostracion cubicus]]''), a marine fish that lives in coral reefs. Mercedes-Benz decided to model the Bionic after this fish due to the supposed low [[coefficient of drag]] of its body shape and the rigidity of its [[exoskeleton]]; this influenced the car's unusual looks. Other parts of the design include the fact that the rear wheels are partially fitted with plastic and that it's considered as a lightweight vehicle. Mercedes-Benz reported a [[drag coefficient]] of 0.19;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/03/08/cars.fish.popsci/index.html Mercedes' fish-inspired car] CNN (retrieved 2008-08-12)&lt;/ref&gt; for comparison, the production vehicle with the lowest ever C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; value was the [[GM EV1]], at 0.195. While the Bionic had a much larger internal volume than the EV1, the Bionic's larger frontal area made the EV1 more aerodynamic overall, as drag is a product of the area and the drag coefficient.

[[File:ReconstructedOetziAxe.jpg|thumb| Reconstruction of [[Ötzi]]'s copper axe (c. 3300 BC)]]

The [[Copper Age]], also called the [[Eneolithic]] or the [[Chalcolithic]] Age, has been traditionally understood as a transitional period between the [[Neolithic]] and the [[Bronze Age]], in which a gradual introduction of the metal ([[native copper]]) took place, while stone was still the main resource utilized. Recent archaeology has found that the metal was not introduced so gradually and that this entailed significant social changes, such as developments in the type of habitation (larger villages, launching of fortifications), long-distance trade, and copper [[metallurgy]].

Roughly, the Copper Age could be situated chronologically between the 5th and 6th [[millennium|millennia]] BC in places like the archaeological sites of [[Majdanpek]], [[Јarmovac]] and [[Pločnik]] (a copper axe from 5500&amp;nbsp;BC belonging to the [[Vinča culture]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/002605.html Neolithic Vinča was a metallurgical culture] Stonepages from news sources November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat later, in the 5th millennium BC, metalwork is attested at [[Rudna Glava]] mine in [[Serbia]],&lt;ref&gt;Tasić, 1995, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; and at Ai Bunar mine in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muzeuluniriialba.ro/docs/apulum/articole/40.%20sentmiklosi.pdf{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

3rd millennium BC copper metalwork is attested in places like [[Palmela]] (Portugal), [[Cortes de Navarra]] (Spain), and [[Stonehenge]] (United Kingdom). However, as often happens with the [[prehistoric]] times, the limits of the age cannot be clearly defined and vary with different sources.

==Inception of metallurgy in Europe==
The theory that [[metallurgy]] was imported into Europe from the Near East has been practically ruled out. A second hypothesis, that there were two main points of origin of metallurgy in Europe, in southern Spain and in West Bulgaria, is also doubtful due to the existence of sites outside the centers of diffusion where metallurgy was known simultaneously with, or before, those in the ‘original’ nuclei, such as [[Brixlegg]] (Tyrol, Austria), while sites closer to the supposed origins of metallurgy, such as in the north of Spain, show fewer metal artifacts than sites in the south and practically no evidence of production (Perez Arrondo 1986).

Currently, the general opinion is that the development of metallurgy took place independently in different places, at different times, with various techniques. One fact that supports this interpretation is that, although the final products (beads, rings, sickles, swords, axes, etc.) are quite similar throughout Europe, the method of production is not. Thus the use of [[Crucible#Chalcolithic|crucibles]] was the technique utilized in the south of Spain, whereas central Europe employed a [[Ancient iron production#Early copper smelting slag|slagging process]], but Cabrierés (France) used a primitive oxidizing non-slagging process (Bourgarit, et al. 2003), while in the British Isles the absence of debris, slag or ceramic suggests another technique (Craddock 1995).

Consequently, the way in which metallurgy was initiated differs considerably depending on the region. There are areas in which copper seems to play a crucial role (i.e., the Balkans), whereas other areas show no interest in it at all. Then there are societies that use copper artifacts but do not practice metallurgy (Mohen 1992; 71), and there are other ones that fully adopt some of the cultural innovations but ignore the rest. One example of the latter is [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]] in northern Spain, where splendid large [[dolmen]]s are present along the [[Ebro river]], but metal is rather infrequent, and when it does appear between the trapping, it is more often [[bronze]] or [[arsenical copper]] than [[copper]] (Cava 1984).

==Reasons to use copper==
Copper is the eighth most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, is available all over the world,  and is one of the few that can appear in a pure state (Atkinson 1987). It is not complicated to work with, and a bare hammering can be enough to transform a nugget into a bead. The eye-catching look of native copper makes it easy to recognize, and even flashier if converted into jewelry, a possible motivation for humankind to start the metallurgy with it. An evolutive technological process (Coghlan 1975, Mohen 1992; 48) has been described, although there are authors like Javinovic (Mohen 1992; 52) who think that it is not necessary to pass through the first stages to reach the last one.

===Converting copper===
[[Image:Native Copper Macro Digon3.jpg|thumb|Sample of native copper.]]
To start with, the raw material must be obtained. [[Copper]] can be found in over 160 different minerals (Atkinson 1987), but mining activities are entailed to obtain them in large quantities if a reasonable amount of copper is wanted. Some of the most commonly exploited minerals are [[cuprite]], [[malachite]], [[azurite]], [[chalcopyrite]], [[chrysocolla]] and [[tennantite]]; e.g. [[malachite]] was extracted in [[Rudna Glava]] (Serbia), Cabrierés (France) or Chinflón ([[Riotinto]], Spain). In fact, one of the possible explanations about what ''[[Ötzi the Iceman]]'', the ancient [[mummy]] found in the Alps who lived around 3300 years BC, was doing at {{convert|3210|m|ft|-1}} of altitude is that he could have been prospecting for new ores of minerals (Peroni 1996; 336).

Secondly, the mineral is separated from the [[gangue]]. This is only possible by [[smelting]] or [[beneficiation]]. To do so, it is necessary to use a furnace that is able to reach at least {{convert|1089|°C|°F|0}}.

Lastly, a wide range of specific tools and resources have to be available, such as furnaces, moulds, [[crucible]]s, mauls, etc.

*'''Stage A:''' Although [[native copper]] nowadays is frequently displayed in museum showcases of mineral collections, it once occurred copiously during prehistoric times. In [[Cyprus]] or [[Crete]], collecting the mineral was once as easy as simply picking it up from the ground. In fact, native copper is no longer as easy to find in that state these days. The treatment of this native mineral was also uncomplicated through cold-hammering. This only permitted the production of a limited range of artifacts like awls, pins, or beads. In larger objects, the metal cracks when it is cold-hammered.
*'''Stage B:''' Annealing the metal on an open fire ({{convert|200|-|300|°C|°F|-1|disp=or}} is hot enough) reduces its hardness considerably and gives in malleability. This permits the manufacture of slightly more sophisticated objects, like bracelets, but is still a rather limited technique.
*'''Stage C:''' In the first two steps, the mineral used was [[native copper]] that does not actually need specialized technology. Probably, due to the situation that native copper was increasingly difficult to find, copper ore is used in this third step. This is a very significant development. In fact, this is truly the beginning of the [[metallurgy]], as the mineral has to be smelted to separate the copper from the [[gangue]], requiring technology.

==Early mining in Europe==
[[Image:Chrysokoll Chrysocolla.jpg|thumb|Polished [[chrysocolla]].]]
Minerals of copper were known from ancient times. In Crete, little fragments of [[malachite]] and [[azurite]] were powdered and used as make up or to decorate ceramic in an early date such as 6000&amp;nbsp;BC (Mohen 1992).

Therefore, the minerals were not collected because people were looking for copper but for virtues like those mentioned or simply because of its brightness and colour, but this knowledge of the minerals is critical since they already knew how to recognize them and where to collect them when, later, they started the systematic search for ores.

Numerous examples of mines are known all over Europe (Craddock 1980, Mohen 1992 and 1996, Shennan 1999, Bartelheim et al. 2003) from the east: [[Rudna Glava]] (Serbia), Ai Bunar (Bulgaria); to the west: [[Mount Gabriel]] (Ireland), [[Great Orme]], [[Alderley Edge]] (United Kingdom); crossing Central Europe: [[Mitterberg]] (Salzach, Austria), [[Neuchâtel]] (Switzerland), Cabrierés (France); to the south: [[Riotinto]], [[Mola Alta de Serelles]] (Spain); and the Mediterranean: [[Corsica]], Cyprus, and the [[Cyclades]] islands. It is remarkable that, usually, it is not a single mine but a complex, with a variable, large number of mineshafts, as in [[Rudna Glava]] (30) or [[Mount Gabriel]] (31).

==Techniques and tools==
The techniques observed in all of them are quite similar. Basically they used the thermic alteration or firesetting (Mohen 1992, Craddock 1995, Eiroa et al. 1996, Timberlake 2003). This consists of applying fire to the rock and then pouring water over it: the rapid changes of temperature will cause cracks within the rocks that can be totally broken with the help of mauls and picks. Then the useful masses were selected, crushed and transported to the production centre that could be in the surrounding area ([[Mitterberg]]) or far away ([[Rudna Glava]]).

The mines were exploited in extremely efficient and clever ways, according to the technology available (Jovanovic 1980, Craddock 1995, Timberlake 2003). The entire convenient mineral was collected and the abandoned shafts carefully refilled with gangue and rocks (Mohen 1992; 85). For example, at [[Mount Gabriel]], it was estimated that they extracted the astonishing number of {{convert|32570.15|tonne}} of rock, gangue and ore. The usable amount of copper was 162.85 tonnes and the final smelting finished metal was 146.56 tonnes (Jackson 1980; 24). The entire process was thoroughly described in 1744 by Lewis Morris, Crown Mineral Agent for Cardiganshire, and, incidentally, [[antiquarian]] (Timberlake, 2003, 22):

{{cquote|Their method seems to be this. They make a great fire of wood in the bottom of their rakes which were always open up on that account, and when the rock was sufficiently hot they cast water upon it, which shiver’d it; and then with stone wedges, which they drove in with other stones, they work’d their way through the hardest rocks, tho’ but slowly.}}

The tools employed are mainly presented in Lewis' observations, but other ones have been recovered in archaeological context:
*&lt;span style="color:#515151"&gt;'''Stone tools:'''&lt;/span&gt; The most frequent find are the stone hammers, normally made of hard rocks accessible to the mine, beach or river pebbles (Jovanovic 1980, Craddock 1995). There is no standardization of these mauls but is common a system of hafting, usually a groove carved in the middle for where a rope was tied to the handle, like the twisted hazel recovered in [[Copa Hill]] (Timberlake 2003; 32-33).
* &lt;span style="color:#515151"&gt;'''Antler and bone tools:'''&lt;/span&gt; Picks and scrapes made of bone and [[antler]]s have been found in the majority of the mines (Craddock 1995).
* &lt;span style="color:#515151"&gt;'''Wood:'''&lt;/span&gt; Evidence of wooden tools are more infrequent. Nevertheless in places like Ai Bunar or [[Mount Gabriel]] were recovered [[shovel]]s and wedges. A rudimentary system of stairs or [[scaffolding]]s can be supposed (Mohen 1992).
* &lt;span style="color:#515151"&gt;'''Metal:'''&lt;/span&gt; The use of any metallic tool is rather strange and extraordinary. It seems that the copper was not used for the miners' tools. However copper [[chisel]]s and discarded axes could be utilized as wedges. (Craddock 1995; 97)
* &lt;span style="color:#515151"&gt;'''Other evidence:'''&lt;/span&gt; The presence of [[coal]] and [[charcoal]], crucial for the firing (fire-setting) and furnace (fuel), is habitual. Leather sacks (at Ai Bunar) and shoulder baskets (at Copa Hill) were used to transport the crushed mineral.

==Society==
The information available about the people of the [[Copper Age]] has not substantially increased along with the number of archaeological sites. Several ideas have been proffered, one of the most followed is that the metal itself did not bring abrupt transformation into the people's life (Cunliffe 1998) or even more that ''‘early copper does not produce anything useful at all’'' (Renfrew 1986, 146), meaning with this that with the copper, they produced mainly [[jewellery]] and, overall, weapons that obviously were not within reach of the majority of the population but only to privileged individuals. In other words, the real importance of the metal is not utilitarian but social. This is a suitable explanation about the rising of Great Cultures of Metal such as [[Vinča culture]] (Ex-Yugoslavia) [[Tiszapolgar]] and [[Unetice culture]] (Central Europe), [[Remedello culture|Remedello]] and [[Rinaldone]] (Italy), [[Montagne Noire]] (France), [[El Argar]] and [[Targas, Spain|Targas]] (Spain), etc.
[[Image:Or de Varna - Nécropole.jpg|right|thumb|Male tomb of Varna (Bulgaria). 5th millennium BC.]]

As the period moved forward, especially around the 3rd millennium, new and complex realities would appear strongly linked to the metal, like the impressive fortified villages of [[Los Millares]] (Spain), [[Vila Nova de Sao Pedro]] (Portugal) or the more modest [[cairn]] next to Copa Hill (United Kingdom) apparently destinated to control the centres of extraction, or the equally stunning and generalized cultural phenomenons of [[Megalithism]], [[Rock Art]], [[Bell Beakers]] Vessels… that are known from Scandinavia to the South of Spain and from Scotland to Turkey.

'''Mostafa Kamal Tolba''' ({{Lang-ar|مصطفى كمال طلبة}}) (8 December 1922 – 28 March 2016) was an [[Egypt]]ian scientist who served for seventeen years as the Executive Director of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Environment Encyclopedia and Directory 2001|date=2001|publisher=Europa Publications|isbn=1857430891|page=545|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Born in the town of [[Zifta]] (located in [[Gharbia Governorate]]), Tolba graduated from [[Cairo University]] in 1943 and obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[Imperial College London]] five years later. He established his own school in [[microbiology]] at Cairo University's Faculty of Science and also taught at the [[University of Baghdad]] during the 1950s. In addition to his academic career Tolba worked in the Egyptian civil service.&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ozone.unep.org/Events/awards2005_profiles.shtml |title=2005 Awards Profiles: Mostafa Kamal Tolba (Egypt) |work=The Vienna Convention Award For Outstanding Contributions to the Protection of the Ozone Layer |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]] |accessdate=2010-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150412223537/http://ozone.unep.org/Events/awards2005_profiles.shtml |archivedate=2015-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving briefly as President of the [[Egyptian Olympic Committee]] (1971–1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.egolympic.org.eg/ar/president_A.pdf |title=Egyptian Olympic Committee Presidents 1910 until now |publisher=[[Egyptian Olympic Committee]] |language=Arabic |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]], 2.86 MB |accessdate=2010-10-07 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolba led Egypt's delegation to the landmark [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|1972 Stockholm Conference]], which established the United Nations Environment Programme. Tolba became UNEP's Deputy Executive Director immediately after the conference, and two years later was promoted to Executive Director. During his long tenure (1975–1992), he played a central role in the fight against [[ozone depletion]], which culminated with the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer|Vienna Convention]] (1985) and the [[Montreal Protocol]] (1987).&lt;ref name="UNEP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mostafa Tolba: Green giant: A creator of the successful regime to reduce global emissions has died|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21695857-creator-successful-regime-reduce-global-emissions-has-died-green-giant|accessdate=2 April 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was a significant influence in the creation and organization of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolin|first1=Bert|title=A History of the Science and Politics of Climate Change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1706">A '''network address''' is an identifier for a [[Node (networking)|node]] or [[Host (networking)|host]] on a [[telecommunications network]]. Network addresses are designed to be [[unique identifier]]s across the network, although some networks allow for [[Link-local address|local]], [[Private network|private addresses]] or [[locally administered address]]es that may not be unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc527495(v=ws.10).aspx |title=Networking Basics: Network addressing |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special network addresses are allocated as [[Broadcast address|broadcast]] or [[multicast address]]es. These too are not unique.

In some cases, network hosts may have more than one network address; for example, each [[network interface]] may be uniquely identified. Further, because protocols are frequently [[Abstraction layer|layered]], more than one protocol's network address can occur in any particular network interface or node and more than one type of network address may be used in any one network.

==Examples== 
Examples of network addresses include:
* [[Telephone number]], in the [[public switched telephone network]]
* [[IP address]] in [[IP network]]s including the [[Internet]]
* [[IPX]] address, in [[NetWare]]
* [[X.25]] or [[X.21]] address, in a [[circuit switching|circuit switched]] data network 
* [[MAC address]], in [[Ethernet]] and other related network technologies

The {{Nihongo|'''Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University'''|沖縄科学技術大学院大学|Okinawa Kagaku Gijutsu Daigakuin Daigaku|'''OIST'''}} is an interdisciplinary graduate school located in [[Onna, Okinawa|Onna]], [[Okinawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. The school offers a 5-year [[PhD]] program in Science. Over half of the faculty and students are recruited from outside Japan, and all education and research is conducted entirely in English.

OIST relies on public subsidies paid by the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=D|last=Cyranoski |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7353/full/474541b.html |title=Made in Japan |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|pages=541–542|doi=10.1038/474541b|volume=474 |issue=7353 |date=29 June 2011|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government subsidy for OIST comes in two areas: a subsidy for operations and a subsidy for facilities.

==Graduate school==
The [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] program is taught entirely in English and is individually tailored to each student. Students are encouraged to focus their research on cross-disciplinary areas of studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Degree structure|url=https://admissions.oist.jp/degree-structure|publisher=oist.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
In June 2001 [[Kōji Omi]], former Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs and former Minister of State for Science and Technology Policy, announced plans to establish a new graduate university in Okinawa. A Board of Governors was appointed in 2004 and the following year, the [[National Diet|Diet]] recognized OIST as an "Independent Administrative Institution".&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=About — History|url=https://www.oist.jp/history|publisher=oist.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first batch of students were welcomed in September 2012 after receiving approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Normile|first1=Dennis|title=Japan's New Okinawa Institute Officially Becomes Graduate University|journal=Science|date=28 October 2011|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/10/japans-new-okinawa-institute-officially-becomes-graduate-university|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The research community consists of faculty and researchers divided into "units" based on area of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Research Overview|url=https://www.oist.jp/research-overview|publisher=oist.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has no departments—OIST researchers conduct multi-disciplinary research in Physics, Chemistry, Neuroscience,&lt;ref name=economist2&gt;{{cite news|title= Robocopulation|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21601230-using-robots-model-evolutionary-conundrum-robocopulation|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=19 May 2014|date=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine Science, Environmental and Ecological Sciences, Mathematical and Computational Sciences, and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news|title=Where rats and robots play|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21540228|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=15 December 2011|date=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''operation chart''' is a [[graphical]] and [[symbol]]ic representation of the [[manufacturing]] operations used to produce a product.&lt;ref&gt;Groover, M. P. (2007). ''Work Systems: The Methods, Measurement &amp; Management of Work'', Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|978-0-13-140650-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation chart illustrates only the [[value-adding]] activities in the [[manufacturing process]]; therefore, [[material handling]] and [[Warehouse|storage]] are not illustrated in this chart. operation chart records the overall picture of process and sequencewise steps of operations.

== Operations and their symbols in the operation chart ==
The operations described in the operation chart are:
#Processing and assembly operations: [[Process (engineering)|Processing]] operation such as changing in shape and properties. On the other hand, joining two or more parts is an [[Manufacturing|assembly]] operation. Furthermore, these two operations are represented by this symbols, circle (○) and (O) letter.
#Inspection operations: [[Inspection]] operations are represented by square symbol (□) and (I) as letter. It's done by an inspector checks the material, work part and assembly for quality and quantity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7926">In [[linguistics]], '''phraseology''' is the study of set or fixed expressions, such as [[idiom]]s, [[phrasal verb]]s, and other types of multi-word [[lexical unit]]s (often collectively referred to as ''[[phraseme]]s''), in which the component parts of the expression take on a meaning more specific than or otherwise not predictable from the sum of their meanings when used independently. For example, ‘[[Dutch auction]]’ is composed of the words ''Dutch'' ‘of or pertaining to the Netherlands’ and ''auction'' ‘a public sale in which goods are sold to the highest bidder’, but its meaning is not ‘a sale in the Netherlands where goods are sold to the highest bidder’. Instead, the phrase has a conventionalized meaning referring to any auction where, instead of rising, the prices fall.

== History of the development of phraseology ==
Phraseology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] φράσις ''phrasis'', "way of speaking" and -λογία ''-logia'', "study of") is a scholarly approach to language which developed in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Knappe, Gabriele. (2004) Idioms and Fixed Expressions in English Language Study before 1800. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; It took its start when [[Charles Bally]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Bally, Charles (1909 [1951]) Traité de stylistique française. Genève: Georg et Cie.&lt;/ref&gt; notion of ''locutions phraseologiques'' entered Russian [[lexicology]] and [[lexicography]] in the 1930s and 1940s and was subsequently developed in the former Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries. From the late 1960s on it established itself in (East) German linguistics but was also sporadically approached in English linguistics. The earliest English adaptations of phraseology are by Weinreich (1969)&lt;ref&gt;Weinreich, Uriel (1969)  Problems in the Analysis of Idioms. In J. Puhvel (ed.), Substance and Structure of Language, 23-81. Berkeley/Los Angeles: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; within the approach of [[transformational grammar]], Arnold (1973),&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, I.V. (1973) The English Word Moscow: Higher School Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt; and Lipka (1992 [1974]).&lt;ref&gt;Lipka, Leonhard. 1992. An Outline of English Lexicology. Tübingen: Max Niemeyer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; In Great Britain as well as other Western European countries, phraseology has steadily been developed over the last twenty years. The activities of the European Society of Phraseology (EUROPHRAS) and the European Association for Lexicography (EURALEX) with their regular conventions and publications attest to the prolific European interest in phraseology. European scholarship in phraseology is more active than in North America. Bibliographies of recent studies on English and general phraseology are included in Welte (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Welte, Werner. (1990) Englische Phraseologie und Idiomatik. Ein Arbeitsbuch mit umfassender Bibliographie. Frankfurt: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; and specially collected in Cowie &amp; Howarth (1996)&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, A. P. &amp; Peter Howarth.  (1996) Phraseology - a Select Bibliography. ''International Journal of Lexicography'' 9(1): 38–51&lt;/ref&gt; whose bibliography is reproduced and continued on the internet and provides a rich source of the most recent publications in the field.

==Phraseological units==
{{Main | Phraseme}}
The basic units of analysis in phraseology are often referred to as [[phraseme]]s or ''phraseological units''. Phraseological units are (according to Prof. Kunin A.V.){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} stable word-groups with partially or fully transferred meanings ("to kick the bucket",  “Greek gift”, “drink till all's blue”, “drunk as a fiddler (drunk as a lord, as a boiled owl)”, “as mad as a hatter (as a march hare)”). According to Rosemarie Gläser, a phraseological unit is a lexicalized, reproducible bilexemic or polylexemic word group in common use, which has relative syntactic and semantic stability, may be idiomatized, may carry [[connotations]], and may have an emphatic or intensifying function in a text.&lt;ref&gt;Gläser, Rosemarie. 1998. The Stylistic Potential of Phraselological Units in the Light of Genre Analysis In A.P. Cowie (ed.), Phraseology. Oxford: Clarendon Press, page 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exudates come in the form of chemicals released into the rhizosphere by cells in the roots and cell waste referred to as "rhizodeposition." This rhizodeposition comes in various forms of organic carbon and nitrogen that provide for the communities around plant roots and dramatically affect the chemistry surrounding the roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hinsinger|first=Philippe|last2=Gobran|first2=George R.|last3=Gregory|first3=Peter J.|last4=Wenzel|first4=Walter W.|date=November 2005|title=Rhizosphere geometry and heterogeneity arising from root-mediated physical and chemical processes|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=168|issue=2|pages=293–303|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01512.x|pmid=16219069|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exopolysaccharides, such as PGA, affect the ability of roots to uptake water by maintaining the stability of the rhizosphere and controlling the flow of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2000|title=Root- and microbial-derived mucilages affect soil structure and water transport|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2389.2000.00327.x|journal=European Journal of Soil Science|volume=51|issue=3|pages=435|last1=Czarnes|first1=S.|last2=Hallett|first2=P.

Although it goes beyond the rhizosphere area, it is notable that some plants secrete [[Allelopathy|allelochemicals]] from their roots which inhibit the growth of other organisms. For example, [[garlic mustard]] produces a chemical which is believed to prevent [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualisms]] forming between the surrounding [[tree]]s and mycorrhiza in [[Mesic habitat|mesic]] [[North America]]n [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|temperate forests]] where it is an [[invasive species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Campbell|last3=Powell|last4=Wolfe|last5=Callaway|last6=Thelen|last7=Hallett|last8=Prati|last9=Klironomos|year=2006|title=Invasive plant suppresses the growth of native tree seedlings by disrupting belowground mutualisms|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=4|issue=5|pages=e140|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040140|pmc=1440938|pmid=16623597|author=Stinson KA, Campbell SA, Powell JR, Wolfe BE, Callaway RM, Thelen GC, Hallett SG, Prati D, Klironomos JN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology of the rhizosphere ==
Rhizodeposition allows for the growth of communities of microorganisms directly surrounding and inside plant roots. This leads to complex interactions between species including mutualism, predation/parasitism, and competition.

=== Predation ===
Predation is considered to be top-down because these interactions decrease the population, but the closeness of the interactions of species directly effects the availability of resources causing the population to also be affected by bottom-up controls.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0846:TIBDPI]2.0.CO;2|year=2003|volume=84|issue=4|pages=846|title=Top-Down is Bottom-Up: Does Predation in the Rhizosphere Regulate Aboveground Dynamics?|journal=Ecology|last1=Moore|first1=John C.|last2=McCann|first2=Kevin|last3=Setälä|first3=Heikki|last4=De Ruiter|first4=Peter C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without soil fauna, microbes that directly prey upon competitors of plants and plant mutualists, interactions within the rhizosphere would be antagonistic toward the plants. Soil fauna provide the top-down component of the rhizosphere while also allowing for the bottom-up increase in nutrients from rhizodeposition and inorganic nitrogen. The complexity of these interactions have also been shown through experiments with common soil fauna, such as nematodes and protists. Predation by bacterial-feeding nematodes was shown to influence nitrogen availability and plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1942528|title=Interactions of Bacteria, Fungi, and their Nematode Grazers: Effects on Nutrient Cycling and Plant Growth|journal=Ecological Monographs|first1=Russell E.|last1=Ingham|first2=J. A.|last2=Trofymow|first3=Elaine R.|last3=Ingham|first4=David C.|last4=Coleman|date=1985|volume=55|issue=1|pages=119–140|doi=10.2307/1942528}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an increase in the populations of bacteria in which nematodes were added. Predation upon ''Pseduomonas'' by amoeba shows predators are able to upregulate toxins produced by prey without direct interaction using supernatant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Predator-Prey Chemical Warfare Determines the Expression of Biocontrol Genes by Rhizosphere-Associated Pseudomonas fluorescens|first1=Alexandre|last1=Jousset|first2=Laurène|last2=Rochat|first3=Stefan|last3=Scheu|first4=Michael|last4=Bonkowski|first5=Christoph|last5=Keel|date=August 2010|journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol.|volume=76|issue=15|pages=5263–5268|doi=10.1128/AEM.02941-09|pmid=20525866|pmc=2916451}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of predators to control the expression and production of biocontrol agents in prey without direct contact is related to the evolution of prey species to signals of high predator density and nutrient availability.

The [[food web]] in the rhizosphere can be considered as three different channels with two different sources of energy; the detritus-dependent channels are fungi and bacterial species and the root energy dependent channel consists of nematodes, symbiotic species, and some arthropods.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This food web is constantly in flux as the amount of detrius available and the rate of root sloughing changes as roots grow and age. This bacterial channel is considered to be a faster channel because of the ability of species to focus on more accessible resources in the rhizosphere and have faster regeneration times compared with the fungal channel. All three of these channels are also interrelated to the roots that form the base of the rhizosphere ecosystem and the predators, such as the nematodes and protists, that prey upon many of the same species of mircroflora.

=== Competition ===
[[Allelopathy]] and [[autotoxicity]] and negative root-root communications&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|title=How plants communicate using the underground information superhighway|first1=Harsh Pal|last1=Bais|first2=Sang-Wook|last2=Park|first3=Tiffany L|last3=Weir|first4=Ragan M|last4=Callaway|first5=Jorge M|last5=Vivanco|date=2004|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=9|issue=1|pages=26–32|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2003.11.008|pmid=14729216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The competition between plants due to released exudates is dependent geometrical properties, which determine the capacity of interception of exudates from any point in relation to the plants’ roots, and physicochemical properties, which determine the capacity of each root to take up exudates in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raynaud|first=Xavier|last2=Jaillard|first2=Benoît|last3=Leadley|first3=Paul W.|date=2008|title=Plants May Alter Competition by Modifying Nutrient Bioavailability in Rhizosphere: A Modeling Approach|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=171|issue=1|pages=44–58|doi=10.1086/523951|pmid=18171150|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geometrical properties are the density of roots, root diameter, and distribution of the roots and physicochemical properties are exudation rate, decay rate of exudates, and the properties of the environment that affect diffusion. These properties define the rhizosphere of roots and the likelihood that plants can directly compete with neighbors.

Plants and soil microflora indirectly compete against one another by tying up limiting resources, such as carbon and nitrogen, into their biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01001-X|title=Competition for nitrogen between plants and soil microorganisms|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=12|issue=4|pages=139|year=1997|last1=Kaye|first1=Jason P.|last2=Hart|first2=Stephen C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This competition can occur at varying rates due to the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in detritus and the ongoing mineralization of nitrogen in the soil. Mycorrhizae and heterotrophic soil microorganisms compete for both carbon and nitrogen depending upon which is limiting at the time, which itself heavily depends on the species, scavenging abilities, and the environmental conditions affecting nitrogen input. Plants are less successful at uptake of organic nitrogen, such as amino acids, than the soil microflora that exist in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owen|first=A.G|last2=Jones|first2=D.L|title=Competition for amino acids between wheat roots and rhizosphere microorganisms and the role of amino acids in plant N acquisition|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|language=en|volume=33|issue=4–5|pages=651–657|doi=10.1016/s0038-0717(00)00209-1|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This informs other mutualistic relationships formed by plants with relation to nitrogen uptake.

Competition over other resources, such as oxygen in limited environments, are directly affected by the spatial and temporal locations of species and the rhizosphere. In methanotrophs, proximity to higher density roots and the surface are important and help to determine where they are dominant over heterotrophs in rice paddies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Methane Oxidation and the Competition for Oxygen in the Rice Rhizosphere|first1=Peter van|last1=Bodegom|first2=Fons|last2=Stams|first3=Liesbeth|last3=Mollema|first4=Sara|last4=Boeke|first5=Peter|last5=Leffelaar|date=August 2001|journal=Appl.

The weak connection between the various channels of energy is important in regulation in the populations of both predator and prey and the availability of resources to the biome. Strong connections between resource-consumer and consumer-consumer create coupled systems of oscillators which are then determined by the nature of the available resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Weak trophic interactions and the balance of nature|first1=Kevin|last1=McCann|first2=Alan|last2=Hastings|first3=Gary R.|last3=Huxel|date=22 October 1998|journal=Nature|volume=395|issue=6704|pages=794–798|doi=10.1038/27427}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems can then be considered cyclical, quasi-periodic, or chaotic.

=== Mutualism ===
Plants [[Secretion|secrete]] many compounds through their roots to serve symbiotic functions in the rhizosphere. [[Strigolactone]]s, secreted and detected by [[mycorrhiza]]l fungi, stimulate the [[germination]] of spores and initiate changes in the mycorrhiza that allow it to colonize the root. The parasitic plant, ''[[Striga (plant)|Striga]]'' also detects the presence of strigolactones and will germinate when it detects them; they will then move into the root, feeding off the nutrients present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnaud Besserer, Virginie Puech-Pagès, Patrick Kiefer, Victoria Gomez-Roldan, Alain Jauneau, Sébastien Roy, Jean-Charles Portais, Christophe Roux, Guillaume Bécard, Nathalie Séjalon-Delmas|first=|year=2006|title=Strigolactones Stimulate Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi by Activating Mitochondria|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=4|issue=7|pages=e226|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040226|pmid=16787107|pmc=1481526}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreas Brachmann, Martin Parniske|first=|year=2006|title=The Most Widespread Symbiosis on Earth|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=4|issue=7|pages=e239|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040239|pmid=16822096|pmc=1489982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbiotic [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] bacteria, such as ''[[Rhizobium]]'' species, detect compounds like [[flavonoids]] secreted by the roots of leguminous plants and then produce [[nod factor]]s which signal to the plant that they are present and will lead to the formation of [[root nodule]]s. In these nodules bacteria, sustained by nutrients from the plant, convert nitrogen gas to a form that can be used by the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1120260109|pmid=22493242|pages=6751–6756|title=Plant-activated bacterial receptor adenylate cyclases modulate epidermal infection in the Sinorhizobium meliloti-Medicago symbiosis|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=109|issue=17|year=2012|last1=Tian|first1=C. F.|last2=Garnerone|first2=A.-M.|last3=Mathieu-Demaziere|first3=C.|last4=Masson-Boivin|first4=C.|last5=Batut|first5=J.|pmc=3340038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-symbiotic (or "free-living") nitrogen-fixing bacteria may reside in the rhizosphere just outside the roots of certain plants (including many grasses), and similarly "fix" nitrogen gas in the nutrient-rich plant rhizosphere. Even though these organisms are thought to be only loosely associated with plants they inhabit, they may respond very strongly to the status of the plants. For example, nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the rhizosphere of the [[rice plant]] exhibit [[Diurnality|diurnal]] cycles that mimic plant behavior, and tend to supply more fixed nitrogen during growth stages when the plant exhibits a high demand for nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sims GK, Dunigan EP|year=1984|title=Diurnal and seasonal variations in nitrogenase activity (C2H2 reduction) of rice roots|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|volume=16|issue=1|pages=15–18|doi=10.1016/0038-0717(84)90118-4|last2=Dunigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In exchange for the resources and shelter that plants and roots provide, fungi and bacteria control pathogenic microbes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The fungi that perform such activities also serve close relationships with species of plants in the form of mycorrhizal fungi, which are diverse in how they relate to plants. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and the bacteria that make the rhizosphere their home also form close relationships in order to be more competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1996|title=Cellular interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizosphere bacteria|journal=Protoplasm|volume=193|pages=123-131|doi=10.1007/BF01276640|last1=Bianciotto|first1=V.|last2=Minerdi|first2=D.|last3=Perotto|first3=S.|last4=Bonfante|first4=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which plays into the bigger cycles of nutrients that impact the ecosystem, such as biogeochemical pathways.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Community structure ===
Bais et al. (2004) call the rhizosphere an information super highway because of the proximity of data points, which include roots and other organisms in the soil, and the methods for transferring data using exudates and communities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This description has been used to explain the complex interactions that plants, their fungal mutualists, and the bacterial species that live in the rhizosphere have entered into over the course of their evolution. Certain species like ''[[Trichoderma]]'' are interesting because of their ability to select for species in this complex web. ''Trichoderma'' is a [[Biological Control Agent|biological control agent]] because of evidence that it can reduce plant pathogens in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mechanisms Employed by Trichoderma Species in the Biological Control of Plant Diseases: The History and Evolution of Current Concepts|journal=Plant Disease|volume=87|pages=4-10|last=Howell|first=C. R.|doi=10.1094/PDIS.2003.87.1.4|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants themselves also impact which bacterial species are in the rhizosphere which are selected against because of the introduction of exudates and the relationships that it maintains.

==Regulation==
===United States===
[[File:Hyperion plant.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Hyperion sewage treatment plant|Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant]] in Los Angeles, California is one of the largest municipal plants in the United States.]]
[[Sewage treatment]] systems in the United States are subject to the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) and are regulated by federal and [[U.S. state|state]] environmental agencies. In most states, local sewage plants receive discharge permits from state agencies; in the remaining states and [[Insular area#Inhabited 2|territories]], permits are issued by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information#tab-2 |title=NPDES State Program Information |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-02-06 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment plants, known as [[publicly owned treatment works]] (POTW) in CWA parlance, must protect the health and welfare of the local population by ensuring that wastewater does not contaminate the local potable water supply, nor violate additional [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|water quality standards]] that protect the ecological health of the water body. 

The basic national standard for U.S. municipal treatment plants is the '''Secondary Treatment Regulation'''.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1989). "Secondary Treatment Regulation." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most plants in the U.S. must meet this [[secondary treatment]] standard. The permit authority (state agency or EPA) can compel a POTW to meet a higher standard, if there are applicable water quality standards for the receiving water body. For water bodies with stringent standards, such as [[Lake Tahoe]], POTWs must treat their discharges to [[Sewage treatment#Tertiary treatment|tertiary treatment]] levels, and then pump all treated water out of the drainage basin so that no effluent ever drains to a certain body of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-limits |title=NPDES Permit Limits |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-11-29 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such higher standards may require the POTW to construct improvements to its plant(s). If not in compliance with its permit and regulations, POTWs may be subject to heavy fines. Regulation is therefore often the driving force behind increasing sewage treatment costs in the United States, and is directly linked to the high cost of constructing or expanding a sewage treatment facility.

Many large cities in the U.S. operate [[combined sewer]]s, which collect sewage and [[stormwater]] runoff in a single pipe system leading to the treatment plant. Combined sewers can cause serious water pollution problems due to combined sewer overflows, which are caused by large variations in flow between dry and wet weather. These overflows can lead to violation of the Secondary Treatment Regulation and/or water quality standards. Discharge permits for these POTWs typically have additional requirements that require facility improvements to reduce or eliminate the overflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/combined-sewer-overflows-csos |title=Combined Sewer Overflows |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-16 |website=NPDES |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
In England and Wales, [[Ofwat]] regulates charges and service standards. In [[England]] environmental standards and their achievement for sewage disposal are regulated by the [[Environment Agency]]. In [[Wales]] environmental regulation is undertaken by [[Natural Resources Wales]]. In [[Scotland]] the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] fulfils the environmental regulation role and the [[Water Industry Commission for Scotland]] undertakes the economic regulatory role.

==Administration==
===United States===
Sewer systems are usually administered on the local level, usually citywide, and usually by the city itself. These systems, which may operate independently or as a subdivision of a city or other municipal agency, are typically operated as ''Enterprises'', meaning that they produce enough revenues to fund their own activities.

Revenues are usually generated through two charges to customers: ''connection fees'' and ''use charges''. Connection fees are charged once to new customers as they connect to the sanitary sewer collection system, and are usually designed to recover [[capital investments]] made by the enterprise to serve its customers. Use charges are periodic charges for ongoing use of the system, and are designed to recover [[operations and maintenance]] expenses. Both connection fees and use charges are typically proportionate to the amount and strength of wastewater expected to be generated by each customer. Therefore, a single family residence would pay much smaller fees and charges than a food processing plant.

Some POTWs are eligible for low-interest loans to finance system improvements, from the [[Clean Water State Revolving Fund]]. This program is administered by EPA and state agencies, using a combination of federal and state funds.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2012). [http://water.epa.gov/grants_funding/cwsrf/cwsrf_index.cfm "Clean Water State Revolving Fund."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In [[England]] sewerage and sewage disposal is undertaken by relatively few large private companies, including several multi-national companies. In [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] a "not for profit" company is the responsible body, however in Wales almost all the operational work is sub-[[subcontractor|contract]]ed by others. Charges to domestic users are based either on the metered volume of incoming water or on the notional value of the property ([[Rates (tax)|rateable]] basis).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9292">A '''shtick''' ({{lang-yi|'''שטיק'''}}, the closely related German word ''Stück'' sounds similar, yet it is not used in the same way as the English "thing") is a comic theme or [[gimmick]] derived from the [[Yiddish]] word ''shtik'' (שטיק), meaning "piece" (in stand-up comedy a near equivalent term is a "bit"). The English word for "piece" or "thing" is sometimes used in a similar context. Another variant is "bits of business" or just "bits". ''Shtick'' may refer to an adopted persona, usually for comedy performances, that is maintained consistently (though not necessarily exclusively) across the performer's career. In this usage, the recurring personalities adopted by Laurel and Hardy through all of their many comedy films (although they often played characters with different names and occupations) would qualify as their shtick. A comedian might maintain several different shticks of this sort, particularly if appearing in a variety show encouraging development of multiple characters, such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. 

In common usage, the word ''shtick'' has also come to mean any talent, style, habit, or other eccentricity for which a person is particularly well-known, even if not intended for comedic purposes. For example, a person who is known locally for an ability to eat dozens of hot dogs quickly might say that it was his shtick. Among [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], "shtick" can also refer to [[Jewish wedding#Special dances|wedding shtick]], in which wedding guests entertain the bride and groom through dancing, costumes, juggling, and silliness.

Because of its roots in show business, ''shtick'' has taken on connotation of a contrived and often used act. For this reason, journalists and commentators often apply the word disparagingly to stock replies from politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, Michael D. ''[http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/07/the_white_stripes_and_their_on.html  The White Stripes and Their One-Note Shtick]'', ''[http://nymag.com/  New York Magazine]'', July 18, 2007. Retrieved January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
*[[Jack Benny]]'s character on his radio program was notoriously both stingy and a bad violin player, as well as being perpetually 39 years old.  In real life, Benny was known as a competent [[violin]]ist and lavish tipper, and kept celebrating his 39th birthday each year publicly because "there's nothing funny about 40".
*Three of the [[Marx Brothers]], [[Groucho Marx|Groucho]], [[Chico Marx|Chico]] and [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]], had well-honed shticks by the time they started making movies.
**Groucho, with his stooped walk, greasepaint moustache, [[lascivious]] eyebrow raising, and his cigar;
**Chico, with his fake [[Italian language|Italian]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], his "shooting the keys" style of piano playing, and borderline moronic behavior; and
**Harpo, with his [[Mime artist|pantomime]] routines, the [[Magic satchel#In films|seemingly bottomless pockets]] of his [[trench coat]], and his ability to play the [[harp]].
** The fourth performing brother, [[Zeppo Marx|Zeppo]], never developed a shtick and was a straight man in their movies — though some have argued that blandness and "normality" was indeed his shtick.
*[[W.C. Fields]] nurtured a character that was not far from himself in real life, being misanthropic, misogynistic, and a hard drinker, as well as the unique bellow of his voice and his famous bulbous nose.
*Many of the performers over the course of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s long broadcast history have developed shticks that were popular enough to be developed into feature films. The earliest of these was ''[[The Blues Brothers]]'', the dark-suited alter egos of [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]], which spawned two movies and several actual blues albums. Of the movies that followed in later years, some met with similar success (such as [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]' ''[[Wayne's World]]''), while others are regarded as critical and commercial disasters ([[Julia Sweeney]]'s ''[[It's Pat]]''!).
*[[Henny Youngman]]'s standard line "Take my wife&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; please!" was part of his schtick. It consisted of several [[One-liner joke|one-liners]] delivered in rapid-fire sequence.
*[[Johnny Carson]]'s many shticks include his role as "[[Carnac the Magnificent]]", an [[India]]n [[fortune teller]] who could divine answers to questions sealed in envelopes and "kept in a [[Hermetic seal|hermetically sealed]] [[mayonnaise]] jar on the front porch of [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]] since noon today". His signature imaginary golf swing at the end of his [[monologue]] would also qualify.
*[[Chris Berman]]'s shtick in his [[ESPN]] commentary was his tendency to give additional [[nickname]]s to players based on their last names (often intended as [[pun]]s or [[popular culture|pop culture]] references). Berman was also known to often say a football player "could&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; go&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; all&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; way" on long [[touchdown]] plays (parodying [[Howard Cosell]]'s delivery).
*Comedian [[George Carlin]] created a famously banned shtick, "[[Filthy Words]]", a/k/a "Seven dirty words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/filthywords.html |title=George Carlin, Filthy Words |website=Exploring Constitutional Conflicts |quote=The following is a verbatim transcript of "Filthy Words" (the George Carlin monologue at issue in the Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation) prepared by the Federal Communications Commission... |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Andrew Dice Clay]]'s shtick in his comedy routines is his crude, [[misogynist]] themed humor, and sometimes vulgar reinterpretations of [[nursery rhymes]].
*[[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s shtick was centered around his famous [[catchphrase]], "I don't get no respect," accompanied by his characteristic facial gesture and yanking or straightening his scarlet necktie.
*[[Stephen Colbert]] has referred to [[Stephen Colbert (character)|his character]] as a shtick.
*[[Andy Kaufman]] was a particularly rigorous practitioner of shtick. Kaufman almost never appeared in public, other than as one of his shtick characters, such as "Foreign Man" or [[Tony Clifton]]. When he did appear as himself, he still acted out some shtick routine, with one notable example being a long-running [[professional wrestling]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#F|feud]] with [[Jerry Lawler]].
*[[The Rubberbandits]] are Irish comedians who wear plastic bags over their faces as shtick.
*[[Yakov Smirnoff]]'s shtick, at the height of his career, involved comparisons between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], punctuated by the catchprase "What a country!".
*[[Lewis Black]]'s shtick is the crescendo of rage upon which his routines are built; another is bewailing the rise in his blood pressure due to the presumed strain of these outbursts.
*[[Sam Kinison]]'s shtick was his increasingly emotional, high-stress vocal delivery, often leading to actual shouting or screaming, to the point where his voice became hoarse.
*[[Bob Newhart]]'s shtick is his long phone calls with imaginary or historical persons. Hearing only Newhart's [[deadpan]] comments, the audience is left to infer what the other person is saying.&lt;ref name=NewhartNYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Zinoman |first=Jason |title=No Real Hurry to Tell the Joke: Bob Newhart, Master of the One-Sided Conversation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/arts/television/bob-newhart-master-of-the-one-sided-conversation.html |website=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=30 October 2014 |date=May 26, 2014 |quote=Mr. Newhart became famous through stand-up routines that were one-sided telephone conversations in which his comic partner was neither seen nor heard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*All original members of [[The Wiggles]] were known for having schticks. [[Jeff Fatt]]'s was [[narcolepsy|falling asleep at odd times]], leading the other Wiggles and the audience to call out the [[catchphrase]] "[[Wake up Jeff|Wake Up Jeff!]]", [[Anthony Field]]'s was eating too much food, [[Greg Page (musician)|Greg Page]]'s was doing [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] tricks, and [[Murray Cook]]'s was an obsession with playing the [[guitar]].
*[[Penn and Teller]]'s shtick focuses mainly on which part of the duo does the talking; Penn provides the only on-stage narration and is the only public voice of the act, whereas Teller never speaks on stage or on camera. In on-camera interviews, Teller remains in shadow, and in rare circumstances when Teller speaks on-stage, his face is obscured.
*[[Gilbert Gottfried]]'s stage persona, with his perpetually high-pitched squeaky voice and pinched face, is a shtick that has been maintained through almost all of his public appearances and television and film roles.
*[[Larry the Cable Guy]]'s stage persona, developed during his days as a member of a morning radio zoo crew, is considered a shtick. Despite his public appearances as a hillbilly with a deep Southern accent, propensity for wearing sleeveless flannel shirts and his signature "Git-R-Done!" catchphrase, the comedian, whose real name is Daniel Whitney, is a native of Nebraska.

'''Social metabolism''' or '''socioeconomic metabolism''' is the set of [[Stock and flow|flow]]s of [[material]]s and [[energy]] that occur between [[Nature]] and [[society]], between different societies, and within societies. These human-controlled material and energy flows are a basic feature of all societies but their magnitude and diversity largely depend on specific [[culture|cultures]], or sociometabolic regimes.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Manuel |first1= |last2= Toledo |first2= Víctor M. |year= 2014|title= The Social Metabolism: A Socio-Ecological Theory of Historical Change|url= https://books.google.es/books/about/The_Social_Metabolism.html?id=JwzvAwAAQBAJ| publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3-319-06357-7 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"&gt;{{es}}[http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/rz/v34n136/v34n136a4.pdf El metabolismo social: una nueva teoría socioecológica.] Relaciones. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Social or socioeconomic metabolism is also described as "the self-reproduction and evolution of the biophysical structures of human society. It comprises those biophysical transformation processes, distribution processes, and flows, which are controlled by humans for their purposes. The biophysical structures of society (‘in use stocks’) and socioeconomic metabolism together form the biophysical basis of society."
&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social metabolic processes begin with the [[human]] ''appropriation'' of materials and energy from nature. These can be ''transformed'' and ''circulated'' to be ''consumed'' and ''excreted'' finally back to Nature itself. Each of these processes has a different [[environmental impact]] depending on how it is performed, the amount of materials and energy involved in the process, the area where it occurs, the time available or the Nature's regenerative capacity.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"/&gt;

Social metabolism represents an extension of the metabolism concept from human bodies to the biophysical basis of society. Humans build and operate mines and farms, oil refineries and power stations, factories and infrastructure to supply the energy and material flows needed for the physical reproduction of a specific culture. In-use stocks, which comprise buildings, vehicles, appliances, infrastructure, etc., are built up and maintained by the different industrial processes that are part of social metabolism. These stocks then provide service to people in form of shelter, transportation, or communication.

Society and its metabolism together form an [[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]] system, a complex system that reproduces itself. Neither culture nor social metabolism can reproduce themselves in isolation. Humans need food and shelter, which is delivered by social metabolism, and the latter needs humans to operate it.

Studies of social metabolism can be carried out at different levels of system aggregation, see [[material flow analysis]]. In material flow accounting, for example, the [[Factor of production|inputs]] and [[Output (economics)|outputs]] of materials and energy of a particular [[State (polity)|state]] or region, as well as [[import]]s and [[export]]s, are analysed. Such studies are facilitated by the ease of access to information about [[commercial transaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year= 2000|title= The Weight of Nations: Material Outflows from Industrial Economies |url= http://pdf.wri.org/weight_of_nations.pdf |publisher= World Resources Institute |isbn=978-1-56973-439-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Carpintero Redondo |first= Óscar |year= 2005|title= El metabolismo de la economía española: recursos naturales y huella ecológica (1955-2000) |url= http://www.fcmanrique.org/recursos/publicacion/elmetabolismo.pdf|language= Spanish|publisher= Fundación César Manrique |isbn=978-84-88550-60-6 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Social or socioeconomic metabolism stipulates that human society and its interaction with Nature form a complex  self-reproducing system, and it can therefore be seen as [[paradigm]] for studying the biophysical basis of human societies under the aspect of self-reproduction. "A common paradigm can facilitate model combination and integration, which can lead to more robust and comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments of sustainable development strategies. ... The use of social or socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm can help to justify alternative economic concepts."&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Société Chimique de France''' ('''SCF''') is a [[learned society]] and [[professional association]] founded in 1857 to represent the interests of French chemists in a variety of ways in local, national and international contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Société Chimique de France (SCF), [http://www.societechimiquedefrance.fr/fr/missions-de-la-scf.html   Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409094637/http://www.societechimiquedefrance.fr/fr/missions-de-la-scf.html |date=2010-04-09 }}; retrieved 2011-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;  Until 2009 the organization was known as the '''Société Française de Chimie'''.

==History==
The Society traces its origins back to an organization of young Parisian chemists who began meeting in May 1857 under the name Société Chimique, with the goal of self-study and mutual education.  In 1858 the established chemist [[Adolphe Wurtz]] joined the society, and immediately transformed it into a [[learned society]] modeled after the [[Chemical Society]] of London, which was the precursor of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. Like its British counterpart, the French association sought to foster the communication of new ideas and facts throughout France and across international borders.&lt;ref name="Lagowski1991"&gt;Lagowski, J. J. (1991). [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ed068p1  "A British Sesquicentennial,"] ''Journal of Chemical Education,'' Vol 68, No. 1, p. 1; acknowledging the sesquicentennial of The Chemical Society in London, which eventually became the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]; retrieved 2011-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Support for the ''[[Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France|Bulletin de la Société Chimique de Paris]]'' began in 1858.   

In the 21st century, the society has become a member of [[ChemPubSoc Europ]]e, which is an organization of 16 European chemical societies.  This European consortium was established in the late 1990s as many chemical journals owned by national chemical societies were amalgamated.&lt;ref&gt;ChemPubSoc Europe, [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu.html mission]; [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu_members.html  participating societies]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 they started [[ChemistryViews]].org, their news and information service for chemists and other scientists worldwide.

===Prizes and awards===
The society acknowledges individual achievement with prizes and awards, including:
* Louis Ancel Prize
* Raymond Berr Prize

[[File:The Hand of Guido.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Guidonian hand]]]]

'''Solmization''' is a system of attributing a distinct [[syllable]] to each note in a [[musical scale]]. Various forms of solmization are in use and have been used throughout the world, but '''[[solfège]]''' is the most common convention in Europe and North America. 

==Overview==
The seven syllables normally used for this practice in English-speaking countries are: '''do''', '''re''', '''mi''', '''fa''', '''sol''', '''la''', and '''ti''' (with sharpened notes of '''di''', '''ri''', '''fi''', '''si''', '''li''' and flattened notes of '''te''', '''le''', '''se''', '''me''', '''ra''').

[[Guido of Arezzo]] is widely considered to be the origin of the European tradition of solmization. In Guido's ''Micrologus'' (1026), the ut–re–mi–fa–so–la syllables are derived from the initial syllables of each of the first six half-lines of the first stanza of the [[hymn]] ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', whose text is attributed to the Italian monk and scholar [[Paul the Deacon|Paulus Diaconus]].&lt;ref name="groveearlymiddle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palisca|first1=Claude V.|title=Theory, theorists §5 Early Middle Ages|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/44944|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford Music Online|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2016}} [[Giovanni Battista Doni]] is known for having changed the name of note "Ut" (C), renaming it "Do" (in the "Do Re Mi ..." sequence known as [[solfège]]).&lt;ref name="McNaught"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative explanation, first proposed by [[Francisci a Mesgnien Meninski|Franciszek Meninski]] in ''Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalum'' (1680) and later by [[Jean-Benjamin de La Borde|J.-B. Laborde]] in ''Essai sur la Musique Ancienne et Moderne'' (1780), is that the syllables were derived from the Arabic solmization system درر مفصّلات ''Durar Mufaṣṣalāt'' ("Separated Pearls") (''dāl, rā', mīm, fā', ṣād, lām, tā''') [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|during the Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;Farmer (1988), p.72–82. {{Full|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no documentary evidence for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Guido d'Arezzo: Medieval Musician and Educator|first=Samuel D.|last=Miller|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|volume=21|issue=3|date=Autumn 1973|pages=239–45|doi=10.2307/3345093|publisher=MENC_ The National Association for Music Education|jstor=3345093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the origin of solmization was to be found in [[Vedic texts]] like the [[Upanishads]], which discuss a musical system of seven notes, realized ultimately in what is known as [[sargam (music)|sargam]]. In [[Indian classical music]], the notes in order are: '''sa''', '''re''', '''ga''', '''ma''', '''pa''', '''dha''', and '''ni''', which correspond to the Western solfege system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Robert|editor1-last=Tenzer|editor1-first=Michael|title=Analytical Studies in World Music|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=309|chapter=Architectonic Composition in South Indian Classical Music: The "Navaragamalika Varnam"|quote=The svara sections are sung in sargam (Indian solfege), using the Indian note names, sa, ri, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni (which correspond to the Western do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Byzantine music]] uses syllables derived from the [[Greek alphabet]] to name notes: starting with C, the notes are '''ni''' (eta), '''pa''' (alpha), '''vu''' (beta), '''ga''' (gamma), '''di''' (delta), '''ke''' (epsilon), '''zo''' (zeta).

In [[Han people]]'s music in China, the words used to name notes are (from fa to mi): 上 (siong or shang4), 尺 ('''cei''' or '''chi3'''), 工 ('''gong'''), 凡 ('''huan''' or '''fan2'''), 六 ('''liuo''' or '''liu4'''), 五 ('''ngou''' or '''wu3'''), 乙 ('''yik''' or '''yi3'''). The system is used for teaching sight-singing.

In [[music of Japan|Japanese music]], the first line of ''[[Iroha]]'', an ancient poem used as an "ABC" of traditional [[kana]], is used for solmization. The syllables representing the notes A, B, C, D, E, F, G are '''i''', '''ro''', '''ha''', '''ni''', '''ho''', '''he''', '''to''' respectively. [[Shakuhachi musical notation]] uses another solmization system beginning "Fu Ho U".

In [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[Karawitan|Javanese]] musicians derive syllables from [[kepatihan notation|numbers]]; '''ji'''-'''ro'''-'''lu'''-['''pi''']-'''ma'''-'''nem''' (''siji, loro, telu'', [''papat'', normally skipped in [[pentatonic]] scales], ''lima, enem'').

In Scotland, [[Canntaireachd]] was used as a means of communicating [[bagpipes|bagpipe]] music verbally.

In [[software engineering]], '''syntactic methods''' are techniques for developing correct software [[Computer program|programs]].  The techniques attempt to detect, and thus prevent, certain kinds of defects ([[computer bug|bugs]]) by examining the structure of the code being produced at its [[syntactic]] rather than [[semantic]] level.

==Usage==

Syntactic methods are often used when [[formal methods]] are not an option, and are often a simpler and, more importantly, cheaper alternative. In non-[[mission-critical]] systems, [[formal methods]] may prove to be too expensive for the benefit they provide. The costs of modelling, personnel, execution and development may often outweigh the benefits gained by preventing possible failures. This approach revolves around the use of an ''abstract [[dependency graph]]'' which is created from the system in question. An abstract dependency graph is a [[directed graph]], a graph of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] connected by one-way edges. Most often, the vertices and edges of the graph represent the inputs and outputs of functions in or components of the system. By inspecting the created abstract dependency graph, the developer can detect ''syntactic anomalies'' (or ''Preece anomalies'') in the system. While anomalies are not always defects, they often provide clues to finding defects in a system. Therefore, the anomalies in a system help point the developer in the right direction in finding defects.

==Anomalies==

There are four main types of anomaly:

* ''Redundancies'' &amp;ndash; A chunk of the graph is redundant if its terminals can be reached if the chunk is removed from the graph
* ''Conflicts'' &amp;ndash; A system contains conflicts if the same inputs can imply different outputs
* ''Circularities'' &amp;ndash; A loop in the graph indicates a circularity in the system
* ''Deficiencies'' &amp;ndash; A chunk is deficient if a subset of inputs leads to no terminals

While anomalies often point to defects, they can just as easily reflect normal intended functionality in the system. It is up to the developer to look into anomalies in order to determine whether they are clues to problems or simply false alarms.

By creating a visual [[directed graph]] of a system, there are several obvious visual flags that indicate the above anomalies:

* a sub-graph with no input is probably missing something important;
* while looking at the transitive closure of a system (all nodes downstream from a node), a node in its own transitive closure indicates a circularity;
* while looking at the transitive closure of a system, subsumption between pairs of rows indicates redundancy;
* conflicts are somewhat more difficult as they become more semantic than syntactic.

When formal methods prove too costly, a system can be checked solely on its [[syntax]]. This is not as thorough, as it only looks at a system on a surface level. However, it does give a developer many clues as to where a system's defects may lie.

'''Terrestrial reconnaissance''', or ''ground'' recon, is a type of [[reconnaissance]] that is employed along the elements of [[ground warfare]].  It is the [[intelligence collection management|collection of intelligence]] that strictly involves routes, areas, zones (terrain-oriented); and the enemy (force-oriented).  Ground reconnaissance is considered to be the most effective type of reconnaissance but also the slowest method in obtaining information about the terrain and enemy.

Those units in contact with the enemy, especially patrols, are among the most reliable sources of information.  [[Combat engineers]] are also good sources of information.  These engineer units conduct [[engineer reconnaissance]] of an area and can provide detailed reporting on [[Line of communication|lines of communications]]; i.e., roads, rivers, railroad lines, bridges, and obstacles to maneuver.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4369">'''Universal Accounting Center (UA)''' is a [[Privately owned enterprise|privately owned]] training organization located in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].  Founded in 1979, they offer self-paced [[Home study course|home-study courses]] in [[accounting]], [[bookkeeping]], [[tax preparation]], [[QuickBooks]] and [[marketing]] that specializes in [[small business]].

==History==
Universal Accounting was established in 1979.  The training center was founded as Universal Training Systems by Alf Bostrom with the purpose to teach students full-charge bookkeeping and accounting.  It first functioned under the parent company Metropolitan Business Bureau (MBB) which Alf began as a [[Financial consultant|financial consulting]] firm in 1960.  Through his experience with MBB, Alf established the [[business model]] upon which Universal Accounting would be built. Until quite recently, Universal Accounting was run by Alf’s son, [[Allen Bostrom]].

Universal Training Systems initially followed a [[classroom]]-based learning model, and the first Universal classroom was opened in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Shortly thereafter, several school locations in [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] were opened and franchised.

In 1992, Alf’s sons, Allen and Ken Bostrom, joined his staff, and in 1994, Alf retired, and Allen Bostrom became president and [[CEO]] of the newly named Universal Accounting Center. The school has evolved from offering local live courses to developing and selling home-based study materials for bookkeeping, accounting, tax preparation, QuickBooks and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upgrade.slco.org/upAndComing/UaC008.html] Upgrade.com "Teaching Basics Propels Company to Inc. 500 List."&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1st, 2014, Roger Knecht became UAC's new president and CEO; Allen Bostrom remains as the chair of Universal's Board of Directors.

==Accreditation==
Universal Accounting has been approved by the California Tax Education Council (CTEC) to offer the Professional Tax Preparer Certification (PTP) as a [[distance learning]] course in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enewschannels.com/2006/11/09/enc381_012629.php] Berg, Tabitha (2006-11-09).“Universal Accounting Center Tax Education Approved by California.” eNewsChannels.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Continuing professional development|Continuing Professional Education]] (CPE) credits are awarded for each of Universal’s training programs.

[[file:KKP Auslauf.jpg|thumb|Cooling tower and water discharge of a nuclear power plant]]

'''Water cooling''' is a method of [[heat]] removal from components and industrial equipment. [[Water]] may be a more efficient heat transfer fluid where [[air cooling]] is ineffective. In most occupied climates water offers the [[thermal conductivity]] advantages of a liquid with unusually high [[specific heat capacity]] and the option of evaporative cooling. Low cost often allows rejection as waste after a single use, but recycling coolant loops may be pressurized to eliminate evaporative loss and offer greater portability and improved cleanliness. Unpressurized recycling coolant loops using evaporative cooling require a blowdown waste stream to remove impurities concentrated by evaporation. Disadvantages of water cooling systems include accelerated [[corrosion]] and maintenance requirements to prevent heat transfer reductions from [[biofouling]] or [[Limescale|scale]] formation. Chemical additives to reduce these disadvantages may introduce toxicity to wastewater. Water cooling is commonly used for cooling [[automobile]] [[internal combustion engine]]s and large industrial facilities such as [[nuclear power plant|nuclear]] and [[steam electric power plant]]s, [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[electrical generator|generators]], [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]] and [[chemical plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

The main mechanism for water cooling is [[convective heat transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.che.ufl.edu/unit-ops-lab/experiments/CT/2+CT-Theory.pdf|title=Chemical Engineering at the University of Florida|author=|date=|website=www.che.ufl.edu|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
Water is inexpensive, [[non-toxic]], and available over most of the earth's surface. Liquid cooling offers higher thermal conductivity than air cooling. Water has unusually high specific heat capacity among commonly available liquids at room temperature and atmospheric pressure allowing efficient heat transfer over distance with low rates of mass transfer. Cooling water may be recycled through a ''recirculating'' system or used in a single pass ''once-through cooling'' (OTC) system. Water's high [[enthalpy of vaporization]] allows the option of efficient evaporative cooling to remove waste heat in [[cooling tower]]s or [[cooling pond]]s.{{sfnp|Kemmer|1979|pages=1-1, 1-2}} Recirculating systems may be ''open'' if they rely upon evaporative cooling or ''closed'' if heat removal is accomplished in [[heat exchanger]]s with negligible evaporative loss. A heat exchanger or [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] may separate ''non-contact cooling water'' from a [[fluid]] being cooled,{{sfnp|Kemmer|1979|pages=38-1, 38-4, 38-7 &amp; 38-8 }} or ''contact cooling water'' may directly impinge on items like [[saw]] blades where [[phase (matter)|phase]] difference allows easy separation.  Environmental regulations emphasize the reduced concentrations of waste products in non-contact cooling water.{{sfnp|King|1995|pages=143, 439}}

=== Ships and boats ===
Water is an ideal cooling medium for vessels as they are constantly surrounded by water that generally remains at a low temperature throughout the year. Systems operating with sea water need to be manufactured from [[cupronickel]], [[bronze]], [[titanium]] or similarly corrosion-resistant materials. Water containing sediment may require velocity restrictions through piping to avoid erosion at high velocity or blockage by settling at low velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Thermex [http://thermex.co.uk/news/blog/160-what-is-a-heat-exchanger "Heat Exchanger FAQ Page"] 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Water accelerates corrosion of metal parts and is a favorable medium for biological growth. Dissolved minerals in natural water supplies are concentrated by evaporation to leave deposits called scale. Cooling water often requires addition of chemicals to minimize corrosion and insulating deposits of scale and biofouling.{{sfn|Betz|pages=183–184}}

=== Biofouling ===
Water is a favorable environment for many life forms. Flow characteristics of recirculating cooling water systems encourage colonization by [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms to use the circulating supply of food, [[oxygen]] and nutrients.{{sfnp|Reid|1961|pages=267–268}} Temperatures may become high enough to support [[thermophilic]] populations. Biofouling of heat exchange surfaces can reduce heat transfer rates of the cooling system; and biofouling of cooling towers can alter flow distribution to reduce evaporative cooling rates.  Biofouling may also create differential oxygen concentrations increasing corrosion rates.  OTC and open recirculating systems are most susceptible to biofouling.  Biofouling may be inhibited by temporary habitat modifications.  Temperature differences may discourage establishment of thermophilic populations in intermittently operated facilities; and intentional short term temperature spikes may periodically kill less tolerant populations.  [[Biocide]]s have been commonly used to control biofouling where sustained facility operation is required.{{sfn|Betz|page=202}}

=== Chemistry ===
Water contains varying amounts of impurities from contact with the atmosphere, soil, and containers. Manufactured metals tend to revert to ores via electrochemical reactions of corrosion.  Water can accelerate corrosion as both an electrical conductor and solvent for metal ions and oxygen.  Corrosion reactions proceed more rapidly as temperature increases.{{sfn|Betz|pages=183–184}} Preservation of machinery in the presence of hot water has been improved by addition of [[corrosion inhibitor]]s including [[zinc]], [[chromates]] and [[phosphates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hemmasian-Ettefagh|first=Ali|date=2010|title=Corrosion Inhibition of Carbon Steel in Cooling Water|url=|journal=MATERIALS PERFORMANCE|volume=49|pages=60-65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahgoub|first=F.M.|last2=Abdel-Nabey|first2=B.A.|last3=El-Samadisy|first3=Y.A.|date=March 2010|title=Adopting a multipurpose inhibitor to control corrosion of ferrous alloys in cooling water systems|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matchemphys.2009.10.028|journal=Materials Chemistry and Physics|volume=120|issue=1|pages=104–108|doi=10.1016/j.matchemphys.2009.10.028|issn=0254-0584}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two have toxicity concerns;{{sfnp|Kemmer|1979|pages=38-20, 38-21}} and the last has been associated with [[eutrophication]].{{sfnp|Goldman|Horne|1983|pages=153, 160}} Residual concentrations of biocides and corrosion inhibitors are of potential concern for OTC and blowdown from open recirculating systems.{{sfn|Betz|page=215}} With the exception of machines with short design life, closed recirculating systems require periodic cooling water treatment or replacement raising similar concern about ultimate disposal of cooling water containing chemicals used with environmental safety assumptions of a closed system.

==== Solids ====
[[Total dissolved solids]] or TDS (sometimes called filtrable residue) is measured as the mass of residue remaining when a measured volume of [[filter (chemistry)|filtered]] water is [[evaporate]]d.{{sfnp|Franson|1975|pp= 89-98 }} [[Salinity]] measures water [[density]] or [[conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] changes caused by dissolved materials.{{sfnp|Franson|1975|pp= 99-100 }}  Probability of scale formation increases with increasing total dissolved solids.  Solids commonly associated with scale formation are [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] [[carbonate]] and [[sulfate]].  Corrosion rates initially increase with salinity in response to increasing electrical conductivity, but then decrease after reaching a peak as higher levels of salinity decrease dissolved oxygen levels.{{sfn|Betz|pages=183–184}}

==== Hydrogen ====
Water ionizes into [[hydronium]] (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) [[cation]]s and [[hydroxide]] (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) [[anion]]s.  The concentration of ionized [[hydrogen]] (as protonated water) is expressed as [[pH]].{{sfnp|Franson|1975|pp= 406-407 }} Low pH values increase rate of corrosion while high pH values encourage scale formation.  [[Amphoterism]] is uncommon among metals used in water cooling systems, but [[aluminum]] corrosion rates increase with pH values above 9.  [[Galvanic corrosion]] may be severe in water systems with [[copper]] and aluminum components.  [[Acid]] may be added to cooling water systems to prevent scale formation if the pH decrease will offset increased salinity and dissolved solids.{{sfn|Betz|pages=191–194}}

==== Phosphorus and chromium ====
Concentrations of [[polyphosphate]]s or [[phosphonate]]s with zinc and chromates or similar compounds have been maintained in cooling systems to keep heat exchange surfaces clean so a film of [[Iron(III) oxide#Gamma phase|gamma iron oxide]] and [[zinc phosphate]] may inhibit corrosion by passivating anodic and cathodic reaction points.{{sfn|Betz|pages=198–199}} These increase salinity and total dissolved solids, and [[phosphorus]] compounds may provide the limiting essential nutrient for algal growth contributing to biofouling of the cooling system or to eutrophication of natural aquatic environments receiving blowdown or OTC water.  Chromates reduce biofouling in addition to effective corrosion inhibition, but residual toxicity in blowdown or OTC water has encouraged reduced chromate concentrations and use of less flexible corrosion inhibitors.{{sfnp|Kemmer|1979|pages=38-20, 38-21}}  Blowdown may also contain [[chromium]] leached from cooling towers constructed of wood preserved with [[chromated copper arsenate]].

==== Oxygen ====
Some groundwater contains very little oxygen when pumped from wells, but most natural water supplies include dissolved oxygen.  Corrosion increases with increasing oxygen concentrations.{{sfn|Betz|pages=183–184}} Dissolved oxygen approaches saturation levels in cooling towers.  Dissolved oxygen is desirable in blowdown or OTC water being returned to natural aquatic environments.

==== Biocides ====
[[Chlorine]] may be added in the form of [[hypochlorite]] to decrease biofouling, but is later reduced to [[chloride]] to minimize toxicity of blowdown or OTC water returned to natural aquatic environments.  Hypochlorite is increasingly destructive to wooden cooling towers as pH increases.  Chlorinated phenols have been used as biocides or leached from preserved wood in cooling towers.  Both hypochlorite and [[pentachlorophenol]] have reduced effectiveness at pH values greater than 8.{{sfn|Betz|pages=203–209}}  Non-oxidizing biocides may be more difficult to detoxify prior to release of blowdown or OTC water to natural aquatic environments.

== Steam power stations ==

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:KKP Einlauf.jpg|thumb|Cooling water intake of a nuclear power plant]]
Few other cooling applications approach the large volumes of water required to condense low pressure steam at [[power station]]s. Many facilities, particularly electric power plants, use millions of gallons of water per day for cooling.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2010).
[http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-04/documents/partial-list-of-facilities-subject-to-cwa-316b_2010.pdf "Partial List of Facilities Subject to Clean Water Act 316(b)."]&lt;/ref&gt; Water cooling on this scale may alter natural water environments and create new environments. [[Thermal pollution]] of rivers, estuaries and coastal waters is a consideration when siting such plants. Water returned to aquatic environments at temperatures higher than the ambient receiving water modify aquatic habitat by increasing biochemical reaction rates and decreasing oxygen saturation capacity of the habitat. Temperature increases initially favor a population shift from species requiring the high-oxygen concentration of cold water to those enjoying advantages of increased metabolic rates in warm water.{{sfnp|Reid|1961|pages=267–268}}

OTC systems may be used on very large rivers or at [[coastal]] and [[estuarine]] sites. These power stations put the [[waste heat]] into the river or coastal water. These OTC systems thus rely upon a good supply of river water or seawater for their cooling needs. Such facilities are built with intake structures designed to pump in large volumes of water at a high rate of flow. These structures tend to also pull in large numbers of fish and other aquatic organisms, which are killed or injured on the [[fish screen|intake screens]].&lt;ref name="EPA-intakes" &gt;EPA (2014). [http://www2.epa.gov/cooling-water-intakes "Cooling Water Intakes."]&lt;/ref&gt; Large flow rates may immobilize slow-swimming organisms including [[fish]] and [[shrimp]] on [[fish screen|screens]] protecting the small bore tubes of the heat exchangers from blockage.  High temperatures or pump turbulence and shear may kill or disable smaller organisms passing the screens entrained with the cooling water.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2004). [http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-04/documents/cooling-water_phase-2_economics_2004.pdf "Economic and Benefits Analysis for the Final Section 316(b) Phase II Existing Facilities Rule."] Chapter A2. Document No. EPA-821-R-04-005.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., cooling water intake structures kill billions of fish and other organisms each year.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (May 2014). [http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-04/documents/final-regulations-cooling-water-intake-structures-at-existing-facilities_fact-sheet_may-2014.pdf "Final Regulations to Establish Requirements for Cooling Water Intake Structures at Existing Facilities."] Fact sheet. Document no. EPA-821-F-14-001.&lt;/ref&gt; More agile aquatic [[predator]]s consume organisms impinged on the screens; and warm water predators and [[scavenger]]s colonize the cooling water discharge to feed on entrained organisms.

The U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] requires the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to issue [[regulation]]s on industrial cooling water intake structures.&lt;ref&gt;Clean Water Act, Section 316(b), {{USC|33|1316}}.&lt;/ref&gt; EPA issued final regulations for new facilities in 2001 (amended 2003),&lt;ref name="EPA-intakes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. ''Cooling Water Intake Structures.'' Final rule: 2001-12-18, {{USFR|66|65255}}. Amended: 2003-06-19, {{USFR|68|36749}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and for existing facilities in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;EPA.

=== Cooling towers ===
[[File:A Marley industrial cooling tower.jpg|thumb|right|A Marley mechanical induced draft cooling tower]]
{{see also|Cooling tower}}
As an alternative to OTC, industrial cooling towers may use river water, coastal water ([[seawater]]), or well water as their source of fresh cooling water. The large mechanical induced-draft or forced-draft cooling towers in industrial plants continuously circulate cooling water through heat exchangers and other equipment where the water absorbs heat. That heat is then rejected &lt;!-- engineering term, although ejected makes more sense in regular English--&gt;to the atmosphere by the partial evaporation of the water in cooling towers where upflowing air is contacted with the circulating downflow of water. The loss of evaporated water into the air exhausted to the atmosphere is replaced by "make-up" fresh river water or fresh cooling water; but volumes of water lost during evaporative cooling may decrease natural habitat for aquatic organisms. Since the evaporation of pure water is replaced by make-up water containing carbonates and other dissolved salts, a portion of the circulating water is also continuously discarded as "blowdown" water to prevent the excessive build-up of salts in the circulating water; and these blowdown wastes may change the receiving water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Internal combustion engines ==
{{details|Internal combustion engine cooling}}
The [[water jacket]] around an engine is very effective at deadening mechanical noises, which makes the engine quieter.

=== Open method ===
[[File:Moore-single-cylinder-gasoline-engine.jpg|thumb|An antique gasoline engine with an evaporative cooler and mesh screen to improve evaporation. Water is pumped up to the top and flows down the screen to the tank.]]
{{Details|Hopper cooling}}
An open water cooling system makes use of [[evaporative cooling]], lowering the temperature of the remaining (unevaporated) water. This method was common in early internal combustion engines, until scale buildup was observed from dissolved salts and minerals in the water.  Modern open cooling systems continuously waste a fraction of recirculating water as blowdown to remove dissolved solids at concentrations low enough to prevent scale formation.  Some open systems use inexpensive [[tap water]], but this requires higher blowdown rates than [[purified water|deionized]] or [[distilled water]].  Purified water systems still require blowdown to remove accumulation of byproducts of chemical treatment to prevent corrosion and biofouling.{{sfn|Betz|page=192}}

=== Pressurization ===
Water cooling also has a [[boiling point]] temperature of around 100 degrees C at atmospheric pressure. Engines operating at higher temperatures may require a pressurized recycle loop to prevent overheating.&lt;ref name="Sturgess"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sturgess |first=Steve |url= http://www.truckinginfo.com/channel/maintenance/article/story/2009/08/column-keep-your-cool.aspx |title= Column: Keep Your Cool |publisher= Heavy Duty Trucking|date= August 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; Modern automotive cooling systems often operate at {{Convert|15|psi|kPa|0|abbr=on}} to raise the boiling-point of the recycling water coolant and reduce evaporative losses.&lt;ref name=HowStuffWorks&gt;{{cite web
  |last=Nice|first=Karim|title=How Car Cooling Systems Work|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/cooling-system.htm|work=HowStuffWorks|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=20 August 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antifreeze ===
The use of water cooling carries the risk of damage from freezing. Automotive and many other engine cooling applications require the use of a water and [[antifreeze]] mixture to lower the freezing point to a temperature unlikely to be experienced.  Antifreeze also inhibits corrosion from dissimilar metals and can increase the boiling point, allowing a wider range of water cooling temperatures.&lt;ref name="HowStuffWorks"/&gt; Its distinctive odor also alerts operators to cooling system leaks and problems that would go unnoticed in a water-only cooling system. The heated coolant mixture can also be used to warm the air inside the car by means of the [[heater core]].

=== Other additives ===
Other less common chemical additives are products to reduce surface tension. These additives are meant to increase the efficiency of automotive cooling systems. Such products are used to enhance the cooling of underperforming or undersized cooling systems or in racing where the weight of a larger cooling system could be a disadvantage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Power electronics and transmitters ==
Since approximately 1930 it is common to use water cooling for tubes of powerful transmitters. As these devices uses high operation voltages ( around 10 kV), the use of deionized water is required and it has to be carefully controlled.
Modern solid-state transmitters can be built so that even high power transmitters do not require water cooling. Water cooling is however also sometimes used for thyristors of HVDC valves, for which also the use of deionized water is required.{{Citation needed

=== Liquid cooling maintenance ===
[[File:© CoolIT Rack DCLC AHx Liquid Cooling Solution.jpg|thumb|CoolIT Rack DCLC AHx Liquid Cooling Solution]]
Liquid cooling techniques are increasingly being used for the thermal management of electronic components. This type of cooling is a solution to ensure the optimisation of energy efficiency while simultaneously minimising noise and space requirements. Especially useful in supercomputers or Data Centers as maintenance of the racks is quick and easy.  After disassembly of the rack, advanced technology quick release couplings eliminate spillage for the safety of operators and protects the integrity of fluids (no impurities in the circuits).  These couplings are also capable of being locked (Panel mounted?) to allow blind connection in difficult to access areas.{{Citation needed
|reason=this section has no reference citations
|date=September 2018}}
It is important in electronics technology to analyse the connection systems to ensure:
* Non-spill sealing (clean break, flush face couplings)
* Compact and lightweight (materials in special aluminum alloys)
* Operator safety (disconnection without spillage)
* Quick-release couplings sized for optimized flow
* Connection guiding system and compensation of misalignment during connection on rack systems
* Excellent resistance to vibration and corrosion
* Designed to withstand a large number of connections even on refrigerant circuits under residual pressure

Water cooling often adds complexity and cost in comparison to air cooling design by requiring a pump, tubing or piping to transport the water, and a radiator, often with fans, to reject the heat to the atmosphere. Depending on the application, water cooling may create an additional element of risk where leakage from the water coolant recycle loop may corrode or short-circuit sensitive electronic components.

The primary advantage of water cooling for cooling [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cores in computing equipment is transporting heat away from the source to a secondary cooling surface to allow for large, more optimally designed [[radiator]]s rather than small, relatively inefficient fins&lt;!--these are FINS as in, a metal lattice which gives a high surface area, not fans!!!--&gt; mounted directly on the heat source. Cooling hot computer components with various fluids has been in use since at least as far back as the development of [[Cray-2]] in 1982, using [[Fluorinert]].  Through the 1990s, water cooling for home PCs slowly gained recognition amongst enthusiasts, but it started to become noticeably more prevalent after the introduction of [[AMD]]'s hot-running [[Athlon]] processor in mid-2000.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} As of 2011, there are several manufacturers of water cooling components and kits, and some custom computer retailers include various setups of water cooling for their high-performance systems.

Water cooling can be used to cool many computer components, but especially the [[CPU cooling|CPU]]. Water cooling usually uses a CPU [[water block]], a [[pump|water pump]], and a water-to-air heat exchanger.  By transferring device heat to a separate heat exchanger which can variously be made large and use larger, lower-speed fans, water cooling can allow quieter operation, improved processor speeds ([[overclocking]]), or a balance of both. Less commonly, [[Graphics processing unit|GPUs]], [[Northbridge (computing)|Northbridges]], [[Southbridge (computing)|Southbridges]], [[Hard disk|hard disk drives]], [[Random access memory|memory]], [[voltage regulator module]]s (VRMs), and even [[Power supply|power supplies]] can be water-cooled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koolance.com/1300-1700w-liquid-cooled-power-supply |title=Koolance 1300/1700W Liquid-Cooled Power Supply |publisher=Koolance.com |date=2008-03-22 |accessdate=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiator size may vary: from 40mm dual fan (80mm) to 140 quad fan (560mm) and thickness from 30mm to 80mm

Water coolers for desktop computers were, until the end of the 1990s, homemade. They were made from car [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiators]] (or more commonly, a car's [[heater core]]), [[aquarium]] pumps and home-made water blocks, laboratory-grade PVC and silicone tubing and various reservoirs (homemade using plastic bottles, or constructed using cylindrical acrylic or sheets of acrylic, usually clear) and or a [[T-Line]]. More recently a growing number of companies are manufacturing water-cooling components compact enough to fit inside a computer case. This, and the trend to CPUs of higher power dissipation, has greatly increased the popularity of water cooling.

Dedicated overclockers occasionally use [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] or [[Peltier-Seebeck effect|thermoelectric coolers]] in place of more common standard heat exchangers. Water cooling systems in which water is cooled directly by the evaporator coil of a phase change system are able to chill the circulating coolant below the ambient air temperature (impossible with a standard heat exchanger) and, as a result, generally provide superior cooling of the computer's heat-generating components. The downside of phase-change or thermoelectric cooling is that it uses much more electricity, and [[Antifreeze (coolant)|antifreeze]] must be added due to the low temperature. Additionally, insulation, usually in the form of lagging around water pipes and neoprene pads around the components to be cooled, must be used in order to prevent damage caused by [[condensation]] of water vapour from the air on chilled surfaces. Common places from which to borrow the required [[phase transition]] systems are a household [[dehumidifier]] or [[air conditioner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forums.extremeoverclocking.com/showthread.php?t=354585 |title=Dehumidifier &amp; Air Conditioner  |publisher=extremeoverclocking.com |date=2011-04-05 |accessdate=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative cooling system, which enables components to be cooled below the ambient temperature, but which obviates the requirement for antifreeze and lagged pipes, is to place a [[Thermoelectric cooling|thermoelectric device]] (commonly referred to as a 'Peltier junction' or 'pelt' after [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier|Jean Peltier]], who documented the effect) between the heat-generating component and the water block.  Because the only sub-ambient temperature zone now is at the interface with the heat-generating component itself, insulation is required only in that localized area. The disadvantage of such a system is a higher power dissipation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

To avoid damage from condensation around the Peltier junction, a proper installation requires it to be "potted" with silicone epoxy. The epoxy is applied around the edges of the device, preventing air from entering or leaving the interior.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Apple's [[Power Mac G5]] was the first mainstream desktop computer to have water cooling as standard (although only on its fastest models). [[Dell]] followed suit by shipping their XPS computers with liquid cooling{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, using [[thermoelectric cooling]] to help cool the liquid. Currently, Dell's only computers to offer liquid cooling are their [[Alienware]] desktops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other applications ==
Plant [[transpiration]] and animal [[perspiration]] use evaporative cooling to prevent high temperatures from causing unsustainable [[metabolism|metabolic rates]]. 

[[Machinegun]]s used in fixed defensive positions sometimes use water cooling to extend barrel life through periods of rapid fire, but the weight of the water and pumping system significantly reduces the portability of water-cooled firearms.

A [[hospital]] in [[Sweden]] relies on snow-cooling from [[Meltwater|melt-water]] from to cool its data centers, medical equipment, and maintain a comfortable ambient temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lvn.se/v1/In-english1/In-english/Environment-and-energy/Energy-Factor-2/Snow-cooling-in-Sundsvall/|title=Snow cooling in Sundsvall|website=www.lvn.se|language=sv|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nuclear reactors use [[heavy water]] as cooling. Heavy water is employed in [[nuclear reactor]]s because it is a weaker [[neutron absorber]]. This allows for the use of less enriched fuel. For the main cooling system, normal water is preferably employed through the use of a heat exchanger, as heavy water is much more expensive. Reactors that use other materials for moderation (graphite) [[RBMK|may also use normal water for cooling]].

High-grade industrial water (produced by [[reverse osmosis]] or [[distillation]]) and potable water are sometimes used in industrial plants requiring high-purity cooling water. Production of these high purity waters creates waste byproduct [[brine]]s containing the concentrated impurities from the source water.

In 2018, researchers from the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] and [[University of Wyoming]] invented a radiative cooling [[metamaterial]] known as "RadiCold", being developed since 2017. This metamaterial aids in cooling of water and increasing the efficiency of power generation, in which it would cool the underneath objects, by reflecting the sun's rays while at the same time allowing the surface to discharge its heat as an infrared thermal radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dongliang Zhao |author2=Ablimit Aili|author3=Yao Zhai |author4=Jiatao Lu |author5=Dillon Kidd |author6=Gang Tan |author7=Xiaobo Yin |author8=Ronggui Yang |title=Subambient Cooling of Water: Toward Real-World Applications of Daytime Radiative Cooling |publisher=ScienceDirect |date=26 October 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.joule.2018.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a search feature, one can locate a particular pathway by name, by the genes and proteins it contains, or by the text displayed in its description. The pathway collection can also be browsed with combinations of species names and ontology-based categories.

In addition to the pathway diagram, each pathway page also includes a description, bibliography, pathway version history and list of component genes and proteins with linkouts to public resources. For individual pathway nodes, users can access a list of other pathways with that node. Pathway changes can be monitored by displaying previous revisions or by viewing differences between specific revisions. Using the pathway history one can also revert to a previous revision of a pathway.
Pathways can also be tagged with ontology terms from three major [[Open Biomedical Ontologies|BioPortal]] ontologies (Pathway, Disease and Cell Type).

The '''Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle''' was a three-day [[academic conference]] where the [[precautionary principle]] was defined. The January 1998 meeting took place at [[Wingspread]], headquarters of the [[Johnson Foundation]] in [[Racine, Wisconsin]], and involved 35 [[scientists]], [[lawyers]], policy makers and [[environmentalists]] from the United States, Canada and Europe.&lt;ref name="mindfully"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
{{main|Precautionary principle}}

The formal concept evolved out of the German socio-legal tradition in the 1930s, centering on the concept of good household management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agobservatory.org/library.cfm?refID=30236&lt;/ref&gt; In German the concept is ''Vorsorgeprinzip'', which translates into English as ''precaution principle''.

Many of the concepts underpinning the precautionary principle pre-date the term's inception. For example, the essence of the principle is captured in a number of cautionary [[aphorism]]s such as "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure", "better safe than sorry", and "look before you leap".&lt;ref&gt;http://rachel.org/?q=en/node/3850&lt;/ref&gt; The precautionary principle may also be interpreted as the evolution of the ancient medical principle of "[[Primum non nocere|first, do no harm]]" to apply to institutions and institutional decision-making processes rather than individuals.

==Final statement==
In the final text of the agreement, it was agreed that the [[precautionary principle]] could be summarized as
&lt;blockquote&gt;cv 
When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically.&lt;ref name="official-pr"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = 
  | first =

  | format = 
  | doi = 
  | accessdate = October 25, 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The members also concluded that current [[environmental policies]] do not do enough to prevent environmental disasters instead of controlling damage after an incident.

==Follow up committees==
The February 2, 2000 [[European Commission Communication on the Precautionary Principle]] notes: "The precautionary principle applies where scientific evidence is insufficient, inconclusive or uncertain and preliminary scientific evaluation indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potentially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection chosen by the EU".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.progressiveregulation.org/perspectives/precaution.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The January 29, 2000 [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]] says: "Lack of scientific certainty due to insufficient relevant scientific information ... shall not prevent the Party of import, in order to avoid or minimize such potential adverse effects, from taking a decision, as appropriate, with regard to the import of the living modified organism in question."

'''Year zero''' does not exist in the [[anno Domini]] system usually used to number years in the [[Gregorian calendar]] and in its predecessor, the [[Julian calendar]]. In this system, the year {{nowrap|[[1 BC]]}} is followed by {{nowrap|[[AD 1]]}}.  However, there is a year zero in [[astronomical year numbering]] (where it coincides with the Julian year {{nowrap|1 BC}})  and in [[ISO 8601|ISO 8601:2004]] (where it coincides with the Gregorian year {{nowrap|1 BC}}) as well as in all [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist]] and [[Hindu calendar]]s.

== Historical, astronomical and ISO year numbering systems ==

=== Historians ===

The ''[[Anno Domini]]'' era was introduced in 525 by [[Scythia Minor|Scythian]] monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (c. 470–c. 544), who used it to identify the years on his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. He introduced the new era to avoid using the ''[[Diocletian Era|Diocletian era]]'', based on the accession of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]], as he did not wish to continue the memory of [[Diocletianic Persecution|a persecutor of Christians]]. In the preface to his Easter table, Dionysius stated that the "present year" was "the [[consulship]] of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]] [Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior]" which was also 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]".&lt;ref name=Dionysius&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm|title=DIONYSIUS EXIGUUS. LIBER DE PASCHATE SIVE CYCLUS PASCHALIS|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109025617/http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm|archivedate=9 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; How he arrived at that number is unknown.

Dionysius did not use AD years to date any historical event. This began with the English cleric [[Bede]] (c. 672–735), who used AD years in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (731), popularizing the era. Bede also used a term similar to the English [[Anno Domini|before Christ]] once, but that practice did not catch on until very much later. Bede did not sequentially number [[Roman calendar#Months|days of the month]], weeks of the year, or months of the year. However, he did number many of the [[week#numerical|days of the week]] using a counting origin of one in [[Ecclesiastical Latin]]. Previous Christian histories used ''[[anno mundi]]'' ("in the year of the world") beginning on the first day of [[Creation myth|creation]], or ''anno Adami'' ("in the year of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]") beginning at the creation of Adam five days later (the sixth day of creation according to the [[Genesis creation narrative]]), used by Africanus, or ''anno Abrahami'' ("in the year of [[Abraham]]") beginning 3,412 years after Creation according to the [[Septuagint]], used by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], all of which assigned "one" to the year beginning at Creation, or the creation of Adam, or the birth of Abraham, respectively. Bede continued this earlier tradition relative to the AD era.

In chapter II of book I of ''Ecclesiastical history'', Bede stated that [[Julius Caesar]] invaded Britain "in the year 693 after the building of Rome, but the sixtieth year before the incarnation of our Lord", while stating in chapter III, "in the year of Rome 798, [[Claudius]]" also invaded Britain and "within a very few days … concluded the war in … the fortysixth [year] from the incarnation of our Lord".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-book1.html|title=Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both dates are wrong, they are sufficient to conclude that Bede did not include a year zero between BC and AD: 798 − 693 + 1 (because the years are inclusive) = 106, but 60 + 46 = 106, which leaves no room for a year zero. The modern English term "before Christ" (BC) is only a rough equivalent, ''not'' a direct translation, of Bede's Latin phrase ''ante incarnationis dominicae tempus'' ("before the time of the lord's incarnation"), which was itself never abbreviated. Bede's singular use of 'BC' continued to be used sporadically throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

Neither the concept nor a symbol for zero existed in the system of [[Roman numerals]]. The [[Babylonian numerals#Numerals|Babylonian system]] of the BC era had used the idea of "nothingness" without considering it a number, and the Romans enumerated in much the same way. Wherever a modern zero would have been used, Bede and Dionysius Exiguus did use [[Latin]] number words, or the word ''nulla'' (meaning "nothing") alongside Roman numerals.&lt;ref name=Dionysius/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faith Wallis, trans. ''Bede: The Reckoning of Time'' (725), Liverpool: Liverpool Univ. Pr., 2004. {{ISBN|0-85323-693-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Byrhtferth's Enchiridion'' (1016). Edited by Peter S. Baker and Michael Lapidge. Early English Text Society 1995. {{ISBN|978-0-19-722416-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zero was invented in India in the sixth century, and was either transferred or reinvented by the Arabs by about the eighth century. The [[Arabic numerals|Arabic numeral]] for zero ([[0 (number)|0]]) did not enter Europe until the thirteenth century. Even then, it was known only to very few, and only entered widespread use in Europe by the seventeenth century.

The ''anno Domini'' nomenclature was not widely used in Western Europe until the 9th century, and the {{nowrap|1 January}} to {{nowrap|31 December}} historical year was not uniform throughout Western Europe until 1752. The first extensive use (hundreds of times) of 'BC' occurred in ''Fasciculus Temporum'' by [[Werner Rolevinck]] in 1474, alongside years of the world (''anno mundi'').&lt;ref&gt;Werner Rolevinck, ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''anno Domini'', ''Dionysian era'', ''Christian era'', ''vulgar era'', and ''common era'' were used interchangeably between the [[Renaissance]] and the 19th century, at least in [[Latin]]. But ''vulgar era'' was suppressed in English at the beginning of the 20th century after ''vulgar'' acquired the meaning of "offensively coarse", replacing its original meaning of "common" or "ordinary". Consequently, historians regard all these eras as equal.

Historians have never included a year zero. This means that between, for example, {{nowrap|1 January}} {{nowrap|500 BC}} and {{nowrap|1 January}} {{nowrap|AD 500}}, there are 999 years: 500 years BC, and 499 years AD preceding 500. In common usage ''anno Domini'' 1 is preceded by the year 1 [[Ante Christum Natum|BC]], without an intervening year zero.&lt;ref&gt;While it is increasingly common to place ''AD'' after a date by analogy to the use of ''BC'', formal English usage adheres to the traditional practice of placing the abbreviation before the year as in Latin (e.g., {{nowrap|100 BC}}, but {{nowrap|AD 100}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the choice of calendar system (whether [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]) nor the era (''Anno Domini'' or [[Common Era]]) determines whether a year zero will be used. If writers do not use the convention of their group (historians or astronomers), they must explicitly state whether they include a year 0 in their count of years, otherwise their historical dates will be misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;V. Grumel, ''La chronologie'' (1958), page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astronomers ===
{{Main article|Astronomical year numbering}}

In astronomy, for the year AD 1 and later it is common to assign the same numbers as the Anno Domini notation, which in turn is numerically equivalent to the Common Era notation. But the discontinuity between 1 AD and 1 BC makes it cumbersome to compare ancient and modern dates. So the year before 1 AD is designated 0, the year before 0 is &amp;minus;1, and so on.

The letters "AD", "BC", "CE, or "BCE" are omitted. So 1 BC in historical notation is equivalent to 0 in astronomical notation, 2 BC is equivalent to &amp;minus;1, etc. Sometimes positive years are preceded by the + sign. This year numbering notation was introduced by the astronomer Jacques Cassini in 1740.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 3| publisher = Univ Science Books| isbn = 1-891389-85-8| editor1-first = Sean E. | editor1-last= Urban | editor2-first = P.

G. | author-last = Richards | page = 591 | location = Mill Valley, CA| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== History of astronomical usage ====
In 1627, the German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] first used an astronomical year which was to become year zero in his ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]''. He labeled the year ''Christi'' and inserted it between years labeled ''Ante Christum'' (BC) and ''Post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages of the Sun, Moon, and planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uni-kiel.de/digiport/bis1800/Arch3_436.html Tabulae Rudolphinae – Ioannes Keplerus] (1627) 191 (42), 197 (48), 203 (54), 209 (60), 215 (66), 221 (72), 227 (78).&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1702 the French astronomer [[Philippe de la Hire]] used a year he labeled {{nowrap|''Christum 0''}} at the end of years labeled ''ante Christum'' (BC), immediately before years labeled ''post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages in his ''Tabulæ Astronomicæ'', thus adding the designation ''0'' to Kepler's ''Christi''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjygAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP35,M1 Tabulae Astronomicae – Philippo de la Hire] (1702), Tabulæ 15, 21, 39, 47, 55, 63, 71; Usus tabularum 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1740 the French astronomer [[Jacques Cassini]] {{nowrap|(Cassini II)}}, who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bn0EBVsfi1YC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103 ''The nothing that is''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 103.&lt;/ref&gt; completed the transition in his ''Tables astronomiques'', simply labeling this year ''0'', which he placed at the end of years labeled ''avant Jesus-Christ'' (BC), immediately before years labeled ''après Jesus-Christ'' (AD).&lt;ref&gt;[Jacques] Cassini, ''Tables astronomiques'' (1740), Explication et usage 5; Tables 10, 22, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ISO 8601 ===

[[ISO 8601|ISO 8601:2004]] (and previously ISO 8601:2000, but not ISO 8601:1988) explicitly uses astronomical year numbering in its date reference systems. Because it also specifies the use of the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]] for all years before 1582, some readers incorrectly assume that a year zero is also included in that proleptic calendar, but it is not used with the BC/AD era. The "basic" format for year 0 is the four-digit form 0000, which equals the historical year 1&amp;nbsp;BC. Several "expanded" formats are possible: −0000 and +0000, as well as five- and six-digit versions. Earlier years are also negative four-, five- or six-digit years, which have an [[absolute value]] one less than the equivalent BC year, hence -0001 = 2 BC. Because only [[ISO 646]] (7-bit [[ASCII]]) characters are allowed by ISO 8601, the minus sign is represented by a [[hyphen-minus]].

== Other traditions ==

=== South Asian calendars ===
All eras used with [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist calendar]]s, such as the [[Saka era]] or the [[Kali Yuga]], begin with the year 0. All  these calendars use elapsed, expired, or complete years, in contrast with most other calendars which use current years. A complete year had not yet elapsed for any date in the initial year of the epoch, thus the number 1 cannot be used. Instead, during the first year the indication of 0 years (elapsed) is given in order to show that the epoch is less than 1 year old. This is similar to the Western method of stating a person's age – people do not reach age one until one year has elapsed since birth (but their age during the year beginning at birth is specified in months or fractional years, not as age zero). However, if ages were specified in years and months, such a person would be said to be, for example, 0 years and 6 months or 0.5 years old. This is analogous to the way time is shown on a [[24-hour clock]]: during the first hour of a day, the time elapsed is 0 hours, ''n'' minutes.
