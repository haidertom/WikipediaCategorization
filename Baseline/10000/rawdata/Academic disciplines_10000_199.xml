{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}
In [[biology]] and [[ecology]], '''abiotic components''' or '''abiotic factors''' are non-living chemical and [[Physical property|physical]] parts of the [[Natural environment|environment]] that affect living [[organism]]s and the functioning of [[ecosystem]]s. Abiotic factors and the phenomena associated with them underpin all biology. 

Abiotic components include physical conditions and non-living [[Resource (biology)|resources]] that affect living organisms in terms of [[Developmental biology|growth]], [[Maintenance of an organism|maintenance]], and [[reproduction]].  Resources are distinguished as substances or objects in the environment required by one organism and consumed or otherwise made unavailable for use by other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, R.E. 2005. ''The Economy of Nature, 6th edition''. WH Freeman, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F.S. III, H.A. Mooney, M.C. Chapin, and P. Matson. 2011. Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology. Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Abiotic Factors.tif|thumb|These are different settings on earth that are abiotic factors, which mean they are not living organisms, that contribute to the earth in many different ways.]]
Component degradation of a substance occurs by [[chemical process|chemical]] or [[Physical change|physical process]]es, e.g. [[hydrolysis]].  All non-living components of an ecosystem, such as atmospheric conditions and water resources, are called abiotic components.&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Vocabulary. ISO 6107-6:1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
In biology, abiotic factors can include water, light, radiation, temperature, [[humidity]], [[atmosphere]], and soil. The macroscopic climate often influences each of the above. Pressure and sound waves may also be considered in the context of marine or sub-terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=EoEarth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |title=Abiotic factor |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment |year=2010 |last=Hogan |first=C.

Consider the differences in the mechanics of [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]], [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]], and [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM]] plants in regulating the influx of [[carbon dioxide]] to the [[Calvin-Benson Cycle]] in relation to their abiotic stressors. C3 plants have no mechanisms to manage [[photorespiration]], whereas C4 and CAM plants utilize a separate [[PEP Carboxylase]] enzyme to prevent photorespiration, thus increasing the yield of photosynthetic processes in certain high energy environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Chuali|last2=Guo|first2=Longyun|last3=Li|first3=Yixue|last4=Wang|first4=Zhuo|title=Systematic Comparison of C3 and C4 Plants Based on Metabolic Network Analysis|journal=BMC Systems Biology|date=2012|volume=6|issue=59|doi=10.1186/1752-0509-6-S2-S9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubisco and C4 Plants|url=http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/content/filerepository/CMP/00/001/066/Rubisco%20and%20C4%20plants.pdf?v=1353967268963|website=RSC: Advancing the Chemical Sciences|publisher=RSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Archea]] require very high temperatures, pressures or unusual concentrations of chemical substances such as sulfur; this is due to their specialization into extreme conditions. In addition, fungi have also evolved to survive at the temperature, the humidity, and stability of their environment.&lt;ref name=UWC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/sci_ed/grade10/ecology/abiotic/abiot.htm |title=Abiotic Components |publisher=Department of Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, [[University of the Western Cape]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425160041/http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/SCI_ED/grade10/ecology/abiotic/abiot.htm |archivedate=2005-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, there is a significant difference in access in both water and humidity between [[temperate rain forest]]s and [[desert]]s. This difference in water availability causes a diversity in the types of plants and animals that survive in these areas. These differences in abiotic components alter the species present both by creating boundaries of what species can survive within the environment, as well as influencing competition between two species. Abiotic factors such as salinity can give one species a competitive advantage over another, creating pressures that lead to speciation and alteration of a species to and from generalist and specialist competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunson|first=William A.|date=November 1991|title=The Role of Abiotic Factors in Community Organization|url=https://www.jstor.org.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/stable/pdf/2462508.pdf|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=138 |issue=5|pages=1067–1091|doi=10.1086/285270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aesthetic relativism''' is the idea that [[points of view (philosophy)|views]] of [[beauty]] are [[relativism|relative]] to differences in perception and consideration, and [[intrinsic|intrinsically]], have no absolute [[truth]] or [[Validity (logic)|validity]] 

==Overview==
Aesthetic relativism might be regarded as a sub-set of an overall philosophical [[relativism]], which denies any absolute standards of [[truth]] or [[morality]] as well as of aesthetic judgement. (A frequently-cited source for philosophical relativism in [[postmodern]] theory is a fragment by [[Nietzsche]], entitled "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense.")

For example, in historical terms, the female form as depicted in the [[Venus of Willendorf]] and the women in the paintings of [[Rubens]] would today be regarded as over-weight, while the slim models on the covers of contemporary fashion magazines would no doubt be regarded in a negative light by our predecessors. In contemporary (cross-cultural) terms, [[body modification]] among "[[primitive culture|primitive]]" peoples is sometimes regarded as [[grotesque]] by Western society. 

Aesthetic relativism is a variety of the philosophy known generally as relativism, which casts doubt on the possibility of direct epistemic access to the "external world", and which therefore rejects the positive claim that statements made about the external world can be known to be objectively true. Other varieties of relativism include cognitive relativism (the general claim that all truth and knowledge is relative) and Ethical Relativism (the claim that moral judgments are relative). Aesthetic and ethical relativism are sub-categories of Cognitive Relativism. Philosophers who have been influential in relativist thinking include David Hume, particularly his "radical scepticism" as set out in A Treatise of Human Nature; Thomas Kuhn, with regard to the history and philosophy of science, and particularly his work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions; Friedrich Nietzsche, in moral philosophy and epistemology; and Richard Rorty, on the contingency of language.

Philosophers who have given influential objectivist accounts include Plato, and in particular his Theory of the Forms; Immanuel Kant, who argued that the judgment of beauty, despite being subjective, is a universally practiced function of the mind; Noam Chomsky, whose "nativist" theory of linguistics argues for a universal grammar (i.e., that language is not as contingent as relativists have argued that it is).

The most prominent philosophical opponent of aesthetic relativism was Immanuel [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], who argued that the judgment of beauty, while subjective, is universal.

==History==
In 1911, [[Frederic Goudy]], [[Alfred Stieglitz]], and [[William Addison Dwiggins|W. A. Dwiggins]] came together to discuss the creation of an organization that was committed to individuals passionate about communication design.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://madmuseum.org/series/aiga|title=AIGA|website=madmuseum.org|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, president of the [[National Arts Club]], [[John G. Agar (lawyer)|John G. Agar]], announced the formation of The American Institute of Graphic Arts during the eighth annual exhibition of “The Books of the Year.” The National Arts Club was instrumental in the formation of AIGA in that they helped to form the committee to plan to organize the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/11/13/104788833.html|title=ARTS CLUB WARNED OF 'THOUGHT TRUST'; While It Plans for Graphic Arts, Bacheller Also Warns of Our Europeanization.

Howland]] and officially formed the American Institute of Graphic Arts in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aiga.org/How-Our-Quarter-Century-Began/|title=How Our Quarter Century Began|newspaper=AIGA {{!}} the professional association for design|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howland, publisher and editor of ''The Outlook'', was elected president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Steven Heller|author2=Nathan Gluck|title=Seventy-five years of AIGA|url=http://www.aiga.org/about-history-75thanniversary/|website=aiga.org|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the group was to promote excellence in the graphic design profession through its network of local chapters throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1920, AIGA began awarding [[List of AIGA medalists|medals]] to "individuals who have set standards of excellence over a lifetime of work or have made individual contributions to innovation within the practice of design." Winners have been recognized for design, teaching, writing or leadership of the profession and may honor individuals posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aiga.org/medal|title=AIGA Medalists List|newspaper=AIGA {{!}} the professional association for design|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the New York Chapter was formed and the organization began creating local chapters to decentralize leadership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Represented by Washington, D.C. arts advocate and attorney, James Lorin Silverberg, Esq., The Washington, D.C. Chapter of AIGA, was organized as the American Institute of Graphic Arts, Incorporated, Washington, D.C. on September 6, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=District of Columbia Corporate Records|url=http://corp.dcra.dc.gov/BizEntity.aspx/ViewEntityData?entityld=2787251|publisher=The District of Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbol sign project==
{{main article|DOT pictograms}}
The AIGA, in collaboration with the [[US Department of Transportation]], produced 50 standard symbols to be used on signs "in airports and other transportation hubs and at large international events". The first 34 symbols were published in 1974, receiving  a [[Presidential Design Award]]. The remaining 16 designs were added in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/symbol-signs|title=Symbol Signs|year=2009|publisher=AIGA|accessdate=September 2, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091010215420/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/symbol-signs| archivedate= October 10, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual competitions ==

===Cased===
In 2012, AIGA replaced all its competitions with a single competition called "Cased"&lt;ref name="Cased-competition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/cased/|title=Cased, AIGA's annual design competition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly called "Justified"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/justified/#about |title=Justified: AIGA Annual Design Competition |author=AIGA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The stated aim of the competition is to demonstrate "the collective success and impact of the design profession by celebrating the best in contemporary design through case studies".&lt;ref name="Cased-competition" /&gt;

===50 Books/50 Covers===
Between 1941 and 2011 AIGA sponsored a juried contest for the 50 best designed books published in the previous year, entitled "50 Books/50 Covers". Jurors included booksellers, book publishers, and designers such as [[George Salter]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Books of the year 1963'', The American Institute of Graphic Arts, New York, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2012, AIGA announced that it would cease organizing the contest and that future contests would be organized by [[Design Observer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/AIGA-and-Design-Observer-partner-on-50-Books-50-Covers/ |title=AIGA and Design Observer Partner on "50 Books/50 Covers" |date=February 17, 2012 |author=AIGA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This move has been criticized.&lt;ref name=Unjustified&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.printmag.com/featured/aiga-unjustified/ |title=AIGA: Unjustified |first=Paula |last=Scher |authorlink=Paula Scher |work=[[Print (magazine)|Print Magazine]] |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===365===
The 365 was an annual design competition for all graphic design other than book design.&lt;ref name=Unjustified /&gt; The last “365” competition was organized in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/about-365/ |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;365 | Design Effectiveness Competition&lt;/nowiki&gt; |author=AIGA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after which it was replaced by the "Cased" competition.

==Conferences==
AIGA organized two conferences, the AIGA Design Conference and GAIN: AIGA Design and Business Conference. Both conferences were held biennially and the two were held in alternating years. Beginning in 2016, the AIGA Design Conference will be held annually with the 2016 conference held in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designconference.aiga.org/#!/|title=AIGA Design Conference|website=designconference.aiga.org|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AIGA Design Conference===

The first AIGA Design Conference took place in Boston, Massachusetts in 1985.

'''Apologetics''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀπολογία}}, "speaking in defense") is the religious discipline of defending [[religious doctrine]]s through systematic [[argument]]ation and discourse.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G627 |title=ἀπολογία |work=Blue Letter Bible-Lexicon |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01618a.htm |title=Apologetics |date= |website=The Advent |publisher= |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apologetics |title=apologetics |date= |website=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |publisher= |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of early Christian writers|Early Christian writers]] (c. 120–220) who defended their beliefs against [[criticism of Christianity|critics]] and recommended their [[faith]] to outsiders were called [[Christian apologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Apologists |editor1-last=Cross |editor1-first=F.&amp;nbsp;L. |editor1-link=Frank Leslie Cross |work=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |location=New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 21st-century usage, ''apologetics'' is often identified with debates over [[religion]] and [[theology]].

==Etymology==
The term ''apologetics'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''apologia''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the Classical Greek legal system, two key technical terms were employed: the prosecution delivered the ''kategoria'' (κατηγορία), and the defendant replied with an ''apologia''. To deliver an ''apologia'' meant making a formal speech or giving an explanation to reply and rebut the charges, as in the case of [[Socrates]]' [[Apology (Plato)|Apologia]] defense, as chronicled in [[Apology (Plato)|Plato's ''Apology'']] (the defense speech of [[Socrates]] at his trial).  This term appears in the [[Koine Greek]] of the [[New Testament]]. The [[Apostle Paul]] employs the term ''apologia'' in his trial speech to [[Porcius Festus|Festus]] and [[Agrippa I|Agrippa]] when he says "I make my defense" in [[Acts 26]]:2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/26/2/s_1044002|title=Acts 26:2|last=|first=|date=19 September 2016|website=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cognate]] form appears in Paul's [[Letter to the Philippians]] as he is "defending the gospel" in Philippians 1:7,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/phl/1/7/s_1104007|title=Phl 1:7|last=|first=|date=19 September 2016|website=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in "giving an answer" in 1 Peter 3:15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1pe/3/15/s_1154015|title=1Pe 3:15|last=|first=|date=19 September 2016|website=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ''apologetics'' has Western, primarily Christian origins and is most frequently associated with the defense of Christianity, the term is sometimes used referring to the defense of any religion in formal debate involving religion.

== Apologetic positions ==

===Bahá'í===
{{main article|Bahá'í apologetics}}
Many [[Bahá'í literature#Apologia|apologetic books]] have been written in defence of the history or teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. The religion's founders wrote several books presenting proofs of their religion, among them are the [[Báb]]'s ''[[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Dalá'il-i-Sab'ih (The Seven Proofs)|Seven Proofs]]'' and [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]''.&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= apologetics |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |pages= 39–40 |isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Bahá'í authors wrote prominent apologetic texts, such as [[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl]]'s ''The Brilliant Proof'' and [[Udo Schaefer]] et al.'s ''Making the Crooked Straight'';.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/cannuyer_schaefer_desinformation|title=Making the Crooked Straight, by Udo Schaefer, Nicola Towfigh, and Ulrich Gollmer|work=bahai-library.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
One of the earliest Buddhist apologetic texts is ''[[Milinda Panha|The Questions of King Milinda]]'', which deals with the Buddhist metaphysics such as the "no-self" nature of the individual and characteristics such as of wisdom, perception, volition, feeling, consciousness and the soul. In the mid-19th century, encounters between Buddhists and Christians in [[Religion in Japan|Japan]] prompted the formation of a Buddhist Propagation Society {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. In recent times, A.&amp;nbsp;L. De Silva, an Australian convert to [[Buddhism]], has written a book, ''Beyond Belief'', providing Buddhist apologetic responses and a critique of Christian Fundamentalist doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/beyond-belief02.pdf|title=Beyond Belief, a Buddhist Critique of Fundamentalist Christianity|last=De Silva|first=A.&amp;nbsp;L.|publisher=Three Gems Publications, ebook link at Buddha Dharma Education Association Incorporated, also|year=1994|isbn=978-0-6462-1211-1|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunapala Dharmasiri wrote an apologetic critique of the [[God in Christianity|Christian concept of God]] from a [[Theravada|Theravadan Buddhist]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God : a critique of the concept of God in contemporary Christian theology and philosophy of religion from the point of view of early Buddhism|last=Dharmasiri|first=Gunapala|publisher=Colombo : Lake House Investments|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main article|Christian apologetics}}
[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-compact.svg|thumb|260px|The [[Scutum Fidei]], a diagram frequently used by [[Christian]] apologists to explain the [[Trinity]]]]

Christian apologetics combines [[Christian theology]], [[natural theology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/theo-nat/ | title=Natural Theology | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=10 March 2015 | author=Brent, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[philosophy]] to present a rational basis for the Christian faith, to defend the faith against objections and misrepresentation.

Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries. In the [[Roman Empire]], Christians were severely persecuted, and many charges were brought against them. J. David Cassel&lt;ref&gt;J. David Cassel. "Defending the Cannibals: How Christians responded to the sometimes strange accusations of their critics." {{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/1998/issue57/57h012.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821133320/http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/1998/issue57/57h012.html |archivedate=2011-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives several examples: [[Tacitus]] wrote that [[Nero]] fabricated charges that Christians started the [[Great Fire of Rome|burning of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals XV.44&lt;/ref&gt; Other charges included [[cannibalism]] (due to a literal interpretation of the [[Eucharist]]) and [[incest]] (due to early Christians' practice of addressing each other as "brother" and "sister"). [[Saul of Tarsus]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]] and others often defended Christianity against charges that were brought to justify persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christianity.com/church/church-history/timeline/1-300/why-early-christians-were-despised-11629610.html|title=Why Early Christians Were Despised|last=|first=|date=|website=Christianity Today (Church history timeline).|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later apologists have focused on providing reasons to accept various aspects of Christian belief. Christian apologists of many traditions, in common with Jews, Muslims, and some others, argue for the existence of a unique and personal God. [[Theodicy]] is one important aspect of such arguments, and [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s arguments have been highly influential in this area. Many prominent Christian apologists are scholarly philosophers or theologians, frequently with additional doctoral work in [[physics]], [[cosmology]], [[comparative religions]], or other fields. Others take a more popular or pastoral approach. Some prominent modern apologists are [[Douglas Groothuis]], [[Frederick Copleston]], [[John Lennox]], [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter R. Martin]], [[Dinesh D'Souza]], [[Douglas Wilson (theologian)|Douglas Wilson]], [[Cornelius Van Til]], [[Gordon Clark]], [[Francis Schaeffer]], [[Greg Bahnsen]], [[Edward John Carnell]], [[James White (theologian)|James White]], [[R.C. Sproul]], [[Hank Hanegraaff]], [[Ravi Zacharias]], [[Alister McGrath]], [[Lee Strobel]], [[Josh McDowell]], [[Peter Kreeft]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[William Lane Craig]], [[J. P. Moreland]], [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], [[David Bentley Hart]], [[Gary Habermas]], [[Norman Geisler]] and [[Scott Hahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0088.html/ Catholic Education Resource Center: ''The Scott Hahn Conversion Story''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718093548/http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0088.html/ |date=July 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable apologists within the [[Catholic Church]] include [[Robert Barron (bishop)|Bishop Robert Barron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordonfire.org/about/fr-robert-barron/|title=Page Not Found - Word On Fire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[G. K. Chesterton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Everlasting Man|last=Chesterton|first=G K|publisher=Wilder Publications|year=2008|isbn=160459246X|location=Radford|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Hahn|Dr. Scott Hahn]], [[Patrick Madrid]], Kenneth Hensley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicapologeticsacademy.com/faculty/kenneth-hensley/|title=Kenneth Hensley - Catholic Apologetics Academy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Keating]], [[Ronald Knox]], [[Peter Kreeft]], and Gus Loyd.

[[John Henry Newman]] (February 21, 1801 – August 11, 1890) was an English convert to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], later made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and [[beatified]] in 2010. In early life he was a major figure in the [[Oxford Movement]] to bring the [[Church of England]] back to its Catholic roots.  Eventually his studies in history persuaded him to become a Roman Catholic. When John Henry Newman entitled his spiritual autobiography ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' in 1864, he was playing upon both this connotation, and the more commonly understood meaning of an expression of contrition or regret.

Christian apologists employ a variety of philosophical and formal approaches, including [[Ontological argument|ontological]], [[Cosmological argument|cosmological]], and [[teleological argument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bethinking.org/apologetics/an-introduction-to-christian-apologetics?Strongs=G627|title=An Introduction to Christian Apologetics|last=Coulter|first=Paul|date=|website=Bethinking|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian presuppositionalist approach to apologetics utilizes the [[transcendental argument for the existence of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Apologetics: A Justification of Christian Belief
John Frame-Joseph Torres - P&amp;R Publishing - 2015 p. 67f&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tertullian]] was a notable early [[Christian]] apologist. He was born, lived and died in [[Carthage]]. He is sometimes known as the "Father of the [[Latin Church]]". He introduced the term ''[[Trinity]]'' ([[Latin]] ''trinitas'') to the Christian vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Christian Thought'', [[Paul Tillich]], Touchstone Books, 1972. {{ISBN|0-671-21426-8}} (p. 43)&lt;/ref&gt; and also probably{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} the formula "three Persons, one Substance" as the Latin "tres [[Persona]]e, [[Consubstantial|una Substantia]]" (itself from the [[Koine Greek]] "treis [[Hypostasis (religion)|Hypostaseis]], [[Ousios|Homoousios]]"), and also the terms ''Vetus Testamentum'' ([[Old Testament]]) and ''Novum Testamentum'' ([[New Testament]]).

There are notable Latter-day Saint apologists who focus on the defense of [[Mormonism]], including early church leaders such as [[Parley P. Pratt]], [[John Taylor (1808-1887)|John Taylor]], [[B.&amp;nbsp;H. Roberts]], [[James E. Talmage]] and more modern figures such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]].

Several well-known Mormon apologetic organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (a group of scholars at [[Brigham Young University]]) and [[FairMormon]] (an independent, Mormon-run, not-for-profit group), have been formed to defend the doctrines and history of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] in general and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in particular.

=== Deism ===
[[Deism]] is a form of [[theism]] in which God created the universe and established rationally comprehensible moral and natural laws but no longer intervenes in human affairs. Deism is a [[natural religion]] where belief in God is based on application of reason and evidence observed in the designs and laws found in nature.&lt;sup&gt;[[Criticism of atheism#cite note-12|[12]]]&lt;/sup&gt;  The World Order of Deists maintains a web site presenting deist apologetics that demonstrate the existence of God based on evidence and reason, absent divine revelation.

===Hinduism===
Hindu apologetics began developing during the British colonial period.  A number of Indian intellectuals had become critical of the British tendency to devalue the Hindu religious tradition. As a result, these Indian intellectuals, as well as a handful of British [[Indology|Indologists]], were galvanized to examine the roots of the religion as well as to study its vast arcana and corpus in an analytical fashion. This endeavor drove the deciphering and preservation of [[Sanskrit]]. Many translations of Hindu texts were produced which made them accessible to a broader reading audience.

A range of Indian philosophers, including [[Swami Vivekananda]] and [[Aurobindo Ghose]], have written rational explanations regarding the values of the Hindu religious tradition. More modern proponents such as the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] have also tried to correlate recent developments from [[quantum physics]] and [[consciousness]] research with Hindu concepts. The late Reverend [[Pandurang Shastri Athavale]] has given a plethora of discourses regarding the symbolism and rational basis for many principles in the [[Veda|Vedic tradition]]. In his book ''The Cradle of Civilization'', David Frawley, an American who has embraced the Vedic tradition, has characterized the ancient texts of the Hindu heritage as being like "pyramids of the spirit". [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] translated over sixty volumes of classic Vedic scriptures including the biography and conclusions of the famous 16th century bhakti scholar [[Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]; many of these translations and commentaries have been further translated into as many as eighty languages, producing over half a billion books distributed throughout the world. Such individuals have tried to construct an intellectual defense of [[Hinduism]] during a phase when the [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalistic]] elements of other faiths have sought to denigrate the ancient religion in an effort to gain converts.

===Islam===
''Ilm al-Kalām'', literally "science of discourse",&lt;ref name="Wolfson"&gt;Winter, Tim J. "Introduction." Introduction. The Cambridge Companion to Classical Islamic Theology. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2008. 4–5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; usually foreshortened to ''[[kalam]]'' and sometimes called ''Islamic scholastic theology'', is an Islamic undertaking born out of the need to establish and defend the tenets of Islamic faith against doubters and detractors.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Pelner Cosman, Linda Gale Jones, Handbook to Life in the Medieval World, p 391. {{ISBN|1438109075}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scholar of ''kalam'' is referred to as a ''mutakallim'' (plural ''mutakallimūn'') as distinguished from philosophers, jurists, and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Bennett, The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies, p 119. {{ISBN|1441127887}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{See also|Jewish polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages}}
Jewish apologetic literature can be traced back as far as [[Aristobulus of Paneas]], though some discern it in the works of [[Demetrius the chronographer]] (3rd century BCE) traces of the style of "questions" and "solutions" typical of the genre. Aristobulus was a Jewish philosopher of [[Alexandria]] and the author of an apologetic work addressed to [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]]. [[Josephus]]'s [[Contra Apion]] is a wide-ranging defense of [[Judaism]] against many charges laid against Judaism at that time, as too are some of the works of [[Philo of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;John Granger Cook (2000) ''The Interpretation of the New Testament in Greco-Roman paganism'' p.4., Mohr Siebeck Verlag, Tuebingen, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1651-apologists|title=APOLOGISTS|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to modern Christian missionaries, and congregations that "are designed to appear Jewish, but are actually fundamentalist Christian churches, which use traditional Jewish symbols to lure the most vulnerable of our Jewish people into their ranks",&lt;ref name=Schoon2006p125&gt;Simon Schoon, "Noachides and Converts to Judaism", in [[Jan N. Bremmer]], [[Wout van Bekkum|Wout Jac. van Bekkum]], Arie L. Molendijk.

[[Kiruv Organisation]], founded by Rabbi Yosef Mizrachi, and Outreach Judaism, founded by Rabbi [[Tovia Singer]], are other prominent international organizations that respond "directly to the issues raised by missionaries and cults, by exploring Judaism in contradistinction to fundamentalist Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outreachjudaism.org/about_us.html About Us], Outreach Judaism website. Accessed January 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton]], "The Modern Anti-Cult Movement in Historical Perspective", in Jeffrey Kaplan, Heléne Lööw.

===Pantheism===
Some pantheists have formed organizations such as the [[World Pantheist Movement]] and the [[Universal Pantheist Society]] to promote and defend the belief in [[pantheism]].&lt;ref name=Credo&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheist Credo|url=http://www.pantheism.net/manifest.htm|publisher=World Pantheist Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Americans===
In a famous speech called "Red Jacket on Religion for the White Man and the Red" in 1805, [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]] chief [[Red Jacket]] gave an apologetic for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/8/3.html#txt1|title=Red Jacket on the Religion of the White Man and the Red by Red Jacket.

== In literature ==
Plato's ''Apology'' may be read as both a religious and literary apology; however, more specifically literary examples may be found in the [[preface]]s and [[dedication]]s, which proceed many [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] plays, novels, and poems. Eighteenth century authors such as [[Colley Cibber]], [[Frances Burney]], and [[William Congreve]], to name but a few, prefaced the majority of their poetic work with such apologies. In addition to the desire to defend their work, the apologetic preface often suggests the author's attempt to humble his- or herself before the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30105/apology|title=Apology|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|work=Britannica Academic Edition|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bioreporter.jpg|thumb|361px|right|'''Anatomy of a bioreporter organism.''' Upon exposure to a specific analyte, the promoter/reporter gene complex is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translated into a reporter protein that is ultimately responsible for generating a signal.]]

'''Bioreporters''' are intact, living [[microbial]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that have been [[genetically engineered]] to produce a measurable signal in response to a specific chemical or physical agent in their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].  Bioreporters contain two essential genetic elements, a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] gene and a [[reporter gene]].  The promoter gene is turned on ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]) when the target agent is present in the cell’s environment.  The promoter gene in a normal bacterial cell is linked to other genes that are then likewise transcribed and then translated into proteins that help the cell in either combating or adapting to the agent to which it has been exposed.  In the case of a bioreporter, these genes, or portions thereof, have been removed and replaced with a reporter gene.  Consequently, turning on the promoter gene now causes the reporter gene to be turned on.  Activation of the reporter gene leads to production of reporter [[proteins]] that ultimately generate some type of a detectable signal.  Therefore, the presence of a signal indicates that the bioreporter has sensed a particular target agent in its environment.

Originally developed for fundamental analysis of factors affecting [[gene expression]], bioreporters were early on applied for the detection of environmental contaminants&lt;ref&gt;King, J.M.H. et al. (1990) Rapid, sensitive bioluminescence reporter technology for naphthalene exposure and biodegradation. Science 249, 778-781.http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/249/4970/778?ck=nck&lt;/ref&gt; and have since evolved into fields as diverse as [[medical diagnosis|medical diagnostics]], [[precision agriculture]], [[food safety]] assurance, process monitoring and control, and bio-[[microelectronic]] computing.  Their versatility stems from the fact that there exist a large number of [[reporter gene]] systems that are capable of generating a variety of signals.  Additionally, reporter genes can be genetically inserted into [[bacterial]], [[yeast]], [[plant]], and [[mammalian]] cells, thereby providing considerable functionality over a wide range of host vectors.

==Reporter gene systems==

Several types of reporter genes are available for use in the construction of bioreporter organisms, and the signals they generate can usually be categorized as either [[colorimetric]], [[fluorescent]], [[luminescent]], [[chemiluminescent]] or [[electrochemical]].  Although each functions differently, their end product always remains the same – a measurable signal that is proportional to the concentration of the unique chemical or physical agent to which they have been exposed.  In some instances, the signal only occurs when a secondary [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] is added to the [[bioassay]] (''luxAB'', Luc, and aequorin).  For other bioreporters, the signal must be activated by an external light source (GFP and UMT), and for a select few bioreporters, the signal is completely self-induced, with no exogenous substrate or external activation being required (''luxCDABE'').  The following sections outline in brief some of the reporter gene systems available and their existing applications.

===Bacterial luciferase (Lux)===

[[Image:Biolumplate.jpg|thumb|180px|right| Bioluminescence emitted from colonies of microbial cells containing the genes for bacterial luciferase.]]

[[Luciferase]] is a generic name for an [[enzyme]] that [[catalyzes]] a light-emitting reaction.  Luciferases can be found in bacteria, algae, fungi, jellyfish, insects, shrimp, and squid, and the resulting light that these organisms produce is termed bioluminescence.  In bacteria, the genes responsible for the light-emitting reaction (the ''lux'' genes) have been isolated and used extensively in the construction of bioreporters that emit a blue-green light with a maximum intensity at 490&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;Meighen, E.A. (1994) Genetics of bacterial bioluminescence. Annu. Rev. Genet. 28, 117-139. http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ge.28.120194.001001&lt;/ref&gt;  Three variants of ''lux'' are available, one that functions at &lt; 30°C, another at &lt; 37°C, and a third at &lt; 45°C.  The ''lux'' genetic system consists of five genes, ''luxA'', ''luxB'', ''luxC'', ''luxD'', and ''luxE''.  Depending on the combination of these genes used, several different types of [[bioluminescent]] bioreporters can be constructed.

===''luxAB'' Bioreporters===

''luxAB'' bioreporters contain only the ''luxA'' and ''luxB'' genes, which together are responsible for generating the light signal.  However, to fully complete the light-emitting reaction, a [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] must be supplied to the cell.  Typically, this occurs through the addition of the chemical [[decanal]] at some point during the bioassay procedure.  Numerous ''luxAB'' bioreporters have been constructed within bacterial, yeast, insect, nematode, plant, and mammalian cell systems.

===''luxCDABE'' Bioreporters===

Instead of containing only the ''luxA'' and ''luxB'' genes, bioreporters can contain all five [[genes]] of the ''lux'' cassette, thereby allowing for a completely independent light generating system that requires no extraneous additions of substrate nor any [[Excited state|excitation]] by an external light source.  So in this bioassay, the bioreporter is simply exposed to a target [[analyte]] and a [[quantitative property|quantitative]] increase in bioluminescence results, often within less than one hour.  Due to their rapidity and ease of use, along with the ability to perform the bioassay repetitively in [[real-time data|real time]] and on-line, makes ''luxCDABE'' bioreporters extremely attractive.  Consequently, they have been incorporated into a diverse array of detection methodologies ranging from the sensing of environmental contaminants to the real-time monitoring of pathogen infections in living mice.

===Nonspecific ''lux'' Bioreporters===

Nonspecific ''lux'' bioreporters are typically used for the detection of chemical toxins.  They are usually designed to continuously bioluminesce.  Upon exposure to a chemical toxin, either the cell dies or its metabolic activity is retarded, leading to a decrease in [[bioluminescent]] light levels.  Their most familiar application is in the Microtox [http://www.modernwater.co.uk/monitoring/toxicity/] assay where, following a short exposure to several concentrations of the sample, the decreased [[bioluminescence]] can be correlated to relative levels of [[toxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermens, J. et al. (1985) Quantitative structure-activity relationships and mixture toxicity of organic chemicals in Photobacterium phosphoreum: the Microtox test. Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf. 9, 17-25. http://www.springerlink.com/content/m67248753tkj1111/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firefly luciferase (Luc)===

[[Firefly luciferase]] catalyzes a reaction that produces visible light in the 550 – 575&amp;nbsp;nm range.  A click-beetle luciferase is also available that produces light at a peak closer to 595&amp;nbsp;nm.  Both luciferases require the addition of an exogenous substrate (luciferin) for the light reaction to occur.  Numerous ''luc''-based bioreporters have been constructed for the detection of a wide array of [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] and [[organic compound]]s of environmental concern.  The most promising applications, however, probably rely on introducing the genetic code of the firefly luciferase into other eukaryotic cells and tissues. 

====Medical diagnostics====
Insertion of the ''luc'' genes into a human cervical carcinoma cell line ([[HeLa]]) illustrated that tumor-cell clearance could be visualized within a living mouse by simply scanning with a charge-coupled device camera, allowing for [[chemotherapy]] treatment to rapidly be monitored on-line and in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;Contag, C.H. et al. (2000) Use of reporter genes for optical measurements of neoplastic disease in vivo. Neoplasia 2 (1-2), 41-52. http://neoreviews.aappublications.org/cgi/content/extract/1/12/e225&lt;/ref&gt;  In another example, the ''luc'' genes were inserted into human breast cancer cell lines to develop a bioassay for the detection and measurement of substances with potential [[estrogenic]] and antiestrogenic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Legler, J. et al. (1999) Development of a stably transfected estrogen receptor-mediated luciferase reporter gene assay in the human T47D breast cancer cell line. Toxicol. Sci. 48 (1), 55-66. http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/48/1/55&lt;/ref&gt;

====Research on gene regulation====
Particular [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] can be placed upstream of the ''luc'' gene, that is, the ''luc'' sequence can be fused to the promoter sequence at DNA level. If such construct is not too large in size, it can simply be introduced into eukaryotic cells using [[plasmids]]. This approach is widely used to study the activity of a given promoter in a given cell/tissue type, since the amount of light produced by the luciferase is directly proportional to the promoter activity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovács KA, Steinmann M, Halfon O, Magistretti PJ, Cardinaux JR | title = C/EBPbeta couples dopamine signalling to substance P precursor gene expression in striatal neurones. | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 98 | issue = 5 | pages = 1390-9 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16771829 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03957.x  }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to studying the promoters, firefly luciferase assays offer the option of studying [[transcriptional activators]]: in these experiments typically the [[GAL4/UAS_system]] is used and its Gal4 upstream activating DNA sequence (UAS) is placed upstream the ''luc'' gene while the different activators or the different variants/fragments of the same activator are fused to the GAL4 DNA binding module at protein level. This way the transcriptional activity of the different GAL4 fusion proteins can be directly compared using light as a readout. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovács KA, Steinmann M, Halfon O, Magistretti PJ, Cardinaux JR | title = Complex regulation of CREB-binding protein by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 | journal = Cellular Signalling | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 2252–60 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26247811 | doi = 10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.08.001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Aequorin===

[[Aequorin]] is a photoprotein isolated from the bioluminescent jellyfish ''[[Aequorea victoria]]''.  Upon addition of [[calcium]] ions (Ca2+) and coelenterazine, a reaction occurs whose end result is the generation of blue light in the 460 - 470&amp;nbsp;nm range.  Aequorin has been incorporated into human [[B cell]] lines for the detection of [[pathogenic]] bacteria and viruses in what is referred to as the [[Cell CANARY]] assay (Cellular Analysis and Notification of Antigen Risks and Yields).&lt;ref&gt;Rider, T. et al. (1999) In NASA/NCI Biomedical Imaging Symposium.&lt;/ref&gt;  The B cells are genetically engineered to produce aequorin.  Upon exposure to antigens of different pathogens, the recombinant B cells emit light as a result of activation of an intracellular signaling cascade that releases calcium ions inside the cell.

===Green fluorescent protein (GFP)===

[[Green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) is also a photoprotein isolated and cloned from the jellyfish ''[[Aequorea victoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Misteli, T. and Spector, D.L. (1997) Application of the green fluorescent protein in cell biology and biotechnology. Nat. Biotechnol. 15, 961-964.&lt;/ref&gt;  Variants have also been isolated from the sea pansy ''[[Renilla reniformis]]''.  GFP, like aequorin, produces a blue fluorescent signal, but without the required addition of an exogenous substrate.  All that is required is an [[ultraviolet light]] source to activate the fluorescent properties of the photoprotein.  This ability to autofluoresce makes GFP highly desirable in biosensing assays since it can be used on-line and in to monitor intact, living cells.  Additionally, the ability to alter GFP to produce light emissions besides blue (i.e., cyan, red, and yellow) allows it to be used as a multianalyte detector.  Consequently, GFP has been used extensively in bioreporter constructs within bacterial, yeast, nematode, plant, and mammalian hosts.

===Uroporphyrinogen (urogen) III methyltransferase (UMT)===

[[Uroporphyrinogen (urogen) III methyltransferase]] (UMT) catalyzes a reaction that yields two [[fluorescent]] products which produce a red-orange fluorescence in the 590 - 770&amp;nbsp;nm range when illuminated with [[ultraviolet light]].&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, I. et al. (1995) Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the uroporphyrinogen-III methyltransferase cobA gene of Propionibacterium freudenreichii (shermanii). J. Bacteriol. 177, 1564–1569.http://jb.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/177/6/1564&lt;/ref&gt;  So as with GFP, no addition of exogenous substrates is required.  UMT has been used as a bioreporter for the selection of recombinant [[plasmids]], as a marker for gene [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] in bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells, and for the detection of toxic salts such as [[arsenite]] and [[antimonite]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4305">The '''Buxheim Organ Book''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Buxheimer Orgelbuch'') is a manuscript created around 1460/1470 with 256 original compositions and arrangements for keyboard instruments for the [[Buxheim Charterhouse]] in [[Germany]], in today's district of [[Unterallgäu]]. Most of the composers are anonymous, but some are also known composers of the time (e.g. [[John Dunstable]], [[Guillaume Du Fay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], [[Walter Frye]], [[Conrad Paumann]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/cds/nxs53466.htm|title=Buxheimer Orgelbuch|website=www.medieval.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
[[File:Buxheimer Orgelbuch (f°169r).jpg|alt=Manuscript|thumb|A page from the Buxheim Organ Book as preserved in Bavarian State Library, Munich]]
In addition to arrangements of secular chansons, dances and songs, it contains about fifty pieces of liturgical character and about thirty preludes, in which rhapsodic-figurative and purely chordal parts alternate. The pieces are mostly two- and three-part, but several are four-part.

The research is still at odds with the origins of the Buxheim Organ Book. There are no records of its use, so it can therefore be regarded as a transcript for teaching (or illustration) purposes. Presumably it came from a writer from the southern German area and was in the possession of the Buxheim Charterhouse near [[Memmingen]] from 16th century and until 1883, when it was offered for sale and has been owned by the [[Bavarian State Library]] in [[Munich]] since then. The manuscript is often attributed to [[Conrad Paumann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.553466&amp;catNum=553466&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English#|title=BUXHEIMER ORGELBUCH (DAS), Vol.  1|website=www.naxos.com|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-nr89013017/|title=Paumann, Conrad 1410-1473|last=|first=|date=|website=worldcat.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; because his "Fundamentum organisandi" is included in its entirety. This would mean that the manuscript originates from Munich, since from 1450 until his death in 1473, Paumann worked as a [[Bavaria]]n court organist in Munich. Paumann's "Fundamentum organisandi" is also included in the [[Lochamer-Liederbuch]], compiled around the same time.

The tabular inscription of the Buxheim Organ Book consists of a seven-line system and letters, the so-called "older" German [[organ tablature]].

The '''case method''' is a [[Teaching method|teaching approach]] that uses decision-forcing cases to put students in the role of people who were faced with difficult decisions at some point in the past. It developed during the course of the twentieth-century from its origins in the [[casebook method]] of teaching law pioneered by Harvard legal scholar [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. In sharp contrast to many other teaching methods, the case method requires that instructors refrain from providing their own opinions about the decisions in question.  Rather, the chief task of instructors who use the case method is asking students to devise and defend solutions to the problems presented by each case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&amp;sid=2257175]&lt;/ref&gt;
== Comparison with the casebook method of teaching law ==
The case method evolved from the [[casebook method]], a mode of teaching based on [[Socratic method|Socratic principles]] pioneered at [[Harvard University]] by [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. Like the casebook method the case method calls upon students to take on the role of an actual person faced with a difficult problem.
== Decision-forcing cases ==

A decision-forcing case is a kind of [[Decision Game | decision game]].  Like any other kinds of decision games, a decision-forcing case puts students in a role of person faced with a problem (often called the "protagonist") and asks them to devise, defend, discuss, and refine solutions to that problem.  However, in sharp contrast to decision games that contain fictional elements, decision-forcing cases are based entirely upon reliable descriptions of real events.

A decision-forcing case is also a kind of case study.  That is, it is an examination of an incident that took place at some time in the past.  However, in contrast to a retrospective case study, which provides a complete description of the events in question, a decision-forcing case is based upon an "interrupted narrative."  This is an account that stops whenever the protagonist finds himself faced with an important decision.  In other words, while retrospective case studies ask students to analyze past decisions with the aid of hindsight, decision-forcing cases ask students to engage problems prospectively. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/degree-programs/teaching/Contributed-Case-Packet.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms of decision-forcing cases ==
In recent years, following corporate scandals and the global financial crisis, the case method has been criticized for contributing to a narrow, instrumental, amoral, managerial perspective on business where making decisions which maximise profit is all that matters, ignoring the social responsibilities of organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridgman|first1=Todd|title=Beyond the Manager’s Moral Dilemma: Rethinking the ‘Ideal Type’ Business Ethics Case|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=2010|volume=94|page=311-322|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0759-3|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0759-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that the case method puts too much emphasis on taking action and not enough on thoughtful reflection to see things from different perspectives. It has been suggested that different approaches to case writing, that do not put students in the ‘shoes’ of a manager, be encouraged to address these concerns. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bridgman|first=Todd|last2=Cummings|first2=Stephen|last3=McLaughlin|first3=Colm|date=2016-12-01|title=Restating the Case: How Revisiting the Development of the Case Method Can Help Us Think Differently About the Future of the Business School|url=http://amle.aom.org/content/15/4/724|journal=Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=724–741|doi=10.5465/amle.2015.0291|issn=1537-260X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role play ==

Every decision-forcing case has a protagonist, the historical person who was faced with the problem or problem that students are asked to solve.  Thus, in engaging these problems, students necessarily engage in some degree of role play.

Some case teachers, such as those of the Marine Corps University, place a great deal of emphasis on role play, to the point of addressing each student with the name and titles of the protagonist of the case.  (A student playing the role of a king, for example, is asked "Your Majesty, what are your orders?")  Other case teachers, such as those at the Harvard Business School, place less emphasis on role play, asking students "what would you do if you were the protagonist of the case."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbs.edu/teaching/case-method-in-practice/leading-in-the-classroom/openings.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical solution ==

After discussing student solutions to the problem at the heart of a decision-forcing case, a case teacher will often provide a description of the historical solution, that is, the decision made by the protagonist of the case.  Also known as "the rest of the story", "the epilogue", or (particularly at Harvard University) "the 'B' case", the description of the historical solution can take the form of a printed article, a video, a slide presentation, a short lecture, or even an appearance by the protagonist.

Whatever the form of the description of the historical solution, the case teacher must take care to avoid giving the impression that the historical solution is the "right answer."  Rather, he should point out that the historical solution to the problem serves primarily to provide students with a baseline to which they can compare their own solutions.

Some case teachers will refrain from providing the historical solution to students.  One reason for not providing the historical solution is to encourage students to do their own research about the outcome of the case.  Another is to encourage students to think about the decision after the end of the class discussion. "Analytic and problem-solving learning," writes Kirsten Lundgren of Columbia University, "can be all the more powerful when the 'what happened' is left unanswered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://casestudies.jrn.columbia.edu/casestudy/www/case_method.asp?nid%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009025732/https://casestudies.jrn.columbia.edu/casestudy/www/case_method.asp?nid=3 |archivedate=2014-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complex cases ==

A classic decision-forcing case asks students to solve a single problem faced by a single protagonist at a particular time.  There are, however, decision-forcing cases in which students play the role of a single protagonist who is faced with a series of problems, two or more protagonists dealing with the same problem, or two or more protagonists dealing with two or more related problems.

== Decision-forcing staff rides ==

A decision-forcing case conducted in the place where the historical decisions at the heart of the case were made is called a "decision-forcing staff ride."  Also known as an "on-site decision-forcing case", a decision-forcing staff ride should not be confused with the two very different exercises that are also known as "[[staff ride |staff rides]]": retrospective battlefield tours of the type practiced by the United States Army in the twentieth century and the on-site contingency planning exercises (Stabs Reisen, literally "staff journeys") introduced by [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]] in 1801 and made famous by [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder | the elder Hellmuth von Moltke]] in the middle years of the nineteenth century.

To avoid confusion between "decision-forcing staff rides" and staff rides of other sorts, the Case Method Project at the [[Marine Corps University]] in Quantico, Virginia, has adopted the term "Russell Ride" to describe the decision-forcing staff rides that it conducts.  The term is an homage to Major General[[John Henry Russell Jr.]],USMC, the 16th [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]] and an avid supporter of the applicatory method of instruction. &lt;ref&gt;[http://onsitetoughcase.blogspot.com/2015/11/decision-forcing-staff-ride.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Sandwich metaphors ==

Decision-forcing cases are sometimes described with a system of metaphors that compares them to various types of sandwiches.  In this system, pieces of bread serve as a metaphor for narrative elements (i.e. the start, continuation, or end of an account) and filling of the sandwich serves as a metaphor for a problem that students are asked to solve.

A decision-forcing case in which one protagonist is faced with two problems is thus a "triple-decker case."  (The bottom piece of bread is the background to the first problem, the second piece of bread is both the historical solution to the first problem and the background to the second problem, and the third piece of bread is the historical solution to the second problem.) Similarly, a decision-forcing case for which the historical solution is not provided (and is thus a case with but one narrative element) is an [[Open sandwich|"open-face"]] or [[Open sandwich|"smørrebrød"]] case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://casemethodusmc.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-sandwich-metaphor.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  

A decision-forcing case in which students are asked to play the role of a decision-maker who is faced with a series of decisions is sometimes called a [[White Castle (restaurant)|"White Castle"]] or [[Slider (sandwich)|"slider"]] case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://casemethodusmc.blogspot.com/2014/10/white-castle-cases.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case materials ==

Case materials are any materials that are used to inform the decisions made by students in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Commonly used case materials include articles that were composed for the explicit purpose of informing case discussion, secondary works initially produced for other purposes, historical documents, artifacts, video programs, and audio programs.

Case materials are made available to students at a variety times in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Materials that provide background are distributed at, or before, the beginning of the class meeting.  Materials that describe the solution arrived at by the protagonist and the results of that solution are passed out at, or after, the end of the class meeting. (These are called "the B-case", "the rest of the story", or "the reveal.")  Materials that provide information that became available to the protagonist in the course of solving the problem are given to students in the course of a class meeting.  (These are often referred to as "handouts.") &lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&amp;sid=4468541]&lt;/ref&gt;

Case materials may be either "refined" or "raw." Refined case materials are secondary works that were composed expressly for use as part of decision-forcing cases. (Most of the case materials that are available from case clearing houses and academic publishers are of the refined variety.) Raw case materials are those that were initially produced for reasons other than the informing of a case discussion. These include newspaper articles, video and audio news reports, historical documents, memoirs, interviews, and artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://som.yale.edu/our-programs/full-time-mba/curriculum/raw-case-approach]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Published case materials ==

A number of organizations, to include case clearing houses, academic publishers, and professional schools, publish case materials.  These organizations include:

* Globalens at the [[University of Michigan]]
* [[Harvard Business School]]
* [[Nagoya University of Commerce &amp; Business]]
* [[Darden School]] at the [[University of Virginia]]
* [[Asian Institute of Management]]
* [[Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad]]
* Asian Case Research Centre at the [[University of Hong Kong]]

==The narrative fallacy==

The presentation of a decision-forcing case necessarily takes the form of a story in which the protagonist is faced with a difficult problem.  This can lead to "the narrative fallacy", a mistake that leads both case teachers and the developers of case materials to ignore information that, while important to the decision that students will be asked to make, complicates the telling of the story.  This, in turn, can create a situation in which, rather than engaging the problem at the heart of the case, students "parse the case materials."  That is, they make decisions on the basis of the literary structure of the case materials rather than the underlying reality. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-01-23/the-case-against-case-studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques for avoiding the narrative fallacy include the avoidance of standard formats for case materials;  awareness of tropes and clichés; the use of case materials originally created for purposes other than case teaching; and the deliberate inclusion of "distractors" - information that is misleading, irrelevant, or at odds with other information presented in the case.

==Purpose of the case method==

The case method gives students the ability to quickly make sense of a complex problem, rapidly arrive at a reasonable solution, and communicate that solution to others in a succinct and effective manner. In the course of doing this, the case method also accomplishes a number of other things, each of which is valuable in its own right.  By exciting the interest of students, the case method fosters interest in professional matters.  By placing such things in a lively context, the case method facilitates the learning of facts, nomenclature, conventions, techniques, and procedures.  By providing both a forum for discussion and concrete topics to discuss, the case method encourages professional dialogue.  By providing challenging practice in the art of decision-making, the case method refines professional judgement.  By asking difficult questions, the case method empowers students to reflect upon the peculiar demands of their profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/loader.php?type=d&amp;id=1246140]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his classic essay on the case method ("Because Wisdom Can't Be Told"), Charles I. Gragg of the Harvard Business School argued that "the case system, properly used, initiates students into the ways of independent thought and responsible judgement."  &lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/BUSINESS304/Because+wisdom+can't+be+told+-+1940]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incompatible objectives==

While the case method can be used to accomplish a wide variety of goals, certain objectives are at odds with its nature as an exercise in professional judgement.  These incompatible objectives include attempts to use decision-forcing cases to:

* provide an example to be emulated 
* paint a particular person as a hero or a villain 
* encourage (or discourage) a particularly type of behavior 
* illustrate a pre-existing theory 

Thomas W. Shreeve, who uses the case method to teach people in the field of military intelligence, argues that "Cases are not meant to illustrate either the effective or the ineffective handling of administrative, operational, logistic, ethical, or other problems, and the characters in cases should not be portrayed either as paragons of virtue or as archvillains. The instructor/casewriter must be careful not to tell the students what to think—they are not empty vessels waiting to be filled with wisdom. With this method of teaching, a major share of the responsibility for thinking critically about the issues under discussion is shifted to the students, where it belongs." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ni-u.edu/ni_press/pdf/Experiences_to_Go.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disclaimers==

Case materials are often emblazoned with a disclaimer that warns both teachers and students to avoid the didactic, hortatory, and "best practices" fallacies.  Here are some examples of such disclaimers:


''&lt;div style="text-indent: 2em"&gt;This case is intended to serve as the basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either the effective or ineffective handling of a situation.&lt;/div&gt;


''&lt;div style="text-indent: 2em"&gt;This decision-forcing case is an exercise designed to foster empathy, creativity, a bias for action, and other martial virtues.  As such, it makes no argument for the effectiveness of any particular course of action, technique, procedure, or convention. &lt;/div&gt;''


''&lt;div style="text-indent: 2em&gt;This case is intended to serve as the basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either the effective or ineffective handling of a situation. Its purpose is to put the student in the shoes of the decision-maker in order to gain a fuller understanding of the situations and the decisions made.&lt;/div&gt;''

== Use of the case method in professional schools ==

The case method is used in a variety of professional schools.  These include the:

The '''Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors''' or '''ICES''' is a  professional association in the field of civil engineering surveying. ICES is now recognised as the leading chartered professional body for civil engineering surveyors. ICES members consist mainly of commercial managers and [[geospatial engineering|geospatial engineers]] working and studying within [[civil engineering]] surveying. The institution began in 1969 as the Association of Surveyors in Civil Engineering and became a registered educational charity in 1992. In 1992, ICES became the first associated institution of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) and together formed two joint boards to provide and disseminate surveying knowledge and expertise; the Geospatial Engineering Board and Commercial Management Board. ICES also has reciprocal membership agreements in place with the ICE.

== International recognition ==
ICES is an internationally recognised qualifying body established to regulate, educate and train surveyors working within civil engineering. The headquarters are in the United Kingdom, with 11 regions consisting of volunteer-led committee members. ICES regions include  the UK, Ireland, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates. ICES also has memoranda of understandings agreements with many international surveying institutions and is a member of the [[International Federation of Surveyors|International Federation of Surveyors (FIG)]].

== Membership ==
Applicants for membership must demonstrate that they have fulfilled the institution's competency requirements and the general competencies plus at least one specialism must be met with and signed off by a sponsor.

Members may use designations after their names such as:
*FCInstCES for Fellow of the Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors, Chartered Civil Engineering Surveyor.
*MCInstCES for Member of the Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors, Chartered Civil Engineering Surveyor.
*TCInstCES for Technical Member of the Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors
*GCInstCES for Graduate Member of the Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors

[[File:Webcomic xkcd - Wikipedian protester.png|thumb|right|250px|[[xkcd]] webcomic titled "Wikipedian Protester"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://xkcd.com/285/ |title= Wikipedian Protestor|author= Randall Munroe |accessdate= 20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''citation''' is a [[reference]] to a [[Publishing|published]] or unpublished source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/citation|title=Definition of CITATION|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of [[microattribution]].

Citations have several important purposes: to uphold [[intellectual honesty]] (or avoiding [[plagiarism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Does it Mean to Cite?| publisher=MIT Academic Integrity|url=https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/citing-your-sources/avoiding-plagiarism-cite-your-source}}&lt;/ref&gt; to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources, to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the author's argument in the claimed way, and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Legal Writing Directors &amp; Darby Dickerson, ''ALWD Citation Manual: A Professional System of Citation,'' 4th ed.(New York: Aspen, 2010), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As Roark and Emerson have argued, citations relate to the way authors perceive the substance of their work, their position in the academic system, and the moral equivalency of their place, substance, and words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Signals |ssrn=2688685 |date=2015-11-10 |location=Rochester, N.Y. |first=Marc Lane |last=Roark |first2=Warren |last2=Emerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these attributes, many drawbacks and shortcoming of citation practices have been reported, including for example honorary citations, circumstantial citations, discriminatory citations, selective and arbitrary citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moustafa|first=Khaled|date=2016|year=|title=Aberration of the Citation|journal=Accountability in Research|volume=23|issue=4|pages=230–244|doi=10.1080/08989621.2015.1127763|issn=1545-5815|pmid=26636372|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems, such as the Oxford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lc.unsw.edu.au/onlib/refbib.html |title=Oxford Referencing System |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard, MLA, [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), and other citations systems, because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers. Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use.

Bibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgement by other authors of the priority of one's ideas.

== Concept ==
A '''bibliographic citation''' is a reference to a [[book]], [[article (publishing)|article]], [[web page]], or other published item. Citations should supply detail to identify the item uniquely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |title=Library glossary |accessdate=2009-02-27 |date=August 22, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Benedictine University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430220849/http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different citation systems and styles are used in [[scientific citation]], [[legal citation]], [[prior art]], [[the arts]], and the [[humanities]].

== Content ==
Citation content can vary depending on the type of source and may include:
*''Book:'' author(s), book title, place of publication, publisher, date of publication, and page number(s) if appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workbook/evaluate.htm#citing |title=Anatomy of a Citation |work=LIU.edu |accessdate=2015-09-28 |ref=refLongIslandUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Journal:'' author(s), article title, journal title, date of publication, and page number(s).
*''Newspaper:'' author(s), article title, name of newspaper, section title and page number(s) if desired, date of publication.
*''Web site:'' author(s), article and publication title where appropriate, as well as a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], and a date when the site was accessed.
*''Play:'' inline citations offer part, scene, and line numbers, the latter separated by periods: 4.452 refers to scene 4, line 452. For example, "In Eugene Onegin, Onegin rejects Tanya when she is free to be his, and only decides he wants her when she is already married" (Pushkin 4.452–53).&lt;ref name=Brigham&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |title=How to cite sources in the body of your paper |work=BYUI.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |ref=refBrigham |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113174823/http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Poem:'' spaced [[Slash (punctuation)#In English text|slashes]] are normally used to indicate separate lines of a poem, and [[Parenthetical referencing|parenthetical citations]] usually include the line number(s). For example: "For I must love because I live&amp;nbsp;/ And life in me is what you give." (Brennan, lines 15–16).&lt;ref name=Brigham/&gt;
*''Interview:'' name of interviewer, interview descriptor (ex. personal interview) and date of interview.

=== Unique identifiers ===
Along with information such as author(s), date of publication, title and page numbers, citations may also include [[unique identifier]]s depending on the type of work being referred to.
* Citations of books may include an [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN).
* Specific volumes, articles or other identifiable parts of a periodical, may have an associated [[Serial Item and Contribution Identifier]] (SICI) or an [[International Standard Serial Number]] (ISSN).
* Electronic documents may have a [[digital object identifier]] (DOI).
* Biomedical research articles may have a PubMed Identifier ([[PMID]]).

== Systems ==
Broadly speaking, there are two types of citation systems, the Vancouver system and parenthetical referencing.&lt;ref name="Neville2012"&gt;Neville, C. (2012). Referencing: Principles, practices and problems. In RGUHS Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Vol 2:2. pp. 1-8&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE) adds a third, the'' citation-name system''.&lt;ref name="council2006scientific"&gt;Council of Science Editors, Style Manual Committee (2007). Scientific style and format: the CSE manual for authors, editors, and publishers.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vancouver system ===
{{main|Vancouver system}}
The Vancouver system uses sequential numbers in the text, either bracketed or superscript or both.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt; The numbers refer to either footnotes (notes at the end of the page) or endnotes (notes on a page at the end of the paper) that provide source detail. The notes system may or may not require a full bibliography, depending on whether the writer has used a full-note form or a shortened-note form.

For example, an excerpt from the text of a paper using a notes system ''without'' a full bibliography could look like:

:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The note, located either at the foot of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) would look like this:

:1. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' (New York: Macmillan, 1969) 45–60.

In a paper with a full bibliography, the shortened note might look like:

:1. Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' 45–60.

The bibliography entry, which is required with a shortened note, would look like this:

:Kübler-Ross, Elisabeth. ''On Death and Dying''. New York: Macmillan, 1969.

In the humanities, many authors also use footnotes or endnotes to supply anecdotal information. In this way, what looks like a citation is actually supplementary material, or suggestions for further reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studenthandouts.com/citations.htm |title=How to Write Research Papers with Citations: MLA, APA, Footnotes, Endnotes |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenthetical referencing ===
{{main|Parenthetical referencing}}
Parenthetical referencing, also known as Harvard referencing, has full or partial, in-text, citations enclosed in circular brackets and embedded in the paragraph.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt;

An example of a parenthetical reference:
:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance" (Kübler-Ross,1969, p 45–60).

Depending on the choice of style, fully cited parenthetical references may require no end section. Other styles include a list of the citations, with complete bibliographical references, in an end section, sorted alphabetically by author. This section is often called "References", "Bibliography", "Works cited" or "Works consulted".

In-text references for online publications may differ from conventional parenthetical referencing. A full reference can be hidden, only displayed when wanted by the reader, in the form of a [[tooltip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://livereference.org Live Reference Initiative]. Retrieved 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This style makes citing easier and improves the reader's experience.

=== Citation-name system ===
Superscripted numbers are inserted at the point of reference, just as in the citation‐sequence system, but the citations are numbered according to the order of cited works at the end of the paper or book; this list is often sorted alphabetically by author.

== Styles ==

Citation styles can be broadly divided into styles common to the Humanities and the Sciences, though there is considerable overlap. Some style guides, such as [[the Chicago Manual of Style]], are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as [[MLA style manual|MLA]] and [[APA style|APA]] styles, specify formats within the context of a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csuchico.edu/lref/newciting.html |title=Citation Formats &amp; Style Manuals |work=CSUChico.edu |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refCaliforniaStateUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=Lesley.edu |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228053242/http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |ref=refLesleyUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=RIT.edu |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refRIT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203115324/http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |archivedate=February 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The various guides thus specify order of appearance, for example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.

A number of organizations have created styles to fit their needs; consequently, a number of different guides exist. Individual publishers often have their own in-house variations as well, and some works are so long-established as to have their own citation methods too: [[Stephanus pagination]] for [[Plato]]; [[Bekker numbers]] for [[Aristotle]]; citing the Bible by book, chapter and verse; or [[Shakespeare]] notation by play.

=== Humanities ===
* The [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] (CMOS) was developed and its guide is ''The Chicago Manual of Style''. It is most widely used in history and economics as well as some social sciences. The closely related [[Turabian]] style—which derives from it—is for student references, and is distinguished from the CMOS by omission of quotation marks in reference lists, and mandatory access date citation.
* The Columbia Style was created by Janice R. Walker and Todd Taylor to give detailed guidelines for citing internet sources. Columbia Style offers models for both the humanities and the sciences.
* ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'' by Elizabeth Shown Mills covers primary sources not included in CMOS, such as censuses, court, land, government, business, and church records. Includes sources in electronic format. Used by genealogists and historians.&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;Elizabeth Shown Mills. ''Evidence Explained : Citing History Sources from Artifacts to cyberspace.'' 2d ed. Baltimore:Genealogical Pub. Co., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harvard referencing]] (or author-date system) is a specific kind of [[parenthetical referencing]]. Parenthetical referencing is recommended by both the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] and the [[Modern Language Association]]. Harvard referencing involves a short author-date reference, e.g., "(Smith, 2000)", being inserted after the cited text within parentheses and the full reference to the source being listed at the end of the article.
* [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]] was developed by the [[Modern Language Association]] and is most often used in [[the arts]] and the [[humanities]], particularly in [[English studies]], other [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], including [[comparative literature]] and [[literary criticism]] in languages other than English ("[[foreign languages]]"), and some [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] studies, such as [[cultural studies]], [[drama]] and [[theatre]], [[film]], and other [[Mass media|media]], including [[television]]. This style of citations and bibliographical format uses [[parenthetical referencing]] with author-page (Smith 395) or author-[short] title-page (Smith, ''Contingencies'' 42) in the case of more than one work by the same author within parentheses in the text, keyed to an alphabetical list of sources on a "Works Cited" page at the end of the paper, as well as notes (footnotes or endnotes). See ''[[The MLA Style Manual]]'' and ''[[The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers]]'', particularly [[The MLA Style Manual#Citation and bibliography format|Citation and bibliography format]].{{efn|The field of [[Communication]] (or Communications) overlaps with some of the disciplines also covered by the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and has its own disciplinary style recommendations for documentation format; the style guide recommended for use in student papers in such departments in American colleges and universities is often ''[[APA style|The Publication Manual of the APA]]'' ([[American Psychological Association]]); designated for short as "[[APA style]]".}}
* The [[MHRA Style Guide]] is published by the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] (MHRA) and most widely used in the arts and humanities in the [[United Kingdom]], where the MHRA is based.  It is available for sale both in the UK and in the [[United States]]. It is similar to [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]], but has some differences.  For example, MHRA style uses footnotes that reference a citation fully while also providing a bibliography.  Some readers find it advantageous that the footnotes provide full citations, instead of shortened references, so that they do not need to consult the bibliography while reading for the rest of the publication details.&lt;ref&gt;The 2nd edition (updated April 2008) of the ''[[MHRA Style Guide]]'' is downloadable for free from the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] official Website.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas of the Humanities, footnotes are used exclusively for references, and their use for conventional [[footnotes]] (explanations or examples) is avoided. In these areas, the term "footnote" is actually used as a synonym for "reference", and care must be taken by editors and typesetters to ensure that they understand how the term is being used by their authors.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Legal citation}}
*The [[Bluebook]] is a citation system traditionally used in American academic legal writing, and the Bluebook (or similar systems derived from it) are used by many courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/ |title=Introduction to Basic Legal Citation (LII 2007 ed.) |work=Cornell.edu |first=Peter W |last=Martin |origyear=1993 |date=May 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-03 |ref=refMartin2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, academic legal articles are always footnoted, but motions submitted to courts and court opinions traditionally use inline citations, which are either separate sentences or separate clauses. Inline citations allow readers to quickly determine the strength of a source based on, for example, the court a case was decided in and the year it was decided.
*The legal citation style used almost universally in Canada is based on the ''Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation'' (AKA ''[[McGill Guide]]''), published by ''McGill Law Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210184155/http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/citeguide.php Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation (Cite Guide)]''. ''McGill Law Journal''. Updated October 2008. Retrieved 2009-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
*British legal citation almost universally follows the ''[[Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities]]'' (OSCOLA).

=== Sciences, mathematics, engineering, physiology, and medicine ===
*The [[American Chemical Society]] style, or [[ACS style]], is often used in [[Chemistry]] and some of the [[physical sciences]]. In ACS style references are numbered in the text and in the reference list, and numbers are repeated throughout the text as needed.
*In the style of the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP style), references are also numbered in the text and in the reference list, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.
*Styles developed for the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS), or AMS styles, such as [[AMS-LaTeX]], are typically implemented using the [[BibTeX]] tool in the [[LaTeX]] typesetting environment. Brackets with author's initials and year are inserted in the text and at the beginning of the reference. Typical citations are listed in-line with alphabetic-label format, e.g. [AB90]. This type of style is also called an "''Authorship trigraph.''"
*The [[Vancouver system]], recommended by the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE), is used in medical and scientific papers and research.
**In one major variant, that used by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), citation numbers are included in the text in square brackets rather than as superscripts. All bibliographical information is exclusively included in the list of references at the end of the document, next to the respective citation number.
**The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) is reportedly the original kernel of this biomedical style, which evolved from the Vancouver 1978 editors' meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icmje.org "Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals"].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]] database uses this citation style and the [[National Library of Medicine]] provides "ICMJE [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] -- Sample References".&lt;ref&gt;International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html "ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals -- Sample References"].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The AMA Style.
*The style of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), or [[IEEE style]], encloses citation numbers within square brackets and numbers them consecutively, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/documents/style_manual.pdf IEEE Style Manual]. Retrieved 2015-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In areas of biology that falls within the [[ICNafp]] (which itself uses this citation style throughout), a variant form of author-title citation is the primary method used when making nomenclatural citations and sometimes general citations (for example in code-related proposals published in ''[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]]''), with the works in question not cited in the bibliography unless also cited in the text. Titles use standardized abbreviations following ''Botanico-Periodicum-Huntianum'' for periodicals and ''Taxonomic Literature 2'' (later [[IPNI]]) for books.
*Pechenik Citation Style is a style described in ''A Short Guide to Writing about Biology'', 6th ed. (2007), by [[Jan Pechenik|Jan A. Pechenik]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/colleges-and-schools/college-of-arts-and-sciences/majors-programs/Biology/Undergraduate_Research/Forms/citation_guide.pdf "Pechenik Citation Style QuickGuide"] ([[PDF]]). [[University of Alberta]], Augustana Campus, Canada. [[World Wide Web|Web]]. November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1955, Eugene Garfield proposed a [[citation index|bibliographic system for scientific literature]], to consolidate the integrity of [[scientific publishing|scientific publications]].&lt;ref name=cisn&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |authorlink= |title=Citation indexes for science. A new dimension in documentation through association of ideas |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=1123–1127 |publisher= |location= |year=2006 |url= |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl189 |id= |pmid=16987841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social sciences ===
* The style of the [[American Psychological Association]], or [[APA style]], published in the [[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association]], is most often used in [[social sciences]]. APA citation style is similar to [[Harvard referencing]], listing the author's name and year of publication, although these can take two forms: ''name citations'' in which the surnames of the authors appear in the text and the year of publication then appears in parentheses, and ''author-date citations'', in which the surnames of the authors and the year of publication all appear in parentheses. In both cases, in-text citations point to an alphabetical list of sources at the end of the paper in a References section.
* The [[American Political Science Association]] publishes both a style manual and a style guide for publications in this field.&lt;ref name=APSA&gt;Stephen Yoder, ed. (2008). ''The APSA Guide to Writing and Publishing'' and ''Style Manual for Political Science''. Rev. ed. August 2006. [http://www.apsanet.org/PUBLICATIONS/Online-Store APSAnet.org Publications]. Retrieved 2015-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The style is close to the CMOS.
* The [[American Anthropological Association]] utilizes a modified form of the [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] laid out in their Publishing Style Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm|title=Publishing Style Guide - Stay Informed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[ASA style]] of [[American Sociological Association]] is one of the main styles used in [[sociological]] publications.

== Issues ==
{{see also|Impact factor#Editorial policies that affect the impact factor}}

In their research on footnotes in scholarly journals in the field of communication, Michael Bugeja and Daniela V. Dimitrova have found that citations to online sources have a rate of decay (as cited pages are taken down), which they call a "half-life", that renders footnotes in those journals less useful for scholarship over time.&lt;ref&gt;Bugeja, Michael and Daniela V. Dimitrova. ''Vanishing Act: The Erosion of Online Footnotes and Implications for Scholarship in the Digital Age''. Duluth, Minnesota: Litwin Books (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experts have found that published replications do not have as many citations as original publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Replications and Extensions in Marketing: Rarely Published But Quite Contrary |author=Raymond Hubbard and J. Scott Armstrong |journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing |volume=11 |pages=233–248 |year=1994 |doi=10.1016/0167-8116(94)90003-5 |issue=3|url=http://cogprints.org/5199/1/Replications-and-Extensions-in-Marketing.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important issue is citation errors, which often occur due to carelessness on either the researcher or journal editor's part in the publication procedure. Experts have found that simple precautions, such as consulting the author of a cited source about proper citations, reduce the likelihood of citation errors and thus increase the quality of research.&lt;ref name="Wright2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Ombudsman: Verification of Citations: Fawlty Towers of Knowledge? |first1=Malcolm |last1=Wright |first2=J.&amp;nbsp;Scott |last2=Armstrong |author2-link=J.

Research suggests the impact of an article can be, partly, explained by superficial factors and not only by the scientific merits of an article.&lt;ref&gt;Bornmann, L., &amp; Daniel, H. D. (2008). What do citation counts measure? A review of studies on citing behavior. Journal of Documentation, 64(1), 45-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Field-dependent factors are usually listed as an issue to be tackled not only when comparison across disciplines are made, but also when different fields of research of one discipline are being compared.&lt;ref&gt;Anauati, Maria Victoria and Galiani, Sebastian and Gálvez, Ramiro H., Quantifying the Life Cycle of Scholarly Articles Across Fields of Economic Research (November 11, 2014). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2523078&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in medicine, among other factors, the number of authors, the number of references, the article length, and the presence of a colon in the title influence the impact; while in sociology the number of references, the article length, and title length are among the factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11192-013-1154-x |first=M. |last=van Wesel |first2=S. |last2=Wyatt |first3=J. |last3=ten Haaf |title=What a difference a colon makes: how superficial factors influence subsequent citation |journal=Scientometrics |issue=3 |volume=98 |pages=1601–1615 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citation patterns are also known to be affected by unethical behavior of both the authors and journal staff. Such behavior is called impact factor boosting, and was reported to involve even the top-tier journals. Specifically the high-ranking journals of medical science, including the Lancet, JAMA and New England Journal of Medicine, are thought to be associated with such behavior, with up to 30% of citations to these journals being generated by commissioned opinion articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.22997 |first=P. |last=Heneberg |title=Parallel Worlds of Citable Documents and Others: Inflated Commissioned Opinion Articles Enhance Scientometric Indicators |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |year=2014 |volume=65 |issue=3 |page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the phenomenon of citation cartels is rising. Citation cartels are defined as groups of authors that cite each other disproportionately more than they do other groups of authors who work on the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fister Jr. | first1 = I. | last2 = Fister | first2 = I. | last3 = Perc | first3 = M.| doi = 10.3389/fphy.2016.00049 | title = Toward the Discovery of Citation Cartels in Citation Networks | journal = Frontiers in Physics | volume = 4 | pages = 49 | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Climate commitment''' describes the fact that [[climate]] reacts with a delay to influencing factors ("[[climate forcing]]s") such as the presence of [[greenhouse gas]]es. Climate commitment studies attempt to assess the amount of future [[global warming]] that is "committed" under the assumption of some constant level of forcings. The constant level often used for illustrative purposes is [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] doubling or quadrupling; or the present level of forcing.

== Basic idea ==
If a [[wiktionary:perturbation|perturbation]] — such as an increase in greenhouse gases or [[solar variation|solar activity]] — is applied to the [[climate system]] the response will not be immediate, principally because of the large [[heat capacity]] (i.e., [[Volumetric heat capacity#Thermal inertia|thermal inertia]]) of the [[ocean]]s. 
:''As an analogue, consider the heating of a thin metal plate (by the sun or by a flame): the plate will warm relatively quickly. If a  thick metal block is heated instead, it will take much longer for the entire block to reach [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] with the imposed heating because of its higher heat capacity.''
Land only stores [[heat]] in the top few meters. 
Ocean water, by contrast, can move vertically and store heat within the ocean's depth ([[convection]]). 
This is why the land surface is observed to warm more than the oceans. It also explains the very large difference in response between 
* "equilibrium" climate prediction [[Execution (computers)|runs]] in which only a shallow ocean is used and it is assumed that the climate has come to equilibrium and 
* "[[Transient state|transient]]" climate prediction runs in which a full ocean is used and the climate is out of balance.

The "commitment" can apply to variables other than temperature: because of the long mixing time for heat into the deep ocean, a given surface warming commits to centuries of [[sea level rise]] from thermal expansion of the ocean. Also once a certain threshold is crossed, it is likely that a slow melting of the Greenland ice sheet will commit us to a sea level rise of 5m over millennia.

== Models ==
{{main|global climate model}}
Recent [[model (abstract)|model]]s forecast that even in the unlikely event of greenhouse gases stabilizing at present levels, the earth would warm by an additional 0.5°C by 2100, a similar rise in temperature to that seen during the 20th century.  In 2050, as much as 64% of that commitment would be due to ''past'' natural forcings.  Over time, their contribution compared to the human influence will diminish.  Overall, the warming commitment at 2005 greenhouse gas levels could exceed 1°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wigley |first=T. M. L. |title=The Climate Change Commitment |journal=Science |volume=307 |issue=5716 |pages=1766–9 |date=17 March 2005 |doi=10.1126/science.1103934 |pmid=15774756 |url=ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/coastal/Climate%20Articles/Wigley_2005%20Sea%20level%20commitment.pdf |format=PDF|bibcode=2005Sci...307.1766W }}&lt;/ref&gt; As ocean waters expand in response to this warming, global [[sea level]]s would mount by about 10 centimeters during that time. These models do not take into account [[ice cap]] and [[glacier]] melting; including those [[climate feedback]] effects would give a 1–1.5°C estimated temperature increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050314/full/050314-13.html |title= Oceans extend effects of climate change |first=Deirdre |last=Lockwood  |date= 2005-05-17 |work=Nature News |publisher= [[Nature Publishing Group]] |doi=10.1038/news050314-13}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This is by no means a new idea, the concept is discussed in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|TAR]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20071231162245/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/008.htm] and in the [[IPCC_Second_Assessment_Report|SAR]] in 1995.

'''Complex and Adaptive Systems Laboratory''' (CASL) is an interdisciplinary research institute in [[University College Dublin]]. It is formed around four research clusters. The institute houses research groups from a number of Schools within UCD, notably computer science.
It is located in the Belfield Business Park at the northern end of the main UCD campus. The institute is involved in all aspects of research into complex systems from atomistic models, through to societal modelling.

==Natural Computing and Optimisation==
Led by Dr. Mike O'Neill this cluster studies computational systems inspired by the Natural World, including complex, physical, social and biological systems, and optimisation and model induction methods in their broader sense.  The main facets of the cluster are:  nature-inspired problem solving, understanding natural systems, exploiting natural processes as computational machines, and developing the next generation of optimisation and model induction methods. Groups in this cluster develop and apply methods to a broad range of problem domains including [[Finance]], [[Computer Science]], [[Design]], [[Architecture]], [[Music]], [[Sound Synthesis]], [[Bioinformatics]], [[Engineering]] and [[Telecommunications]].

==Networks and Data Analysis==
The Networks and Data Analysis cluster is concerned with the analysis of complex data from and about networks. These networks may be social networks (in the broadest sense), biological networks, sensor networks or communications networks. The defining characteristic of the research in this cluster is the significance of the network structure in the data. The research concerns the discovery of interesting structure in the data and the fusion of data from different sources.

==Security and Trust==
The Security and Trust cluster seeks to combine fundamental [[mathematics]], [[computer science]] and [[engineering]], with practical [[software engineering]] expertise and knowledge of human behaviour, to study problems in the areas of security and trust. Research topics include cryptography, security, privacy, trust, voting issues, information security, network coding and network information theory, watermarking, steganography, error correction, modulation, signal processing.

==Simulation Science and Extreme Events==
This cluster aims to study and link the broad common underpinning causes of extreme weather, market crashes, social fads, and global epidemics using simulation science as the tool of discovery.

==Research Training==
A number of structured PhD Programmes provide post-graduate education throughout the Institute:

'''Computer-assisted language learning (CALL), British, or Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI)/Computer-Aided Language Instruction (CALI), American'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=John|date=1983|title=Computer assisted language learning|url=|journal=Language Teaching|volume=16(2)|pages=102-114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''',''' is briefly defined in a seminal work by Levy (1997: p.&amp;nbsp;1) as "the search for and study of applications of the computer in language teaching and learning".&lt;ref name=levy1997&gt;Levy M. (1997) ''CALL: context and conceptualisation'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; CALL embraces a wide range of [[information and communications technology]] applications and approaches to teaching and learning foreign languages, from the "traditional" drill-and-practice programs that characterised CALL in the 1960s and 1970s to more recent manifestations of CALL, e.g. as used in a [[virtual learning environment]] and Web-based [[distance learning]]. It also extends to the use of [[#Corpora and concordancers|corpora and concordancers]], interactive whiteboards,&lt;ref name=schmidcutrim2009&gt;Schmid Euline Cutrim (2009) ''Interactive whiteboard technology in the language classroom: exploring new pedagogical opportunities'', Saarbrücken, Germany: VDM Verlag Dr. Müller.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-mediated communication (CMC),&lt;ref name=lamyhampel&gt;Lamy M.-N. &amp; Hampel R. (2007) ''Online communication in language learning and teaching'', Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Virtual worlds|language learning in virtual worlds]], and [[Mobile Assisted Language Learning|mobile-assisted language learning (MALL)]].&lt;ref name=shieldkukulska&gt;Shield L. &amp; Kukulska-Hulme A. (eds.) (2008) Special edition of ''ReCALL'' (20, 3) on ''Mobile Assisted Language Learning''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term CALI (computer-assisted language instruction) was in use before CALL, reflecting its origins as a subset of the general term CAI (computer-assisted instruction). CALI fell out of favour among language teachers, however, as it appeared to imply a teacher-centred approach (instructional), whereas language teachers are more inclined to prefer a student-centred approach, focusing on learning rather than instruction. CALL began to replace CALI in the early 1980s (Davies &amp; Higgins 1982: p.&amp;nbsp;3)&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. &amp; Higgins J. (1982) ''Computers, language and language learning'', London: CILT.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now incorporated into the names of the growing number of [[#Professional associations|professional associations]] worldwide.

An alternative term, technology-enhanced language learning (TELL),&lt;ref&gt;Bush M. &amp; Terry R. (1997) (eds.) ''Technology-enhanced language learning'', Lincolnwood, Illinois: National Textbook Company.&lt;/ref&gt; also emerged around the early 1990s: e.g. the TELL Consortium project, University of Hull.

The current philosophy of CALL puts a strong emphasis on student-centred materials that allow learners to work on their own. Such materials may be structured or unstructured, but they normally embody two important features: interactive learning and individualised learning. CALL is essentially a tool that helps teachers to facilitate the language learning process. It can be used to reinforce what has already been learned in the classroom or as a remedial tool to help learners who require additional support.

The design of CALL materials generally takes into consideration principles of language pedagogy and methodology, which may be derived from different learning theories (e.g. behaviourist, cognitive, constructivist) and second-language learning theories such as Stephen Krashen's [[monitor hypothesis]].

A combination of face-to-face teaching and CALL is usually referred to as [[blended learning]]. Blended learning is designed to increase learning potential and is more commonly found than pure CALL (Pegrum 2009: p.&amp;nbsp;27).&lt;ref&gt;Pegrum M. (2009) ''From blogs to bombs: The future of digital technologies in education'', Perth: University of Western Australia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

CALL dates back to the 1960s, when it was first introduced on university mainframe computers. The PLATO project, initiated at the University of Illinois in 1960, is an important landmark in the early development of CALL (Marty 1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marty | first1 = F | year = 1981 | title = Reflections on the use of computers in second language acquisition | url = | journal = System | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 85–98 | doi=10.1016/0346-251x(81)90023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the microcomputer in the late 1970s brought computing within the range of a wider audience, resulting in a boom in the development of CALL programs and a flurry of publications of books on CALL in the early 1980s.

Dozens of CALL programs are currently available on the internet, at prices ranging from free to expensive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Courses|url=http://Lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=12 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other programs are available only through university language courses.

There have been several attempts to document the history of CALL. Sanders (1995) covers the period from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, focusing on CALL in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders R. (ed.)

Russell, ''CALICO Journal'' Special Issue, 12, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Delcloque (2000) documents the history of CALL worldwide, from its beginnings in the 1960s to the dawning of the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Delcloque P.

==Typology and phases==

During the 1980s and 1990s, several attempts were made to establish a CALL typology. A wide range of different types of CALL programs was identified by Davies &amp; Higgins (1985),&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. &amp; Higgins J. (1985) ''Using computers in language learning: a teacher's guide'', London: CILT.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones &amp; Fortescue (1987),&lt;ref&gt;Jones C. &amp; Fortescue S. (1987) ''Using computers in the language classroom'', Harlow: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; Hardisty &amp; Windeatt (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Hardisty D. &amp; Windeatt S. (1989) ''CALL'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Levy (1997: pp.&amp;nbsp;118ff.).&lt;ref name=levy1997/&gt; These included gap-filling and Cloze programs, multiple-choice programs, free-format (text-entry) programs, adventures and simulations, action mazes, sentence-reordering programs, exploratory programs—and "total Cloze", a type of program in which the learner has to reconstruct a whole text. Most of these early programs still exist in modernised versions.

Since the 1990s, it has become increasingly difficult to categorise CALL as it now extends to the use of [[blogs]], [[wikis]], [[social networking]], [[podcasting]], [[Web 2.0]] applications, [[#Virtual worlds|language learning in virtual worlds]] and [[interactive whiteboards]] (Davies et al. 2010: Section 3.7).&lt;ref name=davieswalkeretal/&gt;

Warschauer (1996)&lt;ref name=warschauer96&gt;Warschauer M. (1996) "Computer-assisted language learning: an introduction". In Fotos S. (ed.) ''Multimedia language teaching'', Tokyo: Logos International [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/warschauer.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Warschauer &amp; Healey (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warschauer | first1 = M. | last2 = Healey | first2 = D. | year = 1998 | title = Computers and language learning: an overview | url = | journal = Language Teaching | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 57–71 | doi=10.1017/s0261444800012970}}&lt;/ref&gt; took a different approach. Rather than focusing on the typology of CALL, they identified three historical phases of CALL, classified according to their underlying pedagogical and methodological approaches:

* Behavioristic CALL: conceived in the 1950s and implemented in the 1960s and 1970s.
* Communicative CALL: 1970s to 1980s.
* Integrative CALL: embracing Multimedia and the Internet: 1990s.

Most CALL programs in Warschauer &amp; Healey's first phase, Behavioristic CALL (1960s to 1970s), consisted of drill-and-practice materials in which the computer presented a stimulus and the learner provided a response. At first, both could be done only through text. The computer would analyse students' input and give feedback, and more sophisticated programs would react to students' mistakes by branching to help screens and remedial activities. While such programs and their underlying pedagogy still exist today, behaviouristic approaches to language learning have been rejected by most language teachers, and the increasing sophistication of computer technology has led CALL to other possibilities.

The second phase described by Warschauer &amp; Healey, Communicative CALL, is based on the [[communicative approach]] that became prominent in the late 1970s and 1980s (Underwood 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Underwood J. (1984) ''Linguistics, computers and the language teacher: a communicative approach'', Rowley, Massachusetts: Newbury House.&lt;/ref&gt; In the communicative approach the focus is on using the language rather than analysis of the language, and grammar is taught implicitly rather than explicitly. It also allows for originality and flexibility in student output of language. The communicative approach coincided with the arrival of the PC, which made computing much more widely available and resulted in a boom in the development of software for language learning. The first CALL software in this phase continued to provide skill practice but not in a drill format—for example: paced reading, text reconstruction and language games—but the computer remained the tutor. In this phase, computers provided context for students to use the language, such as asking for directions to a place, and programs not designed for language learning such as [[Sim City]], ''Sleuth'' and [[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]] were used for language learning. Criticisms of this approach include using the computer in an ad hoc and disconnected manner for more marginal aims rather than the central aims of language teaching.

The third phase of CALL described by Warschauer &amp; Healey, Integrative CALL, starting from the 1990s, tried to address criticisms of the communicative approach by integrating the teaching of language skills into tasks or projects to provide direction and coherence. It also coincided with the development of multimedia technology (providing text, graphics, sound and animation) as well as Computer-mediated communication (CMC). CALL in this period saw a definitive shift from the use of the computer for drill and tutorial purposes (the computer as a finite, authoritative base for a specific task) to a medium for extending education beyond the classroom. Multimedia CALL started with interactive laser videodiscs such as ''Montevidisco'' (Schneider &amp; Bennion 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Schneider E.W. &amp; Bennion J.L. (1984) "Veni, vidi, vici, via videodisc: a simulator for instructional courseware". In Wyatt D.H. (ed.) ''Computer-assisted language instruction'', Oxford: Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A la rencontre de Philippe'' (Fuerstenberg 1993),&lt;ref&gt;Fuerstenberg G. (1993) ''A la rencontre de Philippe'': Videodisc, Software, Teacher's Manual and Student Activities Workbook: Yale University Press [Online]: http://web.mit.edu/fll/www/projects/Philippe.html&lt;/ref&gt; both of which were simulations of situations where the learner played a key role. These programs later were transferred to CD-ROMs, and new [[role-playing games]] (RPGs) such as ''Who is Oscar Lake?'' made their appearance in a range of different languages.

In a later publication Warschauer changed the name of the first phase of CALL from Behavioristic CALL to Structural CALL and also revised the dates of the three phases (Warschauer 2000):&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer M. (2000) "CALL for the 21st Century", IATEFL and ESADE Conference, 2 July 2000, Barcelona, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Structural CALL: 1970s to 1980s.
* Communicative CALL: 1980s to 1990s.
* Integrative CALL: 2000 onwards.

Bax (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bax | first1 = S | year = 2003 | title = CALL – past, present and future | url = | journal = System | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 13–28 | doi=10.1016/s0346-251x(02)00071-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; took issue with Warschauer &amp; Haley (1998) and Warschauer (2000) and proposed these three phases:

* Restricted CALL – mainly behaviouristic: 1960s to 1980s.
* Open CALL – i.e. open in terms of feedback given to students, software types and the role of the teacher, and including simulations and games: 1980s to 2003 (i.e. the date of Bax's article).
* Integrated CALL – still to be achieved. Bax argued that at the time of writing language teachers were still in the Open CALL phase, as true integration could only be said to have been achieved when CALL had reached a state of "normalisation" – e.g. when using CALL was as normal as using a pen.

See also Bax &amp; Chambers (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bax | first1 = S. | last2 = Chambers | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Making CALL work: towards normalisation | url = | journal = System | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 465–479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bax (2011),&lt;ref&gt;Bax S. (2011) "Normalisation revisited: the effective use of technology in language education", ''International Journal of Computer-Assisted Language Learning and Teaching (IJCALLT)'' 1, 2: 1-15: http://www.igi-global.com/ijcallt&lt;/ref&gt; in which the topic of "normalisation" is revisited.

==Flashcards==

A basic use of CALL is in vocabulary acquisition using [[flashcard]]s, which requires quite simple programs. Such programs often make use of [[spaced repetition]], a technique whereby the learner is presented with the vocabulary items that need to be committed to memory at increasingly longer intervals until long-term retention is achieved. This has led to the development of a number of applications known as spaced repetition systems (SRS),&lt;ref&gt;Mounteney M. ''Spaced repetition learning systems (SRS):'' http://www.omniglot.com/language/srs.php. Accessed 14 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; including the generic [[Anki (software)|Anki]] or [[SuperMemo]] package and programs such as BYKI&lt;ref&gt;BYKI (Before You Know It): A personalized language-learning system, designed to promote language proficiency by expanding the learner's vocabulary. The system makes use of a flashcard interface and tracks everything that has been learned, automatically presenting and re-presenting the material at appropriate intervals: http://www.byki.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and phase-6,&lt;ref&gt;phase-6: A flashcard system that presents vocabulary at phased intervals, aiding long-term retention. http://www.phase-6.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which have been designed specifically for learners of foreign languages.

==Software design and pedagogy==

Above all, careful consideration must be given to [[pedagogy]] in designing CALL software, but publishers of CALL software tend to follow the latest trend, regardless of its desirability. Moreover, approaches to teaching foreign languages are constantly changing, dating back to [[grammar-translation]], through the [[direct method (education)|direct method]], [[Audio-lingual method|audio-lingualism]] and a variety of other approaches, to the more recent [[communicative approach]] and [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] (Decoo 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Decoo W. (2001) ''On the mortality of language learning methods''. Paper given as the James L. Barker lecture on 8 November 2001 at Brigham Young University [Online]: https://web.archive.org/web/20080208190123/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/didascalia/mortality.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Designing and creating CALL software is an extremely demanding task, calling upon a range of skills. Major CALL development projects are usually managed by a team of people:

* A subject specialist (also known as a content provider) – usually a language teacher – who is responsible for providing the content and pedagogical input. More than one subject specialist is required for larger CALL projects.
* A programmer who is familiar with the chosen programming language or authoring tool.
* A graphic designer, to produce pictures and icons, and to advise on fonts, colour, screen layout, etc.
* A professional photographer or, at the very least, a very good amateur photographer. Graphic designers often have a background in photography too.
* A sound engineer and a video technician will be required if the package is to contain substantial amounts of sound and video.
* An instructional designer. Developing a CALL package is more than just putting a text book into a computer. An instructional designer will probably have a background in cognitive psychology and media technology, and will be able to advise the subject specialists in the team on the appropriate use of the chosen technology (Gimeno &amp; Davies 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Gimeno-Sanz A. &amp; Davies G. (2010) CALL software design and implementation. Module 3.2 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

CALL inherently supports [[learner autonomy]], the final of the eight conditions that Egbert et al. (2007) cite as "Conditions for Optimal Language Learning Environments". Learner autonomy places the learner firmly in control so that he or she "decides on learning goals" (Egbert et al., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;8).&lt;ref&gt;Egbert J., Chao C.-C., &amp; Hanson-Smith E. (2007) Introduction: Foundations for Teaching and Learning. In Egbert J. &amp; E. Hanson-Smith (eds.) '' CALL environments: Research, practice, and critical issues '' (2nd edition). Alexandria, VA: TESOL. (pp. 1-14).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is all too easy when designing CALL software to take the comfortable route and produce a set of multiple-choice and gap-filling exercises, using a simple authoring tool (Bangs 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Bangs P. (2011) Introduction to CALL authoring programs. Module 2.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod2-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but CALL is much more than this; Stepp-Greany (2002), for example, describes the creation and management of an environment incorporating a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] and [[whole language]] philosophy. According to constructivist theory, learners are active participants in tasks in which they "construct" new knowledge derived from their prior experience. Learners also assume responsibility for their learning, and the teacher is a facilitator rather than a purveyor of knowledge. Whole language theory embraces constructivism and postulates that language learning moves from the whole to the part, rather than building sub-skills to lead towards the higher abilities of comprehension, speaking, and writing. It also emphasises that comprehending, speaking, reading, and writing skills are interrelated, reinforcing each other in complex ways. Language acquisition is, therefore, an active process in which the learner focuses on cues and meaning and makes intelligent guesses. Additional demands are placed upon teachers working in a technological environment incorporating constructivist and whole language theories. The development of teachers’ professional skills must include new pedagogical as well as technical and management skills. Regarding the issue of teacher facilitation in such an environment, the teacher has a key role to play, but there could be a conflict between the aim to create an atmosphere for learner independence and the teacher's natural feelings of responsibility. In order to avoid learners’ negative perceptions, Stepp-Greany points out that it is especially important for the teacher to continue to address their needs, especially those of low-ability learners.&lt;ref name=steppgreany&gt;Stepp-Greany J. (2002) "Student perceptions on language learning in a technological environment: implications for the new millennium", ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 6, 1: 165-180 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol6num1/steppgreany/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multimedia==

Language teachers have been avid users of technology for a very long time. Gramophone records were among the first technological aids to be used by language teachers in order to present students with recordings of native speakers’ voices, and broadcasts from foreign radio stations were used to make recordings on reel-to-reel tape recorders. Other examples of technological aids that have been used in the foreign language classroom include slide projectors, film-strip projectors, film projectors, videocassette recorders and DVD players. In the early 1960s, integrated courses (which were often described as multimedia courses) began to appear. Examples of such courses are ''Ecouter et Parler'' (consisting of a coursebook and tape recordings)&lt;ref&gt;Côté D., Narins Levy S. &amp; O'Connor P. (1962) ''Ecouter et Parler'', Paris: Librairie Marcel Didier.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Deutsch durch die audiovisuelle Methode'' (consisting of an illustrated coursebook, tape recordings and a film-strip – based on the Structuro-Global Audio-Visual method).&lt;ref&gt;Burgdorf I. Montani K., Z. Skreb Z. &amp; Vidovic M. (1962) ''Deutsch durch die audio-visuelle Methode'', New York: Holt Rinehart and Winston 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s standard microcomputers were incapable of producing sound and they had poor graphics capability. This represented a step backwards for language teachers, who by this time had become accustomed to using a range of different media in the foreign language classroom. The arrival of the multimedia computer in the early 1990s was therefore a major breakthrough as it enabled text, images, sound and video to be combined in one device and the integration of the four basic skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing (Davies 2011: Section 1).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm&gt;Davies G. (2011) Introduction to multimedia CALL. Module 2.2 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers'' (ICT4LT), Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod2-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of CALL programs for multimedia computers that were published on CD-ROM and DVD from the mid-1990s onwards are described by Davies (2010: Section 3).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm/&gt; CALL programs are still being published on CD-ROM and DVD, but Web-based multimedia CALL has now virtually supplanted these media.

Following the arrival of multimedia CALL, multimedia language centres began to appear in educational institutions. While multimedia facilities offer many opportunities for language learning with the integration of text, images, sound and video, these opportunities have often not been fully utilised. One of the main promises of CALL is the ability to individualise learning but, as with the language labs that were introduced into educational institutions in the 1960s and 1970s, the use of the facilities of multimedia centres has often devolved into rows of students all doing the same drills (Davies 2010: Section 3.1).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm/&gt; There is therefore a danger that multimedia centres may go the same way as the language labs. Following a boom period in the 1970s, language labs went rapidly into decline. Davies (1997: p.&amp;nbsp;28) lays the blame mainly on the failure to train teachers to use language labs, both in terms of operation and in terms of developing new methodologies, but there were other factors such as poor reliability, lack of materials and a lack of good ideas.&lt;ref name=davieslessons&gt;Davies G. (1997) "Lessons from the past, lessons for the future: 20 years of CALL". In Korsvold A-K. &amp; Rüschoff B. (eds.) ''New technologies in language learning and teaching'', Strasbourg: Council of Europe, p. 28. Also on the Web in a revised edition (2009): http://www.camsoftpartners.co.uk/coegdd1.htm/&lt;/ref&gt;

Managing a multimedia language centre requires not only staff who have a knowledge of foreign languages and language teaching methodology but also staff with technical know-how and budget management ability, as well as the ability to combine all these into creative ways of taking advantage of what the technology can offer. A centre manager usually needs assistants for technical support, for managing resources and even the tutoring of students. Multimedia centres lend themselves to self-study and potentially self-directed learning, but this is often misunderstood. The simple existence of a multimedia centre does not automatically lead to students learning independently. Significant investment of time is essential for materials development and creating an atmosphere conducive to self-study. Unfortunately, administrators often have the mistaken belief that buying hardware by itself will meet the needs of the centre, allocating 90% of its budget to hardware and virtually ignoring software and staff training needs (Davies et al. 2011: ''Foreword'').&lt;ref name=daviesmmlc&gt;Davies G., Hamilton R., Weidmann B., Gabel S., Legenhausen L., Meus V. &amp; Myers S. (2011) Managing a multimedia language centre. Module 3.1 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self access language learning centers|Self-access language learning centres]] or independent learning centres have emerged partially independently and partially in response to these issues. In self-access learning, the focus is on developing learner autonomy through varying degrees of self-directed learning, as opposed to (or as a complement to) classroom learning. In many centres learners access materials and manage their learning independently, but they also have access to staff for help. Many self-access centres are heavy users of technology and an increasing number of them are now offering online self-access learning opportunities. Some centres have developed novel ways of supporting language learning outside the context of the language classroom (also called 'language support') by developing software to monitor students' self-directed learning and by offering online support from teachers. Centre managers and support staff may need to have new roles defined for them to support students’ efforts at self-directed learning: v. Mozzon-McPherson &amp; Vismans (2001), who refer to a new job description, namely that of the "language adviser".&lt;ref&gt;Mozzon-McPherson M. &amp; Vismans R. (eds.) (2001) ''Beyond language teaching towards language advising'', London: CILT.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==

The emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] (now known simply as "the Web") in the early 1990s marked a significant change in the use of communications technology for all computer users. [[Email]] and other forms of [[electronic communication]] had been in existence for many years, but the launch of [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]], the first graphical [[Web browser]], in 1993 brought about a radical change in the ways in which we communicate electronically. The launch of the Web in the public arena immediately began to attract the attention of language teachers. Many language teachers were already familiar with the concept of [[hypertext]] on stand-alone computers, which made it possible to set up non-sequential structured reading activities for language learners in which they could point to items of text or images on a page displayed on the computer screen and branch to any other pages, e.g. in a so-called "stack" as implemented in the [[HyperCard]] program on Apple Mac computers. The Web took this one stage further by creating a worldwide hypertext system that enabled the user to branch to different pages on computers anywhere in the world simply by pointing and clicking at a piece of text or an image. This opened up access to thousands of authentic foreign-language websites to teachers and students that could be used in a variety of ways. A problem that arose, however, was that this could lead to a good deal of time-wasting if Web browsing was used in an unstructured way (Davies 1997: pp.&amp;nbsp;42–43),&lt;ref name=davieslessons/&gt; and language teachers responded by developing more structured activities and online exercises (Leloup &amp; Ponterio 2003).&lt;ref&gt;LeLoup J. &amp; Ponterio R. (2003) "Interactive and multimedia techniques in online language lessons: a sampler", ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 7, 3 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol7num3/net/default.html&lt;/ref&gt; Davies (2010) lists over 500 websites, where links to online exercises can be found, along with links to online dictionaries and encyclopaedias, concordancers, translation aids and other miscellaneous resources of interest to the language teacher and learner.&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. (2010) [http://www.camsoftpartners.co.uk/websites.htm Graham Davies's Favourite Websites]&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of the (free) ''[[Hot Potatoes]]'' (Holmes &amp; Arneil) authoring tool, which was first demonstrated publicly at the EUROCALL 1998 conference, made it possible for language teachers to create their own online interactive exercises. Other useful tools are produced by the same authors.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes M. &amp; Arneil S. ''Hot Potatoes'', University of Victoria, Canada. Downloadable from: http://hotpot.uvic.ca: A library of Clipart for use with ''Hot Potatoes'' and other authoring tools is also available at the University of Victoria site: http://hcmc.uvic.ca/clipart/&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early days the Web could not compete seriously with [[multimedia]] CALL on CD-ROM and DVD. Sound and video quality was often poor, and interaction was slow. But now the Web has caught up. Sound and video are of high quality and interaction has improved tremendously, although this does depend on sufficient bandwidth being available, which is not always the case, especially in remote rural areas and developing countries. One area in which CD-ROMs and DVDs are still superior is in the presentation of listen/respond/playback activities, although such activities on the Web are continually improving.

Since the early 2000s there has been a boom in the development of so-called [[Web 2.0]] applications. Contrary to popular opinion, Web 2.0 is not a new version of the Web, rather it implies a shift in emphasis from Web browsing, which is essentially a one-way process (from the Web to the end-user), to making use of Web applications in the same way as one uses applications on a desktop computer. It also implies more interaction and sharing. Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2011: Section 2.1)&lt;ref name=introinternet&gt;Walker R., Davies G. &amp; Hewer S. (2011) Introduction to the Internet. Module 1.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; list the following examples of Web 2.0 applications that language teachers are using:

* Image storage and sharing
* [[Social bookmarking]]
* Discussion lists, [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[social networking]]
* [[Chat room]]s, [[MUD]]s, [[MOO]]s and [[MUVE]]s (virtual worlds)
* [[Podcasting]]
* Audio tools
* [[Video sharing]] applications and [[screen capture (disambiguation)|screen capture]] tools (referring to both video screen capture tools and screenshot tools)
* Animation tools – comic strips, movies, etc.
* [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|Mashup]]s
* Blog assisted language learning (BALL)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esp-world.info/Articles_26/push%20button%20publishing%20ward%202004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
There is no doubt that the Web has proved to be a main focus for language teachers, who are making increasingly imaginative use of its wide range of facilities: see Dudeney (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Dudeney G. (2007) ''The Internet and the language classroom'', Second Edition, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. (2008) ''Handbook of research on Web 2.0 and second language learning'', Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA: IGI Global.&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, the use of Web 2.0 tools calls for a careful reexamination of the role of the teacher in the classroom (Richardson 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Richardson W. (2006) ''Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts and the Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms''. Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corpora and concordancers==

Corpora have been used for many years as the basis of linguistic research and also for the compilation of dictionaries and reference works such as the Collins Cobuild series, published by HarperCollins.&lt;ref&gt;HarperCollins: http://www.harpercollins.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Tribble &amp; Barlow (2001),&lt;ref&gt;Tribble C. &amp; Barlow M. (eds.) (2001) ''Using corpora in language teaching and learning'', Special Issue, ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 5, 3 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol5num3/default.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair J. (ed.) (2004) ''How to use corpora in language teaching'', Amsterdam: John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt; and McEnery &amp; Wilson (2011)&lt;ref name=mcenerywilson&gt;McEnery A. &amp; Wilson A. (2011) Corpus linguistics. Module 3.4 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; describe a variety of ways in which corpora can be used in language teaching.

An early reference to the use of electronic concordancers in language teaching can be found in Higgins &amp; Johns (1984: pp.&amp;nbsp;88–94),&lt;ref&gt;Higgins J. &amp; Johns T. (1984) ''Computers in language learning'', London: Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; and many examples of their practical use in the classroom are described by Lamy &amp; Klarskov Mortensen (2010).&lt;ref name = lamyklarskov/&gt;

It was Tim Johns (1991), however, who raised the profile of the use of concordancers in the language classroom with his concept of Data-driven learning (DDL).&lt;ref&gt;Johns T. (1991) "From printout to handout: grammar and vocabulary teaching in the context of Data Driven Learning". In Johns T. &amp; King P. (eds.) ''Classroom concordancing'', Special issue of ''ELR Journal'' 4, University of Birmingham, Centre for English Language Studies: 27-45.&lt;/ref&gt; DDL encourages learners to work out their own rules about the meaning of words and their usage by using a concordancer to locate examples in a corpus of authentic texts. It is also possible for the teacher to use a concordancer to find examples of authentic usage to demonstrate a point of grammar or typical collocations, and to generate exercises based on the examples found. Various types of concordancers and where they can be obtained are described by Lamy &amp; Klarskov Mortensen (2011).&lt;ref name=lamyklarskov&gt;Lamy M-N. &amp; Klarskov Mortensen H. J. (2011) Using concordance programs in the Modern Foreign Languages classroom. Module 2.4 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod2-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Robb (2003) shows how it is possible to use Google as a concordancer, but he also points out a number of drawbacks, for instance there is no control over the educational level, nationality, or other characteristics of the creators of the texts that are found, and the presentation of the examples is not as easy to read as the output of a dedicated concordancer that places the key words (i.e. the search terms) in context.&lt;ref&gt;Robb T.

==Virtual worlds==

[[Virtual worlds]] date back to the adventure games and simulations of the 1970s, for example [[Colossal Cave Adventure]], a text-only simulation in which the user communicated with the computer by typing commands at the keyboard. Language teachers discovered that it was possible to exploit these text-only programs by using them as the basis for discussion. Jones G. (1986) describes an experiment based on the Kingdom simulation, in which learners played roles as members of a council governing an imaginary kingdom. A single computer in the classroom was used to provide the stimulus for discussion, namely simulating events taking place in the kingdom: crop planting time, harvest time, unforeseen catastrophes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = G | year = 1986 | title = Computer simulations in language teaching – the KINGDOM experiment | url = | journal = System | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 179–186 | doi=10.1016/0346-251x(86)90007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early adventure games and simulations led on to multi-user variants, which were known as [[MUDs]] (Multi-user domains). Like their predecessors, MUDs were text-only, with the difference that they were available to a wider online audience. MUDs then led on to [[MOO]]s (Multi-user domains object-oriented), which language teachers were able to exploit for teaching foreign languages and intercultural understanding: see Donaldson &amp; Kötter (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donaldson | first1 = R.P. | last2 = Kötter | first2 = M. | year = 1999 | title = Language learning in cyberspace: teleporting the classroom into the target culture | url = | journal = CALICO Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 531–558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and (Shield 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Shield L. (2003) "MOO as a language learning tool". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major breakthrough in the history of virtual worlds was the graphical user interface. [[Habitat (video game)|Lucasfilm's Habitat]] (1986), was one of the first virtual worlds that was graphically based, albeit only in a two-dimensional environment. Each participant was represented by a visual avatar who could interact with other avatars using text chat.

Three-dimensional virtual worlds such as Traveler and [[Active Worlds]], both of which appeared in the 1990s, were the next important development. Traveler included the possibility of audio communication (but not text chat) between avatars who were represented as disembodied heads in a three-dimensional abstract landscape. Svensson (2003) describes the Virtual Wedding Project, in which advanced students of English made use of Active Worlds as an arena for constructivist learning.&lt;ref&gt;Svensson P. (2003) "Virtual worlds as arenas for language learning". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3D world of [[Second Life]] was launched in 2003. Initially perceived as another [[role-playing game]] (RPG), it began to attract the interest of language teachers with the launch of the first of the series of SLanguages conferences in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;SLanguages: http://www.slanguages.net/home.php&lt;/ref&gt; Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2011: Section 14.2.1)&lt;ref name=introinternet/&gt; and Molka-Danielsen &amp; Deutschmann (2010)&lt;ref name=molka&gt;Molka-Danielsen, J. &amp; Deutschmann, M. (eds.) (2009) ''Learning and teaching in the virtual world of Second Life'', Trondheim, Norway: Tapir Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; describe a number of experiments and projects that focus on language learning in Second Life. See also the Wikipedia article [[Virtual world language learning]].

To what extent Second Life and other virtual worlds will become established as important tools for teachers of foreign languages remains to be seen. It has been argued by Dudeney (2010) in his ''That's Life'' blog that Second Life is "too demanding and too unreliable for most educators". The subsequent discussion shows that this view is shared by many teachers, but many others completely disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Second Life – The Long Goodbye: http://slife.dudeney.com/?p=446&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the pros and cons of Second Life, language teachers’ interest in virtual worlds continues to grow. The joint EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group: http://virtualworldssig.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 2009, and there are now many areas in Second Life that are dedicated to language learning and teaching, for example the commercial area for learners of English, which is managed by Language Lab,&lt;ref&gt;LanguageLab: http://www.languagelab.com/en/&lt;/ref&gt; and free areas such as the region maintained by the Goethe-Institut&lt;ref&gt;Goethe-Institut: http://www.goethe.de/frm/sec/enindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the EduNation Islands.&lt;ref&gt;EduNation Islands: http://edunation-islands.wikispaces.com&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples of simulations created specifically for language education, such as those produced by the EC-funded NIFLAR&lt;ref&gt;Networked Interaction in Foreign Language Acquisition and Research (NIFLAR): http://niflar.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt; and AVALON&lt;ref&gt;Access to Virtual and Action Learning live ONline (AVALON): http://avalon-project.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; projects. NIFLAR is implemented both in Second Life and in [[OpenSimulator|Opensim]].

==Human language technologies==

Human language technologies (HLT) comprise a number of areas of research and development that focus on the use of technology to facilitate communication in a multilingual information society. Human language technologies are areas of activity in departments of the European Commission that were formerly grouped under the heading [[language engineering]] (Gupta &amp; Schulze 2011: Section 1.1).&lt;ref name=guptaschulze&gt;Gupta P. &amp; Schulze M. (2011) Human Language Technologies (HLT). Module 3.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The parts of HLT that is of greatest interest to the language teacher is [[natural language processing]] (NLP), especially [[parsing]], as well as the areas of [[speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]].

Speech synthesis has improved immeasurably in recent years. It is often used in electronic dictionaries to enable learners to find out how words are pronounced. At word level, speech synthesis is quite effective, the artificial voice often closely resembling a human voice. At phrase level and sentence level, however, there are often problems of intonation, resulting in speech production that sounds unnatural even though it may be intelligible. Speech synthesis as embodied in [[text to speech]] (TTS) applications is invaluable as a tool for unsighted or partially sighted people. Gupta &amp; Schulze (2010: Section 4.1) list several examples of speech synthesis applications.&lt;ref name=guptaschulze/&gt;

Speech recognition is less advanced than speech synthesis. It has been used in a number of CALL programs, in which it is usually described as [[automatic speech recognition]] (ASR). ASR is not easy to implement. Ehsani &amp; Knodt (1998) summarise the core problem as follows:

"Complex cognitive processes account for the human ability to associate acoustic signals with meanings and intentions. For a computer, on the other hand, speech is essentially a series of digital values. However, despite these differences, the core problem of speech recognition is the same for both humans and machines: namely, of finding the best match between a given speech sound and its corresponding word string. Automatic speech recognition technology attempts to simulate and optimize this process computationally."&lt;ref name=ehsaniknodt&gt;Ehsani F. &amp; Knodt E. (1998) "Speech technology in computer-aided language learning: strengths and limitations of a new CALL paradigm", ''Language Learning and Technology'' 2, 1: 45–60 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol2num1/article3/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs embodying ASR normally provide a native speaker model that the learner is requested to imitate, but the matching process is not 100% reliable and may result in a learner's perfectly intelligible attempt to pronounce a word or phrase being rejected (Davies 2010: Section 3.4.6 and Section 3.4.7).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm/&gt;

Parsing is used in a number of ways in CALL. Gupta &amp; Schulze (2010: Section 5) describe how parsing may be used to analyse sentences, presenting the learner with a tree diagram that labels the constituent parts of speech of a sentence and shows the learner how the sentence is structured.&lt;ref name=guptaschulze/&gt;

Parsing is also used in CALL programs to analyse the learner's input and diagnose errors. Davies (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. (2002) Article on CALL in the ''Good Practice Guide'' at the website of the Subject Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies (LLAS), University of Southampton [Online]: http://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/gpg/61&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

"Discrete error analysis and feedback were a common feature of traditional CALL, and the more sophisticated programs would attempt to analyse the learner's response, pinpoint errors, and branch to help and remedial activities. ... Error analysis in CALL is, however, a matter of controversy. Practitioners who come into CALL via the disciplines of [[computational linguistics]], e.g. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human Language Technologies (HLT), tend to be more optimistic about the potential of error analysis by computer than those who come into CALL via language teaching. [...] An alternative approach is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to parse the learner's response – so-called ''intelligent CALL'' (ICALL) – but there is a gulf between those who favour the use of AI to develop CALL programs (Matthews 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matthews | first1 = C | year = 1994 | title = Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Learning as cognitive science: the choice of syntactic frameworks for language tutoring | url = | journal = Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 533–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, at the other extreme, those who perceive this approach as a threat to humanity (Last 1989:153)".&lt;ref&gt;Last R.W. (1989) ''Artificial intelligence techniques in language learning'', Chichester: Ellis Horwood.&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwood (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Underwood | first1 = J | year = 1989 | title = On the edge: Intelligent CALL in the 1990s | url = | journal = Computers and the Humanities | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 71–84 | doi=10.1007/bf00058770}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Heift &amp; Schulze (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Heift T. &amp; Schulze M. (eds.) (2007) ''Errors and intelligence in CALL: parsers and pedagogues'', New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; present a more positive picture of AI.

Research into speech synthesis, speech recognition and parsing and how these areas of NLP can be used in CALL are the main focus of the NLP Special Interest Group&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL NLP Special Interest Group: http://siglp.eurocall-languages.org/&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[European Association for Computer-Assisted Language Learning|EUROCALL]] professional association and the ICALL Special Interest Group&lt;ref&gt;CALICO ICALL Special Interest Group: http://purl.org/calico/icall&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[CALICO (consortium)|CALICO]] professional association. The EUROCALL NLP SIG also maintains a Ning.&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL NLP Special Interest Group Ning: http://nlpsig.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

The question of the impact of CALL in language learning and teaching has been raised at regular intervals ever since computers first appeared in educational institutions (Davies &amp; Hewer 2011: Section 3).&lt;ref name=ict4ltmod11&gt;Davies G. &amp; Hewer S. (2011) Introduction to new technologies and how they can contribute to language learning and teaching. Module 1.1 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Recent large-scale impact studies include the study edited by Fitzpatrick &amp; Davies (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick A. &amp; Davies G. (eds.) (2003) ''The impact of Information and Communications Technologies on the teaching of foreign languages and on the role of teachers of foreign languages'', EC Directorate General of Education and Culture.&lt;/ref&gt; and the EACEA (2009) study,&lt;ref&gt;Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission (2009) ''Study on the impact of ICT and new media on language learning'' [Online]: http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/studies/study_impact_ict_new_media_language_learning_en.php&lt;/ref&gt; both of which were produced for the European Commission.

A distinction needs to be made between the impact and the effectiveness of CALL. Impact may be measured quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the uptake and use of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] in teaching foreign languages, issues of availability of hardware and software, budgetary considerations, Internet access, teachers’ and learners' attitudes to the use of CALL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=mahmoudi|first=elham|title=Attitude and student's performance in Computer Assisted English Language Learning (CALL) for Learning Vocabulary|journal=procedia social and behavioral science|date=June 30, 2012|volume=66|pages=489–498|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812052780|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.11.293}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes in the ways in which languages are learnt and taught, and paradigm shifts in teachers’ and learners’ roles. Effectiveness, on the other hand, usually focuses on assessing to what extent ICT is a more effective way of teaching foreign languages compared to using traditional methods – and this is more problematic as so many variables come into play. Worldwide, the picture of the impact of CALL is extremely varied. Most developed nations work comfortably with the new technologies, but developing nations are often beset with problems of costs and broadband connectivity. Evidence on the effectiveness of CALL – as with the impact of CALL – is extremely varied and many research questions still need to be addressed and answered. Hubbard (2002) presents the results of a CALL research survey that was sent to 120 CALL professionals from around the world asking them to articulate a CALL research question they would like to see answered. Some of the questions have been answered but many more remain open.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard P. (2002) ''Survey of unanswered questions in Computer Assisted Language Learning: Effectiveness issues'' [Online]: http://www.stanford.edu/~efs/callsurvey/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Leakey (2011) offers an overview of current and past research in CALL and proposes a comprehensive model for evaluating the effectiveness of CALL platforms, programs and pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Leakey J. (2011) ''Evaluating Computer Assisted Language Learning: an integrated approach to effectiveness research in CALL'', Bern: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

A crucial issue is the extent to which the computer is perceived as taking over the teacher's role. Warschauer (1996: p.&amp;nbsp;6) perceived the computer as playing an "intelligent" role, and claimed that a computer program "should ideally be able to understand a user's spoken input and evaluate it not just for correctness but also for appropriateness. It should be able to diagnose a student's problems with pronunciation, syntax, or usage and then intelligently decide among a range of options (e.g. repeating, paraphrasing, slowing down, correcting, or directing the student to background explanations)."&lt;ref name=warschauer96/&gt; Jones C. (1986), on the other hand, rejected the idea of the computer being "some kind of inferior teacher-substitute" and proposed a methodology that focused more on what teachers could do with computer programs rather than what computer programs could do on their own: "in other words, treating the computer as they would any other classroom aid".&lt;ref name=jones86&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = C | year = 1986 | title = It's not so much the program: more what you do with it: the importance of methodology in CALL | url = | journal = System | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 171–178 | doi=10.1016/0346-251x(86)90006-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warschauer's high expectations in 1996 have still not been fulfilled, and currently there is an increasing tendency for teachers to go down the route proposed by Jones, making use of a variety of new tools such as [[#Corpora and concordancers|corpora and concordancers]], interactive whiteboards&lt;ref name= schmidcutrim2009/&gt; and applications for online communication.&lt;ref name= lamyhampel/&gt;

Since the advent of the Web there has been an explosion in online learning, but to what extent it is effective is open to criticism. Felix (2003) takes a critical look at popular myths attached to online learning from three perspectives, namely administrators, teachers and students. She concludes: "That costs can be saved in this ambitious enterprise is clearly a myth, as are expectations of saving time or replacing staff with machines."&lt;ref&gt;Felix U. (2003) "Teaching languages online: deconstructing the myths", ''Australian Journal of Educational Technology'' 19, 1: 118-138 [Online]: http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet19/felix.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the effectiveness of CALL in promoting the four skills, Felix (2008) claims that there is "enough data in CALL to suggest positive effects on spelling, reading and writing", but more research is needed in order to determine its effectiveness in other areas, especially speaking online. She claims that students' perceptions of CALL are positive, but she qualifies this claim by stating that the technologies need to be stable and well supported, drawing attention to concerns that technical problems may interfere with the learning process. She also points out that older students may not feel comfortable with computers and younger students may not possess the necessary metaskills for coping effectively in the challenging new environments. Training in computer literacy for both students and teachers is essential, and time constraints may pose additional problems. In order to achieve meaningful results she recommends "time-series analysis in which the same group of students is involved in experimental and control treatment for a certain amount of time and then switched – more than once if possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felix | first1 = U | year = 2008 | title = The unreasonable effectiveness of CALL: what have we learned in two decades of research? | url = | journal = ReCALL | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 141–161 | doi=10.1017/s0958344008000323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of technology training in CALL for language teaching professionals certainly vary. Within second language teacher education programs, namely pre-service course work, we can find "online courses along with face-to-face courses", computer technology incorporated into a more general second language education course, "technology workshops","a series of courses offered throughout the teacher education programs, and even courses specifically designed for a CALL certificate and a CALL graduate degree"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = K. H. | year = 2010 | title = CALL teacher education as an impetus for 12 teachers in integrating technology | url = | journal = ReCALL | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 53–69 | doi = 10.1017/s095834400999019X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has identified four levels of courses with only components, namely "web-supplemented, web-dependent, mixed mod and fully online".&lt;ref&gt;Murray, D. E. (2013) A Case for Online English Language Teacher Education. The International Research Foundation for English Language Education. http://www.tirfonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/TIRF_OLTE_One-PageSpread_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a rapidly growing interest in resources about the use of technology to deliver CALL. Journals that have issues that "deal with how teacher education programs help prepare language teachers to use technology in their own classrooms" include ''Language Learning and Technology'' (2002), ''Innovations in Language Learning and Teaching'' (2009) and the TESOL international professional association's publication of technology standards for TESOL includes a chapter on preparation of teacher candidates in technology use, as well as the upgrading of teacher educators to be able to provide such instruction. Both CALICO and EUROCALL have special interest groups for teacher education in CALL.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, D. E. (2013) A Case for Online English Language Teacher Education. The International Research Foundation for English Language Education. http://www.tirfonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/TIRF_OLTE_One-PageSpread_2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Hirshhorn) ==
Within the conservation lab at the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], specialized activities for the treatment and care of paintings, sculpture, works on paper, and time-based media are performed. As an aid in treatment and to better understand the artist’s creative methods and materials, conservators closely examine works of art using a variety of technical tools, including stereo-binocular microscopes and ultraviolet light. Conservators also use an array of analytical methods to identify under-drawings, pigments, binding media, and coating materials. All treatments involve collaboration with curators, and frequently scientists, to determine the condition of a work of art, guide treatment decisions, and examine the artist’s working methods and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Conservation - Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden {{!}} Smithsonian|url = http://hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/conservation/#collection=conservation&amp;detail=http%253A//hirshhorn.si.edu/bio/conservation-department/&amp;title=Conservation+Department|website = Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden {{!}} Smithsonian|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2761">The '''Development Studies Association''' ('''DSA''') is the largest and most coherent national platform for development studies in the world. It is regarded as an influential network with a key role to play through its membership and convening power, internationally as well as nationally. It facilitates access to world leading research on development and its application to policy and practice.

The DSA aims to advance knowledge of the alternative processes and methods of socio-economic change, through supporting high quality research, teaching and practice in international development.  Its strategic objectives are to:&lt;br/&gt;
i) Mobilise collective capacity and knowledge&lt;br/&gt;
ii) Nurture the next generation&lt;br/&gt;
iii) Invest in development infrastructure in the UK and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;

Two key activities are its annual conference and its study groups.

The DSA annual conference gathers together scholars, practitioners, policy makers and other commentators to focus upon major contemporary international development issues in the largest gathering in the UK of the development community.

DSA Study Groups facilitate interaction and networking within the development studies community and encourage the development of new ideas contributing to ongoing debates about development in the UK and Ireland.  The study groups are sustained by active development studies professionals and usually meet at the Annual Conference and at specially convened meetings around the country.

The DSA was founded in 1978 and currently has 35 institutional members (primarily UK University departments/research centres with some development organisations) and 400 individual and student members.  It is governed by a Council made up of academics and practitioners working in international development elected at the Annual General Meeting.

[[File:Let alone2.jpg|thumb|''Lodgings to Let'', an 1814 engraving featuring a double entendre.&lt;br /&gt;He: "My sweet honey, I hope you are to be [[renting|let]] with the Lodgins!"&lt;br /&gt;She: "No, sir, I am to be let &lt;u&gt;alone&lt;/u&gt;".]]

A '''double entendre''' ({{IPAc-en|ɒ̃|ˈ|t|ɒ̃|d|(|r|ə|)}}; {{IPA-fr|dubl ɑ̃.tɑ̃dʁ(ə)|lang}}) is a [[figure of speech]] or a particular way of wording that is devised to be understood in two ways, having a double meaning. Typically one of the meanings is obvious, given the context, whereas the other may require more thought. The [[innuendo]] may convey a message that would be socially awkward, sexually suggestive, or offensive to state directly (the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' describes a double entendre as being used to "convey an indelicate meaning", whilst ''[[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]]'' defines it as "a word or phrase that may be understood in two different ways, one of which is often sexual").&lt;ref name="Longman"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/double-entendre | title=Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English online | publisher=Longman | work=Dictionary of Contemporary English | accessdate=29 August 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903083027/http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/double-entendre | archivedate=3 September 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A double entendre may exploit [[pun]]s to convey the second meaning. Double entendres generally rely on multiple meanings of words, or different interpretations of the same primary meaning. They often exploit [[ambiguity]] and may be used to introduce it deliberately in a text.  Sometimes a [[homophone]] (i.e., another word which sounds the same) can be used as a pun.  When three or more meanings have been constructed, this is known as a "triple entendre", etc.

== Structure ==
A person who is unfamiliar with the hidden or alternative meaning of a sentence may fail to detect its [[innuendo]]s, aside from observing that others find it humorous for no apparent reason. Perhaps because it is not offensive to those who do not recognise it, innuendo is often used in [[sitcom]]s and other [[comedy]] where the audience may enjoy the humour while being oblivious to its secondary meaning.

A triple entendre is a phrase that can be understood in any of three ways, such as in the back cover of the 1981 [[Rush (band)|Rush]] album ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'' which shows a [[moving company]] carrying paintings out of a building while people are shown being emotionally moved and a film crew makes a "[[moving picture]]" of the whole scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#82|title=The Rush Frequently Asked Questions on the Internet File|work=nimitz.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222184534/http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#82|archivedate=22 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The expression comes from [[French language|French]] ''double'' = "double" and ''entendre'' = "to hear" (but also "to understand"&lt;ref name="TLFi"&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/entendre definition of entendre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429210121/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/entendre |date=29 April 2012 }}, ''sub'' II at www.cnrtl.fr, accessed on 23 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;). However, the English formulation is a corruption of the authentic French expression ''à double entente'' ("double meaning").&lt;ref name="reverso"&gt;[http://dictionnaire.reverso.net/francais-definition/entente definition of Entente] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322053028/http://dictionnaire.reverso.net/francais-definition/entente |date=22 March 2012 }} at dictionnaire.reverso.net accessed on 20 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Modern French uses ''double sens'' instead; the phrase ''double entendre'' has no real meaning in the modern French language.

== Usage ==

=== Literature ===
In [[Homer]]'s ''The [[Odyssey]]'', when [[Odysseus]] is captured by the [[Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]], he tells the Cyclops that his name is Oudeis (ουδεις = No-one). When Odysseus attacks the Cyclops later that night and stabs him in the eye, the Cyclops runs out of his cave, yelling to the other cyclopes that "No-one has hurt me!", which leads the other cyclopes to take no action under the assumption that Polyphemus blinded himself by accident, allowing Odysseus and his men to escape.

[[File:Wanderer-Exeter-Book-first-page-Bernard-Muir.jpg|thumb|The first page of the poem "The Wanderer" found in the Exeter Book.]]
Some of the earliest double entendres are found in the [[Exeter Book]], or Codex exoniensis, at [[Exeter Cathedral]] in [[England]]. The book was copied around AD 975. In addition to the various poems and stories found in the book, there are also numerous riddles. The Anglo-Saxons did not reveal the answers to the riddles, but they have been answered by scholars over the years. Some riddles were double-entendres, such as [[Exeter Book#Riddle 25|Riddle 25]] ("I am a wondrous creature: to women a thing of joyful expectation, to close-lying companions serviceable. I harm no city-dweller excepting my slayer alone. My stem is erect and tall––I stand up in bed––and whiskery somewhere down below. Sometimes a countryman's quite comely daughter will venture, bumptious girl, to get a grip on me. She assaults my red self and seizes my head and clenches me in a cramped place. She will soon feel the effect of her encounter with me, this curl-locked woman who squeezes me. Her eye will be wet.") which suggests the answer "a [[Human penis|penis]]" but has the correct answer "an [[onion]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Exeter Book Riddles|url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/britannia/anglo-saxon/flowers/enigmata.html|website = penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of [[innuendo|sexual innuendo]] and double-entendre occur in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (14th century), in which the Wife of Bath's Tale is laden with double entendres. The most famous of these may be her use of the word "queynte" to describe both domestic duties (from the homonym "quaint") and genitalia ("queynte" being the root of '[[cunt]]', a [[Vulgarity|vulgar]] English word for [[vagina]]).  
The title of [[Sir Thomas More]]'s 1516 fictional work ''[[Utopia]]'' is a double entendre because of the [[pun]] between two [[Greek language|Greek]]-derived words that would have identical pronunciation: with his spelling, it means "no place"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.com/dictionary/Utopia|title=Utopia – Definition of utopia by Merriam-Webster|work=webster.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020052252/http://webster.com/dictionary/utopia|archivedate=20 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as echoed later in [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s later [[Erewhon]]); spelled as the rare word [[Eutopia]], it is pronounced the same&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Cousins, Macquarie University. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=8578 "Utopia."

The Literary Dictionary Company. {{Nowrap|3 January}} 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[English language|English]]-speaking readers, but has the meaning "good place".

Sometimes, it is unclear whether a double entendre was intended.  For example, the character [[Charley Bates]] from [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' is frequently referred to as Master Bates. The word "[[masturbation|masturbate]]" was in use when the book was written, and Dickens often used colourful names related to the natures of the characters.

The title of [[Damon Knight]]'s story ''[[To Serve Man]]'' is a double entendre which could mean "to perform a service to humanity" or "to serve a human as food". An alien [[cookbook]] with the title ''To Serve Man'' is featured in the story which could imply that the aliens eat humans. The story was the basis for [[To Serve Man (The Twilight Zone)|an episode]] of [[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|''The Twilight Zone'']]. At the end of the episode the line "It's a cookbook!" reveals the truth.

=== Stage performances ===
[[File:Wilhelm Maria Hubertus Leibl 010.jpg|thumb|right|Flax on a distaff]]
Shakespeare frequently used double entendres in his plays. [[Sir Toby Belch]] in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' says of [[Sir Andrew Aguecheek|Sir Andrew's]] hair, that "it hangs like [[flax]] on a [[distaff]]; and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off"; [[Nurse (Romeo and Juliet)|the Nurse]] in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' says that her husband had told [[Juliet]] when she was learning to walk that "Yea, dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit"; or is told the time by [[Mercutio]]: "for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the [[Prick (slang)|prick]] of noon";  and in ''[[Hamlet]]'', [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] publicly torments [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] with a series of sexual puns, including "country matters" (similar to "[[cunt]]"). The title of Shakespeare's play ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' is a pun on the Elizabethan use of "no-thing" as slang for [[vagina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Gordon |year=1997 |title=''A Glossary of Shakespeare's Sexual Language'' |publisher=Althone Press  |ISBN= 0-485-12130-1 |page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8313901/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gary | last=Dexter | title=Title Deed: How the Book Got its Name | date=13 February 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917011921/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8313901/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html | archivedate=17 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, starting in the 19th century, [[Victorian morality]] disallowed sexual innuendo in the theatre as being unpleasant, particularly for the ladies in the audience. In [[music hall]] songs, on the other hand, this kind of innuendo remained very popular. [[Marie Lloyd]]'s song "She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas" is an example of this. (Music hall in this context is to be compared with [[Variety show|Variety]], the one common, [[low-class]] and vulgar; the other [[demi-monde]], worldly and sometimes [[Chic (style)|chic]].)  In the 20th century there began to a crackdown on lewdness, including some prosecutions. It was the job of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] to examine the scripts of all plays for indecency. Nevertheless, some comedians still continued to get away with it. [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]], famously, had two books of jokes, a white book and a blue book, and would ask his audience which book they wanted to hear stories from. If they chose the blue book, he could blame the audience for the lewdness to follow, the white book was rarely used (in the UK, 'blue' [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] refers to sexual content, as in 'blue jokes', 'blue movies' etc.).

=== Radio and television ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
In the United States, innuendo and double entendre were only lightly used in radio media until the 1980s when the [[Howard Stern Show]] began to push the envelope of what was acceptable on the radio through use of double entendre and ironies. This garnered so much attention it spawned an entire genre of Radio called "[[Shock Jock]] Radio" where DJs will push the limits of what is an "acceptable" double entendre to use on over the air as the FCC has been known to hand out large fines for the use of double entendre on radio if they deem it to be in violation of their standards.

In Britain, innuendo humour began to transfer to [[radio]] and [[film|cinema]] from the late 1950s on. Particularly significant in this respect were the ''[[Carry On (series)|Carry On]]'' series of films and the [[BBC]] radio series ''[[Round the Horne]]'', although some of ''Round the Horne'' appeared to be nonsense language, the protagonists were sometimes having 'rude' conversations in [[Polari]] (gay slang). ''Round the Horne'' depended heavily on innuendo and double entendre, the show's name itself being a triple entendre, a play on the name of its central actor [[Kenneth Horne]] and those around him, the sailor's expression 'going round the horn' (i.e. [[Cape Horn]]), and the fact that 'horn' is slang for an [[erection]]. [[Spike Milligan]], writer of ''[[The Goon Show]]'', remarked that a lot of 'blue' (i.e. sexual) innuendo came from servicemen's jokes, which most of the cast understood (they all had been soldiers) and many of the audience understood, but which passed over the heads of most of the Senior BBC producers and directors, most of whom were "Officer class".

In 1968, the office of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] ceased to have responsibility for censoring live [[entertainment]], after the [[Theatres Act 1968]]. By the 1970s innuendo had become widely used across much of the British broadcast media, including [[British sitcom|sitcoms]] and [[radio comedy]], such as ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''. For example, in the 1970s TV comedy series ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'', Mrs. Slocombe frequently referred to her pet cat as her "pussy", apparently unaware of how easily her statement could be misinterpreted, such as "It's a wonder I'm here at all, you know. My pussy got soakin' wet. I had to dry it out in front of the fire before I left". Someone unfamiliar with sexual slang might find this statement funny simply because of the references to her sodden cat, whereas others would find further humour in the [[innuendo]] ("pussy" being [[sexual slang]] for vulva).

Modern comedies, such as the US version of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', often do not hide the addition of sexual innuendos into the script; for example, main character [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] often deploys the phrase "[[Said the actress to the bishop|that's what she said]]" after another character's innocent statement, to turn it retroactively into a sexual pun.

On The Scott Mills Show on [[BBC Radio 1]], listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with double meanings in a humorous context, a feature known as "Innuendo Bingo". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innuendo Bingo|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|accessdate=15 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102185555/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movies ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Double entendres are popular in modern movies, as a way to conceal adult humour in a work aimed at general audiences. The [[James Bond]] films are rife with such humour.  For example, in ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997), when Bond is disturbed by the telephone while in bed with a Danish girl, he explains to Moneypenny that he is busy "brushing up on a little Danish".  Moneypenny responds by pointing out that Bond was known as "a cunning linguist", a play on the word "[[cunnilingus]]". In the final scene of ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', while Bond is taking Dr Holly Goodhead “round the world one more time”, Q says to Sir Frederick Gray, “I think he’s attempting re-entry, sir.” In ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (1999), while in bed with Dr [[Christmas Jones]], Bond tells her “I thought Christmas only comes once a year”. Other obvious examples include [[Pussy Galore]] in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and [[Holly Goodhead]] in ''Moonraker''. The double entendres of the Bond films were parodied in the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' series.

Bawdy double entendres, such as "I'm the kinda girl who works for Paramount by day, and Fox all night", and (from the movie ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'') "I feel like a million tonight — but only one at a time", are typical of the comedy writing of [[Mae West]], for her early-career vaudeville performances as well as for her later plays and movies.

=== Music ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Double entendres are very common in the titles and lyrics of pop songs, such as "[[If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me]]" by The Bellamy Brothers, which is based on an old [[Groucho Marx]] quote. By one interpretation, the person being talked to is asked if they would be offended; by the other interpretation, they are asked if they would press their body against the person doing the talking.

Singer and songwriter [[Bob Dylan]], in his somewhat controversial song "[[Rainy Day Women No. 12 &amp; 35|Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35]]", repeats the line "Everybody must get stoned". In context, the phrase refers to the punishment of [[capital punishment|execution]] by [[stoning]], but on another level it means to 'get stoned', a common slang term for being high on [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. In their song "Big Balls" on the album ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]'', [[AC/DC]] the chorus "we've got big balls" can be read as referring to either [[ball (dance)|formal dances]] or [[testicle]]s.  During the 1940s, [[Benny Bell]] recorded several "party records" that contained double entendre including "Everybody Wants My Fanny".

=== Social interaction ===
Double entendres can arise in the replies to inquiries. The clichéd phrase "[[that's what she said]]", as well as "so to speak" can be used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fighter Pilot Speak | url = http://christianfighterpilot.com/blog/2006/06/13/fighter-pilot-linguistic-games-so-to-speak/ | accessdate = 11 February 2017 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150123010403/http://christianfighterpilot.com/blog/2006/06/13/fighter-pilot-linguistic-games-so-to-speak/ | archivedate = 23 January 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to remark on a sentence said by another which was not intended as a double entendre but nevertheless could be interpreted with a double meaning, one of them sexual. In recent times, due to prevalence of [[Meme|memes]], the sentence "If you know what I mean" has taken a similar meaning.

[[File:Drexler-Smalley cover.jpg|thumb|The debate between [[K. Eric Drexler]] and [[Richard Smalley]] on the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s began in 2001 and concluded in a cover story in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' in 2003.]]

The '''Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology''' was a public dispute between [[K. Eric Drexler]], the originator of the conceptual basis of [[molecular nanotechnology]], and [[Richard Smalley]], a recipient of the 1996 [[Nobel prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of the [[nanomaterial]] [[buckminsterfullerene]]. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing [[molecular assembler]]s, which are [[molecular machine]]s which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.

The debate was carried out from 2001 to 2003 through a series of published articles and [[open letter]]s. It began with a 2001 article by Smalley in ''[[Scientific American]]'', which was followed by a [[Counterargument|rebuttal]] published by Drexler and coworkers later that year, and two open letters by Drexler in early 2003. The debate was concluded in late 2003 in a "Point–Counterpoint" feature in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' in which both parties participated.

The debate has been often cited in the [[history of nanotechnology]] due to the fame of its participants and its commentary on both the technical and social aspects of [[nanotechnology]]. It has also been widely criticized for its adversarial tone, with Drexler accusing Smalley of publicly misrepresenting his work, and Smalley accusing Drexler of failing to understand basic science, causing commentators to go so far as to characterize the tone of the debate as similar to "a [[pissing contest|pissing match]]"&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"&gt;{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Steven A.  |title=The Nanotech Pioneers: Where Are They Taking Us?  |location=Weinheim |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2006 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "reminiscent of [a] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch".&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=Yes, They Can!

==The participants==

===K. Eric Drexler===
[[File:Eric Drexler 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|K. Eric Drexler developed and popularized the concept of nanotechnology and founded the field of [[molecular nanotechnology]].]]

{{main|K. Eric Drexler}}

K. Eric Drexler is generally considered to have written the first scholarly paper on the topic of nanotechnology,&lt;ref name=edwardsdrexler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pelesko |first=John A. |title=Self-assembly: the science of things that put themselves together |year=2007 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=New York |isbn=978-1-58488-687-7 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a key figure in popularizing these concepts through several publications and advocacy work.&lt;ref name=edwardsdrexler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toumey|first=Christopher|title=Reading Feynman into nanotechnology: a text for a new science|journal=Techné|date=Fall 2008|volume=12|issue=3|page=133–168|doi=10.5840/techne20081231|url=http://litsciarts.org/slsa08/slsa08-650.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trained as an engineer, Drexler was inspired by a then-obscure 1959 talk by physicist [[Richard Feynman]] called ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]'', which posited that it should be physically possible to manipulate individual atoms using [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] engineering methodologies. Drexler was also inspired by recent advances in [[molecular biology]] such as [[recombinant DNA]] technology. In a 1981 publication in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', considered to be the first journal article on nanotechnology, he argued that biological systems such as the [[ribosome]] were already capable of building molecules atom-by-atom, and that artificial machines with this capability could also be constructed. Drexler went on to publish two books on nanotechnology: ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' in 1986, which was intended for the public, and the technical work ''Nanosystems'' in 1992. He also co-founded the [[Foresight Institute]], a public interest group devoted to increasing public awareness and information about molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="edwardsdrexler"&gt;Edwards, pp. 15–21, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drexler's vision of nanotechnology, now called [[molecular nanotechnology]], is based on the concept of the [[molecular assembler]], a [[molecular machine]] which would manufacture molecules and molecular devices atom-by-atom. Drexler drew a distinction between [[wet nanotechnology]] based on biological systems, and "second-generation" dry nanotechnology which would be based on [[mechanosynthesis]], positional control of molecules through principles more related to [[mechanical engineering]]. Drexler and his followers have focused almost exclusively on the latter form of molecular nanotechnology, but Drexler has stated that both are valid pathways to creating molecular machine systems.&lt;ref name="edwardsdrexler"/&gt;

===Richard Smalley===
[[File:Richard Smalley.jpg|thumb|250px|Richard Smalley won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with [[Harry Kroto]] and [[Robert Curl]] for their 1985 discovery of [[buckminsterfullerene]].]]

{{main|Richard Smalley}}

Richard E. Smalley, a chemist at [[Rice University]], was best known as a co-discoverer of the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; [[Allotropes of carbon|form of carbon]] known as [[buckminsterfullerene]] in 1985, along with [[Harry Kroto]], [[Robert Curl]], [[James R. Heath|James Heath]], and [[Sean O'Brien (scientist)|Sean O'Brien]]. Buckminsterfullerene was the first to be discovered of the class of molecules known as [[fullerenes]], which also includes [[carbon nanotube]]s. The study and application of fullerenes forms a significant part of the fields of [[nanomaterials]] and [[nanoelectronics]], and Smalley, Kroto, and Curl were awarded the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 27, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley had also taken a prominent [[public policy]] role in relation to nanotechnology, and was an outspoken advocate for using nanotechnology to develop solutions to the world's energy and health problems, for example raising the possibility of [[Energy applications of nanotechnology|using nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and transmission]], and of developing [[Nanomedicine|nanomaterial-based drugs]] for [[targeted drug delivery]]. Smalley was also active in commercializing his academic research into carbon nanotubes, having founded Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc., and serving on the scientific advisory board of two other biotechnology and nanotechnology [[Startup company|startups]]. Smalley died of [[leukemia]] in October 2005, after the conclusion of his debate with Drexler.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 132, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berube"/&gt;

Smalley wrote an article, "Of Chemistry, Love, and Nanobots", for the September 2001 issue of the [[popular science]] magazine ''[[Scientific American]]'', which was a special issue on the topic of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F90C4210-C153-4B2F-83A1-28F2012B637|date=September 2001| journal=Scientific American| title=Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots| first= Richard E.| last= Smalley |pmid=11524973| volume=285| issue=3| pages=76–7| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0901-76| bibcode=2001SciAm.285c..76S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smalley opened by comparing a chemical reaction to an intricate dance of atoms:

{{Quote|When a boy and a girl fall in love, it is often said that the chemistry between them is good. This common use of the word "chemistry" in human relations comes close to the subtlety of what actually happens in the more mundane coupling of molecules. In a chemical reaction between two 'consenting' molecules, bonds form between some of the atoms in what is usually a complex dance involving motion in multiple dimensions.... And if the chemistry is really, really good, the molecules that do react will all produce the exact product required.}}

He referenced the idea of a [[molecular assembler]], a [[nanorobot]] capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product, posing the question of how long it would take such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material. He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one [[Mole (chemistry)|mole]] of material, but [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating]] assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond. Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely, causing a [[grey goo]] scenario, or, referring to [[Bill Joy]]'s previous article "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]", that the nanorobots could develop [[swarm intelligence]] and become alive in some sense.

Smalley then considered how realistic the concept of a self-replicating nanorobot was. He noted that in a chemical reaction, the [[chemical bond]]s are all interconnected and that the placement of each atom is sensitive to the position of all the other atoms in the vicinity. He then asserted that a molecular assembler would thus have to control many atoms simultaneously in order to work, and would thus have to have many manipulator arms. This led him to raise two objections to the concept of molecular assembler, which he called the "fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem":

{{Quote|Because the fingers of a manipulator arm must themselves be made out of atoms, they have a certain irreducible size. There just isn't enough room in the nanometer-size reaction region to accommodate all the fingers of all the manipulators necessary to have complete control of the chemistry.... [Also,] the atoms of the manipulator hands will adhere to the atom that is being moved. So it will often be impossible to release this minuscule building block in precisely the right spot. Both these problems are fundamental, and neither can be avoided. Self-replicating, mechanical nanobots are simply not possible in our world.}}

Smalley closed the article by returning to the analogy of chemistry as a dance of love, remarking that "you don't make a girl and a boy fall in love by pushing them together."

===Drexler's response===

Bottom, a schematic of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]], which Drexler cited as being able to manipulate individual molecules via [[Mechanosynthesis|positional control]].|alt1=Ribosome schematic|alt2=Scanning tunneling microscope schematic}}

Drexler responded by publishing a rebuttal later in 2001 through the [[Institute for Molecular Manufacturing]], which was co-authored with others including [[Robert Freitas]], [[J. Storrs Hall]], and [[Ralph Merkle]].&lt;ref name="drexlerresponse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.php |title=On Physics, Fundamentals, and Nanorobots: A Rebuttal to Smalley’s Assertion that Self-Replicating Mechanical Nanorobots Are Simply Not Possible |publisher=Institute for Molecular Manufacturing |year=2001 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |first1=K. Eric |last1=Drexler |first2=David |last2=Forrest |first3=Robert A. |last3=Freitas |first4=J. Storrs |last4=Hall |first5=Neil |last5=Jacobstein |first6=Tom |last6=McKendree |first7=Ralph |last7=Merkle |first8=Christine |last8=Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors first discussed the "fat fingers" argument by attacking Smalley's notion that a chemical reaction must involve five to fifteen atoms, stating that many reactions involve only two reactants, one of which can be immobilized and the other attached to a single "finger". They cited as evidence experimental and theoretical results indicating that using [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) tips and related technologies could be used as a reactive structure for positional control and for interaction with surface-bound molecules. They also noted that atomically precise final products do not require precise control of all aspects of the chemical reaction. The authors noted that the "sticky fingers" problem is valid in some reactions, but argue that it would be fallacious to conclude that all reactions have this problem.

The authors put forth the [[ribosome]] as an example of a natural molecular machine; because the ribosome suffers from neither problem, they must not be fundamental, saying:

{{Quote|This ubiquitous biological molecular assembler suffers from neither the “fat finger” nor the “sticky finger” problem. If, as Smalley argues, both problems are “fundamental,” then why would they prevent the development of mechanical assemblers and not biological assemblers? If the class of molecular structures known as proteins can be synthesized using positional techniques, then why would we expect there to be no other classes of molecular structures that can be synthesized using positional techniques?}}

The authors also questioned Smalley's figures for the replication time of nanomachines. Instead of Smalley's figure of 1&amp;nbsp;GHz for the atomic placement frequency, they point out that ''Nanosystems'' suggested a frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, a thousand times slower, and that at Smalley's higher frequency diamondoid nanomachines would overheat and decompose in milliseconds. The authors called this a [[straw man]] argument, writing that "in a serious scientific discussion, a discrepancy of three orders of magnitude between what has been proposed in the literature and what is criticized suggests at best an inadequate grasp of the proposal."  The authors closed by stating that the best way to find out whether molecular assemblers are feasible is through experimental and theoretical work, and that "there are many worthy molecular systems engineering challenges to overcome, but thus far, there has been no credible argument that these devices are infeasible."

Drexler followed up with two open letters to Smalley in April and July 2003. The April letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=An Open Letter on Assemblers|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/Letter.html|publisher=Foresight Institute|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; began, "I have written this open letter to correct your public misrepresentation of my work."  Drexler accused Smalley of continuing to dismiss his work by publicly describing molecular assemblers as requiring what Drexler now calls "Smalley fingers", which he stated to be unlike the enzyme-like systems he had actually proposed. He asserted:

{{Quote|The impossibility of "Smalley fingers" has raised no concern in the research community because these fingers solve no problems and thus appear in no proposals. Your reliance on this straw-man attack might lead a thoughtful observer to suspect that no one has identified a valid criticism of my work. For this I should, perhaps, thank you.}}

Drexler compared the nanotechnology debate's importance to that of discussions of spaceflight before [[Sputnik]] or to theoretical work on [[nuclear chemistry]] before the [[Manhattan Project]]. He disputed Smalley's arguments that the fear of a grey goo scenario would hinder continued funding of nanotechnology research, arguing that the potential for long-term risks made research even more important. His conclusion stated, "your misdirected arguments have needlessly confused public discussion of genuine long-term security concerns."

The July 2003 letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=Toward closure|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/Letter2.html|publisher=Foresight Institute|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=2 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; referenced a note from Smalley promising to respond, which had yet gone unfulfilled. Drexler mentions inconsistencies in Smalley's previous public statements on atom-by-atom construction, and ended by stating "I would not ordinarily raise an issue so persistently, but the question of what nanotechnology can ultimately achieve is perhaps the most fundamental issue in the field today—it shapes basic objectives and expectations—and your words have been remarkably effective in changing how this issue is perceived."

===Exchange of letters in ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News''===
[[File:Nanob.jpg|thumb|A depiction of a putative [[technomimetic]] molecular [[planetary gear]] set. Smalley questioned whether devices like these could be constructed using an [[enzyme]]-like mechanical process, either in an [[aqueous solution]] or with some other chemistry, and whether such devices would be operational at all.]]

The debate was concluded in a "Point–Counterpoint" feature that was the 1 December 2003 cover story of ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'', the newsmagazine of the [[American Chemical Society]].&lt;ref name="counterpoint"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers' |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume=81 |issue=48 |pages=37–42 |publisher=American Chemical Society |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |doi=10.1021/cen-v081n036.p037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The feature first reproduced Drexler's April 2003 open letter to Smalley. Smalley's response began by apologizing for any offense his September 2001 article had caused, and stating that Drexler's book ''Engines of Creation'' had triggered Smalley's own interest in nanotechnology. He agreed that "Smalley fingers" could not work, and then asserted that the same reasons that would preclude atomic control of reactions would also preclude the manipulation of larger building blocks, since each molecule would have multiple atoms which would need to be controlled

He then agreed that something like an enzyme or ribosome would be capable of precise chemistry, but asked how the nanorobot would be able to obtain, control, and repair such an enzyme, and noted the incompatibility of many reactions with water-based biological systems, stating that "biology is wonderous in the vast diversity of what it can build, but it can't make a crystal of silicon, or steel, or copper, or aluminum, or titanium, or virtually any of the key materials on which modern technology is built." Smalley asked what kind of "nonaqueous enzymelike chemistry" Drexler would envision for his molecular assemblers to operate upon, calling this "a vast area of chemistry that has eluded us for centuries."

Drexler's counterresponse began by returning to Feynman's 1959 talk, stating that "although inspired by biology... Feynman's vision of nanotechnology is fundamentally mechanical, not biological." He characterized the challenges as being that of [[systems engineering]] rather than solely chemistry, and referred Smalley to ''Nanosystems'', with its vision of mechanical control of chemical reactions with no enzymes and no reliance on solvents or thermal motion. He stated:

{{Quote|Positional control naturally avoids most side reactions by preventing unwanted encounters between potential reactants. Transition-state theory indicates that, for suitably chosen reactants, positional control will enable synthetic steps at megahertz frequencies with the reliability of digital switching operations in a computer. The supporting analysis for this conclusion appears in "Nanosystems" and has withstood a decade of scientific scrutiny.}}

Drexler reiterated that these molecular assemblers would require no impossible fingers, and would augment solution-phase chemistry to produce [[macroscopic]] products with precise arrangements of chemical building blocks, using solution-phase molecular assemblers to [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] the construction of more sophisticated assemblers. He concluded by writing:

{{Quote|U.S. progress in molecular manufacturing has been impeded by the dangerous illusion that it is infeasible. I hope you will agree that the actual physical principles of molecular manufacturing are sound and quite unlike the various notions, many widespread in the press, that you have correctly rejected. I invite you to join me and others in the call to augment today's nanoscale research with a systems engineering effort aimed at achieving the grand vision articulated by Richard Feynman.}}

Smalley began his concluding letter:

{{Quote|I see you have now walked out of the room where I had led you to talk about real chemistry, and you are now back in your mechanical world. I am sorry we have ended up like this. For a moment I thought we were making progress. You still do not appear to understand the impact of my short piece in Scientific American. Much like you can't make a boy and a girl fall in love with each other simply by pushing them together, you cannot make precise chemistry occur as desired between two molecular objects with simple mechanical motion along a few degrees of freedom in the assembler-fixed frame of reference. Chemistry, like love, is more subtle than that.}}

Smalley stated his belief that most reactions using mechanosynthesis would simply give the wrong product, and that very few reactions and target molecules would likely be compatible with such an approach. He asserted that any robotic assembler arm would need an enzyme-like tool at its end such would require a liquid medium, and as all known enzymes use water as that medium, the range of products must be limited to the "meat and bone of biology."  He accused Drexler of creating "a pretend world where atoms go where you want because your computer program directs them to go there."

Lastly, Smalley recounted his recent experience reading essays written by middle and high school students after an outreach visit, saying that nearly half of them thought that self-replicating nanorobots were possible and that most were worried about the results of them spreading across the world. Smalley called this a deeply troubling bedside story that he did his best to allay. Smalley concluded his letter:

{{Quote|You and people around you have scared our children. I don't expect you to stop, but I hope others in the chemical community will join with me in turning on the light, and showing our children that, while our future in the real world will be challenging and there are real risks, there will be no such monster as the self-replicating mechanical nanobot of your dreams.}}

==Critical response==
{{multiple image|direction=horizontal|image1=Raymond Kurzweil Fantastic Voyage.jpg|width1=160|image2=Lessig portrait.jpg|width2=150|footer=The Drexler–Smalley debate attracted commentary from figures such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] (left) and [[Lawrence Lessig]] (right).|alt1=Ray Kurzweil in 2005|alt2=Lawrence Lessig in 2009}}

===Tone===
The debate has been widely criticized for its adversarial tone. David Berube in ''Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz'' characterized it as "two people talking over each other... not conducive to reasonable rebuttal," and quoted nanotechnology blogger and journalist Howard Lovy as saying "the tenor of the debate is about personal pride, reputation, and a place in the pantheon."&lt;ref name="berube"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berube |first=David |title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2006 |url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1822/ |pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Zyvex]] founder James von Ehr remarked that "Eric [Drexler] didn't do himself any favors by getting into a [[Pissing contest|pissing match]] with a Nobel-prize winner."&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"/&gt;  An article in ''The New York Times'' called the debate "reminiscent of that old ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch... [with] Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin tossing insults at each other while ostensibly debating a serious political issue," referring to a version of the long-running [[Weekend Update#Jane Curtin (1976–1980)|Weekend Update]] segment.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

===Technical commentary===
The debate has received technical criticism as well. Steven A. Edwards in ''The Nanotech Pioneers'' noted that the ambiguity of the specifications and even definition of a molecular assembler makes an evaluation of the argument difficult and minimizes its scientific implications. He remarked that "nowhere in it does ''Nanosystems'' contain a blueprint for a molecular assembler... We are told, for instance, that a manipulator arm would involve 4,000,000 atoms, but we are not told which atoms, or how they would be put together."  He concludes that "the debate over mechanosynthesis so far is huge to the participants, but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most nanotechnologists."&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"/&gt;

On the other hand, [[futurist]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' declared Drexler as the winner of the debate,&lt;ref name="kurzweil"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-14-303788-9|pages=236&amp;ndash;241}}&lt;/ref&gt; reiterating the view that Smalley distorted Drexler's ideas and calling Smalley's responses "short on specific citations and current research and long on imprecise metaphors" and asserting that "Smalley is ignoring the past decade of research on alternative means of positioning molecular fragments using precisely guided molecular reactions... [which have] been extensively studied."  He quoted experimental results on enzyme function in nonaqueous solutions, and pointed out that modern non-biological technology such as airplanes and computers have exceeded the capabilities of natural biological systems. He also noted that "earlier critics also expressed skepticism that either worldwide communication networks or software viruses that would spread across them were feasible... [but today] we are obtaining far more gain than harm from this latest example of intertwined promise and peril."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-drexler-smalley-debate-on-molecular-assembly&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary on public perception of nanotechnology===
The debate's focus on the public perception of nanotechnology has also received commentary. Political blogger [[Glenn Reynolds]] stated that "the business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology just seems too, well, spooky—and worse, that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into the way of bringing products to market."&lt;ref name="berubesocial"&gt;Berube, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lawrence Lessig]] criticized the scientific establishment, represented by Smalley, for arguing that "if so-called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci-fi movies and forgotten after Labor Day, then serious work can continue, supported by billion-dollar funding and uninhibited by the idiocy that buries, for example, stem cell research."&lt;ref name="berubesocial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|title=Stamping Out Good Science|date=July 2004|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/view.html?pg=5|accessdate=12 July 2011|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kurzweil wrote that Smalley's approach to reassuring the public would backfire because it denied both the benefits and risks of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="kurzweil"/&gt;

'''Epigenetic theories of homosexuality''' concern the studies of changes in [[gene expression]] or cellular [[phenotype]] caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying [[DNA sequence]], and their role in the development of [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Rice WR, Friberg U, Gavrilets S. 2013. Homosexuality via canalized sexual development: A testing protocol for a new epigenetic model. BioEssays 35: 343-368 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Rice W. R., Friberg U., and Gavrilets S. 2016. Sexually antagonistic epigenetic marks that canalize sexually dimorphic development. Molecular Ecology 12: DOI: 10.1111/mec.13490 &lt;/ref&gt;
[[Epigenetics]] examines the set of chemical reactions that switch parts of the [[genome]] on and off at strategic times and locations in the organism's [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. However, epigenetic theories tangle a multiplicity of initiating causes and of resulting final effects and will never lead to a single cause or a single result. Hence, any interpretation of such theories may not focus just one isolated reason of a multiplicity of causes or of effects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/de/evolution/ausbildungskonzepte.html Ausbildungskonzept "Integrated approaches to teach and study the role of evolution for the emergence of biological complexity"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of affecting the organism's DNA sequence, non-genetic factors may cause the organism’s genes to express themselves differently. DNA in the human body is wrapped around [[histone]]s, which are [[protein]]s that package and order DNA into structural units. DNA and histone are covered with [[chemical tag]]s known as the [[epigenome]], which shapes the physical structure of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/ "The Epigenome at a Glance."] Genetic Science Learning Center. The University of Utah, 2013. Web. 10 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It tightly wraps inactive genes on the DNA sequence making those genes unreadable while loosely wrapping active genes making them more expressive. The more tightly wrapped the gene, the less it will be expressed in the organism. These epigenetic tags react to stimuli presented from the outside world. It adjusts specific genes in the genome to respond to humans' rapidly changing environments. 
The idea of epigenetics and gene expression has been a theory applied to the origins of homosexuality in humans. One team of researchers examined the effects of [[epi-mark]]s buffering [[XY sex-determination system|XX]] [[fetus]]es and [[XY sex-determination system|XY]] fetuses from certain [[androgen]] exposure and used published data on fetal androgen signaling and [[gene regulation]] through non-genetic changes in DNA packaging to develop a new model for homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;Richards, Sabrina. [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33773/title/Can-Epigenetics-Explain-Homosexuality-/ "Can Epigenetics Explain Homosexuality?."] The Scientist. N.p., 1 Jan. 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found that stronger than average epi-marks, epigenomes that are wrapped tightly around the DNA sequence, convert [[sexual preference]] in individuals without altering [[genitalia]] or [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref&gt;"National Geographic Explains the Biology of Homosexuality." YouTube. YouTube, 04 Feb. 2009. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
This research gives support to the [[hypothesis]] that homosexuality stems from the under expression of certain genes on the DNA sequence involved with sexual preferences. This theory as well as other concepts involved with epi-marks, [[twin studies]], and fetal androgen signaling will be explored here.

== Epigenetic marks ==
{{details|Epigenetics}}

Epigenetic marks (epi-marks) are temporary "switches" that control how our genes are expressed during [[gestation]] and after birth. Moreover, epi-marks  are modifications of histone proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthenburg, A., C. Allis, and J. Wysocka. "Methylation of Lysine 4 on Histone H3: Intricacy of Writing and Reading a Single Epigenetic Mark." Molecular Cell 25.1 (2007): 15-30. Print. {{pmid|17218268}} {{doi|10.1016/j.molcel.2006.12.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic marks are modifications of the [[methyl]] and [[acetyl]] groups that bind to DNA histones thereby changing how the proteins function and as a result, alter gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka E and MJ Lamb (2010). Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.

However, they can be passed on to [[offspring]] through the process of [[mitosis]]. When they are transferred from one parent to an offspring of the opposite sex, it can contribute to an altered sexual development, thus leading to [[masculinization]] of female offspring and [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] of male offspring.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/25431-gene-regulation-homosexuality.html "Gene Regulation May Explain How Homosexuality Flourishes."] LiveScience.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these epi-marks hold no consistency between individuals in regard to strength and variability.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

== Twin studies ==

[[Identical twin]]s have identical DNA, which leads to the perceived conclusion that all identical twins are either [[heterosexual]] or homosexual. However, it is evident that this is not the case, consequently leaving a gap in the explanation for homosexuality. A "gay" gene does not produce homosexuality. Rather, epigenetic modifications act as temporary "switches" that regulate how the genes are expressed.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"/&gt; Of the pairs of identical twins in which one twin is homosexual, only twenty percent of the other twins are homosexual, which leads to the hypothesis that even though identical twins share the same DNA, homosexuality is created by something else rather than the genes. Epigenetic transformation allows the on and off switching of certain genes, subsequently shaping how cells respond to androgen signaling, which is critical in sexual development.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;
Another example of epigenetic consequences is evident in [[multiple sclerosis]] in [[monozygotic]] (identical) twins. There are pairs of twins that are discordant with multiple sclerosis and do not both show the trait. After [[gene testing]], it was suggested that DNA was identical and that epigenetic differences contributed to the gene difference between identical twins.&lt;ref&gt;Handunnetthi, Lahiru, Adam Handel, and Sreeram V. Ramagopalan. Contribution of Genetic, Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Differences to Twin Discordance in Multiple Sclerosis. Ebsco Host. Psyc Info, 2010. Web. {{pmid|20819009}} {{doi|10.1586/ern.10.116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of fetal androgen exposure ==

While in the fetal stages, hormonal influences of [[androgen]], specifically [[testosterone]], cause feminine qualities in regard to sexual development in females and masculine qualities in males. In typical sexual development, females are exposed to minimal amounts of testosterone, thus feminizing their sexual development, while males are typically exposed to high levels of testosterone, which masculinize their development. Epi-marks play a critical role in this development by acting as a buffer between the fetus and androgen exposure. Moreover, they predominantly protect XY fetuses from androgen underexposure while protecting XX fetuses from androgen overexposure.&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt; However, when androgen overexposure happens in XX fetuses, research suggests they can show masculinized behavior in comparison to females who undergo normal levels of androgen exposure. The research also suggests that excess androgen exposure in females led to reduced heterosexual interest in adulthood than did females with normal levels of androgen.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, Charles, Gerard S. Conway, and Melissa Hines. "Androgen and Psychosexual Development: Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Recalled Childhood Gender Role Behavior in Women and Men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)." Journal of Sex Research 41.1 (2004): 75-81. Online {{pmid|15216426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heritability ==

New epi-marks are usually produced with each generation, but these marks sometimes carry over between [[generation]]s. Sex-specific epi-marks are produced in early fetal development that protect each sex from the natural disparity in testosterone that occurs during later stages of fetal development. Different epi-marks protect different sex-specific traits from being masculinized or feminized—some affect the genitals, others affect sexual identity, and yet others affect sexual preference. However, when these epi-marks are transmitted across generations from fathers to daughters or mothers to sons, they may cause reversed effects, such as the feminization of some traits in sons and similarly a partial masculinization of daughters. Furthermore, the reversed effects of feminization and masculinization can lead to a reversed sexual preference. For example, sex-specific epi-marks normally prevent female fetuses from being masculinized through exposure of atypically high [[testosterone]], and vice versa for male fetuses. Sex-specific epi-marks are normally erased and not passed between generations. However, they can sometimes escape erasure and are then transferred from a father's genes to a daughter or from a mother's genes to a son. When this happens, this may lead to an altered sexual preference.&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt; Epi-marks normally protect parents from variation in sex hormone levels during fetal development, but can carry over across generations and subsequently lead to homosexuality in opposite-sex offspring. This demonstrates that [[gene coding]] for these epi-marks can spread in the population because they benefit the development and fitness of the parent but only rarely escape erasure, leading to same-sex sexual preference in offspring.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Figure/Ground''' is an open-source, para-academic, inter-disciplinary website which publishes in-depth interviews with scholars, researchers, and university professors, as well as artists, filmmakers, and creators of every stripe. Figure/Ground was a finalist in 2012 [[Canadian Online Publishing Awards]] and the 2013 [[Edublog Award]]s, and received the 2012 [[New Canadian Weblog Award]] (education category) as well as the 2013 [[John Culkin Award]] for outstanding praxis by the [[Media Ecology Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards|url=http://figureground.org/support-us/|website=Figure/Ground|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Figure/Ground began as a personal blog founded by [[Laureano Ralón]] in 2009. It claims to contain one of the largest collections of scholarly interviews on the web, with numerous volunteer collaborators ranging from senior undergraduates to PhD candidates. 

==Mission==
According to the About page in the website: 

Figure/Ground sits on the edges of the academy and the art world; our aim is to bring the voices of academics and artists out of their specialized domains of practice and give them a venue for speaking frankly to the public at large.
Conversation is one of the most basic forms of human communication, yet the interview is a deeply undervalued genre within academic discourse. The majority of [[peer-reviewed journal]]s in the humanities and social sciences publish mostly essays and book reviews. In an age of digital interactive media, we believe the interview genre can serve as a powerful pedagogic tool and as a primary source for the production of new knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://figureground.org/about-fg/|website=Figure/Ground|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The collection is named for the [[David Green (entrepreneur)|Green family]], founders and leaders of [[Hobby Lobby]], the world’s largest privately owned arts and crafts retailer. The collection was assembled beginning in November 2009 by its original director, ancient/medieval manuscript specialist Scott Carroll, in cooperation with Steve Green, president of [[Hobby Lobby]] and the collection's benefactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fabrikant|first=Geraldine|title=Craft Shop Family Buys Up Ancient Bibles for Museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/business/12bibles.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=8 April 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bible Collection Goes on Tour|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/1118899846001/bible-collection-goes-on-tour|accessdate=19 December 2011|station=Fox News|date=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highlights==
[[Image:Codex Climaci Rescriptus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Codex Climaci Rescriptus]]]]

The capstone of The Green Collection is the [[Codex Climaci Rescriptus]], known as Uncial 0250 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering); which is a [[palimpsest]] whose underwriting includes pages from a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament, as well as pages from a Christian Palestinian Aramaic uncial manuscript of the Old and New Testament. Paleographically the Greek section has been assigned to the 8th century (or 7th century), and the Christian Palestinian Aramaic section to the 6th century.

===Provenance===
In 2015 questions were raised about the provenance of some articles in the collection when ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' ran a story about two or three hundred [[cuneiform]] tablets purchased form an Israeli antiquities dealer and confiscated by U.S. Customs when they were being shipped to the Green collection storage facility in Oklahoma City in 2011.  As of 2015, the tablets remained impounded as a legal dispute regarding the possible illegal purchase of antiquities removed from a conflict zone (Mesopotamia) proceeds.&lt;ref name=Vikan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vikan|first1=Gary|title=Probe of Steve Green’s antiquities may be inevitable; his response is not|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2015/10/30/probe-steve-greens-antiquities-may-inevitable-response-not-commentary/|accessdate=9 November 2015|publisher=[[Religion News Service]]|date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum of the Bible==
{{main|Museum of the Bible}}
In 2012, Steve Green announced his family's intention to open a permanent institution, which he claimed would be a scholarly museum, not an [[Evangelism|evangelistic]] outreach ministry, within the next four years to house The Green Collection. The [[mission statement]] of the museum, however, as found in its [[501(c) organization|501(c)3]] tax filings for 2011, the most recent year available, is "To bring to life the living Word of God, to tell its compelling story of preservation, and to inspire confidence in the absolute authority and reliability of the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caplan-Bricker|first=Nora|title=The Hobby Lobby President Is Also Building a Bible Museum for Over $70 Million|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/117145/museum-bible-hobby-lobby-founders-other-religious-project|accessdate=2 March 2015|newspaper=The New Republic|date=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Green told a press conference that the Museum will focus on  the Bible’s impact, history and narrative, explaining that while he might hope that the museum would bring people to Christianity, the museum is not created as a tool of evangelizing, “We’re not discussing a lot of particulars of the book. It’s more of a high-level discussion of here’s this book, what is its history and impact and what is its story."&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt;

The Greens identified [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and [[New York City]] as finalists for the museum's location.&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;{{cite news|last=Banks|first=Adelle M.|title=Bible museum planned for Washington, D.C.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/bible-museum-planned-for-washington-dc/2012/07/10/gJQAWH2MbW_story.html|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, The Green Collection announced the purchase of the building housing the Washington Design Center in D.C., for a reported $50 million, to house the as-yet-unnamed national Bible museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Banks|first=Adelle M.|title=Washington D.C.: Bible Museum Closes $50 Million Deal For Spot Near National Mall|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/28/washington-dc-bible-museum_n_1712549.html|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=Religion News Service|date=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sernovitz|first=Daniel|title=Museum makes a divine acquisition|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/print-edition/2012/07/20/museum-makes-a-divine-acquisition.html?page=all|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=Washington Business Journal|date=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Washingtonian&gt;{{cite news|last=Joynt|first=Carol Ross|title=The Museum of the Bible to Replace the Washington Design Center|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/capitalcomment/local-news/the-museum-of-the-bible-to-replace-the-washington-design-center.php|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=Washingtonian|date=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beermann|first=Judith|title=Divine Decor to Divine Inspiration: WDC Becomes Bible Museum|url=http://www.thegeorgetowndish.com/thedish/divine-decor-divine-inspiration-wdc-becomes-bible-museum|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=The Georgetown Dish|date=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is located two blocks from the [[National Mall]] at 300 D.

The '''''ISTTOK Tokamak''''' ("Instituto Superior Técnico TOKamak") is a research [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactor ([[tokamak]]) of the [[Instituto Superior Técnico]]. It has a circular cross-section due to a poloidal graphite limiter and an iron core transformer. Its particularity is that it is one of the few tokamaks operating in AC (alternating plasma current) regime, as well in DC regime. In 2013, the AC operation allowed the standard discharges to extend from 35 ms to more than 1s.

== Characteristics ==
* Minor radius: 0.085 metre
* Major radius: 0.46 metre
* Plasma current: ~7kA kiloAmperes
* Plasma life span: 30/1000 milliseconds (DC/AC)
* Maximum toroidal magnetic field: 2.8 Tesla
* Nominal toroidal magnetic field: 0.3-0.6 Tesla

An '''inhabited initial''' is an [[initial]], an enlarged [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] at the beginning of a paragraph or other section of text that contains an illustration of human or animal figures within the letter. It is similar to a [[historiated initial]]; however, the figures in historiated initials show an identifiable scene or story, while the figures in inhabited initials do not show a narrative.&lt;ref name="bluk-glosI" /&gt; Figures in inhabited initials may be related to the contents of the text, but do not have to be.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24303">The '''International Chemistry Olympiad''' ('''IChO''') is an annual academic competition for high school students. It is one of the [[International Science Olympiad]]s.

The first IChO was held in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1968. The event has been held every year since then, with the exception of 1971. The delegations that attended the first events were mostly countries of the former [[Eastern bloc]] and it was not until 1980, the 12th annual International Chemistry Olympiad, that the event was held outside of the bloc in [[Austria]].  Up to 4 students for each national team compete around July in both a theoretical and an experimental sections, with about half of the participants being awarded medals.

==Structure and rules==   
[[File:IChO medal.jpg|thumb|An International Chemistry Olympiad medal for 29th IChO, held at [[Montreal]], [[Canada]].]]

Each delegation consists of up to four students and two mentors (one of them is designated as the head of the delegation or "head mentor"). A delegation may also include a handful of guests and scientific observers. Students must be under the age of 20 and must not be enrolled as regular students in any post-secondary education institution. The International Information Center of the International Chemistry Olympiad is based in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]].

Countries who wish to participate in the IChO must send observers to two consecutive olympiads before their students can participate in the event. A total of 68 countries took part in the 38th IChO in 2006: 67 as participants and 1 as an observer. In 2017 more than 80 countries are expected to send students.

The competition consists of two examinations, a theoretical examination and a practical examination. Both have durations of up to 5 hours, and are held on separate days with the practical examination usually being before the theoretical examination. The theoretical examination has a value of 60 points and the practical examination has a value of 40 points. Each examination is evaluated independently from the other and the sum of the results of the examinations determines a participant's overall result. A scientific jury, which is installed by the host country, suggests the tasks. The international jury, which consists of the 2 mentors from each of the participating countries, discusses the competition tasks and translates them into the language of their students' preference.

Students receive the examinations translated into their languages of preference. It is the duty of the mentors to translate the examinations from English before they are given to the participants. After the examinations are held and evaluated by a committee appointed by the host country and before awards are presented, mentors discuss the evaluation of the exams with judges of the committee to assure fairness in their evaluation. Because the mentors review the examinations before they are given to participants, any communication between the mentors and the students is strictly forbidden prior to the completion of both exams, and the students are required to surrender any mobile phones and laptop computers to the organizer.

The syllabus of the competition contains subjects from several areas of [[chemistry]], including [[organic chemistry]], [[inorganic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[spectroscopy]]. Though some of these subjects are included in most secondary school chemistry programs, for the most part, they are evaluated at a much deeper level and many may require a level of knowledge and understanding comparable to that of post-secondary education. In addition, the host country of each IChO issues a set of preparatory problems well in advance of the competition every year. These preparatory problems cover specific topics in considerable more depth than typical post-secondary education. Preparation for the International Chemistry Olympiad demands a high level of understanding and interest in chemistry and an outstanding ability to relate chemical subjects with one another as well as with the practical world.

[[File:Medali Emas Kelvin.jpg|thumb|A gold medal from the 40th IChO]]
All participants are ranked based on their individual scores and no official team scores are given. Gold medals are awarded to approximately the top 10% of students, silver medals are awarded to approximately the next 20% of students, and bronze medals are awarded approximately to the next 30% of students. The exact number of medals is decided on the blind review of the results. Honorable mentions are awarded to the next top 10% of the participants that do not win a medal. One special award is given to the student that achieves the highest score overall.  Two separate special awards are given to the students who get the best score in the theoretical and practical examinations.

These events are also outstanding opportunities for the students to meet people from all around the world who share similar interests, to visit different places, and to get in touch with different cultures. As the aims of the competition establish, ''the IChO competitions help to enhance friendly relations among young people from different countries; they encourage cooperation and international understanding''.

==Preparation==
While each country is free to choose its team by whatever means it seems appropriate, the selection process usually involves holding regional and national olympiad competitions. Many countries hold "training camps" for its top students, where mentors from the country give the students accelerated college-level courses in chemistry with an emphasis on the topics covered in that year's preparatory problems as well as practical training. It is agreed that such training programs must not exceed a total duration of two weeks but there are allegations every year that some countries exceed this limit by months or even years. Another concern is that some countries tend to bring the same students to the competition year after year, which helps them win better medals. Although some believe that this is against the spirit of the olympiad, many nations find it hard to justify leaving their best students at home.

==History==
The idea of the International Chemistry Olympiad was developed in the former Czechoslovakia in 1968. It was designed with the aim to increase the number of international contacts and the exchange of information between nations. Invitations were sent by the Czechoslovak national committee to all [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, except Romania (due to political issues between Romania and USSR). However, in May 1968, relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union became so delicate that only Poland and Hungary participated in the first international competition.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icho39.chem.msu.ru/html/english/IChO/History.htm |title=39th INTERNATIONAL CHEMISTRY OLYMPIAD |publisher=Icho39.chem.msu.ru |date= |accessdate=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first International Chemistry Olympiad took place in Prague between 18 and 21 June 1968. Each of the three participating countries sent a team of six students, and four theoretical tasks were to be solved. Guidelines for the next competitions were already suggested. The second chemistry Olympiad took place in 1969 in Poland, and Bulgaria also participated, with USSR and GDR only sending observers. Each team consisted of five pupils, and an experimental competition was added. The decision was made to invite more socialist countries to future competitions and to limit the number of pupils to four. The third Olympiad in 1970 was organized in Hungary with the GDR, Romania and the Soviet Union as new countries. In this competition, more than three prizes were distributed for the first time.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

There was no Olympiad held in 1971, as at the end of the competition in 1970, an organizer and host for the next event could not be agreed on. This was solved for the next three years by diplomatically agreeing on the Soviet Union to host 1972, Bulgaria in 1973, and Romania in 1974, starting the tradition to decide the host years in advance.. 1972 was the first time where preparation tasks for the International Chemistry Olympiad were created. Also, at a jury session, it was suggested that invitations should be sent to Vietnam, Mongolia, and Cuba. Unfortunately though, these invitations were not sent, leaving seven to compete in 1973.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

In 1974, Romania invited Sweden and Yugoslavia to the Olympiad in Bucharest and Germany and Austria sent observers. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first NATO-country with an observer present and this was only able to occur because the Brandt government had contracts in the East. Thus, in 1975, West Germany, Austria, and Belgium also participated in the International Chemistry Olympiad.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The first Olympiad in a non-socialist country took place 1980 in Linz in Austria, although the Soviet Union did not participate. Since then the number of the participating countries has increased steadily. In 1980, only 13 nations took part but this number increased to 21 by the 1984 Olympiad in Frankfurt/Main. With [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] and the break-up of the Soviet Union into independent states in the early 1990s, the number of participants increased again. In addition, the increasing interest of Asian and Latin American countries became apparent with the numbers of participants. Altogether 47 delegations participated in 1998.  Presently, 75 countries participate in the International Chemistry Olympiad.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The '''''Journal of Contemporary Religion''''' is a triannual [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] which covers anthropological, sociological, psychological, and philosophical aspects of religion.

== History and format ==
The journal was established in 1985 as ''Religion Today'' by the Centre for New Religions at [[King's College London]]. Its founding [[editor-in-chief|editor]] was [[Peter B. Clarke]] (later at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]]).&lt;ref&gt;Arweck, Elisabeth. ''Researching new religious movements: responses and redefinitions'', p. ix, Routledge 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-415-27755-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney; Finke, Roger. ''Acts of faith: explaining the human side of religion''. University of California Press 2000, p. 16, {{ISBN|978-0-520-22202-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ClarkeNew&gt;Clarke, Peter Bernard. ''New Religions in Global Perspective: A Study of Religious Change in the Modern World'', Routledge 2006, p. 46, {{ISBN|978-0-415-25748-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal, which changed its name to the current title in 1995,&lt;ref name=ClarkeNew /&gt; is published by [[Routledge]]. Its current editor is [[Elisabeth Arweck]] ([[University of Warwick]]); Peter B. Clarke, who died in June 2011, will remain listed as co-editor until the end of the year out of respect for his contributions to the field.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite journal |title=Peter B. Clarke (1940–2011) |first= Elisabeth |last=Arweck |journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion |volume=26|issue=3 |pages = 353|year=2011 |doi=10.1080/13537903.2011.620796}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=editorialBoard&amp;journalCode=cjcr20 Editorial Board], Taylor and Francis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=THE&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner|Lipner, Julius]] (1997-10-17). [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=159825&amp;sectioncode=26 "Social science &amp; humanities journals: Prayers for today"], ''[[Times Higher Education]]''. Retrieved 2010-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

An issue of the triannual journal typically features five or six major articles.&lt;ref name=THE /&gt; Other content includes conference reports, research notes, book reviews and review articles, and articles are sometimes illustrated with graphics or photographs.&lt;ref name=THE /&gt;

== Reception ==
The ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' stated in a 1997 review of the journal that "The contributors are invariably academics, mainly from North America and Europe. The style ranges from the homely, almost chatty at times, to the more formal. The articles, however, are on the whole scholarly and, as advertised, treat of a wide range of subjects, from the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University|Brahma Kumaris]] to [[Sahaja Yoga]], from the '[[Toronto Blessing]]' to the nature of [[fundamentalism]], from 'The Protestant eruption into modern Brazilian politics' to 'Deconfessionalisation in the Netherlands' (in the last three decades or so). There are fieldwork reports, ethnographic accounts, and historical and conceptual studies. The standard of research and analysis is what one would expect from a good academic journal."&lt;ref name=THE /&gt; The review criticised the small number and seemingly arbitrary selection of book reviews, but concluded by stating that "On the whole, then, the journal is a valuable research tool and source of new knowledge for scholars, teachers and others interested in studying the phenomenon of contemporary religion. With nothing really comparable available in the field, it is highly recommended."&lt;ref name=THE /&gt;

== Abstracting and indexing ==
The ''Journal of Contemporary Religion'' is abstracted and indexed in [[Applied Social Sciences Index &amp; Abstracts]], [[British Humanities Index]], [[CSA (database company)|Worldwide Political Science Abstracts]], [[EBSCO Publishing|EBSCOhost]], [[Educational Research Abstracts Online]], [[Multicultural Education Abstracts]], [[New Testament Abstracts]], [[Religious &amp; Theological Abstracts]], [[CSA (database company)#CSA Sociological Abstracts|Sociological Abstracts]], and [[Studies on Women and Gender Abstracts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=abstractingIndexing&amp;journalCode=cjcr20|title=Journal of Contemporary Religion|work=tandfonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[William G. Kerckhoff]] Marine Laboratory''' is owned and operated by the [[California Institute of Technology]]. It is located 101 Dahlia Street, in the [[Corona del Mar, Newport Beach|Corona del Mar]] district of Newport Beach, in Orange County, California. 

;History
The marine laboratory was established by biologist [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] in 1928 to replicate the facilities at the [[Stazione Zoologica]] in Naples, Italy. It is one of the oldest marine laboratories on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. From 1962 until his death in 2002, Dr. [[Wheeler J. North]] conducted numerous studies on the ecology of the California [[kelp forest]]s while based at this laboratory.  During the 1990s and 2000s investigators included members of the [[Eric H. Davidson|Eric Davidson]] lab working on various marine biology related projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/196/1/marine.pdf | title= Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory | publisher=California Institute of Technology | accessdate=19 Dec 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kirkland College''' was a small, private [[Liberal arts college|liberal arts]] [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]] located in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton]], [[New York (state)|New York]], from 1968 to 1978. It was named for [[Samuel Kirkland]], who founded [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]]. Hamilton absorbed Kirkland on June 30, 1978, and now maintains its archives and [[financial endowment]], and supports its alumnae community.&lt;ref name="Kweb"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sharon Rippey |url=http://www.hamilton.edu/alumni/kirklandcollege/ |title=Kirkland College - Home - Hamilton College |publisher=Hamilton.edu |date=2001-08-15 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Planning for Kirkland began during the 1962-1963 [[Academic term|academic year]], at the instigation of then-[[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] president [[Robert W. McEwen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/oral/guides/kirk.html |title=Columbia Center for Oral History &amp;#124; Columbia University Libraries |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was named after the nearby town of Kirkland, in turn named for [[Samuel Kirkland]], the founder of Hamilton.  Hamilton was a [[men's college]]. Kirkland College, a college for women, was envisioned as the first of several institutions which would form a cluster similar to the [[Claremont Colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;Babbitt, S. Limited Engagement: Kirkland College 1965-1968, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the "cluster" vision was never achieved, two factors led to a more innovative and experimental nature at Kirkland: first, the introduction of progressive views of undergraduate education on the part of [[Millicent Carey McIntosh]], former President of [[Barnard College]], who came on as a member of the first Board of Trustees, and second, the mandate to "make a fresh attack on introducing major fields of learning" without being constrained by the more traditional patterns at Hamilton – a mandate embraced by Kirkland's president, Samuel F. Babbitt.&lt;ref&gt;Limited Engagement: Kirkland College 1965-1978, p67&lt;/ref&gt;  The untimely passing of Hamilton President McEwen, also a member of the first Kirkland Board, led to the more independent development of the new institution.

Kirkland opened in 1968 on its own campus, adjacent to Hamilton College. The Kirkland faculty and students operated in a more diverse and transparent community than had been the norm at Hamilton, and, although the new college got off to an exciting start,  the many differences in educational and community functioning inevitably led to small and large conflicts between the two institutions. Meantime, the economic climate, which had been very positive during the planning stages for Kirkland, began to deteriorate. As a result, the debt service accruing to build Kirkland's entirely new campus exerted a tremendous burden on its finances. Construction costs in one year increased by 10%. Planning a large endowment fundraising effort ("The Campaign for the Second Decade") Kirkland turned to Hamilton for a guarantee of potential loss of annual funds. In 1977, with the planned resignation of President Babbitt, Hamilton refused such assistance, and the two colleges were merged under protest &lt;ref&gt;The Kirkland Alumnae Newsletter, vol. III, number 4, May 1977&lt;/ref&gt; into a single, coeducational Hamilton in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;The Kirkland Alumnae Newsletter, Vol.IV, number 2, Aug 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

A study and consideration in the form of an 'intimate history' by Samuel Fisher Babbitt, Kirkland's only president – ''Limited Engagement: Kirkland College 1965-1978, An Intimate History of the Rise and Fall of a Coordinate College for Women'' – provides an in-depth, first-person account of Kirkland's brief existence.  In addition to personal records and recollection, Babbitt was able to employ archival materials housed in the Hamilton College and Columbia University libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Samuel Fisher Babbitt |url=https://www.amazon.com/Limited-Engagement-Kirkland-1965-1978-Coordinate/dp/1425700691 |title=Limited Engagement: Kirkland College 1965-1978: An Intimate History of the Rise And Fall of a Coordinate College for Women |isbn=9781425700690 |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its dissolution, Kirkland College, through faculty who remained to teach at Hamilton, and through the active influence of its graduates and former trustees, has had a profound influence on the surviving coeducational institution. One wag has commented: "Kirkland lost the battle, but they won the war".{{citequote|date=November 2015}}

==Legacy at Hamilton College==
When Kirkland was officially incorporated into and absorbed by Hamilton College in 1978, many continuing students elected to join the new co-ed college, and some faculty accepted equivalent positions in Hamilton's departments.  Yet discontent with the way the merger was executed festered long after 1978, coloring alumnae relations, inter-faculty relations and, to some degree, campus social dynamics. Despite such friction, many of the educational principles of Kirkland (such as student-designed majors and independent study) found their way into the Hamilton curriculum. Efforts on the part of both Kirkland and Hamilton alumni to acknowledge common interests have begun to mend these breaches by responding to the curiosity and interests of current Hamilton students regarding Kirkland and its influence on their college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sharon Rippey |url=https://my.hamilton.edu/alumni/kirklandcollege/committeeforkirkland.html |title=Kirkland College - The Committee for Kirkland College - Hamilton College |publisher=My.hamilton.edu |date=2001-08-15 |accessdate=2015-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531133012/https://my.hamilton.edu/alumni/kirklandcollege/committeeforkirkland.html |archivedate=2010-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endowment===
Upon the dissolution of Kirkland, its endowment was transferred to the Hamilton endowment, with existing restrictions intact, with the understanding that all funds were to be applied "to support women and their needs and interests at Hamilton."  One on-going Hamilton program that received early support from the Kirkland Endowment is HAVOC (Hamilton Association for Volunteering, Outreach and Charity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Emily Chan |url=http://www.hamilton.edu/havoc/default.html |title=HAVOC - Hamilton Association for Volunteering, Outreach, and Charity (HAVOC) - Home - Hamilton College |publisher=Hamilton.edu |date=2001-08-15 |accessdate=2015-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728060825/http://www.hamilton.edu/havoc/default.html |archivedate=2010-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Memorabilia and traditions===
The Kirkland Archives are housed in the Burke Library at Hamilton College.  In 2007 a display case, containing a rotating exhibit of items from the Archives, was installed in the lobby of McEwen Hall, near an iconic sculpture, the "rock swing" that dates from Kirkland's early years.

The central motif of the Kirkland College seal was an apple tree, and green apples remain a symbol of Kirkland among its alumnae and supporters to this day.  During commencement exercises at Hamilton many students and faculty choose to wear a green apple pin on their academic robes to honor Kirkland's legacy.  Many graduating seniors also place green apples on the podium prior to receiving their diplomas.

The Hamilton College Bookstore sells various Kirkland merchandise, typically available on campus during June reunions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hamilton.bkstore.com/default.asp?s=27483744619%7C222&amp;m=0302&amp;cat_id=458 |title=Hamilton College Official Bookstore &amp;#124; Textbooks, Rentals, Sweatshirts, Tees, Hats |publisher=Hamilton.bkstore.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-07 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Kirkland Project===
In the mid-1990s, a group of Hamilton faculty initiated a project with the intention of working "toward establishing a research center like the Bunting Institute at Harvard and the Pembroke Center at Brown."&lt;ref name="KPvol1"&gt;The Kirkland Project News, Vol.1, no.1&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Kirkland Project is named in honor of Kirkland College, building on Kirkland's twin legacies of women's education and innovative pedagogy, expanding on them to meet the global challenges that face contemporary male and female students, faculty and staff.&lt;ref name="KPvol3"&gt;The Kirkland Project News, Spring 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academics.hamilton.edu/organizations/kirkland/ |title=Kirkland Project |publisher=Academics.hamilton.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MARPOL 73-78 signatories.png|thumb|MARPOL 73/78 ratifying states]]
The '''International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978''' ('''MARPOL 73/78''', MARPOL is short for [[marine pollution]] and 73/78 short for the years 1973 and 1978) is one of the most important international marine [[international environmental law|environmental conventions]]. It was developed by the [[International Maritime Organization]] in an effort to minimize pollution of the oceans and seas, including [[marine debris|dumping]], oil and air pollution.  The objective of this convention is to preserve the marine environment in an attempt to completely eliminate pollution by oil and other harmful substances and to minimize accidental spillage of such substances.

The original MARPOL was signed on 17 February 1973, but did not come into force at the signing date. The current convention is a combination of 1973 Convention and the 1978 Protocol,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chronology &amp; Search|url = http://www.martinottaway.com/technical-documents/MAX1-Studies/chronology|website = MAX1 Studies|accessdate = 2015-07-15|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185609/http://www.martinottaway.com/technical-documents/MAX1-Studies/chronology|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which entered into force on 2 October 1983. As of January 2018, 156 states are parties to the convention, being [[flag state]]s of 99.42% of the world's shipping tonnage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/StatusOfConventions/Documents/StatusOfTreaties.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

All ships flagged under countries that are signatories to MARPOL are subject to its requirements, regardless of where they sail and member nations are responsible for vessels registered on their national ship registry.&lt;ref name=crs&gt;Copeland, Claudia.

=== Annex I ===
[[Marpol Annex I|MARPOL Annex I]] came into force on 2 October 1983 and deals with discharge of oil into the ocean environment.  It incorporates the oil discharge criteria prescribed in the 1969 amendments to the 1954 [[International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil]] (OILPOL). It specifies tanker design features that are intended to minimize oil discharge into the ocean during ship operations and in case of accidents. It provides regulations with regard to treatment of engine room bilge water ([[Oily Water Separator (marine)|OWS]]) for all large commercial vessels and ballast and tank cleaning waste ([[Oil Discharge Monitoring Equipment|ODME]]). It also introduces the concept of "special sea areas (PPSE)" which are considered to be at risk to pollution by oil.  Discharge of oil within them has been completely outlawed, with a few minimal exceptions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.imo.org/KnowledgeCentre/ReferencesAndArchives/HistoryofMARPOL/Documents/MARPOL%2073-78%20Brief%20History%20-%20List%20of%20amendments%20and%20how%20to%20find%20them.htm|title = MARPOL73-78:  Brief history - list of amendments to date and where to find them|date = 2012|accessdate = 3 June 2015|website = MARPOL73-78:  Brief history - list of amendments to date and where to find them|publisher = IMO|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of [[Marpol Annex I|MARPOL Annex I]] deals with engine room waste. There are various generations of technologies and equipment that have been developed to prevent waste such as: [[Oily Water Separators|Oily water separators]] (OWS), [[Oil content meter|Oil Content meters]] (OCM), and [[Port Reception Facilities]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL)|url = http://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/International-Convention-for-the-Prevention-of-Pollution-from-Ships-(MARPOL).aspx|website = www.imo.org|accessdate = 2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of the [[Marpol Annex I|MARPOL Annex I]] has more to do with cleaning the cargo areas and tanks. [[Oil Discharge Monitoring Equipment]] (ODME) is a very important technology mentioned in [[Marpol Annex I|MARPOL Annex I]] that has greatly helped improve sanitation in these areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[Oil record book|Oil Record Book]] is another integral part of [[Marpol Annex I|MARPOL Annex I]].  The [[Oil record book|Oil Record Book]] helps crew members log and keep track of oily waste water discharges among other things.

=== Annex II === 
MARPOL Annex II came into force on 6 April 1987. It details the discharge criteria for the elimination of pollution by noxious liquid substances carried in large quantities. It divides substances into and introduces detailed operational standards and measures. The discharge of pollutants is allowed only to reception facilities with certain concentrations and conditions. No matter what, no discharge of residues containing pollutants is permitted within 12 miles of the nearest land. Stricter restrictions apply to "special areas".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Annex II covers the International Bulk Chemical Code (IBC Code) in conjunction with Chapter 7 of the [[SOLAS Convention]]. Previously, chemical tankers constructed before {{dts|1 July 1986}} must comply with the requirements of the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk (BCH Code).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBC Code|url=http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Safety/Cargoes/CargoesInBulk/Pages/IBC-Code.aspx|website=www.imo.org|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annex III ===
MARPOL Annex III came into force on 1 July 1992.  It contains general requirements for the standards on packing, marking, labeling, documentation, stowage, quantity subtraction, division and notifications for preventing pollution by harmful substances. The Annex is in line with the procedures detailed in the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, which has been expanded to include marine pollutants. The amendments entered into force on 1 January 1991.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Annex IV ===
Marpol Annex IV came into force on 27 September 2003.  It introduces requirements to control pollution of the sea by sewage from ships.

=== Annex V ===
MARPOL Annex V (''Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships'') came into force on 31 December 1988.  It specifies the distances from land in which materials may be disposed of and subdivides different types of garbage and marine debris. The requirements are much stricter in a number of "special areas" but perhaps the most prominent part of the Annex is the complete ban of [[Ocean dumping|dumping]] plastic into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/environment/pollutionprevention/garbage/Pages/Default.aspx|title=Garbage|website=www.imo.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annex VI ===
MARPOL Annex VI came into force on 19 May 2005.  It introduces requirements to regulate the air pollution being emitted by ships, including the emission of ozone-depleting substances, [[NOx|Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)]], [[Sulfur oxide|Sulphur Oxides (SOx)]], [[Volatile organic compound|Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)]] and shipboard incineration. It also establishes requirements for reception facilities for wastes from exhaust gas cleaning systems, incinerators, fuel oil quality, for off-shore platforms and drilling rigs and for the establishment of [[Sulphur Emission Control Area|SOx Emission Control Areas (SECAs)]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Amendments==

MARPOL Annex VI amendments according with [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707061408/http://www.imo.org/includes/blastDataOnly.asp/data_id%3D23760/176%2858%29.pdf MEPC 176(58)] came into force 1 July 2010.

Amended [https://web.archive.org/web/20100522170617/http://www.ancomaritime.com/files/Ozone_Depleting_Substances_Marpol_Regulation_12.html Regulations 12] concerns control and record keeping of Ozone Depleting Substances.

Amended [https://web.archive.org/web/20100522170546/http://www.ancomaritime.com/files/Fuel_Oil_Change_over_procedures%20.html Regulation 14] concerns mandatory fuel oil change over procedures for vessels entering or leaving [[Sulphur Emission Control Area|SECA]] areas and FO sulphur limits.

MARPOL Annex V has been amended multiple times, changing different aspects of the original text. 

[http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/PollutionPrevention/Garbage/Documents/2014%20revision/RESOLUTION%20MEPC.220(63)%20Guidelines%20for%20the%20Development%20of%20Garbage%20Management%20Plans.pdf MEPC.219(63)] came into force on 2 March 2012 to generally prohibit the discharge of any garbage into the ocean, with the exception of food wastes, cargo residues, wash-water, and animal carcasses. There are further provisions describing when and how to dispose of the acceptable wastes.

[http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/PollutionPrevention/Garbage/Documents/2014%20revision/RESOLUTION%20MEPC.220(63)%20Guidelines%20for%20the%20Development%20of%20Garbage%20Management%20Plans.pdf MEPC.220(63)] came into force on 2 March 2012 to encourage the creation of a waste management plan on-board vessels.

==Implementation and enforcement==
In order for [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] standards to be binding, they must first be ratified by a total number of member countries whose combined [[gross tonnage]] represents at least 50% of the world's gross tonnage, a process that can be lengthy.  A system of tacit acceptance has therefore been put into place, whereby if no objections are heard from a member state after a certain period has elapsed, it is assumed they have assented to the treaty.

All six Annexes have been ratified by the requisite number of nations; the most recent is Annex VI, which took effect in May 2005. The country where a ship is registered ([[Flag State]]) is responsible for certifying the ship's compliance with MARPOL's [[pollution prevention]] standards. Each signatory nation is responsible for enacting [[municipal law|domestic laws]] to implement the convention and effectively pledges to comply with the convention, annexes, and related laws of other nations.  In the United States, for example, the relevant implementation legislation is the [[Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships]].

One of the difficulties in implementing MARPOL arises from the very international nature of maritime shipping. The country that the ship visits can conduct its own examination to verify a ship's compliance with [[international standard]]s and can detain the ship if it finds significant [[regulatory compliance|noncompliance]]. When incidents occur outside such country's jurisdiction or jurisdiction cannot be determined, the country refers cases to flag states, in accordance with MARPOL. A 2000 US [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] report documented that even when referrals have been made, the response rate from flag states has been poor.&lt;ref name="U.S. GAO, 2000 Report"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Office|first1=U. S. Government Accountability|title=Marine Pollution: Progress Made to Reduce Marine Pollution by Cruise Ships, but Important Issues Remain|date=March 7, 2000|issue=RCED-00-48|page=20|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00048.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306150933/http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00048.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2015, maritime shipping levels became legally subject to new MARPOL directives because the SECA (Sulphur Emission Controlled Areas) zone increased in size. This larger SECA zone will include the North Sea, Scandinavia, and parts of the English Channel. This area is set to include all of the Republic of Ireland's international waters in 2020 culminating in all of Western Europe's subjection to the MARPOL directive. This has proven controversial for shipping and ferry operators across Europe.

Concerns have been raised about the environmental damage moving back to the roads by some of the larger ferry operators that ship substantial amounts of freight and passenger traffic via these routes affected by IMO standards. They claim that MARPOL will drive up ferry costs for the consumer and freight forwarding companies pushing them back onto the European roadways as a financially more cost effective measure compared to increased ferry costs, thereby defeating the object of reducing water pollution.&lt;ref name="Freightlink"&gt;[https://www.freightlink.co.uk/knowledge/articles/what-marpol-and-its-impact-freight-market What is MARPOL and its impact to the freight market?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028234749/https://www.freightlink.co.uk/knowledge/articles/what-marpol-and-its-impact-freight-market |date=28 October 2014 }}, www.freightlink.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach''' ({{lang-de|Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach}}) in [[Oberwolfach]], [[Germany]], was founded by mathematician [[Wilhelm Süss]] in 1944.

It organizes weekly workshops on diverse topics where mathematicians and scientists from all over the world come to do collaborative research.

The Institute is a member of the [[Leibniz Association]], funded mainly by the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)| German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] and by the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]]. It also receives substantial funding from the ''Friends of Oberwolfach'' foundation, from the ''Oberwolfach Foundation'' and from numerous donors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9662">{{for|princely states|Mediatization}}
In communication studies or media studies, '''mediatization''' is a theory that argues that the media shapes and frames the processes and discourse (conversation) of [[political communication]] as well as the society in which that communication takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Lilleker, D., 2008, Key Concepts in Political Communications. SAGE London.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this framework, an important aspect of [[modernization]] is the development of media,&lt;ref&gt;Krotz, F. (2008). Media Connectivity: Concepts, Conditions, and Consequences. In A. Hepp, F. Krotz &amp; S. Moores (Eds.), Network, Connectivity and Flow: Key concepts for Media and Cultural Studies. New York: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with a change in [[communication]] media and proceeding to subordination of the power of prevailing influential institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Hjarvard, S. (2008). The Mediatization of Religion: A Theory of the Media as Agents of Religious Change. In Northern Lights 2008. Yearbook of Film &amp; Media Studies. Bristol: Intellect Press: 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of this process, institutions and whole societies are shaped by and dependent on [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Mazzoleni, G., &amp; Schulz, W. (1999). "Mediatization" of Politics: A Challenge for Democracy? Political Communication, 16(3), 247-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Mediatization is part of a paradigmatic shift in media and communication research. Following the concept of '[[Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies)|mediation]]', 'mediatization' has become the proper concept for capturing how processes of communication transform society, designating large-scale relationships. The two are complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Hepp, A. Hajarvard, S., Lundby, (2015). Mediatization: theorizing the interplay between media, culture and society Media, Culture &amp; Society 37(2) 314–324.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by Von Joachim Preusse and Sarah Zielmann, Kent Asp introduced and lamented on the concept of mediatization, and they clarifiy that: "Mediatisation was first applied to media's impact on political communication and other effects on politics. The Swedish media researcher Kent Asp was the first to speak of the mediatisation of political life, by which he meant a process whereby 'a political system to a high degree is influenced by and adjusted to the demands of the mass media in their coverage of politics'" (2010: 336).

Asp used the term mediated politics to describe how the media have become a necessary source of information between politicians and those in authority and those they governed.  According to Asp's understanding politics are mediated when the mass media are the main or the only source of political information through which it may influence or even shape people's conceptions of political reality. Asp's theoretical assumptions that mass media may influence and mobilize current political ideas through mediatized rituals have been adopted by various communication scholars. In the tradition of Asp, the Danish media scholar [[Stig Hjarvard]] helped to develop the concept of mediatization and suggested that mediatization is a social process whereby the society is saturated and inundated by the media to the extent that the media cannot longer be thought of separated from other institutions within the society.&lt;ref&gt;Hjarvard, S. (2008). The Mediatization of Religion: A Theory of the Media as Agents of Religious Change. In Northern Lights 2008. Yearbook of Film &amp; Media Studies. Bristol: Intellect Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociocultural change ==   
The concept has evolved to focus not only on media effects but on the interrelation between the change of media communication on the one hand and sociocultural changes on the other, as part of our everyday communication practices and our communicative construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Hepp, A. Hajarvard, S., Lundby, (2015). Mediatization: theorizing the interplay between media, culture and society, Media, Culture &amp; Society 37(2) 314–324.&lt;/ref&gt; Mediatization research investigates the interrelation between media communicative change and sociocultural change, understood as a meta-process (a conceptual construct designating long-term processes of change).&lt;ref&gt;Couldry, N. &amp; A. Hepp. (2013). Conceptualizing Mediatization: Contexts,Traditions, Arguments. Communication Theory 23: 191-202.&lt;/ref&gt; Media do not necessarily 'cause' the transformations but they have become co-constitutive for the articulation of politics, economics, education, religion, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Hepp, A. Hajarvard, S., Lundby, (2015). Mediatization: theorizing the interplay between media, culture and society, Media, Culture &amp; Society 37(2) 314–324.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, television, by showcasing know-how health specialists who promote quick individual changes in lifestyle, co-constructs the notion of health together with other institutions and broader cultural shifts in perceptions of the body.

Hjarvard and Peterson summarize media's role in cultural change: "(1) When various forms of subcultures try to make use of media for their own purposes, they often become (re-)embedded into mainstream culture; (2) National cultural policies often serve as levers for increased mediatization; (3) Mediatization involves a transformation of the ways in which authority and expertise are performed and reputation is acquired and defended; and (4) Technological developments shape the media's affordances and thus the particular path of mediatization."&lt;ref&gt;Hjarvard, S. &amp; L.N. Peterson, (2013). [https://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/mediekultur/article/download/8123/6762 Mediatization and cultural change], MedieKultur, 54: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research mobilizing mediatization theories explores the ways in which media are embedded in cultural transformation. For example, "tactical" mediatization designates the response of community organizations and activists to wider technological changes. Kim Sawchuk, professor in Communication Studies at Concordia University, worked with a group of elderly who managed to retain their own agency in this context.&lt;ref&gt;Sawchuk, K. (2013). [http://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/mediekultur/article/view/7313/6765 Tactical mediatization and activist ageing: pressures, push-backs, and the story of RECAA]. MedieKultur 54: 47-64.&lt;/ref&gt; For the elderly, the pressure to mediatize comes from various institutions that are transitioning to online services (government agencies, funding, banks, etc.), among other things. A tactical approach to media is one that comes from those who are subordinates within these systems. It means to implement work-arounds to make the technologies work for them. For example, in the case of the elderly group she studies, they borrowed equipment to produce video capsules explaining their mandate and the importance of this mandate for their communities, which allowed them to reach new audiences while keeping the tone and style of face-to-face communication they privilege in their day-to-day practice. Doing this, they also subverted expectations about the ability of the elderly to use new media effectively.
Another example of study is one which is focused on the media-related practices of graffiti writers and skaters, showing how media integrate and modulate their everyday practices. The analysis also demonstrates how the mediatization of these subcultural groups brings them to become part of mainstream culture, changes their rebellious and oppositional image and engages them with the global commercialization culture.&lt;ref&gt;Encheva, K., Driessens, O., &amp; Verstraeten, H. (2013). The mediatization of deviant subcultures: an analysis of the media - related practices of graffiti writers and skaters, MedieKultur, 54: 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of study mobilizing mediatization theories would be one interested in how media's omnipresence informs the ways Femen's protests may take place on public scenes, allow communication between individual bodies and a shared understanding of activist imaginary. It aims to analyse how their practices are moulded by the media and how these are staged in manners which facilitates spreadability.&lt;ref&gt;Reestorff, C. M. (2014). Mediatised affective activism: The activist imaginary and the topless body in the Femen movement,  Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies, 20: 4, {{doi|10.1177/1354856514541358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nikolai M. Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography''' ({{lang-ru|'''Полярный научно-исследовательский институт морского рыбного хозяйства и океанографии имени Н. М. Книповича'''}}), its acronym being '''PINRO''' ({{lang-ru|'''ПИНРО'''}}), is one of several research institutes of [[Russian Federation|Russia]] subordinate to the [[Russian Federal Agency for Fisheries]] (Rosrybolovstvo). It is based in [[Murmansk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |quote=The data are in the hands of the Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography, known as PINRO.  PINRO, based in Murmansk, has been collaborating with Norwegian researchers for years. |title=Soviet Cold War oceanographic surveys opened up to western scientists |first=Asle |last=Rønning |date=May 23, 2013 |translator-first=Glenn |translator-last=Ostling |url=http://sciencenordic.com/soviet-cold-war-oceanographic-surveys-opened-western-scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The institute was created on March 10, 1921 as the Floating Marine Research Institute (Plavmornin). It was preceded (though not directly) by the Imperial Russian organization Murman Scientific Fisheries Expedition, which existed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and conducted early research with the vessel ''[[Saint Andrew (ship)|Saint Andrew]]''.

Between 1929 and 1933, the Institute was named State Oceanographic Institute of the USSR (SOI). Since 1935, it has borne the name of fisheries science pioneer [[Nikolai Knipovich]].

During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|German invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II]] (called, in Russia, the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]) the Institute was evacuated to [[Arkhangelsk]]. The Institute's main expedition ship ''[[Perseus (Soviet ship)|Perseus]]'', which had been with the Institute since its early days and undertaken close to 100 expeditions, was sunk by German air raiders in the early days of the war. The ''Perseus''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s flag, showing a stylized representation of the [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus constellation]], remains the Institute's symbol to this day.

Since then, the institute has operated several research vessels, including large purpose-built research ships, and [[submersible]]s.

==Activities==
The main task of the team of scientists of the institute is conducting annual studies to help determine the total allowable catch of commercial fish species, invertebrates, algae and marine mammals. The main focus is on [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[capelin]], [[herring]], [[Greenland halibut]], the Barents Sea population of the [[Kamchatka crab]], and [[salmon]]. The Institute's area of responsibility includes the northern waters near European Russia – the [[Barents Sea]], the [[Kara Sea]], the [[White Sea]], the [[Norwegian Sea]], the [[Greenland Sea]] and the Northwest [[Atlantic Ocean]] – as well as freshwater lakes in the [[Murmansk region|Murmansk]] and [[Arkhangelsk Oblast|Arkhangelsk]] Regions, the [[Komi Republic]], and the [[Nenets Autonomous District]].

There is a Northern Branch of PINRO, headquartered in [[Arkhangelsk]].

The '''POISK Centre''' (in [[Russian language|Russian]]:''Центр «ПОИСК»'') is an educational and research organization founded in 2004 at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] ([[Russia]]). Its primary aim is to encourage secondary school students and university students to do independent [[scientific research]].

The POISK Centre supports educational programs that motivate youth to develop an interest in [[physics]] and [[natural sciences]], and to involve them in “what a real scientist does” as early as possible. These activities include tight collaboration with leading universities and secondary schools in Russia and abroad, joint seminars and workshops, regular international scientific conferences, language programs, but also the promotion of research competitions, such as the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament|Young Physicists' Tournament]].

POISK means ‘search’ in [[Russian language|Russian]], but it is also a Russian abbreviation for the Support Centre for Olympiads and Intellectual Competitions.

== Achievements ==

Since 2004, the POISK Centre is the only university-based organization in Russia that is being selecting, supervising and preparing the National team that represents Russia at the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament]].

The POISK Centre’s team has been a participant of [[International Young Physicists' Tournament|IYPTs]] in 2004 ([[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]), 2005 ([[Winterthur]], [[Switzerland]]) and 2006 ([[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]) with significant success, winning bronze medals twice. In May 2007, the POISK’s Russian team fought in the Finals and won silver at the [[Austrian Young Physicists' Tournament]] held in [[Leoben]], [[Austria]].

In November 2007, the POISK's team of university students was one of the two gold winners at the [[Ukrainian Physicists' Tournament for University Students]] held at the [[Kiev National University]], [[Ukraine]].

'''''Parable of the Sower''''' is a science fiction novel by American writer [[Octavia E. Butler]], the first in a two-book series. It was published in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Octavia E. Butler, Science Fiction Writer, Dies at 58|author=Fox, Margalit|date=March 1, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/books/01butler.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Set in the 2020s where society has largely collapsed due to climate change, growing wealth inequality, and corporate greed, ''Parable of the Sower'' centers on a young woman named Lauren Oya Olamina who possesses what Butler dubbed hyperempathy or "sharing" – the ability to feel pain and other sensations she witnesses. As a teenager growing up in the remnants of a [[gated community]] near Los Angeles, she begins to develop a new belief system, which she comes to call Earthseed. When the community's security is compromised, her home is destroyed and her family is murdered, and she travels north with other survivors. Society outside the community walls has reverted to chaos due to resource scarcity and poverty, and mixed race relationships are stigmatized amid attacks against religious and ethnic minorities. Lauren believes that humankind's destiny is to travel beyond Earth and live on other planets, forcing humankind into its adulthood, and that Earthseed is preparation for this destiny. She gathers followers along her journey north and founds the first Earthseed community, Acorn, in Northern California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Proposed third ''Parable'' novel==
Butler had planned to write a third ''Parable'' novel, tentatively titled ''Parable of the Trickster'', which would have focused on the community's struggle to survive on a new planet. She began this novel after finishing ''[[Parable of the Talents (novel)|Parable of the Talents]]'', and mentioned her work on it in a number of interviews, but at some point encountered [[writer's block]]. She eventually shifted her creative attention, resulting in ''[[Fledgling (novel)|Fledgling]]'', her final novel. The various false starts for the novel can now be found among Butler's papers at the [[Huntington Library]], as described in an article at the ''Los Angeles Review of Books''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/theres-nothing-new-sun-new-suns-recovering-octavia-e-butlers-lost-parables | title="There's Nothing New / Under The Sun, / But There Are New Suns": Recovering Octavia E.

==Adaptations==

''Parable of the Sower'' was adapted as ''Parable of the Sower: The Concert Version'', a work-in-progress opera written by American folk/blues musician [[Toshi Reagon]] in collaboration with her mother, singer and composer [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]]. The adaptation's libretto and musical score combine African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[rock and roll]], and [[folk music]] into rounds to be performed by singers sitting in a circle. It was performed as part of [[The Public Theater]]'s [[Under the Radar Festival]] in New York City in 2015&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Grace.

==In popular culture==
''Parable of the Sower'' was referred to in hip-hop artist [[Talib Kweli]]'s song "Ms. Hill" off his mixtape ''[[Right About Now: The Official Sucka Free Mix CD]]''. In the song, which is about [[Lauryn Hill]], Kweli references how Lauryn Hill used to come into [[Nkiru]] (a bookstore Kweli owns in [[Brooklyn]], New York) and liked to buy [[Octavia Butler]] books, namely ''Parable of the Sower''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} "We used to chill at Nkiru / her moms was a customer / she used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler / Parable of the Sower, the main character's name was Lauren".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ms. Hill|work=Anysonglyrics.com|url=http://www.anysonglyrics.com/lyrics/t/talib/Ms-Hill-Lyrics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Lauren Beukes]]' 2013 novel ''[[The Shining Girls]]'', the body of one of the victims, Jin-Sook Au, a social worker, is found with a copy of ''Parable of the Sower''.

Part of the central verse of [[Earthseed]], "All that you touch you change, all that you change changes you", is included in track 2 and 6 of Sugar Candy Mountain's album ''666''.

The work of hip hop/R&amp;B duo [[THEESatisfaction]] was influenced by Octavia Butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://fryemuseum.org/blog/?p=845#more |title=Attention Earthlings! |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher =|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third track from their 2012 album ''[[awE NaturalE]]'', "Earthseed", contains themes from the ''Parable'' series: "Change there are few words / That you can say / We all watch things morphing everyday."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://genius.com/Theesatisfaction-earthseed-lyrics| title=Earthseed - lyrics |last=| first=| date=| website=| publisher=| access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Principlism''' is a system of ethics based on the four moral principles of:

1. Autonomy—free-will or agency, 

2. Beneficence—do good, 

3. Nonmaleficence—do no harm, and 

4. Justice—social distribution of benefits and burdens.

Advocates for principlism argue that from the beginning of recorded history most moral decision-makers descriptively and prescriptively have used these four moral principles; that they are part of or compatible with most intellectual, religious, and cultural beliefs.

==Principlism formalized into national and international law==

Principlism was first formalized as a moral decision-making approach by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in a document called the [[Belmont Report]] on April 18, 1979. The Commission came into existence on July 12, 1974 when the [[National Research Act]] (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law. After four years of monthly deliberations, the Commission met in February 1976 for four days at the Smithsonian Institution’s Belmont Conference Center which resulted in a statement of the basic ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice, for biomedical and behavioral research. The Commission recommended that the Belmont Report be adopted in its entirety as a statement of the Department’s policy for the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.

The Belmont Report’s cause of origin can be traced back to December 9, 1946 when the American Military Tribunal started criminal proceedings against 23 German physicians and administrators for [[war crime]]s and [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]. During the trials, the [[Nuremberg Code]] was drafted for the establishment of standards for judging individuals who conducted biomedical experiments on [[Internment|concentration camp]] prisoners. The Nuremberg Code in its final form was established in 1948 and was the first international document that advocated voluntary [[informed consent]] for participants of research on human subjects.

==Belmont report and its three core principles==

Principlism is a moral approach based on judgments that are generally accepted by most intellectual, cultural and religious traditions. For example, the Belmont Report defines 3 key principles by which to judge the ethicality of biomedical and behavioral research.  These principles are:

1. Respect for persons—Autonomy,

2. Beneficence—do good, and

3. Justice—specifically distributive justice wherein those who bear the burdens of research also receive its benefits.

==Principlism as a practical approach==

Principlism has evolved into a practical approach for ethical decision-making that focuses on the common ground moral principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. The practicality of this approach is that principlism can be derived from, is consistent with, or at the very least is not in conflict with a multitude of ethical, theological, and social approaches towards moral decision-making. This pluralistic approach is essential when making moral decisions institutionally, pedagogically, and in the community as pluralistic interdisciplinary groups by definition cannot agree on particular moral theories or their epistemic justifications. However, pluralistic interdisciplinary groups can and do agree on intersubjective principles. In the development of a principlistic moral framework it is not a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] that the epistemic origins and justifications of these principles be established. Rather the sufficient condition is that most individuals and societies, would agree that both prescriptively and descriptively there is wide agreement with the existence and acceptance of the general values of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.

==Specifying and balancing==

Once these principles have been established the practical activity then becomes that of specifying how the principles are to be used in specific situations and balancing the principles with the other competing moral principles. In using this approach, every moral decision will be dilemmatic in that the agent will be to some degree either morally right and morally wrong under a single principle, and/or there will be two or more competing moral principles and the agent will not be able to completely fulfill one or more moral principles without violating or competing with one or more other moral principles. Dilemmatic decision-making is not unusual when making pluralistic social decisions. The Bill of Rights in [[United States Constitution|the United States Constitution]] perfectly exemplifies this process. A citizen’s [[freedom of speech]], for example, does not allow someone to yell “FIRE” in a crowded theater when there is no fire as individual [[Constitutional right|Constitutional Rights]] and Liberties are constrained by other [[individual rights]] and liberties and therefore they must be specified for specific situations and then balanced with the other inevitable competing principles. 

Principlism, presented as a formal criterion, is a [[Linguistic prescription|description and prescription]] of moral decision-making with a deep and rich heritage that has yet to be formalized for pluralistic interdisciplinary groups. However, since most moral decision-making ultimately use this approach, in one form or another, moral decision making in pluralistic environments is possible as Principlism descriptively describes how people do in fact make moral decisions and prescriptively prescribes how people ought to act based on the intersubjective agreements of common morality. Instead of focusing on the epistemic differences of various philosophical and religious perspectives, Principlism focuses on the intersubjective agreements, and that is why it works so effectively in interdisciplinary pluralistic environments.

Principlism could be modified by adding or subtracting certain component principles yet practically the four principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice are broad and comprehensive enough to sufficiently cover most cases and will provide the necessary output power for making interdisciplinary moral decisions.

==Incommensurable beliefs==

Even though pluralistic groups will in large part have shared universal values—Principlism, it is still clearly recognized that there is and will be incommensurable beliefs as to how the specification and balancing procedures found in the principlistic approach ought to be implemented. However, Principlism has the advantage over most other moral approaches in that Principlism emphasizes the shared interdisciplinary [[universal values]] or principles and uses them in a systematic and transparent fashion resulting in a greater shared understanding and/or compromise. Certainly, Principlism does not claim to be able to solve all moral dilemmas caused by conflicts of beliefs, yet Principlism, without a doubt, has tremendous output power for practicing interdisciplinary moral decision-making. 

==Unified approach==

Principlism is unified approach in that each [[Morality|moral principle]] seems to converge into each of the other three principles. For example, it can be argued that Principlism, as a comprehensive moral approach, is just another term for justice. To the extent that justice is socially valued because of how it effectively establishes autonomy, nonmaleficence, and beneficence, both personally and socially, it can be argued that Principlism only needs its fourth principle—justice, in order to fulfill its moral function. However, this argument can also be made with regards to each of the four principles as each principle seems to be able to include each of the other three principles. Personal autonomy results in the maximization of personal benefits—beneficence and the minimization of personal burdens—nonmaleficence within a legitimate social structure—justice. Likewise, nonmaleficence is maximized, by maximizing autonomy, beneficence, and justice and beneficence is maximized, by maximizing autonomy, nonmaleficence, and justice. 

The fact that each of the four principles can be argued to be the supreme moral principle further validates the Principlistic approach towards moral decision-making. In other words, Principlism is a unified moral approach in which the addition of each principle strengthens the legitimacy of each of the other principles to the extent that each principle is specified and balanced using independent criteria and yet each principle still supports each of the other principles. 

Science illustrates the importance and necessity of such unification. For example, if several academically distinct fields converge on a unified position that would generally give more credence towards that position. On the other hand, if one [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] has a hypothesis that contradicts several or all of the other academic disciplines, then that would be reason either to reject that hypothesis or at least to give it some pause. One example of such unification would be the comparison of evolution vs. [[creationism]]. Evolution converges in several academic fields such as Biology, Microbiology, Astronomy, Cosmology, Geology, Paleontology, Oceanography, Pathology, Medicine, Anthropology, and more. Creationism, on the other hand, is based on the non-academic discipline of [[Faith|religious faith]] and is not supported by any of the empirical academic disciplines. As a result, creationism does not have the same academic stature as evolution and is therefore not considered as a plausible option by any of the empirical or rational academic disciplines. Therefore, other than creationism being a curious sociological, anthropological, or psychological phenomena of culture, religion, and/or belief, creationism has no place in academic empirical rational discourse. Of course academic sciences are by definition limited to empirical and rational discourses and some knowledge is clearly not of that category.  For example, intersubjective experiences of [[sense data]] such as: sight, taste, smell, touch, hearing, and emotional states such as: love, and faith, are real and true experiences yet they elude rational and/or empirical quantification. However, since creationism claims to be an academic empirical conclusion, then it is legitimate to hold creationism to academic standards of universal academic consistency. 

Principlism validates itself with its universally recognized moral principles of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice. These principles are distinct moral attributes that converge and unifies moral decision-making even within pluralistic environments.

==Goal of moral decision-making==

The goal in moral decision-making is ultimately to specify and balance each of the four principles recognizing that there is no set hierarchical order of principles in that one or more moral principle may override one or more other moral principles depending on the circumstances. Specifying is the narrowing down or making the broad moral principles relevant for a particular decision and balancing is the attempt to maximize, as much as possible, all of the contributing or competing moral principles.

==Applying principlism==

The following is an approach that can be used towards applying Principlism to a particular case.

'''DETERMINE THE RELEVANT PARTIES'''

                i.	Positive rights: (Obligation of others to provide something)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1435">'''Reciprocity''' in [[linear system]]s is the principle that a response '''Rab''', measured at a location (and direction if applicable) '''a''', when the system has an excitation signal applied at a location (and direction if applicable) '''b''', is exactly equal to '''Rba''' which is the response at location '''b''', when that same excitation is applied at '''a'''. This applies for all frequencies of the excitation signal. If '''Hab''' is the [[transfer function]] between '''a''' and '''b''' then '''Hab'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''Hba''', if the system is linear.

In the special case of a [[modal analysis]] this is known as Maxwell's reciprocity theorem.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sdrl.uc.edu/academic-course-info/academic-course-info/docs/ucme663/v3_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In electromagnetism the concept is known as [[Reciprocity (electromagnetism)|Lorentz reciprocity]].

The reciprocity principle is also used in the analysis of structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FEQ0H3o-lfoC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=reciprocity+load+deflection | title = Mechanical Vibration: Analysis, Uncertainties, and Control | isbn = 9780824753801 | author1 = Benaroya | first1 = Haym | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with [[Superposition principle|superposition]], symmetry and anti-symmetry, it can be used to resolve complex load conditions.

It has had a significant impact on collective responses to [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault]] in Western academic [[science]].

Published in 2014 by a team of [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]], [[Kathryn B. H. Clancy]], Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and [[Katie Hinde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.

Second, women are more likely to be harassed by senior staff, while men are harassed by their peers. Third, the majority of field scientists do not know how to report harassment.

== Methods ==
The study included responses from 666 field scientists (77.5% were women and 85.9% of participants identified as heterosexual). The survey was conducted in two waves. The first wave ran from February 21 to April 12, 2013, and captured responses from biological anthropologists.  The second wave, running from April 13 to May 10, collected responses from scientists in other disciplines. A further 26 interviews were completed to explore more in-depth experiences of sexual harassment in a broad range of fieldwork sites. The respondents were asked about experiences had at any time during their career.

The survey was not designed to estimate the prevalence of sexual harassment or assault at field sites. It was conducted online and offered anonymity, suggesting a potential [[self-selection bias]]. Only two questions in the survey directly queried the behavior experienced by respondents:

:32. Have you ever personally experienced inappropriate or sexual remarks, comments about physical beauty, cognitive sex differences, or other jokes, at an anthropological field site?

:39. Have you ever experienced physical sexual harassment, unwanted sexual contact, or sexual contact in which you could not or did not give consent or felt it would be unsafe to fight back or not give your consent at an anthropological field site?

An affirmative response to question 32 was counted as a report of sexual harassment, while an affirmative response to question 39 was counted as sexual assault, including rape.

== Findings ==
Almost three-quarters of participants (72.4%) had directly observed or been told about inappropriate behaviour or sexual comments during fieldwork. Around two-thirds of participants (64%) had personally experienced sexual language in the field and 20% of participants had experienced unwanted sexual contact. The study presented these findings as reports of "sexual harassment" and "sexual assault" respectively, though respondents were not asked whether they had been sexually harassed or assaulted. Following conventions in this area of scholarship, the study counted all "sexual remarks" as sexual harassment and all "unwanted sexual contact" as sexual assault.  

The majority of people who experienced sexual harassment and assault were students and postdoctoral candidates. Perpetrators vary according to their target's gender: women are more likely to be harassed by superiors (senior people who have authority over them), while men are more likely to be harassed by their peers. Few people were sexually harassed by local members of the public, and instead the harassment occurred between colleagues in the field.

The SAFE13 study identifies several areas of improvement in combating sexual harassment in the field. For example, only around one-third of field scientists (37.7%) recalled a code of conduct operating at their fieldwork site, and less than one-quarter remembered there being anti-harassment policies. Amongst respondents who had experienced sexual harassment or assault, only one-fifth of survivors (20% each of women and men) knew of an easy way to formally report this experience. Amongst the small minority of people who did report sexual harassment and assault, less than 20% were satisfied with the outcome. The study therefore contributes to a body of empirical studies showing workplace sexual harassment negatively impacts on personal safety and professional productivity. In particular, the study shines attention on the role of fieldwork site directors in establishing clear rules to discourage sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/567418|title=News Bureau {{!}} ILLINOIS|last=Yates|first=Diana|website=news.illinois.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SAFE2 ==
In 2017, the qualitative findings of SAFE13 were published. Authored by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy, the study focused on the experiences of 26 interviewees, who were mostly anthropologists or [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] (23 of 26 interviewees), women (23 of 26), and white (21 of 26).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Robin G.|last2=Rutherford|first2=Julienne N.|last3=Hinde|first3=Katie|last4=Clancy|first4=Kathryn B. H.|date=2017-12-01|title=Signaling Safety: Characterizing Fieldwork Experiences and Their Implications for Career Trajectories|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aman.12929/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=119|issue=4|pages=710–722|doi=10.1111/aman.12929|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants described incidents of sexual harassment in multiple fieldwork sites, so fifty-four field contexts are represented in their narratives. Twelve participants recalled working at field sites with clear anti-harassment rules (representing 18 fieldwork sites). These sites had training, explicit conversations, and senior researchers modelled proactive behaviour to redress sexual harassment. Actively enforced anti-harassment policies were associated with positive fieldwork experiences where scientists felt safe, valued and equal. These sites were categorised by the researchers as "green" contexts where best practice was enforced by senior members of the research team. As a result there were fewer negative experiences, and transgressions were acted upon by leaders.

The rest of the participants described ambiguity or lack of clarity about codes of conduct. Even if they had some rules, sexual harassment still took place because were no consequences. Ambiguity led to repercussions for scientists who resisted sexual coercion, such as being alienated from colleagues and being denied professional opportunities. Harassment and negative fieldwork experiences also led to negative letters of employment, strained workplace relationships, career stalling, being forced to move to another site, or leaving their careers. The hostility would be continued into the future in other contexts, such as at conferences. Some participants were discouraged or prevented from taking formal reporting action by administrators. The researchers call ambiguous sites "yellow" contexts because if there was a vague set of rules, they were not consistently applied. "Red" contexts are fieldwork sites where there is both an absence of rules and consequences. 

SAFE2 and SAFE13 are recognised as having led to concrete institutional and policy changes in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic and public impact ==
Prior to its final publication, the evolving findings of the SAFE13 study received media coverage in 2013, with a focus on how sexual harassment creates a "chilly climate" in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/safe13-field-site-chilly-climate-and-abuse/|title=I had no power to say that's not okay: Reports of harassment and abuse in the field|last=Clancy|first=Kate|date=|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discussion of the evolving study's findings explored the negative impact of harassment on junior women researchers. Media articles focused on fear of professional retribution if scientists report sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/17/young-scientists-face-rampant-sexual-harassment-in-the-field/|title=Study: Young female scientists face sexual harassment, assault while in the field|last=Hogan|first=Caelainn|date=2014-07-17|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other science publishers discussed the sense of powerless that both victims and bystanders face as harassment goes unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/04/survey-finds-sexual-harassment-anthropology|title=Survey Finds Sexual Harassment in Anthropology|date=2013-04-13|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the final report was published, the study became widely cited as evidence that sexual harassment contributes to women leaving science careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmonds|first=Anna|title=Many women scientists sexually harassed during fieldwork|url=https://www.nature.com/news/many-women-scientists-sexually-harassed-during-fieldwork-1.15571|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional scientific societies publicly responded that, beyond making principal researchers responsible for reporting sexual harassment, institutional responses were additionally required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/16/sexual-assault-harassment-science-fieldwork-studies-research-study/12735343/|title=Sex assaults, harassment reported in science fieldwork|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The SAFE13 study inspired women scientists in other fields to conduct similar surveys into sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gewin|first=Virginia|date=2015-03-11|title=Social behaviour: Indecent advances|url=https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7542-251a|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=519|issue=7542|pages=251–253|doi=10.1038/nj7542-251a}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also paved the way for larger institutional surveys on harassment by professional societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201512/astronomy.cfm|title=Astronomy Allies Team Up to Confront Sexual Harassment|website=www.aps.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAFE13 study is referenced in high-profile cases, to contextualise the institutional dynamics that enable harassment to continue over many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-end-sexual-harassment-in-astronomy1/|title=How to End Sexual Harassment in Astronomy|last=Urry|first=Meg|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study has had a major impact on American [[astronomy]] and [[physics]] in particular, as these disciplines increasingly grapple with public incidents of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/30/us/astronomy-sexual-harassment/index.html|title=Sexual harassment in STEM: 'It's tragic'|last=CNN|first=Sara Ganim,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, USA Rep. [[Jackie Speier]] of California sponsored a bill to compel research institutions to report investigations of harassment as a condition of receiving federal grant money. She cited the SAFE13 study as one piece of evidence informing the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://speier.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-jackie-speier-introduces-bill-stop-rampant-sexual-abuse|title=Congresswoman Jackie Speier Introduces Bill to Stop Rampant Sexual Abuse, Harassment in STEM Research|date=2016-09-21|work=Congresswoman Jackie Speier|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also referred to SAFE13 in media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/jackie-speier-sexual-harassment-science/|title=Rep Jackie Speier on Why She's Taking on Sexual Harassment in Science|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the USA [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) announced it would require institutions to report whenever a researcher who is funded by their grants has engaged in sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/issuances/in144.jsp|title=Important Notice No. 144: Harassment (in144) {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSF also expects institutions they fund to provide a harassment-free workplace. The NSF Office of Diversity and Inclusion will additionally provide policies and resources to support this aim, and create an anonymous reporting system to receive direct reports of sexual harassment. The NSF is one of various science agencies under pressure by the [[United States Congress|USA Congress]] to counter sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|date=2018-02-08|title=US science agency will require universities to report sexual harassment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01744-5|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=554|issue=7692|pages=287–288|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-01744-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a major cultural change in scientific science since the SAFE13 study first recommended a review of institutional responses to harassment.

On 27 February 2018, lead researcher of the SAFE13 study, Kathryn (Kate) Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing-review-sexual-harassment-and|title=Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing - A Review of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Science|date=2018-02-27|work=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing identified a need to redress sexual harassment in science as a way to boost opportunities in science. Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kateclancy.com/transcript-of-my-oral-testimony-from-february-27th-congressional-hearing-on-sexual-misconduct-in-the-sciences/|title=Transcript of my oral testimony from February 27th Congressional hearing on sexual misconduct in the sciences {{!}} Context &amp; Variation|website=kateclancy.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years after its preliminary findings were released, the SAFE13 study continues to be referenced in various media articles exploring how victims of sexual harassment are punished when they report harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAFE13 has also been cited as an important resource in responding to the aftermath of the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] movement in 2017, by providing systematic context of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/what-happens-now-studies-of-sexual-harassment-show-the-way/|title=What Happens Now?

Sarin is generally considered a [[weapon of mass destruction]]. Production and stockpiling of Sarin was outlawed as of April 1997 by the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] of 1993, and it is classified as a [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|Schedule 1 substance]]. In June 1994, the UN Special Commission on Iraqi Disarmament reported that it had destroyed Iraq's stockpiles of Sarin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |page= 36 |work= [[UN Chronicle]] |publication-date= September 1, 1994 |volume=31 |issue=3 |title= Nearly half a million litres of chemical warfare agents destroyed in two-year operation. |quote= The two-year operation managed to destroy ... the nerve agents Sarin and Tabun ....

== Health effects ==
[[File:Sarin Biological effects.svg|thumbnail|150px|Sarin (red), acetylcholinesterase (yellow), acetylcholine (blue)]]
Like some other nerve agents that affect the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, Sarin attacks the [[nervous system]] by interfering with the degradation of the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] at neuromuscular junctions. Death will usually occur as a result of [[asphyxia]] due to the inability to control the muscles involved in breathing.

Initial symptoms following exposure to Sarin are a runny nose, tightness in the chest and constriction of the [[pupil]]s. Soon after, the person will have difficulty breathing and they will experience [[nausea]] and drooling. As they continue to lose control of bodily functions, they may vomit, defecate and urinate. This phase is followed by [[Muscle contraction|twitching]] and jerking. Ultimately, the person becomes comatose and suffocates in a series of convulsive [[spasm]]s. Moreover, common mnemonics for the symptomatology of organophosphate poisoning, including Sarin gas, are the "killer B's" of [[bronchorrhea]] and [[bronchospasm]] because they are the leading cause of death,&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Leon. [http://journals.lww.com/em-news/Fulltext/2005/07000/Nerve_Agents__Three_Mechanisms,_Three_Antidotes.11.aspx Nerve Agents: Three Mechanisms, Three Antidotes. Emergency Medicine News. 27(7):12, July 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SLUDGE syndrome|SLUDGE]] – salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal distress, and emesis (vomiting). Death may follow in 1 to 10 minutes after direct inhalation.

Sarin has a high [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] (ease with which a liquid can turn into a gas) relative to similar nerve agents, therefore inhalation can be very dangerous and even vapor concentrations may immediately penetrate the skin. A person’s clothing can release sarin for about 30 minutes after it has come in contact with sarin gas, which can lead to exposure of other people.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Sarin|url= https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/sarin/basics/facts.asp | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = November 18, 2015 | access-date = April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
Treatment measures have been described.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; Treatment is typically with the [[antidote]]s, [[atropine]] and [[pralidoxime]].&lt;ref name=niosh /&gt; [[Atropine]], an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] to [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, is given to treat the physiological symptoms of poisoning. Since muscular response to acetylcholine is mediated through [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, atropine does not counteract the muscular symptoms. Pralidoxime can regenerate [[cholinesterase]]s if administered within approximately five hours. [[Biperiden]], a synthetic acetylcholine antagonist, has been suggested as an alternative to atropine due to its better [[blood–brain barrier]] penetration and higher efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shim|first=TM|author2=McDonough JH |title=Efficacy of biperiden and atropine as anticonvulsant treatment for organophosphorus nerve agent intoxication|journal=Archives of Toxicology|date=May 2000|volume=74|issue=3|pages=165–172|doi=10.1007/s002040050670|pmid=10877003|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA385192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism of action===
Specifically, Sarin is a potent [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor|inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Abu-Qare AW, Abou-Donia MB |title=Sarin: health effects, metabolism, and methods of analysis |journal=[[Food Chem. Toxicol.]] |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1327–33 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12387297 |doi=10.1016/S0278-6915(02)00079-0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an enzyme that degrades the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]] after it is released into the [[synaptic cleft]].  In vertebrates, acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the [[neuromuscular junction]], where signals are transmitted between neurons from the central nervous systems to muscle fibres.  Normally, acetylcholine is released from the neuron to stimulate the muscle, after which it is degraded by acetylcholinesterase, allowing the muscle to relax.  A build-up of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, due to the inhibition of cholinesterase, means the neurotransmitter continues to act on the muscle fibre, so that any nerve impulses are effectively continually transmitted.

Sarin acts on cholinesterase by forming a [[covalent bond]] with the particular [[serine]] residue at the active site. Fluoride is the [[leaving group]], and the resulting [[phosphoester]] is robust and biologically inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Millard CB, Kryger G, Ordentlich A, etal |title=Crystal structures of aged phosphonylated acetylcholinesterase: nerve agent reaction products at the atomic level |journal=Biochemistry |volume=38 |issue=22 |pages=7032–9 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10353814 |doi=10.1021/bi982678l |url=}}. See {{Proteopedia|1cfj}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hörnberg | first1 = Andreas | last2 = Tunemalm | first2 = Anna-Karin | last3 = Ekström | first3 = Fredrik | title = Crystal Structures of Acetylcholinesterase in Complex with Organophosphorus Compounds Suggest that the Acyl Pocket Modulates the Aging Reaction by Precluding the Formation of the Trigonal Bipyramidal Transition State†,‡ | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 46 | issue = 16 | pages = 4815–4825 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17402711 | doi = 10.1021/bi0621361 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its mechanism of action resembles that of some commonly used insecticides, such as [[malathion]]. In terms of biological activity, it resembles [[carbamate]] insecticides, such as [[Carbaryl|Sevin]], and the medicines [[pyridostigmine]], [[neostigmine]], and [[physostigmine]].

=== Diagnostic tests ===
Controlled studies in healthy men have shown that a nontoxic 0.43&amp;nbsp;mg oral dose administered in several portions over a 3-day interval caused average maximum depressions of 22 and 30%, respectively, in plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase levels. A single acute 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg dose caused mild symptoms of intoxication and an average reduction of 38% in both measures of cholinesterase activity. Sarin in blood is rapidly degraded either ''in vivo'' or ''in vitro''. Its primary inactive metabolites have ''in vivo'' serum half-lives of approximately 24 hours. The serum level of unbound [[isopropylmethylphosphonic acid]] (IMPA), a Sarin hydrolysis product, ranged from 2-135&amp;nbsp;µg/L in survivors of a terrorist attack during the first 4 hours post-exposure. Sarin or its metabolites may be determined in blood or urine by gas or liquid chromatography, while cholinesterase activity is usually measured by enzymatic methods.&lt;ref&gt;R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 11th edition, Biomedical Publications, Seal Beach, CA, 2017, pp. 1926-1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer method called "fluoride regeneration" or "fluoride reactivation" detects the presence of nerve agents for a longer period after exposure than the methods described above. Fluoride reactivation is a technique that has been explored since at least the early 2000s. This technique obviates some of the deficiencies of older procedures. Sarin not only reacts with the water in the blood plasma through hydrolysis (forming so-called ‘free metabolites’), but also reacts with various proteins to form ‘protein adducts’. These protein adducts are not so easily removed from the body, and remain for a longer period of time than the free metabolites. One clear advantage of this process is that the period, post-exposure, for determination of Sarin exposure is much longer, possibly 5 to 8 weeks according to at least one study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a484093.pdf|title = Fluoride ion regeneration of sarin (GB) from minipig tissue and fluids following whole-body gb vapor exposure|date = July 2003|accessdate = |website = |publisher = United States Army|last = Jakubowski et. al.|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/5/364.full.pdf|title = Improvements of the Fluoride Reactivation Method for the Verification of Nerve Agent Exposure|last = Degenhardt, et. al.|first = |date = July 2004|journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology|doi = 10.1093/jat/28.5.364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toxicity ===
As a nerve gas, Sarin in its purest form is estimated to be 26 times more deadly than [[cyanide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarin gas as chemical agent – ThinkQuest- Library |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/27393/dreamwvr/agents/sarin1.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808094319/http://library.thinkquest.org/27393/dreamwvr/agents/sarin1.htm |archivedate=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LD50|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] of subcutaneously injected Sarin in mice is 172 μg/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inns|first=RH|author2=NJ Tuckwell |author3=JE Bright |author4=TC Marrs |title=Histochemical Demonstration of Calcium Accumulation in Muscle Fibres after Experimental Organophosphate Poisoning|journal=Hum Exp Toxicol|date=July 1990|volume=9|issue=4|pages=245–250|doi=10.1177/096032719000900407|pmid=2390321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarin is highly toxic, whether by contact with the skin or breathed in. The toxicity of Sarin in humans is largely based on calculations from studies with animals. The lethal concentration of Sarin in air is approximately 35&amp;nbsp;mg per cubic meter per minute for a two-minute exposure time by a healthy adult breathing normally (exchanging 15 liters of air per minute). This number represents the estimated lethal concentration for 50% of exposed victims, the [[LCt50]] value.  There are many ways to make relative comparisons between toxic substances.  The list below compares some current and historic chemical warfare agents with Sarin, with a direct comparison to the respiratory Lct50:

== Production and structure ==
Sarin  is a [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] molecule because it has four chemically distinct [[substituents]] attached to the [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] phosphorus center.&lt;ref&gt;D. E. C. Corbridge "Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology" 5th Edition Elsevier: Amsterdam 1995. {{ISBN|0-444-89307-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The S&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; form (the [[Dextrorotation|(–) optical isomer]]) is the more active [[enantiomer]] due to its greater [[binding affinity]] to [[acetylcholinesterase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Zrinka |last1=Kovarik |first2=Zoran |last2=Radić |first3=Harvey A. |last3=Berman |first4=Vera |last4=Simeon-Rudolf |first5=Elsa |last5=Reiner |first6=Palmer |last6=Taylor |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Acetylcholinesterase active centre and gorge conformations analysed by combinatorial mutations and enantiomeric phosphonates |journal=[[Biochem.

At high [[pH]], sarin decomposes rapidly to nontoxic [[phosphonic acid]] derivatives.

It is usually manufactured and weaponized as a [[racemic]] mixture—an equal mixture of both enantiomeric forms, as this is a simpler process and provides an adequate weapon.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

A number of production pathways can be used to create Sarin. The final reaction typically involves attachment of the isopropoxy group to the phosphorus with an [[alcoholysis]] with [[isopropyl alcohol]]. Two variants of this process are common. One is the reaction of [[methylphosphonyl difluoride]] with isopropyl alcohol, which produces [[hydrofluoric acid]] as a byproduct:

:[[File:Sarin synth with racemic stereochemistry.png|415px]]

The second process, uses equal quantities of [[methylphosphonyl difluoride]] and [[Methylphosphonic acid dichloride|methylphosphonic dichloride]], a mixture "Di-Di" in this process, rather than just the difluoride.  This reaction also gives Sarin, but [[hydrochloric acid]] as a byproduct instead. The Di-Di process was used by the United States for the production of its unitary sarin stockpile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://fas.org/irp/threat/mctl98-2/p2sec04.pdf|title = Chemical Weapons Technology|date = 1998|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |author = Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme below describes an example of Di-Di process. The selection of reagents is arbitrary and reaction conditions and product yield depend on the selected reagents. Inert atmosphere and anhydrous conditions are used for synthesis of sarin and other organophosphates.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Sarin-di-di-process-by-AHRLS-2011.png|500x500px|An example of "di-di" process using arbitrary reagents.|center|frameless]]

As both reactions leave considerable acid in the product, bulk sarin produced without further treatment has a very poor shelf life and would be rather destructive to containers or weapon systems. Various methods have been tried to resolve these problems. In addition to industrial [[refining]] techniques to purify the chemical itself, various additives have been tried to combat the effects of the acid, such as:
* [[Tributylamine]] was added to US sarin produced at [[Rocky Mountain Arsenal]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.wood.army.mil/chmdsd/images/pdfs/Jan-June%202006/Kirby-Nerve%20Gas.pdf|title = Nerve Gas: America's Fifteen Year Struggle for Modern Chemical weapons|last = Kirby|first = Reid|date = January 2006|journal = [[Army Chemical Review]]|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Isopropylamine]] was included as part of the [[M687]] 155&amp;nbsp;mm field artillery shell, which was a [[Binary chemical weapon|binary]] sarin weapon system developed by the US Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Michael Hedges |publication-date= May 18, 2004|title= Shell said to contain sarin poses questions for U.S. |work= [[Houston Chronicle]] |page=A1 |url=http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/Artillery-shell-with-sarin-poses-dilemma-for-U-S-1974450.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012210347/http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/Artillery-shell-with-sarin-poses-dilemma-for-U-S-1974450.php |archivedate=2015-10-12 |accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another byproduct of these two chemical processes is [[diisopropyl methylphosphonate]], formed when a second isopropyl alcohol reacts with the Sarin itself. This chemical degrades into [[isopropyl methylphosphonic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=967&amp;tid=203 |title=Toxic Substances Portal – Diisopropyl Methylphosphonate (DIMP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Degradation and shelf life ==
[[File:Sarin test rabbit.jpg|thumb|upright|Rabbit used to check for leaks at former Sarin production plant ([[Rocky Mountain Arsenal]]), 1970]]

The most important chemical reactions of phosphoryl halides is the [[hydrolysis]] of the bond between phosphorus and the fluoride. This P-F bond is easily broken by nucleophilic agents, such as water and [[hydroxide]]. At high [[pH]], sarin decomposes rapidly to nontoxic [[phosphonic acid]] derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/types-of-chemical-agent/nerve-agents/|title=Nerve agents|publisher=OPCW}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft1st|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial breakdown of sarin is into isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA), a chemical that is not commonly found in nature except as a breakdown product of sarin (this is useful for detecting the recent deployment of sarin as a weapon). IMPA then degrades into methylphosphonic acid (MPA), which can also be produced by other organophosphates.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Sample, ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 17, 2013, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/17/sarin-deadly-history-nerve-agent-syria-un Sarin: the deadly history of the nerve agent used in Syria]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarin with residual acid degrades after a period of several weeks to several months. The shelf life can be shortened by impurities in [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor materials]]. According to the [[CIA]], some Iraqi sarin had a shelf life of only a few weeks, owing mostly to impure precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|date=July 15, 1996|url=https://fas.org/irp/gulf/cia/960715/72569.htm|title=Stability of Iraq's Chemical Weapon Stockpile|accessdate=August 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with nerve agents such as [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]] and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], sarin can have a short shelf life. Therefore, it is usually stored as two separate precursors that produce sarin when combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/sarin-nerve-agent.html | title = Key Points on Sarin: The ‘Most Volatile’ of Nerve Agents | author = Russell Goldmanpril | date = April 6, 2017 | publisher = ''New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarin's shelf life can be extended by increasing the purity of the precursor and intermediates and incorporating [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizers]] such as [[tributylamine]]. In some formulations, tributylamine is replaced by [[diisopropylcarbodiimide]] (DIC), allowing sarin to be stored in [[aluminium]] casings. In [[binary chemical weapon]]s, the two precursors are stored separately in the same [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] and mixed to form the agent immediately before or when the shell is in flight. This approach has the dual benefit of solving the stability issue and increasing the safety of Sarin munitions.

== History ==

Sarin was discovered in 1938 in [[Wuppertal]]-Elberfeld in Germany by scientists at [[IG Farben]] who were attempting to create stronger pesticides; it is the most toxic of the four [[Nerve agent#G-Series|G-Series nerve agents]] made by Germany. The compound, which followed the discovery of the [[nerve agent]] [[tabun (nerve agent)|Tabun]], was named in honor of its discoverers: [[Gerhard Schrader|'''S'''chrader]], [[Otto Ambros|'''A'''mbros]], Gerhard '''R'''itter, and von der L'''in'''de.&lt;ref name="Evans2008"&gt;{{cite book

=== Use as a weapon ===

In mid-1939, the formula for the agent was passed to the [[chemical warfare]] section of the [[German Army Weapons Office]], which ordered that it be brought into mass production for wartime use. Pilot plants were built, and a high-production facility was under construction (but was not finished) by the end of [[World War II]]. Estimates for total Sarin production by Nazi Germany range from 500&amp;nbsp;kg to 10&amp;nbsp;tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* 1950s (early): [[NATO]] adopted sarin as a standard chemical weapon, and both the USSR and the United States produced sarin for military purposes.
* 1953: 20-year-old [[Ronald Maddison]], a [[Royal Air Force]] engineer from [[Consett]], [[County Durham]], died in human testing of Sarin at the [[Porton Down]] chemical warfare testing facility in [[Wiltshire]], England. Ten days after his death an [[inquest]] was held in secret which returned a verdict of [[Death by misadventure|misadventure]].

'''''The Emperor's New Drugs – Exploding the Antidepressant Myth''''' is a 2009 book by [[Irving Kirsch]], arguing that the [[chemical imbalance theory]] of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] is wrong and that [[antidepressants]] have little or no direct effect on depression but, because of their common serious side-effects, they are a powerful [[placebo]].&lt;ref name="Kirsch2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving Kirsch|title=The Emperor's New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth|date=13 October 2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-8635-2|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument==
While analyzing antidepressant trials as part of his research into the [[placebo]] effect, Kirsch realised that drug companies do not publish all of their disappointing antidepressant trial results, but most decisions about the efficacy of an antidepressant are based only on published results. Using the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], he and his colleagues acquired from the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] the unpublished trial results for six antidepressants. When the results from both published and unpublished studies were averaged, the researchers concluded that the drugs produced a small but [[Clinical significance|clinically meaningless]] improvement in mood compared with an inert placebo (sugar pill).&lt;ref name=Medscape/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirsch2002&gt;{{cite journal|title= The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|author1=Kirsch, Irving |author2=Moore, Thomas J. |author3=Scoboria, Alan |author4=Nicholls, Sarah S |journal=Prevention &amp; Treatment|volume=5|issue=1|date= Jul 2002|doi= 10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Some researchers have questioned the statistical basis of this study suggesting that it underestimates the effect size of antidepressants&lt;ref name="HORDER2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horder J, Matthews P, Waldmann R | title = Placebo, Prozac and PLoS: significant lessons for psychopharmacology | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England) | volume = 25 | issue = 10 | pages = 1277–88 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20571143 | doi = 10.1177/0269881110372544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOUNTOULAKIS2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fountoulakis KN, Möller HJ | title = Efficacy of antidepressants: a re-analysis and re-interpretation of the Kirsch data | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–8 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20800012 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145710000957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other studies have reached a range of supporting and conflicting conclusions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gibbons RD, Hur K, Brown CH, Davis JM, Mann JJ | title = Benefits from antidepressants: synthesis of 6-week patient-level outcomes from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials of fluoxetine and venlafaxine | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 572–9 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22393205 | pmc = 3371295 | doi = 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2044 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Fournier JC, DeRubeis RJ, Hollon SD, etal |title=Antidepressant drug effects and depression severity: a patient-level meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=303 |issue=1 |pages=47–53 |date=January 2010  |pmid=20051569 |pmc=3712503 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1943 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine whether their averaging of results was hiding a meaningful benefit to more-severely depressed patients by combining their results with those of moderately and mildly depressed patients, he and his colleagues undertook another study, this time of the four new-generation antidepressants for which all (published and unpublished) trial data were available, and concluded that the difference between drug and placebo effect was greater for more-severely depressed patients, and that this difference was clinically meaningful (but still relatively small) only at the upper end of the very severely depressed category. They attributed this difference to very seriously depressed patients being less responsive to the inert placebo.&lt;ref name=Kirsch2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirsch I, Deacon BJ, Huedo-Medina TB, Scoboria A, Moore TJ, Johnson BT |title=Initial severity and antidepressant benefits: a meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=e45 |date=February 2008  |pmid=18303940 |pmc=2253608 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirsch also addresses the conclusions of the [[STAR*D|a 2004 study]], that if one antidepressant doesn't work on a patient, another should be tried in its place, and then another, until hopefully one will be found to be effective. The 2004 study found that although only 37% of patients were helped by the first antidepressant tried, 67% had found some relief by the time they had tried the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rush AJ |title=Sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (STAR*D): rationale and design |journal=Control Clin Trials |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=119–42 |date=February 2004  |pmid=15061154 |doi= 10.1016/s0197-2456(03)00112-0|url=|name-list-format=vanc |author2= Fava M |author3= Wisniewski SR |displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirsch cites a 1957 study&lt;ref name="Kirsch59"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving Kirsch|title=The Emperor's New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth|url=|date=13 October 2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-8635-2|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which volunteers were given a drug that induces nausea and one to treat nausea. If the anti-nausea drug failed to prevent nausea, they were given another. If that failed, another was tried; and so on. All volunteers experienced complete relief from nausea by the sixth treatment, yet every treatment was a placebo. He concludes that the results of the 2004 antidepressant study are also likely due to the placebo effect.&lt;ref name=Menand&gt;{{cite journal| author=Menand, Louis| url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2010/03/01/100301crat_atlarge_menand?currentPage=all| date=1 March 2010| journal=The New Yorker| title=Head Case: Can Psychiatry Be a Science?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Psychopharmacology revolution#Theory of mood disorders|chemical-imbalance theory of depression]] is based on the efficacy of antidepressants, Kirsch concludes, "It now seems beyond question that the traditional account of depression as a chemical imbalance in the brain is simply wrong."&lt;ref name=Menand/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirsch80"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving Kirsch|title=The Emperor's New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth|url=|date=13 October 2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-8635-2|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and impact==
The European Psychiatric Association published a position paper in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Möller HJ, Bitter I, Bobes J, Fountoulakis K, Höschl C, Kasper S |title=Position statement of the European Psychiatric Association (EPA) on the value of antidepressants in the treatment of unipolar depression |journal=Eur. Psychiatry |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=114–28 |year=2012 |pmid=22119161 |doi=10.1016/j.eurpsy.2011.08.002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924933811001398}}&lt;/ref&gt; that described Kirsch's argument as "misleading".  The organization argues that 
* The mathematical treatment of the data was flawed and underestimates the efficacy of antidepressants; 
* The analysis incorrectly focuses on mean differences between groups and ignores important subgroup effects; 
* The size effect cutoff of 0.50 is arbitrary and not demonstrated to be clinically meaningful; 
* That efficacy measured by the 15-20% difference between placebo and active antidepressant treatment in rate of remission corresponds to moderate to strong efficacy in evidence-based medicine analyses, and 
* Kirsch's analysis disregards the results of double-blind, placebo controlled maintenance studies that show highly statistical effects on the rate of relapse for those treated with antidepressants relative to those receiving placebo

[[Marcia Angell]]'s review of The Emperor's New Drugs welcomes Kirsch's work as a long overdue application of the scientific method to a field lacking rigorous scientific analysis, stating "Kirsch is a faithful proponent of the scientific method, and his voice therefore brings a welcome objectivity to a subject often swayed by anecdotes, emotions, or, as we will see, self-interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/06/23/epidemic-mental-illness-why/ |title=The Epidemic of Mental Illness: Why? |last=Angell |first=Marcia |website=[[New York Review of Books]] |publication-date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Daniel Carlat]] called the book "an important book, with the reservation that Kirsch’s selective use of data gives him the appearance of an anti-antidepressant partisan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Book Review: The Emperor’s New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth. Irving Kirsch Basic Books; 2010. | pmc=3001545 | page=E873 | volume=182 | issue=18 | journal=CMAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He states that Irving's conclusions are "provocative but unconvincing", noting that many drugs such as benzodiazepines have been tested for antidepressant activity and found inactive.  Carlat argues that if antidepressants were acting purely via a placebo effect, any benzodiazepines and other drugs would show activity as well.

In a 2012 episode of [[CBS]]'s ''[[60 Minutes]]'' featuring Kirsch and his book, host [[Lesley Stahl]] said, "The medical community is at war – battling over the scientific research and writings of a psychologist named Irving Kirsch ... Kirsch and his studies have triggered a furious counterattack, mainly from psychiatrists."&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/treating-depression-is-there-a-placebo-effect/|title=Treating Depression: Is there a Placebo Effect? |date=19 February 2012 |website= CBS, 60 Minutes |publisher= |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the program's airing, [[Jeffrey Lieberman]], the American Psychiatric Association's president elect at the time, said, "Dr. Kirsch is mistaken and confused, and he's ideologically biased in his thinking. He is conducting an analysis and interpreting the data to support his ideologically biased perspective.  What he is concluding is inaccurate, and what he is communicating is misleading to people and potentially harmful to those who really suffer from depression and would be expected to benefit from antidepressant medication. To say that antidepressants are no better than placebo is just plain wrong." &lt;ref name=Medscape&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/760569 |author= Fran Lowry|title=APA Blasts 60 Minutes Program on Antidepressants |date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The rhetorical presidency''' is a political [[communication theory]] that describes the communication and government style of [[U.S. president]]s in the twentieth century. This theory describes the transition from a presidency that directed rhetoric toward the [[United States Congress]] and other government bodies, to one that addresses rhetoric, policy and ideas directly to the public.

After [[political scientists]] introduced this theory in 1981&lt;ref name="Caesar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ceaser|first=James W.|author2=Glen E. Thuerow |author3=Jeffrey Tulis |author4=Joseph M Bessette |title=The Rise of the Rhetorical Presidency|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|date=Spring 1981|volume=11|issue=2|pages=158–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Jeffrey Tulis authored ''The Rhetorical Presidency'' in 1987 establishing itself as the first book on the theory. Tulis established three stages in his book how presidential rhetoric evolved throughout the U.S.' history: the "''Old Way''", the "''Middle Way''" and the "''New Way''".&lt;ref name="Tulis"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey |last=Tulis|title=The Rhetorical Presidency|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=GRx5sYilShIC}}|year=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-02295-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulis's book sparked much debate over the historical evolution of presidential rhetoric. Presidential rhetoric integrates both verbal and visual rhetoric practices to gather the support of the public. 
== History ==
The term "rhetorical presidency" was introduced by [[political scientists]] James Ceaser, Glen E. Thurow, Jeffrey Tulis, and Joseph Bessette in 1981.&lt;ref name="Caesar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ceaser|first=James W.|author2=Glen E. Thuerow |author3=Jeffrey Tulis |author4=Joseph M Bessette |title=The Rise of the Rhetorical Presidency|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|date=Spring 1981|volume=11|issue=2|pages=158–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulis wrote the foundational book on the subject entitled ''The Rhetorical Presidency'', in 1987. Tulis' book spurred heated debate on the history and evolution of presidential rhetoric,{{By whom|date = March 2014}} with Tulis himself later revising positions{{Elucidate|date = March 2014}} taken in his book.

By relying less on the traditional methods of communication with Congress and, Presidents rely more on the approval of the people as a means of governance. Presidents hope the people put pressure on their members of Congress to side with the President.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McFarlane |first1=Megan D. |title=Visualizing the Rhetorical Presidency: Barack Obama in the Situation Room |journal=Visual Communication Quarterly |date=January 1, 2016 |volume=23 |issue=No. 1 |pages=3-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Development ==
He claimed that changes in the rhetorical style of the presidency were a symptom of a shift in American's underlying conceptions regarding how government should function. Rhetorical presidency cut congressional dominion, influenced the power to fit public policy, and put the president in front with the American people to show the development of leadership as an imperative demeanor of presidential character and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillespie|first1=Andra|title=Whose Black Politics? Cases in Post-Racial Black Leadership|date=December 23, 2009|publisher=Routledge|page=157|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetorical presidency is both a structural theory and a theory of how presidents communicate in the media age. It draws from political science, history and communication studies.&lt;ref name="Medhurst1996"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin J.|last=Medhurst|title=Beyond the Rhetorical Presidency|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=frR3AAAAMAAJ|p=XI}}|year=1996|publisher=Texas A &amp; M University Press|isbn=978-0-89096-710-2 |p=XI=XXV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tulis delineates the historical arc of presidential rhetoric in the United States as having three stages: the "''Old Way''", the "''Middle Way''" and the "''New Way''".

The Old Way (1789–1900) corresponds with traditional conventions of [[Power in international relations|statecraft]] and rhetoric addressed to Congress, the courts or visiting dignitaries. Most presidential rhetoric was delivered in writing. The only attempt during this period to use rhetoric to address the whole people was President [[Andrew Johnson|Andrew Johnson's]] [[Swing Around the Circle]], which failed.&lt;ref name="Tulis"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey |last=Tulis|title=The Rhetorical Presidency|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=GRx5sYilShIC}}|year=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-02295-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Middle Way (1900–1913) marks a hybrid between internal and external appeals on important matters epitomized by the presidency of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He met fierce opposition from his own party in Congress regarding the [[Hepburn Act]], with appeals directly to the people.&lt;ref name=Tulis /&gt; [[William McKinley]]'s 1898 speaking tour is argued to be an integral part of developing the "''Middle Way''" that Theodore Roosevelt is mainly credited for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saladin |first1=John |title=William McKinley and the Rhetorical Presidency |journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |date=March 3, 2011 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=119-134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Way (1913–present) refers to a presidency which dispenses with traditional statecraft and instead regularly engages the public. [[Woodrow Wilson]] employed two types of rhetoric: the policy speech and the visionary speech. A policy speech explains and defends the president's policy on a certain issue, while the visionary speech articulates a goal for the future and calls the nation towards that goal. Since Wilson, all Presidents have emphasized these tools.&lt;ref name=Tulis /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=Roderick P.|title=Beyond the Rhetorical Presidency|year=1996|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|location=College Station|isbn=0-89096-710-5|pages=77–103|author2=Kathleen E. Kendall |editor=Martin J. Medhurst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Verbal and Visual Rhetoric ==
Verbal rhetoric used by Presidents is the most common type of presidential rhetoric used. The implication of Woodrow Wilson's policy speeches and visionary speeches laid the groundwork for the following Presidents. The use of the [[State of the Union Address]] is an example of Presidents explaining and defending their own policies to gain the support of the public directly. 

Using visual images, text and video to influence or persuade an audience is how Presidents utilize [[visual rhetoric]] in their own presidential rhetoric. The increasing growth of the mass media has increased the value of visual rhetoric in helping create a positive political image with the people.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McFarlane |first1=Megan D. |title=Visualizing the Rhetorical Presidency: Barack Obama in the Situation Room |journal=Visual Communication Quarterly |date=January 1, 2016 |volume=23 |issue=No. 1 |pages=3-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology]], a '''tribe''' is a [[human]] [[social group]]. Exact definitions of what constitutes a tribe vary among anthropologists, and the term is itself considered controversial in academic circles in part due to its association with [[colonialism]]. In general use, the term may refer to people perceived by a population to be [[wikt:primitive|primitive]] and may have negative connotations. The concept is often contrasted with other social groups concepts, such as [[nation]]s, [[state (polity)|state]]s, and forms of [[kinship]].

In some places, such as [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|India]] and [[Tribe (Native American)|North America]], tribes are [[Polity|polities]] that have been granted legal recognition and limited autonomy by the national or federal government.

== Etymology ==
The word tribe first occurs in English in 12th-century [[Middle English]]-literature, in reference to the [[twelve tribes of Israel]]. The Middle English word is derived from Old French ''tribu'' and, in turn, from Latin ''tribus'' (plural ''tribūs''), in reference to a supposed tripartite division of the original Roman state along ethnic lines, into ''tribūs'' known as the ''Ramnes'' (or ''Ramnenses''), ''Tities'' (or ''Titienses''), and ''Luceres'', corresponding, according to [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], to the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], [[Sabines]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] respectively. The ''Ramnes'' were named after [[Romulus]], leader of the Latins, ''Tities'' after [[Titus Tatius]], leader of the Sabines, and ''Luceres'' after [[Lucumo]], leader of an Etruscan army that had assisted the Latins. In 242–240 BC, the [[Tribal Assembly]] (''comitia tributa'') in the [[Roman Republic]] included 35 tribes (four "urban tribes" and 31 "rural tribes"). According to [[Livy]], the three "tribes" were squadrons of cavalry, rather than ethnic divisions.

The term's ultimate etymology is uncertain, perhaps from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] roots ''tri-'' ("three") and ''bhew'' ("to be"). The classicist [[Gregory Nagy]] says,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Nagy]],''Greek Mythology and Poetics'', {{Page numbers needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing the linguist [[Émile Benveniste]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Émile Benveniste]], ''Origines de la formation des noms en indo-européen'',  {{Page numbers needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Umbrian]] ''trifu'' (equivalent of the Latin ''tribus'') is apparently derived from a combination of ''*tri-'' and ''*bhu-'', where the second element is cognate with the Greek root ''phúō'' φύω “to bring forth” and the Greek [[wikt:φυλή|''phulē'']] φυλή "clan, race, people" (plural ''phylai'' φυλαί). The Greek ''[[polis]]'' ("state" or "city") was, like the Roman state, divided into three ''phylai''.

In Europe during the late medieval era, the Bible was written mostly in [[New Latin]] and instead of ''tribus''  the word ''phyle'' was used, derived from the Greek ''phulē''&lt;!-- 'and ultimately the Hebrew, meaning or "sceptre" ' ← Commented this out as the connection, if any, is not at all clear  --&gt;. In the historical sense, "tribe", "race" and "clan" have often been used interchangeably.

==Usage controversy==
The term and concept of a ''tribe'' is controversial among anthropologists and other academics active in the [[social science]]s. The term ''tribe'' was in common use in the field of anthropology until the late 1950s and 1960s, during which time scholars began to reassess its utility. In 1970, anthropologist [[J. Clyde Mitchell]] writes:
:The tribe, a long respected category of analysis in anthropology, has recently been the object of some scrutiny by anthropologists ... Doubts about the utility of the tribe as an analytical category have almost certainly arisen out of the rapid involvement of peoples, even in the remotest parts of the globe, in political, economic and sometimes direct social relationship with industrial nations. The doubts, however, are based ultimately on the definition and meaning which different scholars give to the term 'tribe', its adjective 'tribal', and its abstract form 'tribalism'.&lt;ref name="MITCHELL-1970-83"&gt;Mitchell, Clyde J. 1970. "Tribe and Social Change in South Central Africa: A Situational Approach" in Gutkind, Peter C. W. Editor. ''The Passing of Tribal Man in Africa'', p. 83. [[Brill Publishers|Brill]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing in 2013, scholar Matthew Ortoleva notes that "like the word ''Indian'', ''[t]ribe'' is a word that has connotations of colonialism."&lt;ref name="ORTOLEVA-2013-95"&gt;Ortoleva, Matthew. 2013. "We Face East" in Goggin, Peter N. Editor. ''Environmental Rhetoric and Ecologies of Place'', p. 95. [[Routledge]]. {{ISBN|9781135922658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tribes and nations ==
Considerable debate has accompanied efforts to define and characterize tribes. When scholars use the term, they may perceive differences between pre-state tribes and contemporary tribes; there is also general controversy over [[cultural evolution]] and [[colonialism]].  In the popular imagination, tribes reflect a way of life that predates, and is more natural than that in modern states. Tribes also privilege primordial social ties and are clearly bounded, homogeneous, parochial, and stable.  Tribes are an organization among families (including clans and lineages), which generates a social and ideological basis for solidarity that is in some way more limited than that of an "ethnic group" or of a "nation".  [[Anthropology|Anthropological]] and [[Ethnohistory|ethnohistorical]] research has challenged all of these notions.

[[Cultural anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[Elman Service]] presented a [[Sociopolitical typology|system of classification]] for societies in all human cultures, based on the evolution of [[social inequality]] and the role of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. This system of classification contains four categories:

# [[Hunter-gatherer]] [[Band society|bands]] that are generally [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]]
# Tribal societies with some limited instances of [[social rank]] and prestige
# [[Social stratification|Stratified]] tribal societies led by [[tribal chief|chieftains]] (see [[Chiefdom]])
# [[Civilization]]s, with complex social hierarchies and organized, institutional governments

In his 1975 study, ''The Notion of the Tribe'', [[Cultural anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Morton Fried|Morton H. Fried]] provided numerous examples of tribes that encompassed members who spoke different languages and practiced different rituals, or who shared languages and rituals with members of other tribes.  Similarly, he provided examples of tribes in which people followed different political leaders, or followed the same leaders as members of other tribes.  He concluded that tribes in general are characterized by fluid boundaries and heterogeneity, are not parochial, and are dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Morton H. Fried (1972) ''The Notion of Tribe''.  Cummings Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isolierte-Völker.png|thumb|300px|A map of [[uncontacted tribes]], around the start of the 21st century]]
Fried proposed that most contemporary tribes do not have their origin in pre-state tribes, but rather in pre-state bands. Such "secondary" tribes, he suggested, developed as modern products of state expansion. Bands comprise small, mobile, and fluid social formations with weak [[leadership]]. They do not generate surpluses, pay no taxes, and support no standing army.  Fried argued that secondary tribes develop in one of two ways. First, states could set them up as means to extend administrative and economic influence in their hinterland, where direct political control costs too much. States would encourage (or require) people on their frontiers to form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses and taxes, and would have a leadership responsive to the needs of neighboring states (the so-called "scheduled" tribes of the United States or of British India provide good examples of this). Second, bands could form "secondary" tribes as a means to defend against state expansion. Members of bands would form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses that could support a standing army that could fight against states, and they would have a leadership that could co-ordinate economic production and military activities.

[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] continue to explore the development of pre-state tribes. Current research suggests that tribal structures constituted one type of adaptation to situations providing plentiful yet unpredictable resources. Such structures proved flexible enough to coordinate production and distribution of food in times of scarcity, without limiting or constraining people during times of surplus.

The '''Zhe School''' (浙派) was a [[school]] of painters and was part of the Northern School, which thrived during the [[Ming dynasty]]. The school was led by [[Dai Jin]], traditionally considered its founder. The "Zhe" of the name refers to Dai Jin's home province - [[Zhejiang]]. The school was not a school in the proper sense of the word in that the painters did not formulate a new distinctive style, preferring instead to further the style of the [[Southern Song]], specializing in decorative and large paintings. Instead the school was identified by the formal, academic and conservative outlook, being a revival in the early [[Ming Dynasty]] of the Ma-Xia (Ma Yuan 馬遠, Xia Gui 夏珪), 'academic', style of painting landscapes of the Southern Song.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/painting-zhe-school.php&lt;/ref&gt;
