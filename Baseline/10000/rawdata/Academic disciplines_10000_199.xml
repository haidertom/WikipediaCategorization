      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12886">{{short description|Areas of sea water, fresh water, or groundwater that are depleted of dissolved oxygen}}
'''Anoxic waters''' are areas of sea water, fresh water, or [[groundwater]] that are depleted of [[dissolved oxygen]] and are a more severe condition of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]].  The US Geological Survey defines anoxic groundwater as those with dissolved oxygen concentration of less than 0.5 milligrams per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/vocs/national_assessment/report/glossary.html|publisher=US Geological Survey|title= Volatile Organic Compounds in the Nation's Ground Water and Drinking-Water Supply Wells: Supporting Information: Glossary|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition is generally found in areas that have restricted water exchange.

In most cases, oxygen is prevented from reaching the deeper levels by a physical barrier&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Bjork, Mats |author2=Short, Fred |author3=McLeod, Elizabeth |author4=Beer, Sven |year=2008|title=Managing Sea-grasses for Resilience to Climate Change|series=Volume 3 of IUCN Resilience Science Group Working Papers|location=Gland, Switzerland|publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN)|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RP79Q6brJcoC&amp;pg=PA24 24]|isbn=978-2-8317-1089-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by a pronounced density stratification, in which, for instance, heavier [[hypersaline]] waters rest at the bottom of a basin.  Anoxic conditions will occur if the rate of [[redox|oxidation]] of organic matter by [[bacteria]] is greater than the supply of [[dissolved oxygen]].

Anoxic waters are a natural phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;Richards, 1965; Sarmiento 1988-B&lt;/ref&gt; and have occurred throughout geological history.  In fact, some postulate that the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], a mass extinction of species from world's oceans, resulted from widespread anoxic conditions.  At present anoxic basins exist, for example, in the [[Baltic Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;Jerbo, 1972;Hallberg, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere (see below). Recently, there have been some indications that [[eutrophication]] has increased the extent of the anoxic zones in areas including the Baltic Sea, the Gulf of Mexico,&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxics.usgs.gov/hypoxia/mississippi/oct_jun/index.html |accessdate=2011-02-09 |title=Streamflow and Nutrient Delivery to the Gulf of Mexico for October 2009 to May 2010 (Preliminary)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hood Canal]] in Washington State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsg.washington.edu/mas/pdfs/hypoxia101.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927102104/http://wsg.washington.edu/mas/pdfs/hypoxia101.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes and effects==
Anoxic conditions result from several factors; for example, [[water stagnation|stagnation]] conditions, [[density stratification]],&lt;ref&gt;Gerlach, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; inputs of organic material, and strong [[thermocline]]s.  Examples of which are [[fjord]]s (where shallow sills at their entrance prevent circulation) and deep ocean western boundaries where circulation is especially low while production at upper levels is exceptionally high.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} In wastewater treatment, the absence of oxygen alone is indicated ''anoxic'' while the term [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia|anaerobic]] is used to indicate the absence of any common electron acceptor such as [[nitrate]], [[sulfate]] or oxygen.

When oxygen is depleted in a basin, bacteria first turn to the second-best electron acceptor, which in sea water, is [[nitrate]]. [[Denitrification]] occurs, and the nitrate will be consumed rather rapidly. After reducing some other minor elements, the bacteria will turn to [[redox|reducing]] [[sulfate]]. This results in the byproduct of hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), a chemical toxic to most biota and responsible for the characteristic "rotten egg" smell and dark black sediment color.&lt;ref name="Castro and Huber,2005"&gt;Castro and Huber,2005&lt;/ref&gt;

SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S +H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + chemical energy

If anoxic sea water becomes reoxygenized, [[sulfide]]s will be oxidized to sulfate according to the chemical equation:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

HS&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;

or, more precisely:

(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;106&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 53 SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → 53 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 53 HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 53 HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; +16 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 53 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

Anoxia is quite common in muddy ocean bottoms where there are both high amounts of organic matter and the low levels inflow of oxygenated water through the sediment.  Below a few centimeters from the surface the interstitial water (water between sediment) is oxygen free.

Anoxia is further influenced by biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount oxygen used by marine organisms in the process of breaking down organic matter.  BOD is influenced by the type of organisms present, the pH of the water, temperature, and the type of organic matter present in the area.  BOD is directly related to the amount of dissolved oxygen available, especially in smaller bodies of water such as rivers and streams.  As BOD increases, available oxygen decreases.  This causes stress on larger organisms.  BOD comes from natural and anthropogenic sources, including: dead organisms, manure, wastewater, and urban runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5.2 Dissolved Oxygen and Biochemical Oxygen Demand|url=http://water.epa.gov/type/rsl/monitoring/vms52.cfm|work=Water: Monitoring &amp; Assessment|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Baltic Sea, the slowed rate of decomposition under anoxic conditions has left remarkably preserved [[fossil]]s retaining impressions of soft body parts, in [[Lagerstätte]]n.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nudds|first=John|last2=Selden|first2=Paul|date=2008-07-01|title=Fossil–Lagerstätten|journal=Geology Today|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=153–158|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2451.2008.00679.x|issn=1365-2451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human caused anoxic conditions==

[[Eutrophication]], an influx of nutrients (phosphate/nitrate), often a byproduct of agricultural run-off and sewage discharge, can result in large but short-lived algae blooms. Upon a bloom’s conclusion, the dead algae sink to the bottom and are broken down until all oxygen is expended.  Such a case is the Gulf of Mexico where a seasonal dead zone occurs, which can be disturbed by weather patterns such as hurricanes and tropical convection.  Sewage discharge, specifically that of nutrient concentrated “sludge”, can be especially damaging to ecosystem diversity.  Species sensitive to anoxic conditions are replaced by fewer hardier species, reducing the overall variability of the affected area.&lt;ref name="Castro and Huber,2005"/&gt;

Gradual environmental changes through eutrophication or [[global warming]] can cause major oxic-anoxic regime shifts. Based on model studies this can occur abruptly, with a transition between an oxic state dominated by [[cyanobacteria]], and an anoxic state with sulfate-reducing bacteria and phototrophic [[Purple sulfur bacteria|sulfur bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00912-x|title=Oxic-anoxic regime shifts mediated by feedbacks between biogeochemical processes and microbial community dynamics|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|issue=1|pages=789|doi=10.1038/s41467-017-00912-x|pmid=28986518|pmc=5630580|authors=Bush et al.|year=2017|bibcode=2017NatCo...8..789B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Daily and seasonal cycles==
The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold.  Following Henry’s Law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it.  This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale.  Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months.  This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released.

Daily cycles are also influenced by the activity of photosynthetic organisms.  The lack of photosynthesis during nighttime hours in the absence of light can result in anoxic conditions intensifying throughout the night with a maximum shortly after sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dissolved Oxygen Depletion in Lake Erie|url=http://epa.gov/glnpo/glindicators/water/oxygenb.html|work=Great Lakes Monitoring|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological adaptation==

Organisms have adapted a variety of mechanisms to live within anoxic sediment.  While some are able to pump oxygen from higher water levels down into the sediment, other adaptations include specific hemoglobins for low oxygen environments, slow movement to reduce rate of metabolism, and symbiotic relationships with anaerobic bacteria.  In all cases, the prevalence of toxic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S results in low levels of biologic activity and a lower level of species diversity if the area is not normally anoxic.&lt;ref name="Castro and Huber,2005"/&gt;

'''Anti-suffragism''' was a political movement composed of both men and women that began in the late 19th century in order to campaign against [[women's suffrage]] in countries such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Anti-suffragism was a largely [[Conservatism|conservative]] movement that sought to keep the [[status quo]] for women and which opposed the idea giving women equal suffrage rights. It was closely associated with "domestic feminism," the belief that women had the right to complete freedom within the home. In the United States, these activists were often referred to as "remonstrants" or "antis."

== Background ==
The anti-suffrage movement was a [[countermovement]] opposing the social movement of [[women's suffrage]] in various countries.{{Sfn|Burt|1998|p=69}} It could also be considered a [[Public sphere|counterpublic]] that espoused a [[Conservatism|Conservative]] defense of the [[status quo]] for women and men in society.{{Sfn|Maddux|2004|p=285}} As a countermovement, the anti-suffrage movement didn't gain traction or start to organize until the women's suffrage began to challenge the current [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a9lFXY0kkEwC&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;ots=6cdHKX58Pg&amp;dq=anti-suffragist%20countermovement&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q=anti-suffragist%20countermovement&amp;f=false|title=Women's Movements in the United States: Woman Suffrage, Equal Rights, and Beyond|last=Buechler|first=Steven M.|date=1990|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=|isbn=9780813515595|location=|pages=175|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries in the [[Western world|Western World]] began to explore giving women the equal right to vote around the mid 1800s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Areas with the most visible women's suffrage movements were [[Great Britain]] and in the [[United States]], although women's suffrage movements took place in many Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/woman-suffrage|title=Woman suffrage|last=|first=|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514012354/https://www.britannica.com/topic/woman-suffrage|archive-date=14 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-suffrage activities began to emerge in many countries as women publicly advocated for suffrage.{{Sfn|Burt|1998|p=70}}

== Australia ==
Anti suffrage movements were present in [[Australia]] through the 1880s and 1890s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0453b.htm|title=Suffragists|last=Grimshaw|first=Patricia|date=|website=The Encyclopedia of Women and Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia|language=en-gb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410015728/http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0453b.htm|archive-date=10 April 2018|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-suffrage organisations in Australia were "closely associated with the [[Conservative Party of Australia|Conservative Party]], manufacturing interests and anti-[[Socialism|socialist]] forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womensuffrage.org/?p=576|title=The Opponents of Woman Suffrage|last=Strong-Boag|first=Veronica|date=1 February 2012|website=Women Suffrage and Beyond|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429033348/http://womensuffrage.org/?p=576|archive-date=29 April 2017|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian media took part in the anti-suffrage movement, and depicted women as being "weak and unintelligent," emotional and too involved in domestic and trivial matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2011/12/on-this-day-women-get-the-federal-vote|title=On this day: women get the federal vote|last=Verdouw|first=Emily|date=15 December 2011|work=Australian Geographic|access-date=2018-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515143647/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2011/12/on-this-day-women-get-the-federal-vote|archive-date=15 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==
[[Canadians|Canadian]] men and women both became involved in debating the women's suffrage movement in the late 1800s.{{Sfn|Risk|2012|p=384}} Women's suffrage was debated in the Legislative Assembly in [[New Brunswick]] starting in 1885, and anti-suffrage "testimonies" began to appear in the newspapers around that time.{{Sfn|Risk|2012|p=389}}

==Great Britain==

[[File:Anti-suffrage postcard- For a Suffragette the Ducking-Stool.jpg|thumb|Anti-suffrage postcard- For a Suffragette the Ducking-Stool.jpg]]
Organized campaigns against women's suffrage began in earnest in 1905, around the same time that [[suffragette]]s were turning to [[militant]] tactics.{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=7}} In general, most ordinary women had prioritized domestic and family life over paid employment and political activism when it came to the issue of suffrage.{{Sfn|Bush|2007|pp=308-309}} Most historical evidence shows that ordinary women did not have much interest in the right to vote before the first World War and also after suffrage had been granted to women.{{Sfn|Bush|2007|p=311 "The range of evidence gathered from modern historians seems to confirm the view that the 'ordinary woman' had little interest in the vote before the war, and only limited interest once it had been finally placed in her hand."}}   

The [[Women's National Anti-Suffrage League]] was established in London on 21 July 1908. Its aims were to oppose women being granted the vote in British parliamentary elections, although it did support their having votes in local government elections. It was founded at a time when there was a resurgence of support for the women's suffrage movement.

The Women's National Anti-Suffrage League, publisher of the ''Anti-Suffrage Review'', submitted a petition to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 1907 with 87,500 names, but it was rejected by the Petitions Committee of Parliament as "informal".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Robins, [http://www.jsu.edu/depart/english/robins/waysta/way02tpb.htm Way Stations (1913)], p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anti-Suffrage Review'' also used [[shame]] as a tool to fight against the suffrage movement.{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=6}}

An Anti-suffrage correspondence had taken place in the pages of ''[[The Times]]'' through 1906–1907, with further calls for leadership of the anti-suffrage movement being placed in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in February 1908. Possibly as early as 1907, a letter was circulated to announce the creation of a National Women's Anti-Suffrage Association and inviting recipients to become a member of the Central Organising Committee or a member. It was issued under the names of thirty peeresses who would become prominent anti-suffragists, as well as a number of peers and MPs. However, the first meeting of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League only took place the following year on 21 July, at the Westminster Palace Hotel with [[Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey#Family|Lady Jersey]] in the Chair. Seventeen persons were nominated to the central committee at this meeting, including [[Mrs Humphrey Ward]] in the chair of the Literary Committee and [[Gertrude Bell]] as secretary. Other members were Mrs Frederic Harrison, Miss Lonsdale, [[Violet Markham]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]] MP. Beatrice Chamberlain served as the editor of the ''Anti-Suffrage Review''.{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=8}}

The League's aims were to oppose women being granted the parliamentary franchise, though it did support their having votes in local and municipal elections. It published the ''Anti-Suffrage Review'' from December 1908 until 1918. It gathered 337,018 signatures on an anti-suffrage petition and founded the first local branch in Hawkenhurst in Kent. The first London branch was established in South Kensington under the auspices of Mary, Countess of Ilchester. Soon after, in May 1910, a Scottish branch was organised into the Scottish National Anti-Suffrage League by the Duchess of Montrose. By December of that year, there were 26 branches or sub-branches in the country, a total which grew to 82 by April 1909, and 104 in July 1910. It was announced that 2000 subscriptions had been received by December, 1908, rising to 9000 in July, 1909.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In 1910, the group amalgamated with the [[Men's League for Opposing Woman Suffrage]]&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/votes-for-women/articles/the-anti-suffrage-movement|title=The Anti-Suffrage Movement|last=Bush|first=Julia|date=5 March 2018|website=The British Library|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326122211/https://www.bl.uk/votes-for-women/articles/the-anti-suffrage-movement|archive-date=26 March 2018|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form the [[National League for Opposing Women's Suffrage]]{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=7}} with [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]] as president and Lady Jersey as Vice-President. The merger was in effect a takeover, as the president of the former organisation, Lord Cromer, becoming president of the new one.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Owen, ''Lord Cromer: Victorian Imperialist, Edwardian Proconsul'', Oxford University Press (2004), page 376. {{ISBN|0-19-927966-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 [[Lord Curzon]] and [[Lord Weardale]] became joint presidents. By 1914, there were around 15,000 members.{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=9}} The organisation continued its activities and the publication of the ''Anti-Suffrage Review'' until 1918 when both came to an end as women's suffrage was granted.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Reasons for suffrage opposition ===
The opposition to the right for women to vote was a multifaceted phenomenon in which women themselves played a major part.{{Sfn|Bush|2007|p=2 "Women's roles in the British anti-suffrage movement were important, and in some ways distinctive. Women provided a good deal of the initiative and most of the hard work behind the organized opposition, as well as the majority of its declared supporters."}} One of the reasons for opposition from women was that they believed that women were already equal without needing to be able to vote, although women were expected to be "equal" in different spheres from men.{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=10}} Anti-suffragists were also appalled by the tactics of Suffragettes, who they believed "had attacked the very essence of English womanhood."{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=11}} 

Many female maternal reformers, who sought to protect women's defined spheres of motherhood, education, philanthropy, and civil service; felt that women were the better sex for preserving British society through social service to their communities rather than by meddling with politics.{{Sfn|Bush|2007|p=23}} Women considered themselves as less able to participate in politics and that to do so was women just imitating men, instead of being "real women."{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=10}} Some feared that the right to vote would introduce uninformed women in making decisions on important political matters. Since Britain was in the process of colonizing other regions around the globe, some viewed the right to vote as a threat to their imperial power as it would make the British look weak by other nations who were male oriented still.{{Sfn|Bush|2007|pp=109-112}} Some suffragist female groups developed militant and violent tactics which tarnished the image of women as innocent people that the anti-suffragists had been striving to preserve. Anti-suffragists used theses acts as a reasons to show that women were mentally unable to handle political matters and that both genders had different strengths.{{Sfn|Bush|2007|pp=227-231}}     

Women writers promoted anti-suffragism through their wide readerships by raising questions of what ideal women were to be like.{{Sfn|Bush|2007|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ireland ==
Women's suffrage movements had been going on in [[Ireland]] since the 1870s.{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=12}} However, as Suffragettes in Ireland became more militant, more organized anti-suffrage campaigns emerged.{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=12-13}} An Irish branch of the [[Women's National Anti-Suffrage League]] was started in 1909 in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/century/century-women-and-the-vote/opponents-of-the-cause-1.553535|title=Opponents of the Cause|last=Lane|first=Leeann|date=17 October 2012|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-05-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421032702/https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/century/century-women-and-the-vote/opponents-of-the-cause-1.553535|archive-date=21 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This branch of the League also opposed suffrage in Britain as well.{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=13}}

=== Reasons for suffrage opposition ===
Irish opposition to the women's vote was both religious and cultural. Both [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches in Ireland wanted women's influence to remain domestic in nature.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Women were closely associated with their husbands for legal and political purposes and it was argued that husband's votes were sufficient to allow a woman's political expression.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

[[Irish nationalism]] also played a role in anti-suffrage movements.{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=14}} Because of the nationalistic movements going on in Ireland, both men and women nationalists opposed giving women the vote because they were prioritizing [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]].{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=14}} A nationalist paper, ''[[Bean na hÉireann]],'' which was published by the [[Inghinidhe na hÉireann|Inghinidhe na hÉirann]] (Daughters of Ireland), took a very anti-suffrage stance.{{Sfn|Crozier-De Rosa|2014|p=17-18}}

==United States==
While men were involved in the anti-suffrage movement in the [[United States]], most anti-suffrage groups were led and supported by women.{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=36}} While these groups openly stated that they wanted [[politics]] to be left to men, it was more often women addressing political bodies with anti-suffrage arguments.{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=36}} During the fight to pass the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|nineteenth amendment]], women increasingly took on a leading role in the anti-suffrage movement.{{Sfn|Dodd|2013|p=713}}

[[Helen Kendrick Johnson|Helen Kendrick Johnson's]] ''Woman and the Republic'' (1897) was a lauded anti-suffrage book that described the reasons for opposing women's right to vote.{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=36}} Other books, such as [[Molly Elliot Seawell|Molly Elliot Seawell's]] ''The Ladies' Battle'' (1911), [[Ida Tarbell|Ida Tarbell's]] ''The Business of Being a Woman'' (1912), [[Grace Duffield Goodwin|Grace Duffield Goodwin's]] ''Anti-Suffrage: Ten Good Reasons'' (1915) and [[Annie Riley Hale|Annie Riley Hale's]] ''The Eden Sphinx'' (1916) were similarly well-received by the media and used as a "coherent rationale for opposing women's enfranchisement."{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=36}}

Anti-suffrage [[drama]]s were also published between the mid 1800s and up to the 1920s.{{Sfn|Dassori|2005|p=302}} The first playwright to create anti-suffrage plays was [[William Bentley Fowle]], who wrote the one-act play for amateurs, ''Women's Rights'', published in 1856.{{Sfn|Dassori|2005|p=302}} Later plays were adapted for the professional stage, such as ''The Rights of Man'' (1857) by Oliver S. Leland and ''Election Day'' (1880) by [[Frank Dumont]].{{Sfn|Dassori|2005|p=302}} [[Nellie Locke]] published an anti-suffrage drama in 1896, called ''A Victim of Women's Rights''.{{Sfn|Dassori|2005|p=306}} Many anti-suffrage dramas were overtly political and incorporated the use of [[farce]] to paint suffragists as "self-absorbed" and "mannish in dress and manner."{{Sfn|Dassori|2005|p=305}} They also criticized the idea of the [[New Woman]] in general and advocated for women and men to occupy separate spheres of influence.{{Sfn|Dassori|2005|p=308}}{{Sfn|Dassori|2005|p=314-315}}

''The Remonstrance'', a journal published by the [[Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women]] (MAOFESW) between 1890 and 1920 was used to promote anti-suffrage ideas and also to react to and refute the claims of suffragists.{{Sfn|Burt|1998|p=71}}[[Image:Anti-suffragist.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon in ''[[Harper's]]'' lampoons the anti-suffrage movement (1907).]]

=== Early backing for the anti-suffrage movement ===
The anti-suffrage movement began in the United States after the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts State legislature]] introduced a proposal to promote female voting rights.{{Sfn|Aslanian|2013|p=2}} Two hundred women opposed this initiative as they did not want women to gain full citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jabolonsky, “Female Opposition: The Anti Suffrage Campaign” as featured in Votes for Women: The Struggle for Suffrage Revisited, ed. Jean Baker (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Though nothing became of this proposal, its introduction mobilized the suffrage movement on both sides.

In 1871, a petition to the [[United States Congress]] was published by nineteen women in [[Godey's Lady's Book|Godey's Lady's Book and Magazine]] in opposition to votes for women, the first instance of the mobilization from anti-suffrage women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritter|first=Gretchen|date=1998-06-01|year=|title=Splintered Sisterhood: Gender and Class in the Campaign against Woman Suffrage by Susan E.

Women turned out at the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitutional Convention]] in 1894 to protest women's suffrage.{{Sfn|Goodier|2013|p=15-16}}

=== Emergence of anti-suffrage organizations ===
In 1895, the [[Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women]] (MAOFESW) was created and is noted to be the first effort of the anti-suffragists to institutionalize their cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Anne M.|year=1991|title=A History of the Anti-suffrage Movement in the United States from 1895 to 1920: Women against Equality|url=|journal=Lewiston: Edwin Mellen Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Des Moines, Iowa]], 35 women formed the Iowa Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20052966/|title=Foes of Suffrage Organize|last=|first=|date=23 February 1898|work=Daily News-Democrat|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[California]], [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Oregon]], [[South Dakota]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] all formed groups by 1900.{{Sfn|Maddux|2004|p=287}} [[Ohio]] formed an anti suffrage group, the Ohio Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/05/09/100534217.pdf|title=Ohio's Silent Womanhood|last=|first=|date=9 May 1912|work=New York Times|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage]] was founded in 1897, and by 1908 it had over 90 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/rbcmil.scrp5011203 ''New York State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage Thirteenth Annual Report''], 1908&lt;/ref&gt; It was active in producing pamphlets and publications explaining their views of women's suffrage, until the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was passed in 1920. A [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]] branch was founded in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/rbcmil.scrp5011202 ''Against Suffrage''], newspaper clipping, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; The [[suffragists]] in New York often extended invitations to open discussion with the anti-suffragists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/rbcmil.scrp6005403 ''Mrs. Mackay's Campaign''], newspaper clipping, 25 January 1910&lt;/ref&gt; The New York association had its own magazine, ''The Anti-Suffragist'', published by Mrs. William Winslow Crannell from July 1908 to April 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Anti-Suffragist|title=The Anti-Suffragist {{!}} American periodical|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage]] (NAOWS) was the first national organization of women who challenged the fight for women's suffrage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Righting Feminism: Conservative Women and American Politics|last=Schreiber|first=Ronnee|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=19|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several state associations assembled for an anti-suffrage convention in New York City and formed the NAOWS.{{Sfn|Aslanian|2013|p=2}} The association gained significant momentum between 1912 and 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Susan E.|date=1985-04-01|title=Ladies Against Women: Mobilization Dilemmas of Antifeminist Movements|url=http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/4/348|journal=Social Problems|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=348–362|doi=10.2307/800757|issn=0037-7791}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was operational in twenty-five states.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Nielsen, Un-American Womanhood: Antiradicalism, Antifeminism, and the First Red Scare, (2001), Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; The NAOWS was said to have as many as 350,000 members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the start, the organization was run by [[Josephine Jewell Dodge|Josephine Dodge]] and Minnie Bronson.{{Sfn|Maddux|2004|p=284}} [[Alice Hay Wadsworth]], wife of [[James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr.]], assumed leadership of the association when it moved its headquarters from New York to Washington D.C. in 1917.{{Sfn|Maddux|2004|p=284}} NAOWS produced ''The Woman's Protest'', a newsletter that helped defeat close to forty woman suffrage referenda.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Everett P. Wheeler]], a lawyer from New York, created the [[Man-Suffrage Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage]] in 1913.{{Sfn|Goodier|Pastorello|p=110|2017}} This organization was made up of powerful and affluent men and started out with around 600 members opposed to women's suffrage.{{Sfn|Goodier|Pastorello|p=110|2017}}

=== Reasons for suffrage opposition ===
There were several concerns that drove the anti-suffrage argument. Anti-suffragists felt that giving women the right to vote would threaten the family institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03612759.1998.10528202|title=Woman Suffrage and the Origins of Liberal Feminism in the United States, 1820-1920|last=Marilley|first=Suzanne M.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=4|doi=10.1080/03612759.1998.10528202|quote=|via=Taylor and Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illinois]] anti-suffragist, [[Caroline Corbin]] felt that women's highest duties were motherhood and its responsibilities.{{Sfn|Dodd|2013|p=722}} Some saw women's suffrage as in opposition to God's will.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ideas of the woman suffrage movement, 1890-1920.|last=Kraditor|first=Aileen|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=15|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antis such as [[Catharine Beecher]] and [[Sarah Josepha Hale|Sara Josepha Hale]] both shared a religiously based criticism of suffrage and believed women should be only involved with ''[[Kinder, Küche, Kirche]]'' (children, kitchen and church).{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=49}} Some anti-suffragists didn't want the vote because they felt it violated traditional [[Gender role|gender norms]].{{Sfn|Dodd|2013|p=719}} Many anti-suffragists felt that if women gained the vote there would be an end to "true womanhood."{{Sfn|Dodd|2013|p=723}}

There were also those who thought that women could not handle the responsibility of voting because they lacked knowledge of that beyond the domestic sphere and they feared government would be weakened by introducing this ill-informed electorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=S. E.|date=1986-12-01|title=In Defense of Separate Spheres: Class and Status Politics in the Antisuffrage Movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/65.2.327|journal=Social Forces|volume=65|issue=2|pages=327–351|doi=10.1093/sf/65.2.327|issn=0037-7732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-suffragists did not see voting as a "right," but as a "duty" and that women already had their own unique responsibilities and duties in the [[Private sphere|domestic sphere]].{{Sfn|Maddux|2004|p=288}} Also, since Antis believed that governments had authority due to "force," women wouldn't be able to "enforce the laws they may enact."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20164036/|title=Mrs. George to Address Anti-Suffragists Here|last=|first=|date=11 October 1914|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-suffragists, such as [[Josephine Jewell Dodge|Josephine Dodge]], argued that giving women the right to vote would overburden them and undermine their privileged status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They saw participation in the private sphere as essential to a woman's role and thought that giving them public duties would prevent them from fulfilling their primary responsibilities in the home. Anti-suffragists claimed that they represented the "silent majority" of America who did not want to enter the public sphere by gaining the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Camhi, J. J. (2007). Women Against Women: American Antisuffragism, 1880–1920. ''Understanding Inequality: The Intersection of Race/Ethnicity, Class, and Gender'', 225-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Being against women's suffrage didn't mean, however, that all Antis were against civic pursuits.{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=40}} [[Jeanette L. Gilder]], a journalist, wrote "Give women everything she wants, but not the ballot. Open every field of learning, every avenue of industry to her, but keep her out of politics."{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=40-41}} Dodge encouraged women to become involved in "charitable, philanthropic and educational activities."{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=40}} It was also cited that women had made reforms such as raising the [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]] without the vote and that gaining this right was therefore unnecessary and could even be harmful to further reform movements.{{Sfn|Goodier|2013|p=49}} The thought was that women were able to influence the government because they were seen as politically neutral and [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] and giving them the right to vote would strip them of this unique position.&lt;ref&gt;Thurner, M. (1993). "Better citizens without the ballot": American antisuffrage women and their rationale during the Progressive era. Journal of Women's History, 5(1), 33-60.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, because voting is "only a small part of government," they believed there was no need to vote in order to participate in politics.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This particular line of reasoning, that women should stay out of politics, kept the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]] (GFWC) from officially endorsing suffrage until 1914.{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=41}}

Anti-suffragism was not limited to conservative elements. The [[anarchist]] [[Emma Goldman]] opposed suffragism on the grounds that women were more inclined toward legal enforcement of morality (as in the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]]), that it was a diversion from more important struggles, and that suffrage would ultimately not make a difference. She also said that activists ought to advocate [[revolution]] rather than seek greater privileges within an inherently unjust system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emma Goldman]].

''Anarchism and Other Essays'', 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-suffragists saw women's efforts to gain the vote to be all surface dressing with a lack of serious intent to change the world for the better.{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=42}} Other Antis believed that social reform was better accomplished through [[trade union]]s and non-partisan groups.{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=42}} Progressives criticized suffrage in the [[Utah Territory]] as a cynical [[Mormon]] ploy, resulting in the passage of the [[Edmunds-Tucker Act]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The anti-suffrage movement began to change in its position against suffrage in 1917, expanding their scope to include anti-[[Political radicalism|radical]] rhetoric.{{Sfn|Maddux|2004|p=285}} The anti-suffrage movement focused less on the issue of suffrage and began to spread fear of radical ideas and to use "conspiratorial paranoia."{{Sfn|Maddux|2004|p=291}} Suffragists were accused of subversion of the government and [[treason]].{{Sfn|Maddux|2004|p=292-293}} They were also accused of being [[Socialism|socialists]], "[[Bolsheviks]]" or "unpatriotic German sympathizers."{{Sfn|Maddux|2004|p=292-293}} The [[Texas]] branch of the NAOWS accused women's suffrage groups of being linked to "socialism, [[anarchy]] and [[Mormonism]]."&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/vbtvw|title=Texas Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage|last=Cottrell|first=Debbie Mauldin|date=15 June 2010|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations of being associated with unpopular radical movements was named after the second president of NAOWS, Alice Wadsworth, and called "Wadsworthy" attacks.{{Sfn|Maddux|2004|p=293}} In addition to associating suffrage with radicalism, the antis also felt that they were [[Oppression|oppressed]] and had lost much perceived political power by 1917.{{Sfn|Maddux|2004|p=293}}

Once the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|nineteenth amendment]] was passed, some women who opposed suffrage exercised this right.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodier|first=Susan|date=2007|title=The Other Woman's Movement: Anti-suffrage Activism in New York State, 1865-1932|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/de3a23f495ced83fc68f14ef4ea719a8/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y|journal=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|volume=|pages=|subscription=yes|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Goodier|2013|p=145}} They took the energy they were investing in the anti-suffrage movement and turned it towards supporting the platform of the Republican party.{{Sfn|Goodier|2013|p=147}}{{Sfn|Goodier|2013|p=148}} Former members of anti-suffrage groups in New York became involved in the [[Women's National Republican Club]].{{Sfn|Goodier|2013|p=151}} In this way, they left the private sphere and entered the public sphere, one of the things that they were resisting in their anti-suffrage efforts. Former anti-suffragist, [[Ida Tarbell]], pointed out that it would take some time for women to get comfortable with voting.{{Sfn|Goodier|2013|p=145-146}} Some women didn't vote or get involved in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_wa5BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=How%20Did%20Women%20Antifeminists%20Shape%20and%20Limit%20the%20Social%20Reform%20Movements%20of%20the%201920s&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q=anti-suffrage&amp;f=false|title=Women, Politics and Change|last=Andersen|first=Kristi|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|year=1990|isbn=9781610445344|editor-last=Tilly|editor-first=Louise A.|location=|pages=190–191|language=en|chapter=Women and Citizenship in the 1920s|editor-last2=Gurin|editor-first2=Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like [[Annie Nathan Meyer]] advocated for all anti-suffrage women to not vote in order to allow the country to suffer from what she saw as a terrible decision to allow women to vote.{{Sfn|Goodier|2013|p=144}}

The passage of the Nineteenth Amendment also kickstarted a coalition of anti-suffragists who organized themselves into a political anti-feminist movement in order to "oppose expansion of social welfare programs, women's peace efforts, and to foster a political culture hostile to progressive female activists. This coalition effectively blended anti-feminism and anti-radicalism by embracing and utilizing the hysteria of the post-World War I Red Scare."&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Kim.

== Criticism ==
[[File:Anti_Satire_by_Alice_Duer_Miller.jpg|thumb|[[Alice Duer Miller|Alice Duer Miller's]] satire of Anti-Suffrage arguments from ''The Daily Telegram'' in 1916.]]
There was contemporary criticism of the anti-suffrage movement in the United States. One criticism was that anti-suffragists did not present a consistent argument against suffrage.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20229597/|title=Agitation Against Woman's Suffrage|last=|first=|date=4 February 1900|work=Washington Times|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other arguments were seen as inconsistent, such as Antis claiming that voting meant women must hold office, when members of anti-suffrage groups were already holding offices such as being on the [[Board of education|school board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20231008/|title=Women and Office Holding|last=|first=|date=28 January 1903|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics, such as [[Alice Stone Blackwell]], pointed out that the anti-suffrage groups exaggerated certain claims, such as membership numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20230024/|title=Clipping from - Newspapers.com|last=Miss Blackwell's Statistics|first=|date=|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also argued that there were no new arguments presented over time.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Anti-suffrage groups were also criticized for being "inconsistent" in that they wanted women out of the public sphere, yet they gathered together into public lobbying groups against suffrage.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|The Valley Independent]]'' wrote in 1915 that any organization that wanted to oppose women's suffrage and which was made up of women "leaves a bad taste in our mouth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20236296/|title=Their Privilege|last=|first=|date=2 February 1915|work=The Valley Independent|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics were "almost contemptuous," such as [[Anna Howard Shaw]], who said, "You'd think they would have loyalty enough to their sex not to make us all out a set of fools."{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=33-34}} Shaw believed that Antis were "puppets of more power male forces."{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=33-34}} [[Florence Kelley]] called anti-suffragists "lazy, comfortable, sheltered creatures, caring nothing for the miseries of the poor."{{Sfn|Thurner|1993|p=38}}

T. (ed.)|title=Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics: New Research|year=2009|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|isbn=978-1-60456-907-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three areas are closely interrelated.  AMO theory includes [[classical physics|classical]], [[Semiclassical physics|semi-classical]] and [[quantum physics|quantum]] treatments.  Typically, the theory and applications of [[Emission spectrum|emission]], [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[scattering]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (light) from [[Excited state|excited]] [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s, analysis of spectroscopy, generation of [[laser]]s and [[maser]]s, and the optical properties of matter in general, fall into these categories.

== Atomic and molecular physics ==
{{main article|Atomic physics|Molecular physics}}
'''Atomic physics''' is the subfield of AMO that studies atoms as an isolated system of [[electron]]s and an [[atomic nuclei|atomic nucleus]], while '''molecular physics''' is the study of the physical properties of [[molecule]]s. The term ''atomic physics'' is often associated with [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear bomb]]s, due to the [[synonym]]ous use of ''atomic'' and ''nuclear'' in [[standard English]]. However, physicists distinguish between atomic physics — which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons — and [[nuclear physics]], which considers [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] alone. The important experimental techniques are the various types of [[spectroscopy]]. Molecular physics, while closely related to [[atomic physics]], also overlaps greatly with [[theoretical chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]] and [[chemical physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=|page=803|title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics|author=C.B. Parker|year=1994|edition=2nd|publisher=McGraw Hill |isbn=978-0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both subfields are primarily concerned with [[electronic structure]] and the dynamical processes by which these arrangements change. Generally this work involves using quantum mechanics. For molecular physics, this approach is known as [[quantum chemistry]]. One important aspect of molecular physics is that the essential [[atomic orbital]] theory in the field of atomic physics expands to the [[molecular orbital]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapter 9|page=|title=Chemistry, Matter, and the Universe|author1=R. E. Dickerson |author2=I. Geis |year=1976|edition=|publisher=W.A. Benjamin Inc. (USA)|isbn=978-0-19-855148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular physics is concerned with atomic processes in molecules, but it is additionally concerned with effects due to the [[molecular structure]]. Additionally to the electronic excitation states which are known from atoms, molecules are able to rotate and to vibrate. These rotations and vibrations are quantized; there are discrete [[energy level]]s. The smallest energy differences exist between different rotational states, therefore pure rotational [[Spectrum|spectra]] are in the far [[infrared]] region (about 30 - 150 [[µm]] [[wavelength]]) of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. [[Vibrational spectroscopy of linear molecules|Vibrational spectra]] are in the near infrared (about 1 - 5&amp;nbsp;µm) and spectra resulting from electronic transitions are mostly in the visible and [[ultraviolet]] regions. From measuring rotational and vibrational spectra properties of molecules like the distance between the nuclei can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapters 12, 13, 17|page=|title=The Light Fantastic – Introduction to Classic and Quantum Optics|author=I.R. Kenyon|year=2008|edition=|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-856646-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many scientific fields, strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of ''atomic, molecular, and optical physics''. Physics research groups are usually so classified.

There is no strong distinction, however, between optical physics, applied optics, and optical engineering, since the devices of optical engineering and the applications of applied optics are necessary for basic research in optical physics, and that research leads to the development of new devices and applications. Often the same people are involved in both the basic research and the applied technology development, for example the experimental demonstration of [[electromagnetically induced transparency]] by [[S. E. Harris]] and of [[slow light]] by Harris and [[Lene Vestergaard Hau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sciencewatch.com/nobel/predictions/slow-light |title=Slow Light |website=Science Watch |accessdate=Jan 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapters 9,10|page=|title=Light and Matter: Electromagnetism, Optics, Spectroscopy and Lasers|author=Y.B.

Researchers in optical physics use and develop light sources that span the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] from [[microwave]]s to [[X-ray]]s. The field includes the generation and detection of light, linear and [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear]] optical processes, and [[spectroscopy]]. [[Laser]]s and [[laser spectroscopy]] have transformed optical science.  Major study in optical physics is also devoted to [[quantum optics]] and [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]], and to [[femtosecond]] optics.&lt;ref name="nap"&gt;{{cite book|title=Atomic, molecular, and optical physics|year=1986|publisher=National Academy Press|isbn=978-0-309-03575-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In optical physics, support is also provided in areas such as the nonlinear response of isolated atoms to intense, ultra-short electromagnetic fields, the atom-cavity interaction at high fields, and quantum properties of the electromagnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=|pages=933–934|title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics|author=C.B.

Other important areas of research include the development of novel optical techniques for nano-optical measurements, [[diffractive optics]], [[Interferometry|low-coherence interferometry]], [[optical coherence tomography]], and [[Near-field scanning optical microscope|near-field microscopy]].  Research in optical physics places an emphasis on ultrafast optical science and technology.

==History==
{{Main article|Atomic theory|Basics of quantum mechanics}}
[[File:Bohr-atom-PAR.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Bohr model]] of the [[Hydrogen atom]]]]
One of the earliest steps towards ''atomic physics'' was the recognition that matter was composed of ''atoms'', in modern terms the basic unit of a [[chemical element]]. This theory was developed by [[John Dalton]] in the 18th century. At this stage, it wasn't clear what atoms were - although they could be described and classified by their observable properties in bulk; summarized by the developing [[periodic table]], by [[John Alexander Reina Newlands|John Newlands]] and [[Dmitri Mendeleyev]] around the mid to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="R.E. Dickerson, I. Geis 1976"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapters 7, 8|page=|title=Chemistry, Matter, and the Universe|author1=R. E. Dickerson |author2=I. Geis |year=1976|edition=|publisher=W.A. Benjamin Inc. (USA)|isbn=978-0-19-855148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the connection between atomic physics ''and'' optical physics became apparent, by the discovery of [[spectral line]]s and attempts to describe the phenomenon - notably by [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]], [[Fresnel]], and others in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=|pages=4–11|title=Light and Matter: Electromagnetism, Optics, Spectroscopy and Lasers|author=Y.B. Band|year=2010|edition=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-89931-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From that time to the 1920s, physicists were seeking to explain [[atomic spectra]] and [[blackbody radiation]]. One attempt to explain hydrogen spectral lines was the [[Bohr atom model]].&lt;ref name="R.E. Dickerson, I. Geis 1976"/&gt;

Experiments including [[electromagnetic radiation]] and matter - such as the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Compton effect]], and spectra of sunlight the due to the unknown element of [[Helium]], the limitation of the Bohr model to Hydrogen, and numerous other reasons, lead to an entirely new mathematical model of matter and light: [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=chapter 34|page=|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers - with Modern Physics|author1=P. A. Tipler |author2=G. Mosca |year=2008|edition=|publisher=Freeman|isbn=978-0-7167-8964-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical oscillator model of matter===
Early models to explain the origin of the [[refractive index|index of refraction]] treated an [[electron]] in an atomic system classically according to the model of [[Paul Drude]] and [[Hendrik Lorentz]]. The theory was developed to attempt to provide an origin for the wavelength-dependent refractive index ''n'' of a material. In this model, incident [[electromagnetic waves]] forced an electron bound to an atom to [[Oscillation|oscillate]]. The [[amplitude]] of the oscillation would then have a relationship to the [[frequency]] of the incident electromagnetic wave and the [[Resonance|resonant]] frequencies of the oscillator. The [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of these emitted waves from many oscillators would then lead to a wave which moved more slowly.

===Early quantum model of matter and light===
[[Max Planck]] derived a formula to describe the [[electromagnetic field]] inside a box when in [[thermal equilibrium]] in 1900.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|8–9}}
His model consisted of a superposition of [[standing waves]]. In one dimension, the box has length ''L'', and only sinusoidal waves of [[wavenumber]]
:&lt;math&gt; k = \frac{n\pi}{L} &lt;/math&gt;
can occur in the box, where ''n'' is a positive [[integer]] (mathematically denoted by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n \in \mathbb{N}_1&lt;/math&gt;). The equation describing these standing waves is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;E=E_0 \sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L}x\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the magnitude of the [[electric field]] amplitude, and ''E'' is the magnitude of the electric field at position ''x''. From this basic, [[Planck's law]] was derived.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|4–8,51–52}}
&lt;!-- It's in the energy density form in the book --&gt;

In 1911, [[Ernest Rutherford]] concluded, based on alpha particle scattering, that an atom has a central pointlike proton. He also thought that an electron would be still attracted to the proton by Coulomb's law, which he had verified still held at small scales. As a result, he believed that electrons revolved around the proton. [[Niels Bohr]], in 1913, combined the Rutherford model of the atom with the quantisation ideas of Planck. Only specific and well-defined orbits of the electron could exist, which also do not radiate light. In jumping orbit the electron would emit or absorb light corresponding to the difference in energy of the orbits. His prediction of the energy levels was then consistent with observation.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|9–10}}

These results, based on a ''discrete'' set of specific standing waves, were inconsistent with the ''continuous'' classical oscillator model.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|8}}

Work by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905 on the [[photoelectric effect]] led to the association of a light wave of frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; with a photon of energy &lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt;. In 1917 Einstein created an extension to Bohrs model by the introduction of the three processes of [[stimulated emission]], [[spontaneous emission]] and [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)]].&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|11}}

==Modern treatments==
The largest steps towards the modern treatment was the formulation of quantum mechanics with the [[matrix mechanics]] approach by [[Werner Heisenberg]] and the discovery of the [[Schrödinger equation]] by [[Erwin Schrödinger]].&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|12}}

There are a variety of semi-classical treatments within AMO. Which aspects of the problem are treated quantum mechanically and which are treated classically is dependent on the specific problem at hand. The semi-classical approach is ubiquitous in computational work within AMO, largely due to the large decrease in computational cost and complexity associated with it.

For matter under the action of a laser, a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the atomic or molecular system is combined with the system being under the action of a classical electromagnetic field.&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|14}} Since the field is treated classically it can not deal with [[spontaneous emission]].&lt;ref name=Haken /&gt;{{rp|16}} This semi-classical treatment is valid for most systems,&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|997}} particular those under the action of high intensity laser fields.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|724}} The distinction between optical physics and quantum optics is the use of semi-classical and fully quantum treatments respectively.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|997}}

Within collision dynamics and using the semi-classical treatment, the internal degrees of freedom may be treated quantum mechanically, whilst the relative motion of the quantum systems under consideration are treated classically.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|556}} When considering medium to high speed collisions, the nuclei can be treated classically while the electron is treated quantum mechanically. In low speed collisions the approximation fails.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|754}}&lt;!-- Expand from here, weaknesses of the particular approximation are also described --&gt;

Classical Monte-Carlo methods for the dynamics of electrons can be described as semi-classical in that the initial conditions are calculated using a fully quantum treatment, but all further treatment is classical.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;{{rp|871}}

==Isolated atoms and molecules==
Atomic, Molecular and Optical physics frequently considers atoms and molecules in isolation&lt;!-- not always, there are some multi-particle groups --&gt;. Atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons, whilst molecular models are typically concerned with molecular hydrogen and its [[molecular hydrogen ion]]. It is concerned with processes such as [[ionization]], [[above threshold ionization]] and [[excited state|excitation]] by photons or collisions with atomic particles.

While modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic, if one considers molecules in a [[gas]] or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] then the time-scales for molecule-molecule interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic and molecular processes that we are concerned with. This means that the individual molecules can be treated as if each were in isolation for the vast majority of the time.  By this consideration atomic and molecular physics provides the underlying theory in [[plasma (physics)|plasma physics]] and [[atmospheric physics]] even though both deal with huge numbers of molecules.

==Electronic configuration==
Electrons form notional [[Electron shell|shells]] around the nucleus. These are naturally in a [[ground state]] but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light ([[photon]]s), magnetic fields, or interaction with a colliding particle (typically other electrons).

Electrons that populate a shell are said to be in a [[bound state]].  The energy necessary to remove an electron from its shell (taking it to infinity) is called the [[binding energy]].  Any quantity of energy absorbed by the electron in excess of this amount is converted to [[kinetic energy]] according to the [[conservation of energy]].  The atom is said to have undergone the process of [[ionization]].

In the event that the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy, it may transition to an [[excited state]] or to a [[Virtual state (physics)|virtual state]]. After a statistically sufficient quantity of time, an electron in an excited state will undergo a transition to a lower state via [[spontaneous emission]]. The change in energy between the two energy levels must be accounted for (conservation of energy). In a neutral atom, the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy.  However, if the lower state is in an inner shell, a phenomenon known as the [[Auger effect]] may take place where the energy is transferred to another bound electrons causing it to go into the continuum. This allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon.

There are strict [[selection rules]] as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light—however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes.

'''Authoritarianism''' is a term [[political scientist]]s use for a worldview that values [[orderliness]] and [[authority]], and distrusts outsiders and [[social change]]. As a form of [[government]], it is characterized by strong central power and limited [[political freedom]]s. Individual economic or personal freedoms are subordinate to the state and there is no constitutional [[accountability]] under an authoritarian regime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11431892/after-trump-how-authoritarian-voters-will-change-american-politics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite book|title=Government and Politics - Volume I|last=Sekiguchi|first=Masashi|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=9781905839698|page=92|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gkm5DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 December 2016|date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan Linz]]'s influential 1964 description of authoritarianism&lt;ref&gt;Richard Shorten, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ffbV8ZpQ3MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present]'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), p. 256 (note 67).&lt;/ref&gt; characterized authoritarian [[political system]]s by four qualities:
# Limited [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], that is such regimes place constraints on political institutions and groups like [[legislature]]s, [[Political party|political parties]] and [[interest group]]s;
# A basis for [[Political legitimacy|legitimacy]] based on emotion, especially the identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat "easily recognizable societal problems" such as [[underdevelopment]] or [[insurgency]]; 
# Minimal [[social mobilization]] most often caused by constraints on the public such as suppression of political opponents and anti-regime activity;
# Informally defined executive power with often vague and shifting powers.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Casper, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZVDjmr18f4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fragile Democracies: The Legacies of Authoritarian Rule], pp. 40–50 (citing Linz 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritarian government and states==
===Types===
Linz distinguished new forms of authoritarianism from personalistic dictatorships and totalitarian states, taking [[Francoist Spain]] as an example. Unlike personalistic dictatorships, new forms of authoritarianism have institutionalized representation of a variety of actors (in Spain's case, including the military, the [[Catholic Church]], [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]], [[technocrat]]s and others). Unlike totalitarian states, the regime relies on passive mass acceptance rather than popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Landman, ''Studying Human Rights'' (Routledge, 2003), p. 71 (citing Linz 1964 and others).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars also mention the emergence of a different type of regime - the hybrid regime - in the post-Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mufti |first1=Mariam |title=What Do We Know about Hybrid Regimes after Two Decades of Scholarship? |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=112 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1400 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1400|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several subtypes of authoritarian regimes have been identified by Linz and others.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"&gt;Mark J. Gasiorowski, [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=uxO2QHFzlZsC |page=105 }} The Political Regimes Project], in ''On Measuring Democracy: Its Consequences and Concomitants'' (ed. Alex Inketes), 2006, pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Linz identified the two most basic subtypes as traditional authoritarian regimes and bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes:
* Traditional authoritarian regimes are those "in which the ruling authority (generally a single person)" is maintained in power "through a combination of appeals to traditional legitimacy, [[Clientelism|patron-client ties]] and repression, which is carried out by an apparatus bound to the ruling authority through personal loyalties". An example is [[Ethiopia]] under [[Haile Selassie&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; 
* Bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes are those "governed by a [[military junta|coalition of military officers]] and technocrats who act pragmatically (rather than ideologically) within the limits of their bureaucratic mentality."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; [[Mark J. Gasiorowski]] suggests that it is best to distinguish "simple military authoritarian regimes" from "bureaucratic authoritarian regimes" in which "a powerful group of technocrats uses the state apparatus to try to rationalize and develop the economy" such as [[South Korea]] under [[Park Chung-hee]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Linz also has identified three other subtypes of authoritarian regime: [[Corporatism|corporatist]] or organic-statistic, racial and ethnic "democracy" and post-totalitarian.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Corporatist authoritarian regimes "are those in which corporatism institutions are used extensively by the state to coopt and demobilize powerful interest groups". This type has been studied most extensively in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Racial and ethnic "democracies" are those in which "certain racial or ethnic groups enjoy full democratic rights while others are largely or entirely denied those rights", such as in [[South Africa under apartheid]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Post-totalitarian authoritarian regimes are those in which totalitarian institutions (such as the party, [[secret police]] and state-controlled mass media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heinrich |first1=Andreas |last2=Pleines |first2=Heiko |title=The Meaning of 'Limited Pluralism' in Media Reporting under Authoritarian Rule |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=103 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1238 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1238|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) remain, but where "ideological orthodoxy has declined in favor of routinization, repression has declined, the state's top leadership is less personalized and more secure, and the level of mass mobilization has declined substantially".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt; Examples include the [[Russian Federation]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Eastern bloc]] states in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Authoritarian regimes are also sometimes subcategorized by whether they are personalistic or [[Populism|populist]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes are characterized by arbitrary rule and [[authority]] exercised "mainly through patronage networks and coercion rather than through institutions and formal rules".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes have been seen in post-colonial Africa. By contrast, populist authoritarian regimes "are mobilizational regimes in which a strong, charismatic, manipulative leader rules through a coalition involving key lower-class groups".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Examples include [[Argentina]] under [[Juan Perón|Perón]],&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Egypt under Nasser&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; and [[Venezuela]]  under [[Hugo Chávez|Chávez]] and [[Nicolás Maduro|Maduro]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Onis, [http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/juan-de-onis/after-chavez-authoritarianism-still-threatens-latin-america "After Chavez, Authoritarianism Still Threatens Latin America"], ''World Affairs'' (May 15, 2013): "the followers of the late President Hugo Chávez continue to apply the playbook of authoritarian populism throughout Latin America in their pursuit of more power...one of the Mercosur partners are challenging the basic political practices of authoritarian populism implanted in Venezuela."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weyland, [http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/latin-america%E2%80%99s-authoritarian-drift-threat-populist-left "Latin America's Authoritarian Drift: The Threat from the Populist Left"], ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'', Vol. 23, Issue 3 (July 2013), pp. 18–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism is characterized by highly concentrated and [[Centralized government|centralized]] power maintained by [[political repression]] and the exclusion of potential challengers. It uses [[Political party|political parties]] and mass organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime.&lt;ref name="Vestal"&gt;Theodore M. Vesta, ''[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=XWXtXOl56KkC&amp;c |page=17 }} Ethiopia: A Post-Cold War African State]''. Greenwood, 1999, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Przeworski]] has theorized that "authoritarian equilibrium rests mainly on lies, fear and economic prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Democracy and the Market: Political and Economic Reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfjv6snK0-EC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1991-07-26|isbn = 9780521423359|first = Adam|last = Przeworski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism also tends to embrace the informal and unregulated exercise of [[Power (politics)|political power]], a leadership that is "self-appointed and even if elected cannot be displaced by citizens' free choice among competitors", the arbitrary deprivation of [[civil liberties]] and little tolerance for meaningful [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

A range of [[social control]]s also attempt to stifle [[civil society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer Y. J.|last2=Hsu|first2=Carolyn L.|last3=Hasmath|first3=Reza|date=2016|title=NGO Strategies in an Authoritarian Context, and their Implications for Citizenship: The Case of the People's Republic of China|ssrn=2657187|journal=|location=|publisher=American Sociological Association Annual Meeting (Seattle), August 20–23.|volume=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while political stability is maintained by control over and support of the [[military|armed forces]], a bureaucracy staffed by the regime and creation of [[allegiance]] through various means of [[socialization]] and indoctrination.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarian political systems may be weakened through "inadequate performance to demands of the people".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Vestal writes that the tendency to respond to challenges to authoritarianism through tighter control instead of [[adaptation]] is a significant weakness and that this overly rigid approach fails to "adapt to changes or to accommodate growing demands on the part of the populace or even groups within the system".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Because the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the state is dependent on performance, authoritarian states that fail to adapt may collapse.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarianism is marked by "indefinite political tenure" of the ruler or [[ruling party]] (often in a [[one-party state]]) or other authority.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; The transition from an authoritarian system to a more [[Democracy|democratic]] form of government is referred to as [[democratization]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

===Authoritarianism and totalitarianism===
{{Revolution sidebar}}

[[Totalitarianism]] is an extreme version of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control. Building on the work of Yale political scientist Juan Linz, Paul C. Sondrol of the [[University of Colorado at Colorado Springs]] has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart:&lt;ref name="Sondrol"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sondrol |first1 = P. C. |title = Totalitarian and Authoritarian Dictators: A Comparison of Fidel Castro and Alfredo Stroessner |journal = Journal of Latin American Studies |volume = 23 |issue = 3 |page = 599 |year = 2009 |doi = 10.1017/S0022216X00015868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondrol argues that while both authoritarianism and totalitarianism are forms of [[autocracy]], they differ in "key [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]":
{{quote|(1) Unlike their bland and generally unpopular authoritarian brethren, totalitarian dictators develop a [[charisma]]tic "[[Cult of personality|mystique]]" and a mass-based, pseudo-democratic [[interdependence]] with their followers via the conscious manipulation of a prophetic image.
(2) [[wikt:concomitant|Concomitant]] role conceptions differentiate totalitarians from authoritarians. Authoritarians view themselves as individual beings largely content to control and often maintain the status quo. Totalitarian self-conceptions are largely [[Teleology|teleological]]. The [[tyrant]] is less a person than an indispensable function to guide and reshape the universe.

(3) Consequently, the utilisation of power for personal aggrandizement is more evident among authoritarians than totalitarians. Lacking the binding appeal of [[ideology]], authoritarians support their rule by a mixture of instilling fear and granting rewards to loyal collaborators, engendering a [[kleptocracy]].&lt;ref name="Sondrol"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Compared to totalitarianism, "the authoritarian state still maintains a certain distinction between state and society. It is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty. Totalitarianism, on the other hand, invades [[private life]] and asphyxiates it".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"&gt;Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinction is that "authoritarianism is not animated by utopian ideals in the way totalitarianism is. It does not attempt to change the world and human nature".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt; [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that "a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of ... industrial mass society" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt;

===Authoritarianism and democracy===
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Authoritarianism and democracy are not fundamentally opposed to one another, as it is possible for democracies to possess authoritarian elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frantz |first1=Erica |title=Authoritarian Politics: Trends and Debates |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1498 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1498|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[illiberal democracy]] (or [[procedural democracy]]) is distinguished from [[liberal democracy]] (or [[substantive democracy]]) in that illiberal democracies lack features such as the [[rule of law]], protections for minority groups and an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]].&lt;ref&gt;
* Thomas H. Henriksen, ''American Power after the Berlin Wall'' (Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 199: "experts emphasize that elections alone, without the full democratic panoply of an independent judiciary, free press, and viable political parties, constitute, in reality, illiberal democracies, which still menace their neighbors and destabilize their regions."
*  David P. Forsythe, ''Human Rights in International Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 231: "Illiberal democracies may have reasonably free and fair national elections based on broad suffrage, but they do not counteract the tyranny of the majority with effective protections for ethnic and religious minorities or various types of dissenters."
* Rod Hague &amp; Martin Harrop, ''Political Science: A Comparative Introduction'' (7th ed.: Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 259: "The gradual implementation of the rule of law and due process is an accomplishment of liberal politics, provide a basis for distinguishing liberal from illiberal democracies, and both from authoritarian regimes."
* Vladimir Popov, "Circumstances versus Policy Choices: Why Has the Economic Performance of the Soviet Successor States Been So Poor" in ''After the Collapse of Communism: Comparative Lessons of Transition'' (eds. [[Michael McFaul]] &amp; Kathryn Stoner-Weiss: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 20: "The least efficient institutions are in illiberal democracies combining poor rule of law with democracy ... Less democratic regimes with weak rule of law ... appear to do better than illiberal democracies in maintaining institutional capacity."&lt;/ref&gt;

A further distinction that liberal democracies have rarely made war with one another; research has extended the theory and finds that more democratic countries tend to have few wars (sometimes called [[militarized interstate dispute]]s) causing fewer battle deaths with one another and that democracies have far fewer [[civil war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Some commentators, such as [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], believed that low-income authoritarian regimes have certain technocratic "efficiency-enhancing advantages" over low-income democracies, helping authoritarian regimes generate development.&lt;ref name="Halperin"&gt;Morton H. Halperin, Joseph T. Siegle, &amp; Michael M. Weinstein, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JiNLH1I50PkC The Democracy Advantage: How Democracies Promote Prosperity and Peace]'' ([[Council on Foreign Relations]]/Psychology Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morton H. Halperin]], Joseph T. Siegle and Michael M. Weinstein (2005) counter this belief, arguing that the evidence has shown that there is no "authoritarian advantage" and that there is a "democratic advantage" instead.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin et al. argue that democracies "realize superior development performance" over authoritarianism. They point out that poor democracies are more likely to have steadier economic growth and less likely to experience economic and humanitarian catastrophes than authoritarian regimes; that civil liberties act as a curb on corruption and misuse of resources; and that democracies are more adaptable.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin point out that the vast majority of refugee crises and financial catastrophes occur in authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt;

Studies suggest that several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita, size of the public sector or income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Franco |first1 = Á. |last2 = Álvarez-Dardet |first2 = C. |last3 = Ruiz |first3 = M.

Research shows that the democratic nations have much less [[democide]] or murder by government. Those were also moderately developed nations before applying liberal democratic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R. J. Rummel |author-link=R. J.

The nations with the least amount of [[terrorism]] are the most and least democratic nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/11.04/05-terror.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Freedom squelches terrorist violence |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=2004-11-04 |accessdate=2012-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919050732/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/11.04/05-terror.html |archivedate=2015-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
===Systemic weakness and resilience===
[[Andrew J. Nathan]] notes that "regime theory holds that authoritarian systems are inherently fragile because of weak legitimacy, overreliance on coercion, overcentralization of decision making, and the predominance of personal power over institutional norms....Few authoritarian regimes—be they communist, fascist, corporatist, or personalist—have managed to conduct orderly, peaceful, timely, and stable successions".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"&gt;Andrew J. Nathan, [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/38546/summary "Authoritarian Resilience"], ''Journal of Democracy'', 14.1 (2003), pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception to this general trend is the endurance of the authoritarian rule of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which has been unusually resilient among authoritarian regimes.  Nathan posits that this can be attributed to four factors: (1) "the increasingly norm-bound nature of its succession politics"; (2) "the increase in meritocratic as opposed to factional considerations in the promotion of political elites"; (3) "the differentiation and functional specialization of institutions within the regime"; and (4) "the establishment of institutions for political participation and appeal that strengthen the CCP's legitimacy among the public at large".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"/&gt;

===Gender and authoritarianism===
According to a study by Brandt and Henry, there is a direct correlation between the rates of [[gender inequality]] and the levels of authoritarian ideas in the male and female populations. It was found that in countries with less gender equality where individualism was encouraged and men occupied the dominant societal roles, women were more likely to support traits such as obedience which would allow them to survive in an authoritarian environment and less likely to encourage ideas such as independence and imagination. In countries with higher levels of gender equality, men held less authoritarian views. It is theorized that this occurs due to the stigma attached to individuals who question the cultural norms set by the dominant individuals and establishments in an authoritarian society as a way to prevent the psychological stress caused by the active ostracizing of the stigmatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Brandt |first2=P. J. |last2=Henry |title=Gender Inequality and Gender Differences in Authoritarianism |year=2012 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=38 |issue=10 |pages=1301–15 |doi=10.1177/0146167212449871 |pmid=22733982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical trends==
===Anti-authoritarianism===
{{Main|Anti-authoritarianism}}
Both [[World War II]] (ending in 1945) and the later [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1991) resulted in the replacement of authoritarian regimes by either democratic regimes or regimes that were less authoritarian.

[[World War II]] saw the defeat of the [[Axis powers]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]]. All the Axis powers — [[Nazi Germany]], Fascist Italy and the [[Empire of Japan]] — had totalitarian or authoritarian governments, and two of the three were replaced by governments based on democratic constitutions. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] were an alliance of Democratic states and (later) the Communist [[Soviet Union]]. At least in Western Europe the initial post-war era embraced pluralism and freedom of expression in areas that had been under control of authoritarian regimes.  The memory of fascism and nazism was denigrated. The new [[Federal Republic of Germany]] banned its expression.  In reaction to the centralism of the Nazi state, for example, the new constitution of West Germany ([[Federal Republic of Germany]]) exercised "[[separation of powers]]" and  placed "[[Law enforcement in Germany|law enforcement]] firmly in the hands" of the sixteen ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'' or states of the republic, not with the federal German government (at least not at first).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/security/federal-police/federal-police-node.html The Federal Police].

Culturally there was also a strong sense of anti-authoritarianism based on [[anti-fascism]] in Western Europe. This was attributed to the active resistance from [[German-occupied Europe|occupation]] and to fears arising from the development of [[superpower]]s.&lt;ref name="swcjsb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sign Wars: The Culture Jammers Strike Back! |last=Cox |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=LedaTape Organisation |isbn=978-0-9807701-5-5 |page=108 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=zKo8DrmamAwC |page= }} |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-authoritarianism also became associated with [[countercultural]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] movements such as the [[Beat Generation]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/beatgeneration.html|title=Retired Site PBS Programs |website=pbs.org|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[hippies]] in the 1960s&lt;ref name="Stonepolitics"&gt;"The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom&amp;nbsp;...

In South America, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and Uruguay moved away from dictatorships to democracy between 1982 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The challenge of the past |journal=The Economist |date=22 October 1998 |url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/1998/10/22/the-challenge-of-the-past |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] in [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991]], the other authoritarian/totalitarian "half" of the Allied Powers of WWII collapsed. This led not so much to revolt against authority in general, but to the belief that authoritarian states (and state control of economies) were outdated.

Writing in 2018, U.S. political journalist David Frum stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The hopeful world of the very late 20th century—the world of [[NAFTA]] and an expanding [[NATO]]; of the World Wide Web 1.0 and liberal interventionism; of the global spread of democracy under leaders such as [[Václav Havel]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]—now looks battered and delusive."&lt;ref name="Frum-liberalism"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frum |first1=David |title=The Republican Party Needs to Embrace Liberalism |journal=Atlantic |date=November 2018 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/the-case-for-liberal-republicanism/570790/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In living plants, callus cells are those cells that cover a plant wound. In biological research and biotechnology callus formation is induced from plant tissue samples (explants) after surface sterilization and plating onto tissue culture medium [[in vitro]] (in a closed culture vessel such as a [[Petri dish]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/~sd21/tisscult/what.htm What is Plant Tissue Culture?]&lt;/ref&gt;    The culture medium is supplemented with [[Plant hormone|plant growth regulators]], such as [[auxin]]s, [[cytokinin]]s, and [[gibberellin]]s, to initiate callus formation or [[Somatic Embryogenesis|somatic embryogenesis]].  Callus initiation has been described for all major groups of land plants. [[Image:Callus1.jpg|thumb| ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'' parenchyma cells in culture]]

== Morphology ==
Specific [[auxin]] to [[cytokinin]] ratios in plant tissue culture medium give rise to an unorganized growing and dividing mass of callus cells. Callus cultures are often broadly classified as being either compact or friable. Friable calluses fall apart easily, and can be used to generate cell suspension cultures.  Callus can directly undergo direct [[organogenesis]] and/or [[embryogenesis]] where the cells will form an entirely new plant. This process is known as callus culture

== Callus cells deaths ==
Callus can brown and die during culture, but the causes for callus browning are not well understood.  In ''[[Jatropha curcas]]'' callus cells, small organized callus cells became disorganized and varied in size after browning occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Yang |author2=Guo, Xiulian |author3=Lu, Ran |author4=Niu, Bei |author5=Pasapula, Vijaya |author6=Hou, Pei |author7=Cai, Feng |author8=Xu, Ying |author9=Chen, Fang|title=Changes in morphology and biochemical indices in browning callus derived from Jatropha curcas hypocotyls|journal=Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture (PCTOC)|volume=98|issue=1|pages=11–17|doi=10.1007/s11240-009-9533-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Browning (chemical process)|Browning]] has also been associated with oxidation and [[Natural phenol|phenolic]] compounds in both explant tissues and explant secretions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dan|first=Yinghui |author2=Armstrong, Charles L. |author3=Dong, Jimmy |author4=Feng, Xiaorong |author5=Fry, Joyce E. |author6=Keithly, Greg E. |author7=Martinell, Brian J. |author8=Roberts, Gail A. |author9=Smith, Lori A. |author10=Tan, Lalaine J. |author11=Duncan, David R. |title=Lipoic acid—an unique plant transformation enhancer|journal=In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology - Plant|volume=45|issue=6|pages=630–638|doi=10.1007/s11627-009-9227-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rice, presumably, a condition which is favorable for scutellar callus induction induces necrosis too.&lt;ref name="pazuki"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pazuki |first=Arman |last2=Sohani |first2=Mehdi |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2013 |title= Phenotypic evaluation of scutellum-derived calluses in ‘Indica’ rice cultivars |url= http://aas.bf.uni-lj.si/september2013/08Pazuki.pdf |format=PDF |journal= Acta Agriculturae Slovenica |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=239–247 |doi=10.2478/acas-2013-0020 |accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Callus cells are not necessarily genetically homogeneous because a callus is often made from structural tissue, not individual cells.{{clarify|reason=why would cells derived from "structural tissue" be any less "genetically homogenous" than a population of cells derived from a single cell?|date=August 2016}} Nevertheless, callus cells are often considered similar enough for standard scientific analysis to be performed as if on a single subject. For example, an experiment may have half a callus undergo a treatment as the [[experimental group]], while the other half undergoes a similar but non-active treatment as the [[control group]].

Plant calluses derived from many different cell types can differentiate into a whole plant, a process called regeneration, through addition of plant hormones to the culture medium.  This ability is known as [[totipotency]].  Regeneration of a whole plant from a single cell allows [[transgenesis|transgenics]] researchers to obtain whole plants which have a copy of the transgene in every cell.  Regeneration of a whole plant that has some genetically transformed cells and some untransformed cells yields a [[chimera (plant)|chimera]].  In general, chimeras are not useful for genetic research or agricultural applications.

Genes can be inserted into callus cells using biolistic bombardment, also known as a [[gene gun]], or ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]''.  Cells that receive the gene of interest can then be recovered into whole plants using a combination of [[plant hormone]]s.  The whole plants that are recovered can be used to experimentally determine gene function(s), or to enhance crop plant traits for modern agriculture.

Callus is of particular use in [[micropropagation]] where it can be used to grow genetically identical copies of plants with desirable characteristics.

The '''Clore Social Leadership Programme (Clore Social)''' was established in 2008 to develop and strengthen leadership skills and capacity across the social sector. Clore Social was initiated by the [[Clore Duffield Foundation]] and inspired by its sister programme, the Clore Leadership Programme for the creative and cultural sectors. Its founding director was [[Mary Marsh|Dame Mary Marsh]].

Clore Social identifies, connects and develops leaders through its fully funded fellowship programme and works with people, partners and funders across all sectors to offer a holistic approach to developing leaders for social impact. So far 101 fellows have joined its network. It is run by a small staff team from its office in Kings Cross, London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27305">"'''Communication Theory as a Field'''" is a 1999 article by [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]], attempting to unify the academic field of [[communication theory]].{{sfn|Craig|1999}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008|pp=6}}

Craig argues that communication theorists can become unified in dialogue by charting what he calls the "dialogical dialectical tension", or the similarities and differences in their understanding of "communication" and demonstrating how those elements create tension within the field.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=124}}  Craig mapped these similarities and differences into seven suggested traditions of communication theory and showed how each of these traditions understand communication, as well as how each traditions understanding creates tension with the other traditions.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-149}}

The article has received multiple awards,&lt;ref name="international communication" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCA" /&gt; has become the foundation for many communication theory textbooks,{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}} and has been translated into several different languages.{{sfn|Craig|2009b}}&lt;ref name="vita" /&gt;

"Communication theory as a field" has created two main dialogues between Craig and other theorists. Myers argued that Craig misrepresented the theoretical assumptions of his theory, and that the theory itself does not distinguish between good and bad theories.{{sfn|Myers|2001}} Craig responded that Myers misunderstood not only the basic argument of the article, but also misrepresented his own case study.{{sfn|Craig|2001}} Russill proposed pragmatism as an eighth tradition of communication theory,{{sfn|Russill|2004}}{{sfn|Russill|2005}} Craig responded by expanding this idea and placing Russill's proposition in conversation with the other seven traditions.{{sfn|Craig|2007}}

==Recognition and awards==
"Communication Theory as a Field" has been recognized by multiple associations for its influence upon the field of communication.  These awards include the Best Article Award from the [[International Communication Association]]&lt;ref name="international communication"&gt;{{Cite web|title=International Communication Association Awards |publisher=[[International Communication Association]] |year=2003 |url=http://www.icahdq.org/publicpdf/awards_web.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=Jan 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726164948/http://www.icahdq.org/publicpdf/awards_web.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Golden Anniversary Monograph Award from the [[National Communication Association]].&lt;ref name="NCA"&gt;{{Cite web|title=National Communication Association Awards|publisher =[[National Communication Association]]|year=2001|url= http://www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/Images/NCAawards2001.pdf|accessdate=Jan 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That work has since been translated into French{{sfn|Craig|2009b}} and Russian.&lt;ref name="vita"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Robert |last=Craig |title=Robert Craig Vita |publisher=University of Colorado |date=Feb 3, 2011 |url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~craigr/Vitae.pdf |accessdate=Feb 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612062414/http://spot.colorado.edu/~craigr/Vitae.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory presented in "Communication Theory as a Field" has become the basis of the book "Theorizing Communication" which Craig co-edited with Heidi Muller,{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}} as well as being adopted by several other communication theory textbooks as a new framework for understanding the field of communication theory.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}}

==Metamodel==
Sparked by the "[[Great Debates (international relations)|Third Debate]]" within the field of International Relations Theory in the 1980s, "Communication Theory as a Field" expanded the conversation regarding disciplinary identity in the field of communication.{{sfn|Donsback|2006}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008|pp=6}}{{sfn|Penman|2000}}{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004}}{{sfn|Lindlof|Taylor|2002}}{{sfn|D'Angelo|2002}}{{sfn|Jimenez|Guillem|2009}} At that time, communication theory textbooks had little to no agreement on how to present the field or what theories to include in their textbooks.{{sfn|Anderson|1996|pp=200-201}}{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=120}}  This article has since become the foundational framework for four different textbooks to introduce the field of communication.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}} In this article Craig "proposes a vision for communication theory that takes a huge step toward unifying this rather disparate field and addressing its complexities."{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}} To move toward this unifying vision Craig focused on [[communication theory]] as a practical discipline and shows how "various traditions of communication theory can be engaged in dialogue on the practice of communication."{{sfn|Craig|2006|pp=13}}{{sfn|Penman|2000|pp=6}}  In this deliberative process theorists would engage in dialog about the "practical implications of communication theories."{{sfn|Craig|2001}} In the end Craig proposes seven different traditions of communication theory and outlines how each one of them would engage the others in dialogue.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-146}}

Craig argues that while the study of communication and communication theory has become a rich and flourishing field "Communication theory as an identifiable field of study does not yet exist" and the field of communication theory has become fragmented into separate domains which simply ignore each other.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=119-120}} This inability to engage in dialog with one another causes theorists to view communication from isolated viewpoints, and denies them the richness that is available when engaging different perspectives.{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}} Craig argues that communication theorists are all engaging in the study of practical communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}} By doing so different traditions are able to have a common ground from which a dialog can form, albeit each taking a different perspective of communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}} Through this process of forming a dialog between theorists with different viewpoints on communication "communication theory can fully engage with the ongoing practical discourse (or metadiscourse) about communication in society."{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}}

The communication discipline began not as a single discipline, but through many different disciplines independently researching communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}} This interdisciplinary beginning has separated theorists through their different conceptions of communication, rather than unifying them in the common topic of communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=120-123}} Craig argues that the solution to this incoherence in the field of communication is not a unified theory of communication, but to create a dialogue between these theorists which engages these differences with one another to create new understandings of communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=123-125}}{{sfn|Penman|2000|pp=76}}

To achieve this dialog Craig proposes what he calls "Dialogical-Dialectical coherence," or a "common awareness of certain complementaries and tensions among different types of communication theory."{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=124}} Craig believes that the different theories cannot develop in total isolation from one another, therefore this dialogical-dialectical coherence will provide a set of background assumptions from which different theories can engage each other in productive argumentation.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=124}} Craig argues for a [[metatheory]], or "second level" theory which deals with "first level" theories about communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=126-127}}  This second level metamodel of communication theory would help to understand the differences between first level communication traditions.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=123-132}} With this thesis in place, Craig proposes seven suggested traditions of communication that have emerged and each of which have their own way of understanding communication.{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004|pp=440}}{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-134}}
#[[Rhetoric]]al: views communication as the practical art of discourse.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=135-136}}
#[[Semiotic]]: views communication as the mediation by signs.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=136-138}}
#[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenological]]: communication is the experience of dialogue with others.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=138-140}}
#[[cybernetics|Cybernetic]]: communication is the flow of information.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=141-142}}
#[[Social psychology (sociology)|Socio-psychological]]: communication is the interaction of individuals.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=142-144}}
#[[sociocultural|Socio-cultural]]: communication is the production and reproduction of the social order.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=144-146}}
#[[Critical theory|Critical]]: communication is the process in which all assumptions can be challenged.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=146-149}}

These proposed seven traditions of communication theory are then placed on two separate tables{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=133-134}} first to show how each traditions different interpretation of communication defines the tradition's vocabulary, communication problems, and commonplaces,{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132,133}} and next to show what argumentation between the traditions would look like.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132,134}}  Craig then outlines the specifics of each tradition.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=135-149}}

===Conclusion===

Craig concluded with an open invitation to explore how the differences in these theories might shed light on key issues, show where new traditions could be created, and engaging communication theory with communication problems through metadiscourse.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=149}} Craig further proposes several future traditions that could possibly be fit into the metamodel.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=149,151}} A feminist tradition where communication is theorized as "connectedness to others", an aesthetic tradition theorizing communication as "embodied performance", an economic tradition theorizing communication as "exchange", and a spiritual tradition theorizing communication on a "nonmaterial or mystical plane of existence."{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=151}}

==Response==

===Myers, constitutive metamodel, and truth===
In 2001 Myers, a [[computer-mediated communication]] scholar from [[Loyola University New Orleans]], criticizes Craig's ideas in "A Pox on All Compromises: A reply to Craig (1999)."{{sfn|Myers|2001}}  Myers makes two main arguments against Craig's article. Myers argues that Craig misrepresents the metamodel, and that the lack of any critical truth within Craigs construction is problematic for the field of communication theory.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=219}}{{sfn|Craig|2007}} The metamodel is misrepresented by unjustly arguing that there is a separation between first and second level constitutive models while hiding the paradox within this statement, and that it privileges the constitutive model rather than another theoretical conception.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=219-123, 226}} Next Myers argues that Craig fails to draw any way to discern truth within the theories.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=222-223}} Using a case study regarding the rise and fall of [[technological determinism]] among computer-mediated communication scholars,{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=223-226}} Myers argues that a metamodel needs to provide some mechanism that will "reduce misrepresentation and mistake" in evaluating theory.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=226}} Myers frames Craig's ideas of collective discourse without an evaluative criteria of what is good theory and bad theory as [[The Hatter|"a Mad Hatter's tea party"]] which will "allow all to participate in this party of discourse" but will not be able to "inform any of the participants when it is time to leave."{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=226}}

====Craig's response to Myers====

Craig responded, in "an almost [[William James|Jamesian]] reply",{{sfn|Russill|2005|pp=300}} that Myers criticisms were not founded in actual inconsistencies within Craigs argument.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=232}} Rather they were founded in the difference between Myers and Craig's "respective notions of truth and the proper role of [[Empiricism|empirical truth]] as a criterion for adjudicating among theories."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=232}} In regard to Myers first claim that the separation between first level theories and second level metatheory is paradoxical and therefore an inaccurate or misguided distinction, Craig admits that there is a paradox inherent within a separation between first order theories and metatheory but "slippage between logical levels is an inherent feature (or bug) of communication, and we should not forget that theory is, among other things, communication. "{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=234}} Craig cites [[Gregory Bateson]] as pointing out that while the [[Double bind#Theory of logical types|theory of logical types]] forbids the mixing of different "levels" to avoid paradox, "practical communication necessarily does exactly that."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=233}}  Actual communication is fraught with paradox, and while a logicians ideal would have us try and resolve these paradoxes, in actual practice we don't because there is no way to do so.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=233}} In actually occurring communication people employ different means of dealing with this paradox, but resolving the paradox is not a possible solution.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=233}} Craig argues that Myers has been unable to prove any inconsistency or misrepresentation when it came to using the constitutive model for his metamodel.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=234-235}} Rather than trying to subvert every other theory to a constitutional model, Craig used the constitutive model not for some theory of truth or logical necessity, but because the constitutive model pragmatically will accomplish the goal of the project, that of opening up a space from which competing theories of communication can interact.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=234}} With this the constitutional model will be able to maintain a theoretical cosmopolitanism.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=236}}

On the second argument that the metamodel lacks any empirical truth criteria, Craig argues that not only did Myers miss the point of the metamodel by claiming it should evaluate the truth of theories{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=236-237}} but that Myers own case study fails to back up his point.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=236,238}} The metamodel itself does not distinguish the falseness of other models.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=237}} However, contrary to Myers claim, the metamodel does allow theorists engaged in discussion to judge the validity of theories "on the basis of empirical evidence in ordinary reasonable ways."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=237}} What the metamodel does deny is a universally established absolute truth in the field of communication theory.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=230}} Craig points out that Myers was correct in that the metamodel is ill-equipped to judge theories as valid or invalid, it also doesn't do a good job of closing "the Antarctic ozone hole or solve other problems for which it was not designed."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} The case study that Myers presents is the debate about [[technological determinism]] in the realm of Computer Mediated Communication.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=223-226}} Craig points out that this debate occurred between [[Social psychology (sociology)|social scientific]] researchers.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} This type of research has a shared commitment to [[empirical research]] methods.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} So in spite of already possessing a shared truth criteria, these researchers failed to prevent errors Myers hopes would be avoided by holding onto a form of absolute truth.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} This case study would be a good critique of empirical truth but "how it supports a critique of the constitutive metamodel is less than apparent."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} By relying upon this case study Myers sabotages his argument for establishing an absolute truth criteria, demonstrating that "we would gain little by holding on to such a criterion."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}}

=== Russill, pragmatism as an eighth tradition ===
After this exchange between Myers and Craig, there was no real disciplinary discussion of the metamodel{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125-126}}{{sfn|Craig|2009a|pp=7}} besides textbooks which used the metamodel as a framework for introducing the field.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}}
Then in 2004 in an unpublished dissertation,{{sfn|Russill|2004}}{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=126}} which was mentioned in a footnote in his 2005 "The road not Taken: William James's Radical Empiricism and Communication Theory,"{{sfn|Russill|2005}}{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=126}} Russill proposed the possibly of [[pragmatism]] as an eighth tradition of [[communication studies]].{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=126}}{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=281-282}}{{sfn|Russill|2005|pp=296-298}}{{sfn|Craig|2009a}}  This was attempted by using "Craig's rules" for the requirements of a tradition in communication theory{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130}}{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=282}}{{sfn|Russill|2005|pp=300}} which Russill formulates as "a problem formulation..., an initial vocabulary..., and arguments for the plausibility of this viewpoint in relation to prevailing traditions of theory."{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=281}}{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=133}}

Russill did not write his dissertation with the goal of constructing a tradition of communication theory, rather he was attempting to "resuscitate and reconstruct [[John Dewey|Dewey's]] theory of the public as a pragmatist theory of democratic communication."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130}}{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=iii, 5, 68-105, 279-283}}  To accomplish this goal Russill places Dewey in conversation with a variety of theorists including [[William James]], [[John Locke]], [[James W. Carey|James Carey]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], and [[Walter Lippmann]] among others.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130}}{{sfn|Russill|2004}}  Russill makes the argument that the pragmatist tradition "conceptualizes communication in response to the problem of incommensurability."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=131}}  Incommensurability being how a pluralistic society can engage in cooperation when there is an absence "of common, absolute standards for resolving differences."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=131}}  Russill briefly attempted to construct a pragmatist tradition of communication only to establish Dewey's theory of the public within that tradition.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130-131}}{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=281-282}}  To do this he outlines pragmatism as a tradition that identifies the problem formulation as "incommensurability", and the vocabulary as "democracy, publics, power, criticism, response-ability, triple contingency."{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=281}}{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=131}}

====Craig's response to Russill====

Craig responds to this in "Pragmatism in the Field of Communication Theory" and mentions that while Russill "does not entirely follow 'Craig's Rules'" for a new tradition of communication theory, Russill "does define a pragmatist tradition in terms of a distinct way of framing the problem of communication and articulates premises that make the tradition theoretically and practically plausible."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130-131}}  Craig points out that Russill is not the first communication theorists who writes on pragmatism, however he is the first to use the constitutive metamodel to define it as a tradition of communication.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=134}}  This conception of pragmatism as an eighth tradition of communication studies allows a new space for theories, which Craig identified as either ambiguously placed or neglected, to "immediately snap into focus as contributors to a distinct [pragmatic] tradition."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=134}}

To fully outline a new tradition of communication theory, Russill would have had to fully incorporate that tradition within the dialogical-dialectical matrix.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=135}}  Russill failed to fully consider the full range of criticism which would occur between the Pragmatist tradition and the other traditions of communication.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=135}}  Craig uses the dialogical-dialectical matrix to outline how pragmatism could be incorporated into the metamodel.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=135-137}}

* Haali Media Splitter - demultiplexes MP4 ([[MPEG-4]]), M2TS ([[MPEG transport stream]]) and MKV ([[Matroska]]) files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haali.su/mkv/ Haali Media Splitter]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flash Video|FLV]] Splitter - demultiplexes [[Flash Video|Flash video]] files.&lt;ref&gt;[[SourceForge.net]] - [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=205650&amp;package_id=246121 FLV Splitter]&lt;/ref&gt;

* tsMuxeR, using the Demux output option
* MP4Box, command line MP4 multiplexer/demultiplexer with GUIs like My MP4Box

==Playback issues==
Playback difficulties (such as no playback, no audio, or no video) may result from several or [[Legacy system|legacy]] file splitters for a particular file format being installed on an [[operating system]]. This causes [[codec|decoder]]-to-file-splitter mismatch resulting in playback failure on [[Media player (application software)|media player]]s.

The economics of [[information security]] addresses the economic aspects of [[privacy]] and [[computer security]]. Economics of information security includes models of the strictly rational “[[homo economicus]]” as well as [[behavioral economics]]. '''Economics of security''' addresses individual and organizational decisions and behaviors with respect to security and privacy as market decisions.

Economics of security addresses a core question: why do agents choose technical risks when there exists technical solutions to mitigate security and privacy risks?  Economics addresses not only this question, but also inform design decisions in [[security engineering]].

== Emergence of economics of security ==
[[National security]] is the canonical [[public good]]. The economic status of information security came to the intellectual fore around 2000. As is the case with innovations it arose simultaneously in multiple venues.

In 2000, [[Ross J. Anderson|Ross Anderson]] wrote, [http://www.acsac.org/2001/papers/110.pdf Why Information Security is Hard].  Anderson explained that a significant difficulty in optimal development of security technology is that incentives must be aligned with the technology to enable rational adoption. Thus, economic insights should be integrated into technical design. A security technology should enable the party at risk to invest to limit that risk. Otherwise, the designers are simply counting on [[altruism]] for adoption and diffusion. Many consider this publication the birth of economics of security.

Also in 2000 at Harvard, Camp at the School of Government and Wolfram in the Department of Economics argued that security is not a [[public good]] but rather each extant vulnerabilities has an associated negative [[externality]] value.  Vulnerabilities were defined in this work as tradable goods.  Six years later, [http://idefense.com/ iDEFENSE], [http://zerodayinitiative.com/  ZDI] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20071125104648/http://www.mozilla.org/security/bug-bounty.html Mozilla] have extant markets for vulnerabilities.

In 2000, the scientists at the Computer Emergency Response Team at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] proposed an early mechanism for risk assessment. The Hierarchical Holographic Model provided the first multi-faceted evaluation tool to guide security investments using the science of risk. Since that time, CERT has developed a suite of systematic mechanism for organizations to use in risk evaluations, depending on the size and expertise of the organization: [http://www.cert.org/octave OCTAVE]. The study of computer security as an investment in risk avoidance has become standard practice.

In 2001, in an unrelated development, [[Lawrence A. Gordon]] and [http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty/mloeb/ Martin P. Loeb] published [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=383709 Using information security as a response to competitor analysis systems]. A working paper of the published article was written in 2000. These professors, from Maryland's Smith School of Business, present a game-theoretic framework that demonstrates how information security can prevent rival firms from gaining sensitive information. In this context, the article considers the economic (i.e., cost-benefit) aspects of information security. 

The authors came together to develop and expand a series of flagship events under the name Workshop on the Economics of Information Security.

== Examples of findings in economics of security ==
Proof of work is a security technology designed to stop spam by altering the economics. An early paper in economics of information security argued that [[proof of work]] cannot work. In fact, the finding was that [[proof of work]] cannot work without [[price discrimination]] as illustrated by a later paper, [http://weis2006.econinfosec.org/docs/50.pdf Proof of Work can Work].

Another finding, one that is critical to an understanding of current American data practices, is that the opposite of [[privacy]] is not, in economic terms [[anonymity]], but rather [[price discrimination]]. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.9746&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Privacy and price discrimination] was authored by [[Andrew Odlyzko]] and illustrates that what may appear as information pathology in collection of data is in fact rational organizational behavior.

[[Hal Varian]] presented three models of security using the metaphor of the height of walls around a town to show security as a normal good, public good, or good with externalities. [http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/resources/affiliates/workshops/econsecurity/econws/49.pdf Free riding] is the end result, in any case.

[[Lawrence A. Gordon]] and [http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty/mloeb/ Martin P. Loeb] wrote the [http://ns2.virusflags.dc.hu/~mfelegyhazi/courses/EconSec/readings/04_GordonL02economics_security_investment.pdf Economics of Information Security Investment]. The [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] is considered by many as the first economic model that determines the optimal amount to invest to protect a given set of information. The model takes into account the vulnerability of the information to a security breach and the potential loss should such a breach occur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1782">'''Enterocoely''' (adjective forms: '''enterocoelic''' and '''enterocoelous''') is a process by which some animal [[embryonic development|embryos develop]]. In enterocoely, a [[mesoderm]] (middle layer) is formed in a developing [[embryo]], in which the [[coelom]] forms from pouches "pinched" off of the digestive tract (also known as the embryonic gut, or [[archenteron]]). This type of coelom formation occurs in [[deuterostome]] animals, which for this reason are also known as '''enterocoelomates'''.

Enterocoelous development begins once the embryo reaches the [[gastrula]] phase of development. At this point, there are two layers of cells: the [[ectoderm]] (outermost) and the [[endoderm]] (innermost) layers. The mesoderm begins to form as two "pockets" of tissue (one above the endoderm, and one below) are formed via folding of the endoderm. These "pockets" begin to grow larger, and as they do so, they extend towards each other. When the two "pockets" of cells meet, the mesoderm is formed – a complete layer of tissue right in between the endoderm and ectoderm layers. This then leads to the formation of a coelom.

Enterocoelous development is the stage of embryological development of deuterostomes in which the coelom forms. The stage starts with the gastrula; as the archenteron forms, pockets of migrating cells also form, creating another layer between the endoderm and ectoderm, the mesoderm. These pockets gradually expand to form the coelom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/pae/glossarye.html PAE Virtual Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[protostome]]s, the body cavity is formed by [[schizocoely]].

'''Environmental determinism''' (also known as '''climatic determinism''' or '''geographical determinism''') is the study of how the [[physical environment]] predisposes societies and states towards particular development trajectories. Nineteenth-century approaches held that climate and terrain largely determined human activity and psychology, and it was associated with institutionalized racism and [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Semple|first1=Ellen Churchhill|title=Influences of Geographic Environment, on the Basis of Ratzel's System of Anthropo-Geography|date=1911|publisher=H. Holt &amp; Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars underscore that this approach supported [[colonialism]] and [[eurocentrism]], and devalued human agency in non-Western societies.&lt;ref name="Gilmartin, M. 2009 pp. 115-123"&gt;Gilmartin, M. (2009). "Colonialism/Imperialism". Key concepts in political geography (pp. 115–123). London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sluyter|first1=Ander|title=Neo-Environmental Determinism, Intellectual Damage Control, and Nature/Society Science|journal=Antipode-Blackwell|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]], [[Jeffrey Herbst]], [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]], and other social scientists sparked a revival of the theory during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This "neo-environmental determinism" school of thought examines how geographic and ecological forces influence [[state-building]], [[economic development]], and [[institutions]].

==A history of thought==

===Classical and medieval periods===
Early theories of environmental determinism in [[Ancient China]], [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]] suggested that environmental features completely determined the physical and intellectual qualities of whole societies. [[Guan Zhong]] (720–645 BC), an [[Spring and Autumn period|early]] chancellor in China, held that the qualities of major rivers shaped the character of surrounding peoples. Swift and twisting rivers made people "greedy, uncouth, and warlike".&lt;ref&gt;trans. Allyn Rickett (1998), in ''Guanzi: Political, Economic, and Philosophical Essays from Early China: A Study and Translation''. Volume II. Princeton University Press, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek philosopher [[Hippocrates]] wrote a similar account in his treatise "Airs, Waters, Places".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' Princeton: Princeton University Press. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers in the medieval [[Middle East]] also produced theories of environmental determinism. The [[Afro-Arab]] writer [[al-Jahiz]] argued that the [[skin color]] of people and livestock were determined by the water, soil, and heat of their environments. He compared the color of black [[basalt]] in the northern [[Najd]] to the skin color of the peoples living there to support his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conrad | first1 = Lawrence I. | year = 1982 | title = Taun and Waba: Conceptions of Plague and Pestilence in Early Islam | url = | journal = Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 268–307 [278] | doi=10.2307/3632188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Khaldun]], the [[Sociology in medieval Islam|Arab sociologist]] and [[polymath]], similarly linked skin color to environmental factors. In his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), he wrote that black skin was due to the hot climate of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and not due to African lineage. He thereby challenged [[Hamitic]] theories of race that held that the sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)]] were cursed with black skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title='Race', slavery and Islam in Maghribi Mediterranean thought: the question of the Haratin in Morocco|first=Chouki|last=El Hamel|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|volume=7|issue=3|year=2002|pages=29–52 [39–42]|doi=10.1080/13629380208718472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many writings of Ibn Khaldun were translated during the colonial era in order to advance the colonial propaganda machine.&lt;ref&gt;Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldun Orientalist, by Abdelmajid Hannoum  © 2003 Wesleyan University. {{JSTOR|3590803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Khaldun believed that the physical environment influenced non-physical factors in addition to skin color. He argued that soil, climate, and food determined whether people were [[nomad]]ic or [[sedentism|sedentary]], and what customs and ceremonies they held. His writings may have influenced the later writings of [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] during the 18th century through the traveller [[Jean Chardin]], who travelled to Persia and described theories resembling those of Ibn Khaldun.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Spread of Ibn Khaldun's Ideas on Climate and Culture|author=Warren E. Gates|journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]|volume=28|issue=3|date=July–September 1967|pages=415–422|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|jstor=2708627|doi=10.2307/2708627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western colonial period===
{{main article|Impact of Western European colonialism and colonisation}}
Environmental determinism has been widely criticized as a tool to legitimize [[colonialism]], [[racism]], and [[imperialism]] in [[Africa]], [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="Gilmartin, M. 2009 pp. 115-123"/&gt; Environmental determinism enabled geographers to scientifically justify the supremacy of white European races and the naturalness of imperialism.&lt;ref name="Painter 2009, pg.177"&gt;Painter &amp; Jeffrey, "Political Geography", Sage Publications, 2009, pg.177.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholarship bolstered religious justifications and in some cases superseded them during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="J.A. Campbell 1983"&gt;J.A. Campbell &amp; D.N. Livingstone, "Neo-Lemarckism and the Development of Geography in the United States and Great Britain," Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 8 (1983): 278&lt;/ref&gt;

Many writers, including [[Thomas Jefferson]], supported and legitimized African colonization by arguing that tropical climates made the people uncivilized. Jefferson argued that tropical climates encouraged laziness, relaxed attitudes, promiscuity and generally degenerative societies, while the frequent variability in the weather of the middle and northern latitudes led to stronger work ethics and civilized societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jefferson|first1=Thomas|editor1-last=Gates|editor1-first=Henry Louis|editor2-last=Burton|editor2-first=Jennifer|title=Call and Response: Key Debates in African American Studies|date=2011|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-97578-9|pages=17–24|chapter=Notes on the State of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] also made use of this theory to extol the supremacy of the [[Nordic race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carolynyeager.net/why-we-are-antisemites-text-adolf-hitlers-1920-speech-hofbr%C3%A4uhaus|title="Why We Are Antisemites" - Text of Adolf Hitler's 1920 speech at the Hofbräuhaus|author=Carolyn Yeager|date=29 January 2013|work=carolynyeager.net|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defects of character supposedly generated by tropical climates were believed to be inheritable under the [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] theory of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]], a discredited precursor to the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="J.A. Campbell 1983"/&gt; The outdated theory begins with the observation that an organism faced with environmental pressures may undergo physiological changes during its lifetime through the process of [[acclimatization]]. Lamarckianism suggested that those physiological changes may be passed directly to offspring, without the need for offspring to develop the trait in the same manner.&lt;ref&gt;Lamarck, 1809: 124 in Ernst Mayr, "Lamarck Revisited," Journal of the History of Biology 5 (1972): 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographical societies like the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and the [[Société de géographie]] supported imperialism by funding explorers and other colonial proponents.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmartin, M. (2009). "Colonialism/Imperialism". Key concepts in political geography (pg 117). London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific societies acted similarly. [[Acclimatisation society|Acclimatization societies]] directly supported colonial enterprises and enjoyed their benefits. The writings of Lamarck provided theoretical backing for the acclimatization doctrines. The Société Zoologique d'Acclimatation was largely founded by [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]—son of [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], a close colleague and supporter of Lamarck.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Michael A. "Acclimatizing the World: A History of the Paradigmatic Colonial Science." Osiris 15 (2000): 138, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellen Churchill Semple]], a prominent environmental determinism scholar, applied her theories in a case study which focused on the [[Philippines]], where she mapped civilization and wildness onto the [[topography]] of the islands.&lt;ref name="Painter 2009, pg.177" /&gt; Other scholars argued that climate and topography caused specific character traits to appear in a given populations. Scholars thereby imposed racial stereotypes on whole societies.&lt;ref name="Painter 2009, pg.177" /&gt; Imperial powers rationalized [[Exploitation of labour|labor exploitation]] by claiming that tropical peoples were morally inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Shirlow, Peter, Gallaher, Carolyn, Gilmartin, Mary, "Key Concepts in Political Geography", SAGE Publications Ldt, 2009, pg.127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of environmental determinism in rationalizing and legitimizing [[racism]], [[ethnocentrism]] and [[economic inequality]] has consequently drawn strong criticism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Painter &amp; Jeffrey, "Political Geography", Sage Publications, 2009, pg.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern scientists have also critiqued classical environmental determinism as unscientific. [[Carl O. Sauer|Carl Sauer]] criticized the premature generalizations resulting from bias in environmentalism in 1924. He argued that to define [[geography]] as the study of environmental influences is to assume in advance that such influences do operate, and that science cannot be based upon or committed to preconceptions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Furthermore, since [[evolution|evolutionary change]] manifests over very long time periods, some argue that the ability to adequately correlate human behaviour with any specific environmental condition is speculative at best and impossible at worst.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[David Landes]] similarly condemns of what he terms the unscientific moral geography of [[Ellsworth Huntington]]. He argues that Huntington undermined geography as a science by attributing all human activity to physical influences so that he might classify civilizations hierarchically – favoring those civilizations he considered best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landes|first1=David|title=The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some are So Rich and Some So Poor|ISBN= 0-393-04017-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late-20th-century growth of neo-environmental determinism===
Environmental determinism was revived in the late-twentieth century as neo-environmental determinism. The new term coined by the [[social science|social scientist]] and critic [[Andrew Sluyter]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Sluyter argues that neo-environmental determinism does not sufficiently break with its classical and imperial precursors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Neo-environmental determinism examines how the physical environment predisposes societies and states towards particular trajectories of economic and political development. It explores how geographic and ecological forces influence [[state-building]], [[economic development]], and [[institutions]]. It also addresses fears surrounding the [[effects of global warming|effects of modern climate change]].&lt;ref name="Sage Publications"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthews, Bartlein, Briffa, Dawson, Vernal, Denham, Fritz, Oldfield|title=The SAGE Handbook of Environmental Change|date=2012|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=978-0-85702-360-5|pages=1–447}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] was influential in the resurgence of environmental determinism due to the popularity of his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', which addresses the geographic origins of state formation prior to 1500 A.D.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=0-393-03891-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-environmental determinism scholars debate how much the [[physical environment]] shapes economic and political [[institutions]]. Economic historians [[Stanley Engerman]] and [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] argue that [[factor endowments]] greatly affected "institutional" development in the Americas, by which they mean the tendency to more free (democratic, free market) or unfree (dictatorial, economically restrictive) regimes.

In contrast, [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]], and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] underscore that the geographic factors most influenced institutional development during early state formation and [[colonialism]]. They argue that geographic differences cannot explain economic growth disparities after 1500 A.D. directly, except through their effects on economic and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Crown Business"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Robinson|first2=James|title=Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty|date=2012|publisher=Crown Business|location=New York|isbn=978-0307719218|pages=1–546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists [[Jeffrey Sachs]] and [[John Luke Gallup]] have examined the direct impacts of geographic and climatic factors on economic development, especially the role of geography on the cost of trade and access to markets, the disease environment, and agricultural productivity.&lt;ref name="Geography and Economic Development"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallup, Sachs, and Mellinger|title=Geography and Economic Development|journal=International Regional Science Review|date=August 1999|issue=22|pages=179–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary [[global warming]] crisis has also impacted environmental determinism scholarship. [[Jared Diamond]] draws similarities between the [[climate change|changing climate conditions]] that brought down the [[Easter Island]] civilization and [[global warming]] in his book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Jared|title=Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed|date=January 4, 2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|isbn=0140279512|pages=1–621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Kolata, Charles Ortloff, and Gerald Huag similarly describe the [[Tiwanaku empire]] and [[Maya civilization]] collapses as caused by climate events such as [[drought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolata|first1=Alan L.|last2=Ortloff|first2=Charles|title=Thermal Analysis of Tiwanaku Raised Field Systems in the Lake Titicaca Basin of Bolivia|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=October 1989|volume=16|pages=233–263|doi=10.1016/0305-4403(89)90004-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huag|first1=Gerald|title=Climate and the Collapse of Maya Civilization|journal=Science|date=March 2003|volume=299|issue=5613|pages=1731–1735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter deMenocal, Just as the earthworks in the deserts of the west grew out of notions of landscape painting, the growth of public art stimulated artists to engage the urban landscape as another environment and also as a platform to engage ideas and concepts about the environment to a larger audience. A scientist at the [[Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory]] at [[Columbia University]], writes that societal collapse due to climate change is possible today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=deMenocal|first1=Peter|title=African Climate Change and Faunal Evolution During the Pliocene-Pleistocene|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|date=December 2003|volume=220|pages=3–24|doi=10.1016/s0012-821x(04)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological and geographic impacts on early state formation ==
{{main article|State formation}}

===Effects of species endowments, climate, and continental axes prior to 1500===
{{main article|Guns, Germs, and Steel}}
In the [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' (1999), author [[Jared Diamond]] points to geography as the answer to why certain states were able to grow and develop faster and stronger than others. His theory cited the natural environment and raw materials a civilization was blessed with as factors for success, instead of popular century old claims of racial and cultural superiority. Diamond says that these natural endowments began with the dawn of man, and favored Eurasian civilizations due to their location along similar latitudes, suitable farming climate, and early animal domestication.&lt;ref name="Guns, Germs, and Steel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Jared|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel|date=1997|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond argues that early states located along the same latitude lines were uniquely suited to take advantage of similar climates, making it easier for crops, livestock, and farming techniques to spread. Crops such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]] were simple to grow and easy to harvest, and regions suitable for their cultivation saw high population densities and the growth of early cities. The ability to domesticate herd animals, which had no natural fear of humans, high birth rates, and an innate hierarchy, gave some civilizations the advantages of free labor, fertilizers, and war animals. The east-west orientation of Eurasia allowed for knowledge capital to spread quickly, and writing systems to keep track of advanced farming techniques gave people the ability to store and build upon a knowledge base across generations. Craftsmanship flourished as a surplus of food from farming allowed some groups the freedom to explore and create, which lead to the development of [[metallurgy]] and advances in technology. While the advantageous geography helped to develop early societies, the close proximity in which humans and their animals lived led to the spread of disease across Eurasia. Over several centuries, rampant disease decimated populations, but ultimately led to disease resistant communities. Diamond suggests that these chains of causation led to European and Asian civilizations holding a dominant place in the world today.&lt;ref name="Guns, Germs, and Steel"/&gt;

Diamond uses the Spanish [[conquistador|conquistadors']] conquering of the Americas as a case study for his theory. He argues that the Europeans took advantage of their environment to build large and complex states complete with advanced technology and weapons. The [[Incans]] and other native groups were not as blessed, suffering from a north–south orientation that prevented the flow of goods and knowledge across the continent. The Americas also lacked the animals, metals, and complex writing systems of Eurasia which prevented them from achieving the military or biological protections needed to fight off the European threat.&lt;ref name="Guns, Germs, and Steel"/&gt;

Diamond's theory has not gone without criticism.
* It was notably attacked for not providing enough detail regarding causation of environmental variables, and for leaving logical gaps in reasoning. Geographer Andrew Sluyter argued that Diamond was just as ignorant as the racists of the 19th century. Sluyter challenged Diamond's theory since it seemed to suggest that environmental conditions lead to gene selection, which then lead to wealth and power for certain civilizations. Sluyter also attacks environmental determinism by condemning it as a highly studied and popular field based entirely on Diamond's "quick and dirty" combination of natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
* [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] similarly criticized Diamond's work in their book ''[[Why Nations Fail]]''. They contend that the theory is outdated and can not effectively explain differences in economic growth after 1500 or the reasons why states that are geographically close can exhibit vast differences in wealth. They instead favored an institutional approach in which a societies success or failure is based on the underlying strength of its institutions.&lt;ref name="Crown Business"/&gt;

===Geography and pre-colonial African state-building  ===

==== The effects of climate and land abundance on the development of state systems ====
{{main article|States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control}}

In his book ''[[States and Power in Africa]]'', political scientist [[Jeffrey Herbst]] argues that environmental conditions help explain why, in contrast to other parts of the world such as Europe, many pre-colonial societies in Africa did not develop into dense, settled, hierarchical societies with strong state control that competed with neighboring states for people and territory.&lt;ref name="cul.columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=James|title=States and Power in Africa: By Jeffrey I. Herbst: A Review Essay|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|date=June 2002|volume=40|issue=2|pages=510–19|doi=10.1257/002205102320161357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbst argues that the European state-building experience was highly idiosyncratic because it occurred under systemic geographic pressures that favored wars of conquest – namely, passable [[terrain]], land [[scarcity]], and [[population densities|high-population densities]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tilly|first1=Charles|title=Coercion, Capital, and European States, A.D. 990–1992|date=1990|publisher=Blackwell|location=Cambridge, MA|page=63|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the constant threat of war, political elites sent administrators and armed forces from the urban centers into rural hinterlands to raise taxes, recruit soldiers, and fortify buffer zones. European states consequently developed strong institutions and capital-periphery linkages.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

By contrast, geographic and climatic factors in pre-colonial Africa made establishing absolute control over particular pieces of land prohibitively costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbst|first1=Jeffry|title=States and Power in Africa|date=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01027-7|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, because African farmers relied on rain-fed agriculture and consequently invested little in particular pieces of land, they could easily flee rulers rather than fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbst|first1=Jeffry|title=States and Power in Africa|date=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01027-7|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early African empires, like the [[Ashanti Empire]], successfully projected power over large distances by building roads.The largest pre-colonial polities arose in the [[Sudanian Savanna]] belt of West Africa because the horses and camels could transport armies over the terrain. In other areas, no centralized political organizations existed above the village level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbst|first1=Jeffry|title=States and Power in Africa|date=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01027-7|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African states did not develop more responsive institutions under [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial rule]] or [[Decolonisation of Africa|post-independence]]. Colonial powers had little incentive to develop state institutions to protect their colonies against invasion, having divided up Africa at the [[Berlin Conference]]. The colonizers instead focused on exploting natural resources and [[exploitation colonialism]].&lt;ref name="cul.columbia.edu"/&gt;

==== The effect of disease environments ====
Dr. Marcella Alsan argues the prevalence of the [[tsetse fly]] hampered early state formation in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Alsan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alsan|first=Marcella|date=January 2015|title=The Effect of the Tsetse Fly on African Development|url=https://fsi.stanford.edu/publications/the_effect_of_the_tsetse_fly_on_african_development|journal=American Economic Review|volume=105|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the tsetse virus was lethal to cows and horses, communities afflicted by the insect could not rely on the agricultural benefits provided by [[livestock]]. African communities were prevented from stockpiling agricultural surplus, working the land, or eating meat. Because the disease environment hindered the formation of farming communities, early African societies resembled small [[hunter-gatherer]] groups and not centralized states.&lt;ref name="Alsan"/&gt;

The relative availability of livestock animals enabled European societies to form centralized institutions, develop advanced technologies, and create an agricultural network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Overton|first1=Mark|title=Agricultural Revolution in England: The Transformation of the Agrarian Economy 1500–1850|date=18 April 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could rely on their livestock to reduce the need for manual labor. Livestock also diminished the [[comparative advantage]] of owning [[slaves]]. African societies relied on the use of rival tribesman as slave labor where the fly was prevalent, which impeded long-term societal cooperation.&lt;ref name="Alsan"/&gt;

Alsan argues that her findings support the view of [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] and [[Stanley Engerman]] that factor endowments shape state institutions.&lt;ref name="Alsan"/&gt;

===Llamas, chuño and the Inca Empire===
{{see also|Vertical archipelago}}
[[Carl Troll]] has argued that the development of the [[Inca Empire|Inca state]] in the central [[Andes]] was aided by conditions that allow for the elaboration of the [[staple food]] [[chuño]]. Chuño, which can be stored for long times, is made of [[potato]] dried at [[Freezing#Food_preservation|freezing]] temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern [[Peru]]vian highlands. Contradicting the link between the Inca state and dried potato is that other crops such as [[maize]] can also be preserved with only sun.&lt;ref name=Gade2016/&gt; Troll also argued that [[llama]]s, the Incas' [[pack animal]], can be found in their largest numbers in this very same region.&lt;ref name=Gade2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Gade |first=Daniel |date=2016 |title=Spell of the Urubamba: Anthropogeographical Essays on an Andean Valley in Space and Time |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319208480#aboutBook |chapter=Urubamba Verticality: Reflections on Crops and Diseases |location= |publisher= |page=86 |isbn=978-3-319-20849-7 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth considering that the maximum extent of the Inca Empire coincided with the greatest distribution of [[alpaca]]s and llamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hardoy |first=Jorge Henríque |date=1973 |title=Pre-Colombian Cities |url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=fbQJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=llama+inca+expansion+colombia+limi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rirv1B3ECv&amp;sig=eNEgkUGhfN1RQ2uoR71F2WF52Xw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFtZvGvZTZAhVJHJAKHeZYA_MQ6AEIdDAP#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page=24 |isbn=978-0802703804 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a third point Troll pointed out [[Irrigation in Peru|irrigation]] technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building.&lt;ref name=Gade1996&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gade |first1=Daniel W. |date=1996 |title=Carl Troll on Nature and Culture in the Andes (Carl Troll über die Natur und Kultur in den Anden)  |url= |journal=[[Erdkunde]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=301–316 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire, he opposed environmental determinism, arguing that culture lay at the core of the Inca civilization.&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt;

==Effects of geography on political regimes ==

Numerous scholars have argued that geographic and environmental factors affect the types of [[political regime]] that societies develop, and shape paths towards [[democracy]] versus [[dictatorship]].

=== The disease environment ===
{{main article|Why Nations Fail}}

[[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]], and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] have achieved notoriety for demonstrating that diseases and terrain have helped shape tendencies towards democracy versus dictatorship, and through these economic growth and development. In their book ''[[Why Nations Fail]]'', as well as a paper titled ''The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson|first=Daron, Simon and James|date=December 2001|title=The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation|url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/4123|journal=The American Economic Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors show that the colonial disease environment shaped the tendency for Europeans to settle the territory or not, and whether they developed systems of agriculture and labor markets that were free and egalitarian versus exploitative and unequal. These choices of political and economic institutions, they argue, shaped tendencies to democracy or dictatorship over the following centuries.

===Factor endowments===
{{main article|Factor endowment}}

In order to understand the impact and creation of institutions during early state formation, economic historians [[Stanley Engerman]] and [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] examined the economic development of the Americas during colonization.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic development in the Americas since 1500: endowments and institutions|last=Engerman|first=Stanley L.|last2=Sokoloff|first2=Kenneth L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780521251372|location=United States|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that the beginnings of the success or failure of American colonies were based on the specific [[factor endowments]] available to each colony. These endowments included the climate, soil profitability, crop potential, and even native population density. Institutions formed to take advantage of these factor endowments. Those that were most successful developed an ability to change and adapt to new circumstances over time. For example, the development of economic institutions, such as [[plantation]]s, was caused by the need for a large property and labor force to harvest sugar and tobacco, while smallholder farms thrived in areas where scale economies were absent. Though initially profitable, plantation colonies also suffered from large dependent populations over time as slaves and natives were given few rights, limiting the population available to drive future economic progress and technological development.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Factor endowments also influenced political institutions. This is demonstrated by the plantation owning elite using their power to secure long lasting government institutions and pass legislation that lead to the persistence of inequality society. Engerman and Sokoloff found smallholder economies to be more equitable since they discouraged an elite class from forming, and distributed political power democratically to most land-owning males. These differences in political institutions were also highly influential in the development of schools, as more equitable societies demanded an educated population to make political decisions. Over time these institutional advantages had exponential effects, as colonies with educated and free populations were better suited to take advantage of technological change during the industrial revolution, granting country wide participation into the booming free-market economy.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Engerman and Sokoloff conclude that while institutions heavily influenced the success of each colony, no individual type of institution is the source of economic and state growth. Other variables such as factor endowments, technologies, and the creation of property rights are just as crucial in societal development. To encourage state success an institution must be adaptable and suited to find the most economical source of growth. The authors also argue that while not the only means for success, institutional development has long lasting-economic and social effects on the state.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Other prominent scholars contest the extent to which [[factor endowments]] determine economic and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Easterly 3–39"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|pages=3–39|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nugent 45–82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=March 2010|title=Are Factor Endowments Fate?|url=|journal=Revista de Historia Económica|volume=28|issue=1|pages=45–82|doi=10.1017/s0212610909990048|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American economists [[William Easterly]] and [[Ross Levine]] argue that economic development does not solely depend on geographic endowments—like temperate climates, disease-resistant climates, or soil favorable to [[cash crops]]. They stress that there is no evidence that geographic endowments influence country incomes other than through institutions.&lt;ref name="Easterly 3–39"/&gt; They observe that states like [[Burundi]] are poor—despite favorable environmental conditions like abundant rainfall and fertile soil—because of the damage wrought by colonialism. Other states like [[Canada]] with fewer endowments are more stable and have higher per capita incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|pages=3–5|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Easterly and Levine further observe that studies of how the environment directly influences land and labor were tarred by racist theories of underdevelopment, but that does not mean that such theories can be automatically discredited. They argue that Diamond correctly stresses the importance of germs and crops in the very long-run of societal technological development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|page=6|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They find that regression results support the findings of [[Jared Diamond]] and [[David Landes]] that factor endowments influence GDP per capita. However, Easterly and Levine's findings most support the view that long-lasting institutions most shape economic development outcomes. Relevant institutions include private property rights and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|page=27|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey B. Nugent and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] similarly challenge scholars like [[Barrington Moore, Jr.|Barrington Moore]] who hold that certain factor endowments and [[agricultural]] preconditions necessarily lead to particular political and economic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=March 2010|title=Are Factor Endowments Fate?|url=|journal=Revista de Historia Económica|volume=28|issue=1|pages=47|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nugent and Robinson show that [[Economics of coffee|coffee economies]] in [[South America]] pursued radically different paths of political and economic development during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Nugent 45–82"/&gt;

Some coffee states, like [[Costa Rica]] and [[Colombia]], passed laws like the [[Homestead Act of 1862]]. They favored smallholders, held elections, maintained small militaries, and fought fewer wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=March 2010|title=Are Factor Endowments Fate?|url=|journal=Revista de Historia Económica|volume=28|issue=1|pages=50|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smallholder arrangements prompted widespread government investment in education. Other states like [[El Salvador]] and [[Guatemala]] produced coffee on plantations, where individuals were more disenfranchised. Whether a state became a smallholder or plantation state depended not on factor endowments but on norms established under [[colonialism]]—namely, legal statues determining access to land, the background of the governing elites, and the degree of permitted political competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=March 2010|title=Are Factor Endowments Fate?|url=|journal=Revista de Historia Económica|volume=28|issue=1|pages=45|doi=10.1017/s0212610909990048|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nugent and Robinson thereby conclude that factor endowments alone do not determine economic or political institutions.

==Direct effects of geography on economic development==

===Effects of terrain on trade and productivity===

Historians have also noted population densities seem to concentrate on coastlines and that states with large coasts benefit from higher average incomes compared to those in landlocked countries. Coastal living has proven advantageous for centuries as civilizations relied on the coastline and waterways for trade, irrigation, and as a food source.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Conversely, countries without coastlines or navigable waterways are often less urbanized and have less growth potential due to the slow movement of knowledge capital, technological advances, and people. They also have to rely on costly and time consuming over-land trade, which usually results in lack of access to regional and international markets, further hindering growth. Additionally, interior locations tend to have both lower population densities and labor-productivity levels. However, factors including fertile soil, nearby rivers, and ecological systems suited for rice or wheat cultivation can give way to dense inland populations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Nathan Nunn]] and Diego Puga note that though rugged terrain usually makes farming difficult, prevents travel, and limits societal growth, early African states used harsh terrain to their advantage.&lt;ref name="Nunn 20–36"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nunn|first=Nathan|last2=Puga|first2=Diego|date=February 2012|title=Ruggedness: The Blessing of Bad Geography in Africa|url=http://dpuga.economics.utoronto.ca/research/rugged.pdf|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=94|pages=20–36|doi=10.1162/rest_a_00161|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors used a terrain ruggedness index to quantify topographic heterogeneity across several regions of Africa, while simultaneously controlling for variables such as diamond availability and soil fertility. The results suggest that historically, ruggedness is strongly correlated with decreased income levels across the globe and has negatively impacted state growth over time. They note that harsh terrain limited the flow of trade goods and decreased crop availability, while isolating communities from developing knowledge capital. However, the study also demonstrated that the terrain had positive effects on some African communities by protecting them from the slave trade. Communities that were located in areas with rugged features could successfully hide from slave traders and protect their homes from being destroyed. The study found that in these areas rugged topography produced long-term economic benefits and aided post-colonial state formation.&lt;ref name="Nunn 20–36"/&gt;

===Effects of climate on productivity===

The impact that climate and water navigability have on economic growth and GDP per capita was studied by notable scholars including [[Paul Krugman]], [[Jared Diamond]], and [[Jeffrey Sachs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mellinger|first=Andrew D.|last2=Sachs|first2=Jeffrey D.|last3=Gallup|first3=John L.|date=1999|title=Climate, Water Navigability, and Economic Development (Working Paper)|url=|journal=Harvard Institute for International Development|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using variables to measure environmental determinism, such as climate, land composition, latitude, and the presence of infectious disease, they account for trends in worldwide economic development on local, regional and global scales. To do so, they measure economic growth with GDP per capita adjusted to purchasing power parity (PPP), while also taking into consideration population density and labor productivity .&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gallup, John Luke, Jeffrey D. Sachs and Andrew D. Mellinger. "Geography and Economic Development." International regional Science (1999 vol.22): 179–224. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic historians have found that societies in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] experience higher standards of living, and that as latitude increases north or south from the equator, levels of real GDP per capita also increases. Climate is closely correlated with agricultural production since without ideal weather conditions, agriculture alone will not produce the surplus supply needed to build and maintain economies. Locations with hot tropical climates often suffer underdevelopment due to low fertility of soils, excessive plant transpiration, ecological conditions favoring infectious diseases, and unreliable water supply. These factors can cause tropical zones to suffer a 30% to 50% decrease in productivity relative to temperate climate zones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|pages=3–39|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical infectious diseases that thrive in hot and moist equatorial climates cause thousands of deaths each year. They are also an economic drain on society due to high medical costs, and the unwillingness of foreign capital to invest in a sickly state. Because infectious diseases like malaria often need a warm ecology for growth, states in the mid to high latitudes are naturally protected from the devastating effects of disease.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Climatic determinism and colonization===
Climatic determinism, otherwise referred to as the ''equatorial paradox,'' is an aspect of [[economic geography]]. According to this theory, about 70% of a country's [[economic development]] can be predicted by the distance between that country and the [[equator]], and that the further from the equator a country is located, the more developed it tends to be. The theory is the central argument of [[Philip M. Parker]]'s ''Physioeconomics: The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth'', in which he argues that since humans originated as tropical mammals, those who relocated to colder climates attempt to restore their physiological homeostasis through wealth-creation. This act includes producing more food, better housing, heating, warm clothes, etc. Conversely, humans that remained in warmer climates are more physiologically comfortable simply due to temperature, and so have less incentive to work to increase their comfort levels. Therefore, according to Parker [[GDP]] is a direct product of the natural compensation of humans to their climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Phillip|title=Physioeconomics The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth|journal=The MIT Press|date=September 2000|pages=1–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political geographers have used climatic determinism ideology to attempt to predict and rationalize the history of civilization, as well as to explain existing or perceived social and cultural divides between peoples. Some argue that one of the first attempts geographers made to define the development of human geography across the globe was to relate a country's climate to human development. Using this ideology, many geographers believed they were able "to explain and predict the progress of human societies".&lt;ref name="Painter pg.177"&gt;Painter &amp; Jeffrey, "Political Geography", Sage Publications, 2009, pg.177&lt;/ref&gt; This led to warmer climate zones being "seen as producing less civilized, more degenerate peoples, in need of salvation by western colonial powers."&lt;ref name="Shirlow, Peter 2009, pg.117"&gt;Shirlow, Peter, Gallaher, Carolyn, Gilmartin, Mary, "Key Concepts in Political Geography", Sage Publications Ltd, 2009, pg.117.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellsworth Huntington]] also travelled continental Europe in hopes of better understanding the connection between climate and state success, publishing his findings in ''The Pulse of Asia'', and further elaborating in ''Civilization and Climate''.&lt;ref name="sharp2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharp|first1=Jo|title=Geographies of Postcolonialism|date=2008|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Los Angeles, London|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the political geographers, a crucial component of his work was the belief that the climate of North-western Europe was ideal, with areas further north being too cold, and areas further south being too hot, resulting in lazy, laid-back populations.&lt;ref name="sharp2008" /&gt; These ideas were powerful connections to [[colonialism]], and may have played a role in the creation of the '[[Other (philosophy)#Imperialism and colonialism|other]]' and the literature that many used to justify taking advantage of less advanced nations.&lt;ref name="sharp2008" /&gt; Huntington also argued that climate can lead to the demise of even advanced civilizations through drought, food insecurity, and damages to economic production.&lt;ref name="Sage Publications"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2836">'''Evolutionary suicide''' is an evolutionary phenomenon in which the process of [[adaptation]] causes the population to become [[extinct]]. For example, individuals might be selected to switch from eating mature plants to seedlings, and thereby deplete their food plant's population. Selection on individuals can theoretically produce adaptations that threaten the survival of the population.

Much of the research on evolutionary suicide has used the [[mathematical model]]ing technique [[adaptive dynamics]], in which genetic changes are studied together with [[population dynamics]]. This allows the model to predict how [[population density]] will change as a given [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] invades the population.

Evolutionary suicide has also been referred to as "Darwinian extinction", "runaway selection to self-extinction", and "evolutionary collapse".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The idea is similar in concept to the [[tragedy of the commons]] and the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall]], namely that they are all examples of an accumulation of individual changes leading to a collective disaster such that it negates those individual changes.

Many adaptations have apparently negative effects on population dynamics, for example infanticide by male lions, or the production of toxins by bacteria. However, empirically establishing that an extinction event was unambiguously caused by the process of adaptation is not a trivial task.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15014">'''Failure analysis''' is the process of collecting and analyzing data to determine the cause of a [[failure]], often with the goal of determining corrective actions or liability.
According to Bloch and Geitner, machinery failures reveal a reaction chain of cause and effect… usually a deficiency commonly referred to as the symptom…”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Machinery Failure Analysis and Troubleshooting|last=Bloch|first=Heinz|last2=Geitner|first2=Fred|publisher=Gulf Publishing Company|year=1994|isbn=0-87201-232-8|location=Houston, Texas|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; failure analysis can save money, lives, and resources if done correctly and acted upon. It is an important discipline in many branches of manufacturing industry, such as the electronics industry, where it is a vital tool used in the development of new products and for the improvement of existing products. The failure analysis process relies on collecting failed components for subsequent examination of the cause or causes of failure using a wide array of methods, especially [[microscopy]] and [[spectroscopy]]. [[Nondestructive testing]] (NDT) methods (such as [[industrial computed tomography scanning]]) are valuable because the failed products are unaffected by analysis, so inspection sometimes starts using these methods. 

==Forensic investigation==
[[Forensic]] inquiry into the failed process or product is the starting point of failure analysis. Such inquiry is conducted using scientific analytical methods such as electrical and mechanical measurements, or by analyzing failure data such as product reject reports or examples of previous failures of the same kind. The methods of [[forensic engineering]] are especially valuable in tracing product defects and flaws. They may include [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] cracks, [[brittle]] cracks produced by [[stress corrosion cracking]] or [[environmental stress cracking]] for example. Witness statements can be valuable for reconstructing the likely sequence of events and hence the chain of cause and effect. Human factors can also be assessed when the cause of the failure is determined. There are several useful methods to prevent product failures occurring in the first place, including [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)]] and [[Fault tree analysis|fault tree analysis (FTA)]], methods which can be used during [[prototyping]] to analyze failures before a product is marketed.

Failure theories can only be constructed on such data, but when corrective action is needed quickly, the [[precautionary principle]] demands that measures be put in place. In aircraft accidents for example, all planes of the type involved can be grounded immediately pending the outcome of the inquiry.

Several of the techniques used in failure analysis are also used in the analysis of [[No fault found|no fault found (NFF)]] which is a term used in the field of maintenance to describe a situation where an originally reported mode of failure can't be duplicated by the evaluating technician and therefore the potential defect can't be fixed.

NFF can be attributed to oxidation, defective connections of electrical components, temporary shorts or opens in the circuits, software bugs, temporary environmental factors, but also to the operator error. A large number of devices that are reported as NFF during the first troubleshooting session often return to the failure analysis lab with the same NFF symptoms or a permanent mode of failure.

The term failure analysis also applies to other fields such as business management and military strategy.

==Failure analysis engineers==
A failure analysis engineer often plays a lead role in the analysis of failures, whether a component or product fails in service or if failure occurs in manufacturing or during production processing. In any case, one must determine the cause of failure to prevent future occurrence, and/or to improve the performance of the device, component or structure. Structural Engineers and Mechanical Engineers are very common for the job. More specific majors can also get into the position such as materials engineers. Specializing in metallurgy and chemistry is always useful along with properties and strengths of materials. Someone could be hired for different reasons, whether it be to further prevent or liability issues. The median salary of a failure analysis engineer, an engineer with experience in the field, is $81,647.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Failure_Analysis_Engineer/Salary|title=Failure Analysis Engineer Salary|last=|first=|date=|website=PayScale|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A failure analysis engineer requires a good amount of communication and ability to work with others. Usually, the person hired, has a bachelors in engineering but there are certifications that can be acquired.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Case Studies ==

=== Two Shear Key Rods failed on the Bay Bridge ===

==== People on the Case ====
Mr. Brahimi is an American Bridge Fluor consultant and has a Masters in materials engineering.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brahimi|first=Salim|last2=Agiular|first2=Rosme|last3=Christensen|first3=Conrad|date=7 May 2013|title=Shear Key Rod Failure Analysis Report|url=http://www.baybridgeinfo.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Appendix%20H_E2%20Shear%20Key%20Rod%20Failure%20Fracture%20Analysis%20Report_1.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=Bay Bridge Info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Aguilar is the Branch Chief for Caltrans Structural Materials Testing Branch with 30 years’ experience as an engineer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mr. Christensen who is a Caltrans consultant with 32 years of experience with metallurgy and failure analysis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Steps ====
'''Visual Observation''' which is non-destructive examination. This revealed sign of brittleness with no permanent plastic deformation before it broke. Cracks were shown which were the final breaking point of the shear key rods. The engineers suspected hydrogen was involved in producing the cracks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Scanning Electron Microscopy''' which is the scanning of the cracked surfaces under high magnification to get a better understanding of the fracture. The full fracture happened after the rod couldn’t hold under load when the crack reached a critical size.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Micro Structural Examination''' where cross-sections were examined to reveal more information about interworking bonds of the metal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Hardness Testing''' using two strategies, the Rockwell C Hardness and the Knoop Microhardness which reveals that it was not heat treated correctly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Tensile Test''' tells the engineer the yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation was sufficient to pass the requirements. Multiple pieces were taken and performed by Anamet Inc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Charpy V-Notch Impact Test''' shows the toughness of the steel by taking different samples of the rod and done by Anamet Inc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Chemical Analysis''' was the Final Test also done by Anamet Inc. which met the requirements for that steel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Conclusion of the Case Study ====
The rods failed from hydrogen embrittlement which was susceptible to the hydrogen from the high tensile load and the hydrogen already in the material. The rods did not fail because they did not meet the requirements for strength in these rods. While they met requirements, the structure was inhomogeneous which caused different strengths and low toughness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This study shows a couple of the many ways failure analysis can be done. It always starts with a nondestructive form of observation, like a crime scene. Then pieces of the material are taken from the original piece which are used in different observations. Then destructive testing is done to find toughness and properties of the material to find exactly what went wrong.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Failure of failure analysis ===
The collapse of the Oakland Nimitz Freeway was a bridge that collapsed during an earthquake even after the program to strengthen the bridge. Different engineers were asked on their take on the situation. While some don’t blame the program or the department, like James Rogers who said that the earthquake could have “a good chance the Embarcadero would do the same thing the Nimitz did.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/21/us/experts-ask-if-anti-quake-steps-contributed-to-highway-collapse.html|title=Experts Ask if Anti-Quake Steps Contributed to Highway Collapse|last=Bishop|first=Katherine|date=1989|website=NY Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some said more prevention could’ve been done. Dr. Priestly says that “neither of the department’s projects to strengthen roadways addressed the problems of weakness…” in the bridges joints. Some experts agreed that more could’ve been done to prevent this disaster. The program is under fire for making “the failure more serious”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== From a design engineer's POV ===
[[File:F101 - T-9 Jet Engine Test Cell.ogv|thumb|Jet Engine Test Cell&lt;ref&gt;''T-9 Jet Engine Test Cell.'' Dir. Timothy Kirchner. ''Defense Visual Information Distribution Services''. DVIDS, 12 Aug. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A product needs to be able to work even in the hardest of scenarios. This is very important on products made for expensive builds such as buildings or aircraft. If these parts fail, they can cause serious damage and/or safety problems. A product starts to be designed "...to minimize the hazards associated with this "worst case scenario." Discerning the worst case scenario requires a complete understanding of the product, its loading and its service environment. Prior to the product entering service, a prototype will often undergo laboratory testing which proves the product withstands the worst case scenario as expected."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brady|first=Brian|date=1999|title=Failure Analysis|url=http://www.matscieng.sunysb.edu/disaster/fail-anal/|journal=|publisher=Department of Material Science and Engineering|publication-place=State University of New York at Stony Brook|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the tests done on jet engines today are very intensive checking if the engine can withstand:

* ingestion of debris, dust, sand, etc.;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.klm.com/how-do-we-test-jet-engines/|title=How do we Test Jet Engines?|last=Duivis|first=Rob|date=7 March 2016|website=Meanwhile at KLM|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ingestion of hail, snow, ice, etc.;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* ingestion of excessive amounts of water.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

These tests must be harder than what the product will experience in use. The engines are pushed to the max in order to ensure that the product will function the way it should no matter the condition. Failure analysis on both sides is about the prevention of damage and maintaining safety.

'''Fatimid art''' refers to Islamic artifacts and architecture from the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] (909-1171), principally in [[Egypt]] and [[North Africa]]. The Fatimid Caliphate was initially established in the [[Maghreb]], with its roots in a ninth-century [[Shia]] [[Ismailism|Ismailist]] religious movement originating in [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]].  Many monuments survive in the Fatimid cities founded in North Africa, starting with [[Mahdia]], on the [[Tunisia]]n coast, the principal city prior to the conquest of Egypt in 969 and the building of  ''al-Qahira'', the "City Victorious", now part of modern-day [[Cairo]]. The period was marked by a prosperity amongst the upper echelons, manifested in the creation of opulent and finely wrought objects in the decorative arts, including carved [[rock crystal]], [[lustreware]] and other [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wood carving|wood]] and [[ivory carving]], [[gold jewelry]] and other [[metalware]], textiles, books and coinage.  These items not only reflected personal wealth, but were used as gifts to curry favour abroad. The most precious and valuable objects were amassed in the caliphal palaces in al-Qahira. In the 1060s, following several years of drought during which the armies received no payment, the palaces were systematically looted, the libraries largely destroyed, precious gold objects melted down, with a few of the treasures dispersed across the medieval Christian world. Afterwards Fatimid artifacts continued to be made in the same style, but were adapted to a larger populace using less precious materials. 
{{cquote|In 1067-68 the great treasury of the Fatimids was ransacked when the troops rebelled and demanded to be paid. The stories of this plundering mention not only great quantities of pearls and jewels, crowns, swords, and other imperial accoutrements but also many objects in rare materials and of enormous size. Eighteen thousand pieces of rock crystal and cut glass were swiftly looted from the palace, and twice as many jewelled objects; also large numbers of gold and silver knives all richly set with jewels; valuable chess and backgammon pieces; various types of hand mirrors, skilfully decorated; six thousand perfume bottles in gilded silver; and so on. More specifically, we learn of enormous pieces of rock crystal inscribed with caliphal names; of gold animals encrusted with jewels and enamels; of a large golden palm tree; and even of a whole garden partially gilded and decorated with niello.  There was also an immensely rich treasury of furniture, carpets, curtains, and wall coverings, many embroidered in gold, often with designs incorporating birds and quadrupeds, kings and their notables, and even a whole range of geographical vistas.Relatively few of these objects have survived, most of them very small; but the finest are impressive enough to lend substance to the vivid picture painted in the historical accounts of this vanished world of luxury. |4={{harvtxt|Ettinghausen|Grabar|Jenkins|2001}}}}

==Rock crystal ewers==
Rock crystal ewers are pitchers carved from a single block of [[Quartz|rock crystal]]. They were made by Islamic [[Fatimid]] artisans and are considered to be amongst the rarest objects in [[Islamic art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://simerg.com/literary-readings/literary-reading-fatimid-rock-crystal-ewers-most-valuable-objects-in-islamic-art/ Fatimid Rock Crystal Ewers, Most Valuable Objects in Islamic Art]&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few that survived and are now in collections across Europe. They are often in cathedral treasuries, where they were rededicated after being captured from their original Islamic settings. Made in Egypt in the late 10th century, the ewer pictured is exquisitely decorated with fantastic birds, beasts and twisting tendrils. The Treasure of Caliph Mostansir-Billah at [[Cairo]], which was destroyed in 1062, apparently contained 1800 rock crystal vessels.

Great skill was required to hollow out the raw rock crystal without breaking it and to carve the delicate, often very shallow, decoration.

==Fatimid architecture==
{{main article|Fatimid architecture}}
In architecture, the [[Fatimid]]s followed [[Tulunid]] techniques and used similar materials, but also developed those of their own. In [[Cairo]], their first congregational mosque was [[al-Azhar mosque]] ("the splendid") founded along with the city (969–973), which, together with its adjacent institution of higher learning ([[al-Azhar University]]), became the spiritual center for [[Ismaili|Ismaili Shia]]. The Mosque of al-Hakim (r. 996–1013), an important example of Fatimid architecture and architectural decoration, played a critical role in [[Fatimid]] ceremonial and procession, which emphasized the religious and political role of the [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]]. Besides elaborate funerary monuments, other surviving Fatimid structures include the [[Aqmar Mosque]] (1125)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=INsmT6zjAl8C&amp;pg=PA72 Doris Behrens-Abouseif (1992), ''Islamic Architecture in Cairo: An Introduction'', BRILL, p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the monumental gates for Cairo's [[Defensive wall|city walls]] commissioned by the powerful [[Fatimid]] [[emir]] and [[vizier]] [[Badr al-Jamali]] (r. 1073–1094).

[[File:Wiki-frot1.png|thumb|200px|Frot: two men rubbing their penises together to create sexual sensations]]
'''Frot''' ([[slang]] for [[Non-penetrative sex#Frottage|frottage]]; ult. from the French verb ''frotter'', "to rub") is a [[non-penetrative sex|non-penetrative]] form of [[Men who have sex with men|male to male sexual activity]] that usually involves direct [[Human penis|penis]]-to-penis contact.&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;{{cite book | author =Joe Perez|title=Rising Up|isbn=1411691733|publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu.com]]|year=2006|pages=190–192|accessdate=March 24, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/?id=caJ7gPv0DrAC&amp;pg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advocate.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=The New Sex Police|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=2005-04-12|accessdate=2011-02-12|pages=39–40, 42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mGMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized by [[gay]] male activists who disparaged the practice of [[anal sex]],&lt;ref name="Perez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Advocate.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gaytoday.badpuppy.com&gt;{{cite web| last = Nichols| first = Jack| title = Interview: Cockrub Warrior Bill Weintraub| publisher = Gay Today|url =http://gaytoday.badpuppy.com/garchive/interview/120400in.htm| accessdate =April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since evolved to encompass a variety of preferences for the act, which may or may not imply particular attitudes towards other [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]]. Owing to its non-penetrative character, frot has the [[safe sex]] advantage of minimizing the transmission risk for [[HIV/AIDS]]; however, it still carries the risk of skin-to-skin [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]], such as [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]] and [[Crab louse|pubic lice]] (crabs), both of which can be transmitted even when lesions are not visible.&lt;ref name="aids.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Risk Factors|publisher=[[AIDS.gov]]|accessdate=June 8, 2012|url=http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/prevention/reduce-your-risk/sexual-risk-factors/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dianne Hales|title=An Invitation to Health Brief 2010-2011| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2008|accessdate=August 29, 2013|pages =269–271| isbn = 0495391921|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and etymology==
''[[Genital-genital rubbing|Genital-genital (GG) rubbing]]'' is sexual activity in which there is rubbing contact between the genitals, in the same naming convention as ''genital-anal sex'' and ''genital-oral sex.'' This type of sexual intimacy is not restricted to humans. ''GG rubbing'' is a term frequently used by [[Primatology|primatologists]] to describe [[Tribadism#Among female bonobos|the act among female bonobos]],&lt;ref name="de Waal FB, 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bonobo Sex and Society |last=de Waal |first=Frans B. M. |authorlink=Frans de Waal |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=272 |issue=3 |pages=58–88 |date=March 1995 |pmid=7871411 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0395-82 |url=http://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/uploads/media/Bonobo_sex_01.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=21 December 2011 |quote=They also practice so-called penis-fencing, in which two males hang face to face from a branch while rubbing their erect penises together. ...Perhaps the bonobo's most typical sexual pattern, undocumented in any other primate, is genito-genital rubbing (or GG rubbing) between adult females.

The modern definition of ''frot'' emerged in a context of a debate about the status of anal sex within the gay male community; some in the anti-anal, pro-frot camp insist that anal sex ought to be avoided altogether.&lt;ref name="Advocate.com"/&gt; One view argued that the popularity of anal sex would decline, presumably with a corresponding drop in HIV rates, if gay men could somehow be persuaded to stop thinking of anal sex as a "[[Vanilla sex|vanilla]]" practice, but rather as something "kinky" and not-quite-respectable—as was the case in the 1950s and 1960s, when gay men who preferred to do only [[mutual masturbation]] and [[fellatio]] sometimes used the disparaging slang term ''brownie queen'' for aficionados of anal sex.&lt;ref name=gaytoday.badpuppy.com/&gt;

Gay activist Bill Weintraub began to heavily promote and recommend the gender-specific meaning of "penis-to-penis rubbing" as ''frot'' on Internet forums sometime in the late 1990s, and said he coined the term. "I don't use the word 'frottage,' because it is an ersatz French word which can indicate any sort of erotic rubbing," he stated. "Frot, by contrast, is always phallus-to-phallus sex." Weintraub believes that is what actual sex is – genital-genital contact.&lt;ref name="Piepenburg"&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik|last=Piepenburg|title=What's Rub Got to Do With it?|publisher=''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]''|date=February 2006|accessdate=2011-02-18|pages=74 and 76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2IEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Frottage+has+almost+achieved+mythic+status+in+an+academic+context.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b2-ZUPGKA9POyAHgyIHgCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Frottage%20has%20almost%20achieved%20mythic%20status%20in%20an%20academic%20context.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative terms for frot include ''frictation'', which can refer to the wider meaning of ''[[Non-penetrative sex#Frottage|frottage]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Aaron's Dictionary of Gay Terms, F | work = | publisher = | url = http://www.aaronsgayinfo.com/AlphaMenu/Fterms.html

==Sexual practices==
{{See also|Gay sexual practices}}

===General===
Frot can be enjoyable because it mutually and simultaneously stimulates the genitals of both partners as it tends to produce pleasurable friction against the [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]] nerve bundle on the underside of each man's penile shaft, just below the [[External urethral orifice (male)|urinary opening]] (meatus) of the penis [[glans penis|head]] (glans penis).

===Safe sex===
Since frot is a non-penetrative sex act, the risk of passing a [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI/STD) that requires direct contact between the [[mucous membrane]]s and [[pre-ejaculate]] or [[semen]] is reduced. [[HIV]] is among the infections that require such direct contact, and research indicates that there is no risk of HIV transmission via frot.&lt;ref name="aids.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kelly | first = Jeffrey A | title = Advances in HIV/AIDS education and prevention | journal = Family Relations
 | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 345–352 | date = October 1995 | doi = 10.2307/584989 | publisher = National Council on Family Relations | jstor = 584989 | issn = 0197-6664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, frot can still transmit other sexually transmitted infections, such as [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]] (which can cause [[genital wart]]s) and [[Crab louse|pubic lice]] (crabs).&lt;ref name="aids.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt; [[HPV vaccine|Vaccines are available]] against HPV.

===Comparison with anal sex and debates===
Some gay men, or [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) in general, prefer to engage in frot or other forms of [[mutual masturbation]] because they find it more pleasurable or more affectionate than [[anal sex]], to preserve [[technical virginity]], or as [[safe sex]] alternatives to anal penetration.&lt;ref name="Perez"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Advocate.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="Virgin"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Joseph Gross|title = Like a Virgin|id = 0001-8996|work=The Advocate|publisher=Here Publishing|year=2003|pages=44–45|accessdate=2011-03-12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eWQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Gay+men+who+prefer+anal+sex#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson and Johnson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gay Perspective: Things Our Homosexuality Tells Us about the Nature of God &amp; the Universe|isbn = 1-59021-015-8|publisher=[[Lethe Press]]|year=2008|page=139|accessdate=2011-02-12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LPyhsuVbUlAC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author1=Edwin Clark Johnson |author2=Toby Johnson }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Underwood"&gt;{{cite book | author =Steven Gregory Underwood|title =Gay men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles|isbn = 1-56023-375-3|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=4|accessdate=2011-02-12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i4wRl0_8NuUC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; This preference has led to some debate in the gay male and MSM community regarding what constitutes "real sex" or the most sensual expression of sexual intimacy. Some frot advocates consider "two genitals coming together by mingling, caressing, sliding" and rubbing to be sex more than other forms of male sexual activity.&lt;ref name="Perez"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gaytoday.badpuppy.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="out.com"/&gt; Other men who have sex with men associate male masculinity with the sexual positions of "tops" and "bottoms" during anal sex.&lt;ref name="Harvey, Wenzel, and Sprecher"&gt;{{cite book |author1=John H.

During anal sex, the insertive partner may be referred to as the ''[[Top, bottom and versatile#Top|top]]'' or ''active'' partner. The one being penetrated may be referred to as the ''[[Top, bottom and versatile#Bottom|bottom]]'' or ''passive'' partner. Preference for either is referred to as ''[[Top, bottom and versatile#Versatile|versatile]]''.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Role+versatility+among+men+who+have+sex+with+men+in+urban+Peru.-a0168586762] Role versatility among men who have sex with men in urban Peru. In: ''The Journal of Sex Research,'' August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some frot advocates insist that such roles introduce inequality during sexual intimacy, and that frot is "equal" because of mutual genital-genital stimulation. The lack of mutual genital stimulation and role asymmetry has led other frot advocates to denounce anal sex as degrading to the receptive partner.&lt;ref name="Perez"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Advocate.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=gaytoday.badpuppy.com /&gt;&lt;ref name="out.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Dolby|title=Why Some Gay Men Don't Go All The Way|publisher=''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]''|date=February 2004|accessdate=2011-02-12|pages=76–77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jmIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of dominance and inequality associated with sex roles is disputed by researchers who state that it is not clear that specific sexual acts are necessarily indicative of general patterns of masculinity or dominance in a gay male relationship, and that, for both partners, anal intercourse can be associated with being masculine.&lt;ref name="Harvey, Wenzel, and Sprecher"/&gt; Additionally, some frot advocates, such as Bill Weintraub, are concerned with diseases that may be acquired through anal sex.&lt;ref name=Perez/&gt;&lt;ref name=gaytoday.badpuppy.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite book | author =Edward C. Green|title =Broken Promises: How the AIDS Establishment Has Betrayed the Developing World|isbn =1-936227-00-2|publisher=PoliPointPress|year=2011|pages=273 pages|accessdate=March 24, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AXLzKLqg4IC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Bill%20Weintraub%20anal%20sex&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 article in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', one anal sex opponent said that no longer showing anal sex as erotic would help avoid [[HIV/AIDS]], and opined that some gay men perceived him to be antigay when he was only trying to keep gay and bisexual men alive and healthy.&lt;ref name=Advocate.com/&gt;

The view that anal sex is something that should be discouraged is not supported by all frot supporters. Author Joe Perez states that Weintraub and his followers have "gone overboard" in their enthusiasm for frot by claiming that supporting frot means disowning anal sex or that the latter is "inherently degrading, unnatural, or disease-spreading." He says Weintraub and his supporters' views should be taken "with a grain of salt if you can" and that he hopes for more inclusive frot communities.&lt;ref name="Perez"/&gt;

Gay men, and MSM in general, who prefer anal sex may view it as "[their] version of intercourse"&lt;ref name="dailyuw.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Celia |last=Hunko |title=Anal sex: Let's get to the bottom of this |publisher=''[[The Daily of the University of Washington]]'' |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=April 26, 2010 |url=http://dailyuw.com/2009/2/6/anal-sex-lets-get-bottom/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20100428073805/http://dailyuw.com/2009/2/6/anal-sex-lets-get-bottom/ |archivedate=April 28, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as "the natural apex of sex, a wonderful expression of intimacy, and a great source of pleasure".&lt;ref name="Johnson and Johnson"/&gt; Psychologist Walt Odets said, "I think that anal sex has for gay men the same emotional significance that vaginal sex has for heterosexuals."&lt;ref name=Advocate.com/&gt; The act is generally viewed as [[vanilla sex]] among MSM,&lt;ref name ="Gay vanilla sex"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bell |first1=Robin |date=13 February 1999 |title=Homosexual men and women |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=318 |issue=7181 |pages=452–5 |doi=10.1136/bmj.318.7181.452 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/318/7181/452 |accessdate=9 November 2011 |pmid=9974466 |pmc=1114912}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often thought to be expected, even by MSM who do not prefer the act.&lt;ref name="out.com"/&gt; "Some people like [anal] because it seems taboo or naughty," stated author and sex therapist Jack Morin. "Some people like the flavor of dominance and submission... some don’t."&lt;ref name=dailyuw.com/&gt;

MSM who defend the essential validity of anal sex have rejected claims made by radical frot advocates. Others have at times disparaged frottage as a makeshift, second-rate form of male/male intimacy—something better left to inexperienced teenagers and "closeted" older men.&lt;ref name="Piepenburg"/&gt; Odets said, "No one would propose that we initiate a public health measure by de-eroticizing vaginal sex. It would sound like a ridiculous idea. It's no less ridiculous for gay men."&lt;ref name=Advocate.com/&gt;

''[[The Huffington Post]]'' contributor and [[Sexology|sexologist]] [[Joe Kort]] proposed the term ''side'' for gay men who are not interested in anal sex and instead prefer "to kiss, hug and engage in oral sex, rimming, mutual masturbation and rubbing up and down on each other", viewing "sides" as simply another gay male sexual preference akin to being a top, bottom or versatile, and adding that "Whether a man enjoys anal sex or not is no reflection on his sexual orientation, and if he's gay, it doesn't define whether or not he's 'really' having sex."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-kort-phd/guys-on-the-side-looking-beyond-gay-tops-and-bottoms_b_3082484.html Guys on the 'Side': Looking Beyond Gay Tops and Bottoms] huffingtonpost.com Retrieved 2-13-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 survey of gay and bisexual men by the ''[[Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' found that out of over 1,300 different combinations of sexual acts practiced, the most common, at 16% of all encounters, to be "holding their partner romantically, kissing partner on mouth, solo masturbation, masturbating partner, masturbation by partner, and genital–genital contact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02438.x | volume=8 | title=Sexual Behaviors and Situational Characteristics of Most Recent Male‐Partnered Sexual Event among Gay and Bisexually Identified Men in the United States | year=2011 | journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine | pages=3040–3050 | last1 = Rosenberger | first1 = Joshua G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genital-genital rubbing has been observed between males of other animals as well. The homosexual activities of [[bonobo]]s are of special interest because of their genetic closeness to humans; and like humans, their [[Libido|sex drive]]s are not reproductively-driven.&lt;ref name="de Waal FB, 1995"/&gt; Among bonobos, frottage frequently occurs when two males hang from a tree limb and engage in penis fencing; it also occurs while two males are in [[missionary position]].&lt;ref name="de Waal FB, 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name=penisfencing&gt;{{cite book|author= Frans B. M. de Waal |authorlink= Frans de Waal| title=The ape and the sushi master : cultural reflections by a primatologist|publisher=Basic Books|chapter=Bonobos and Fig Leaves|year= 2001|isbn= 84-493-1325-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a special form of frottage called ''rump rubbing'' in which males stand back to back on all fours and rub their genito-anal regions together.

Frot-like genital rubbing between non-primate males has been observed among bull [[manatee]]s, in conjunction with "kissing". When engaging in genital-genital rubbing, male [[bottlenose dolphin]]s often penetrate the [[genital slit]] or, less commonly, the anus. Penis-to-penis rubbing is also common among [[List of mammals displaying homosexual behavior|homosexually active mammals]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Bagemihl|Bagemihl, Bruce]].

Meffe, C. Ronald Carroll and Contributors. ''Principles of Conservation Biology'' (3rd ed.). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer.&lt;/ref&gt; is a tool used in [[wildlife conservation]] to identify gaps in conservation lands (e.g., [[protected area]]s and [[nature reserve]]s) or other wildlands where significant plant and animal species and their habitat or important ecological features  occur. 

Conservation managers or scientists can use it as a basis for providing recommendations to improve the representativeness of nature reserves or the effectiveness of protected areas so that these areas provide the best value for conserving [[biodiversity|biological diversity]]. With the information that a gap analysis yields, the boundaries of protected areas may be designed to subsume 'gaps' containing significant populations of wildlife species that can enhance the long-term survival of a larger [[metapopulation]] of the species already within the managed or protected area, or to include a diversity of wildlife species or [[ecosystem]]s that merit protection but are inadequately represented in an existing protected area network. Gap assessments can be done using the [[geographic information system]]: land maps that delineate topography, biological and geological features ([[forest cover]], plains, rivers, etc.), boundaries, land ownership and use are overlaid with the distribution of wildlife species. How much of the species' distribution fall within or without the conservation lands, or within a highly exploited area etc. can be identified.


At its simplest, a gap analysis is an assessment of the extent to which a protected area system meets protection goals set by a nation or region to represent its biological diversity. Gap analyses can vary from simple exercises based on a spatial comparison of biodiversity with existing protected areas to complex studies that need detailed data gathering and analysis, mapping and use of software decision packages. All gap analyses should consider a range of different “gaps” in a protected area network:


'''Representation gaps:''' either no representations of a particular species or ecosystem in any protected area, or not enough examples of the species or ecosystem represented to ensure long-term protection.

'''Ecological gaps:''' while the species or ecosystem occurs in the protected area system, occurrence is either of inadequate ecological condition, or the protected area(s) fail to address species'' movements or specific ecological conditions needed for long-term survival or ecosystem functioning.

'''Management gaps:''' protected areas exist but management regimes (management objectives, governance types, or management effectiveness) do not provide full security for particular species or ecosystems given local conditions.

[[Image:Spartina alterniflora.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''[[Spartina alterniflora]]'' ([[cordgrass]]), a halophyte.]]

A '''halophyte''' is a salt-tolerant [[plant]] that grows in waters of high [[salinity]], coming into contact with saline water through its roots or by salt spray, such as in saline semi-deserts, [[mangrove]] swamps, marshes and sloughs and seashores. These plants do not prefer saline environments but because of their ability to cope with high salinity in various ways they face much less competition in these areas. The word derives from Ancient Greek ἅλας (halas) 'salt' and φυτόν (phyton) 'plant'. An example of a halophyte is the salt marsh grass ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]'' (smooth cordgrass). Relatively few plant species are halophytes—perhaps only 2% of all plant species.

The large majority of plant species are '''glycophytes''', which are not salt-tolerant and are damaged fairly easily by high salinity.&lt;ref name="Glenn99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glenn | first1 = E. P. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1999 | title = Salt tolerance and crop potential of halophytes | url = | journal = Critical Review in Plant Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 227–55 | doi = 10.1080/07352689991309207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Halophytes can be classified in many ways. According to '''Stocker''' (1933), it is mainly of 3 kinds, viz.

1. '''Aqua-halines'''
*''Emerged Halophytes'' (most of the stem remains above the water level)
*''Hydro-halophytes'' (whole or almost whole plant remains under water)
2. '''Terrestro-halines'''
*''Hygro-halophytes'' (grow on swamp lands)
*''Mesohalophytes'' (grow on non-swamp, non-dry lands)
*''Xero-halophytes'' (grow on dry or mostly dry lands)
3. '''Aero-halines'''


Again, according to '''Iversen''' (1936), these plants are classified with respect to the salinity of the soil on which they grow.

1. '''Oligo-halophytes''' (amount of [[NaCl]] in the soil is 0.01 to 0.1%)

2. '''Meso-halophytes''' (amount of NaCl in the soil is 0.1 to 1%)

3. '''Euhalophytes''' (amount of NaCl in the soil is &gt;1%)&lt;ref name=''Halophytes: Classification and Characters of Halophytes''&gt;{{cite web | title=Halophytes: Classification and Characters of Halophytes | url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/plants/halophytes-classification-and-characters-of-halophytes-with-diagram/6932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Salt tolerance ==
One quantitative measure of salt tolerance ([[halotolerance]]) is the total dissolved solids in irrigation water that a plant can tolerate. [[Seawater]] typically contains 40&amp;nbsp;grams per litre (g/l) of dissolved salts (mostly [[sodium chloride]]). [[Beans]] and [[rice]] can tolerate about 1–3 g/l, and are considered glycophytes (as are most [[crop plant]]s). At the other extreme, ''[[Salicornia bigelovii]]'' (dwarf glasswort) grows well at 70 g/l of dissolved solids, and is a promising halophyte for use as a crop. 
&lt;ref&gt;
Glenn, E. P.; Brown, J. J.; O'Leary, J. W. (1998). [http://www.miracosta.edu/home/kmeldahl/writing/..%5Carticles/crops.pdf "Irrigating Crops with Seawater",] ''[http://www.sciam.com Scientific American]'', Vol. 279, no. 8, Aug. 1998, pp. 56-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants such as barley (''[[Hordeum vulgare]]'') and the date palm (''[[Phoenix dactylifera]]'') can tolerate about 5 g/l, and can be considered as marginal halophytes.&lt;ref name="Glenn99" /&gt;

Adaptation to saline environments by halophytes may take the form of salt tolerance or salt avoidance. Plants that avoid the effects of high salt even though they live in a saline environment may be referred to as facultative halophytes rather than 'true', or obligatory, halophytes.[[File:Pneumatophore overkill - grey mangrove.JPG|thumb|320px|right|[[Pneumatophores]] of [[Grey mangrove]]]]

For example, a short-lived plant species that completes its reproductive life cycle during periods (such as a [[rainy season]]) when the salt concentration is low would be avoiding salt rather than tolerating it. Or a plant species may maintain a 'normal' internal salt concentration by excreting excess salts through its leaves, by way of a [[hydathode]], or by concentrating salts in leaves that later die and drop off.

In an effort to improve agricultural production in regions where crops are exposed to salinity, research is focused on improving understanding of the various mechanisms whereby plants respond to salinity stress, so that more robust crop halophytes may be developed.  Adaptive responses to salinity stress have been identified at molecular, cellular, metabolic, and physiological levels.&lt;ref name=Gupta-2014&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijg/2014/701596/| title=Mechanism of Salinity Tolerance in Plants: Physiological, Biochemical, and Molecular Characterization| first1=Bhaskar| last1=Gupta| first2=Bingru| last2=Huang| journal=[[International Journal of Genomics]]| doi=10.1155/2014/701596| date=3 April 2014| accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Some halophytes are:
*''[[Anemopsis californica]]'' (''yerba mansa'', lizard tail)
*''[[Atriplex]]'' (saltbush, orache, orach)
*''[[Attalea speciosa]]'' (babassu)
*''[[Panicum virgatum]]'' (switchgrass)
*''[[Salicornia]] bigelovii'' (dwarf glasswort, pickleweed)
*''[[Spartina alterniflora]]'' (smooth cordgrass)
*''[[Tetragonia tetragonoides]]'' (warrigal greens, ''kōkihi'', sea spinach)

==As biofuel==
{{Main|Biofuel}}

Some halophytes are being studied for use as "3rd-generation" biofuel precursors.

Due to various differences in cultural histories and environmental [[resources]], [[West African]] nations developed [[glass]] traditions distinct from [[Egypt]], [[North Africa]] and the rest of the world. The presence of glass in Sub-Saharan Africa mostly consists of the importation of [[glass beads]] shipped primarily from the [[Middle East]] and [[India]]n as early as 200-300AD; later, from [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Venice]].

As most African cultures have long histories of crafting and adornment with beads made from [[wood]], [[bone]] and [[exoskeleton|shell]], the introduction of glass as a bead material was widely and rapidly received.  The exchange of glass beads for local [[good (economics)|goods]] such as [[ivory]], [[gold]] and [[slaves]] aided in the accumulation of [[wealth]] and creation of unequal power dynamics still apparent today.&lt;ref name=Dubin&gt;Dubin 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Archaeological]] evidence, primarily from various burial sites from the West and coastal port cities in the East, confirm the [[import]] of hundreds of thousands of glass beads.4 &lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;&lt;ref name=david&gt;Davidson 1972&lt;/ref&gt; 3 These assemblages boast rich varieties in [[shape]], [[colour]], [[Surface texture|texture]] and [[Pattern#Visual|patterning]].  While most Sub-Saharan glass was imported as pre-formed beads, there is evidence of the importation of glass fragments and [[ingots]] to be used in local beadmaking practices.5 Preliminary excavations also exhibit evidence of indigenous glass production from raw materials, a [[technology]] previously thought unknown to this region of the world.6 4, recent evidence has shown that glass making has been started separate from the general glass trade centuries before European and Arab contact &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/glass-africa-made-before-european-arrival-colonialisation-advanced-technology-a8168601.html|title=Glass was made in Africa centuries before arrival of Europeans|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural and Historical Significance==

===Symbolism===

As subsistence-level herding was common throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa, bead adornment was an apt medium for self and cultural expression; whereas a more permanent art form would have proven impractical.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  Through various bead shape formations, colouring choices and assemblage methods, individuals were able to express complex information which was particularly useful in the absence of written language.  Notions such as age, marital status and relative economic wealth were communicated through careful selection of symbolic glass beads.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  The remelting and reworking of existing beads also suggests that the shape and style of glass beads held specific cultural values; various regions were able to imitate more favourable foreign styles, create unique forms or produce much larger beads than what was available through international trade, effectively expressing local distinctiveness.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; 7 8  Glass beads also provided a means of connecting with ones ancestors.  Known as Heirloom beads, these beads were typically translucent, resembling wax, having a discoid shape and usually could be dated back to the middle and late Iron Age.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;  Whether strung as jewellery, attached to clothing or stored unassembled, Heirloom beads were extremely prized and often passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; Additionally, glass beads have been linked to a number of religious and symbolic practices, primarily as offerings to deities at sacred locations and constructed shrines.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt; 4

===Beads as Economic Wealth===

Glass beads in Sub-Saharan regions were used as an economic tool, denoting wealth and political power.  Yoruba kings, or Obas, often encouraged complicated and abundant glass beadworking as a visual symbol of their nation’s wealth.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;   Production of beads in great quantities could also be offered by Obas to various deities as a symbol of appreciation of such granted political and economic power.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  Aje Ilekes, discs of melted cullet (recycled material) glass with beads embedded, were produced by intentionally destroying and remelting glass beads, serving as a status symbol of power and wealth.  Aje Ilekes are still used today as a monetary system, often exchanged as wedding dowry.4  In the archaeological record it is common to find numerous glass beads and beadworking tools such as stone anvils and crucibles included in burial sites suggesting the objects’ cultural and economic importance.4

==Importation and Trade==

===Early Chronology===

Attempts to determine date and origin of glass beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa have been made with varying success.  It is generally agreed that glass beads were present in the Sub-Saharan world by at least 300AD, having been imported from the Middle East and South East Asian regions.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  Transported by sea, shipments arrived to coastal ports such as Mtwapa and Ungwana in Kenya and were then distributed inland via local trade networks and kinship relations.3 On land, glass bead cargos travelled through North Africa south to areas such as Gao in Mali, as well as Nigeria, Ghana and Benin.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  The expansion of the Roman Empire helped to broaden trade patterns and the introduction of the camel as means of transport significantly fostered the spread of imported goods.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; European nations entered the African trading market, beginning with Portugal, Italy and Bohemia in the 15th century, followed by the Dutch, English, French, Belgians and Germans.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  By the 17th century, the Netherlands managed to secure an impressive monopoly on the glass bead exchange with Sub-Saharan Africa.  A Dutch merchant and entrepreneur named Sir Nicholas Crisp is recorded to have been awarded a patent “for the sole making and vending of beads and beugles to trade to Guinea,” in 1632.7

===Trade Wind Beads===

During the Medieval Period, trade of a particular style of glass bead, the Trade Wind bead, dominated the market.  These beads ranged in colour and length but could be mass-produced.3 Termed “Trade Wind beads” due to the use of monsoon winds for navigation, these beads were shipped throughout the Indian Ocean Trading Complex, especially to East, West and South African coastal ports.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  3   India and Sri Lanka contributed greatly to the exchange of Trade Wind beads though it has been disputed whether these countries also partook in the primary production of glass used for such beads. The mineral soda-alumina (abbreviated m-Na-Al or mNa) chemical composition of most Trade Wind Beads found in Sub-Saharan regions suggests a connection to the mineral-soda sources and alumina rich sand ubiquitous in India; however, there is no archaeological evidence to support this hypothesis to date.3 Other analysts propose a Middle Eastern, Venetian and/or Portuguese origin for the Trade Wind beads found in Sub-Saharan regions.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;

===Slave Beads===
{{main article|Trade beads}}

European nations became increasingly involved in the glass bead trade with Africa which consequently aided in the foreign exploitation of natural resources, including slaves.  Because Westerners viewed Africans as “the uncivilised of the World,”7 glass beads known crudely as “slave beads” were commonly exchanged for human cargo which could then be shipped and traded for other desired goods.  The residual effects from the glass bead trade had dramatically varying results across Sub-Saharan Africa.  While most regions suffered economic and social hardship due to abusive foreign monopolies, some nations prospered from this interaction.  Coastal ports serving as initial points of contact often benefited from access to imported goods, reaping profits from their own subsequent distribution to regions inland.  Scholars have suggested that the rise of Empires in Ghana and Mali between the 8th-13th centuries, as well as the Kingdoms of Benin and Akan during the 16th century are intrinsically related to the access and distribution of foreign glass beads.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;  3 5

==Bead Manufacture==

===Glass Manufacture: Primary and Secondary Glass Production===

Primary glass production involves the combination of the raw materials Soda, Lime and Silica, heated at specific temperatures in order to produce a basic glass compound (see Glass and Anglo-Saxon Glass).  Traditionally, glass has been made from either the mixture of ground quartz stones (providing the silica) and plant ash (supplying the soda and lime elements); or, by utilizing sand as a silica and lime source and then adding a chemical natron for the remaining soda needed.  The production of primary glass has seen much variation throughout its history, each region slightly altering the chemical composition to better suit its particularly environmental and cultural needs (i.e. adding various fluxes/chemical additives in order to lower the required melting temperature).  The addition of mineral deposits to alter the colour of glass can be carried out in the primary stage or can be added in later stages of production. The secondary production of glass typically involves processes of colouring, remelting, shaping and decorating of the glass object.  While some archaeological evidence suggests the concurrence of both primary and secondary glass production at the same site, in the case of glass beads these processes often occurred separately.  As access to premade glass and foreign colorants increased, beadmaking from imported goods developed into a technology which could be conducted in virtually any location across the globe.10

===Beadworking===
{{main article|Glass beadmaking}}

The production of beads from imported glass shards, cullet (scraps) and undesired glass beads has a lively presence in Sub-Saharan history.  Imported glass was either formed by melting such imported glass, potentially adding desired colorants, and then shaping the melt into a bead form; or, by grinding down the imported glass to form a powder which would then be shaped, heated and cooled.  The archaeological evidence of beadworking in Sub-Saharan Africa provides examples of both types.5 9 &lt;ref name=david/&gt;

===Wound Glass Beads===

With melted glass working, beads found were generally formed by either a wound, drawn or moulded process.  Wound glass beads, also known as Tubular, Cylindrical, Spherical or Melon-Shaped, were formed by folding molten glass around a metal rod called a mandrel.  Once the glass had cooled slightly, the material was slipped off the mandrel and pinched and prodded until it reached a desired shape.9&lt;ref name=david/&gt;

===Drawn Glass Beads===

Also known as Cane beads, Drawn beads were formed by dipping an iron blowpipe into molten glass and slightly blowing air through the pipe, allowing for a “gather,” or hollow glass ball, to form at the end.  A rod called a ‘puntil’ was used to pull the gather into a longer, hollow form which would then cool and be broken into individual beads.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; As glassblowing technology did not exist in early Sub-Saharan African regions, locally produced drawn beads were made by trapping air bubbles in molten glass and then drawing the glass into a cane form.8

===Moulded Glass Beads===

Little evidence of beads produced from moulds are found in Sub-Saharan Africa,&lt;ref name=david/&gt; however it is understood that beads of this form were produced by dropping molten glass into a preformed open clay mould and then “punched” with a core to take on the mould’s form.  Holes could then be drilled through moulded beads or, beads produced from half moulds could then be adhered together.9

===Powder Glass Beads===
{{main article|Powder glass beads}}

The glass beads of Sub-Saharan Africa that were not melted from pre-existing glass material were instead formed by grinding glass into a fine powder to be worked further.  Sources for such glass included scraps from broken glass bottles, cullets (recycled glass) or pre-existing glass beads which were no longer wanted.  The grinding process generally caused colouring to be lost; therefore, various pigments were often added at this stage (see the colouring section below).  After the desired colour was achieved, powdered glass was either worked in its dry form or was wetted with water or saliva to create a paste.  This paste was next formed by hand into various bead shapes.  Powder Glass Beads were then heated, allowed to cool and finally, polished.8 Garden Roller beads, such as the Bodom beads of Ghana.8 were the earliest form of  powder glass beads found, made by threading glass in a mould with a mandrel.  This process was extremely labour-intensive and expensive as the mould used was unable to be reused.8 More common were the Kiffa beads, typically associated with Mauritania.  These beads were produced from the wet-form of powder glass production, and have been found since the 8th century.  The paste produced in wet-form production was shaped into a bead using frames typically made of leaves of grass and then were decorated and coloured using a needle.8

===Lapidary Beads===

Though technically made from glass, the lapidary style of bead production is more akin to stone working than proper glass manufacturing.  This process involved the recycling of imported glass by chipping, knapping, drilling and polishing pieces to a desired bead form.  Evidence from areas outside of Ile-Ife, Nigeria suggests that individuals scavenged for discarded glass remains from earlier burial sites at Olokun Grove.  Glass remains that had been brought to the upper soil layers (either naturally or via “mining”) were collected and worked to produce new glass beads.4

===Colouring===

Colouring of glass could either be achieved by adding bits of pre-existing coloured glass, such as bottle shards or beads, by adding scrap metals, or by adding mineral pigments directly.9 The beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa generally contained the following pigment sources: Red was achieved by adding small amounts of metallic copper.  The presence of Iron could also produce a red colour, as well as form green and brown tones.3 &lt;ref name=david/&gt; When copper was present and cooled in an oxidizing atmosphere (i.e. great exposure to oxygen) glass could achieve a blue-green colour.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; To get a clear blue colour cobalt was often used.3 To produce a purple colour manganese was added, and in the right environments manganese was also used as a decolouring agent.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;  Yellow and opaque white were created by the addition of antimony and lead or tin and lead and if a stronger orange colour was desired zinc was then added as well.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;  While the colouring of imported glass certainly took place in local Sub-Saharan beadworking sites, this does not imply that the minerals utilized came from local sources.  Many glass pigments were most likely imported from abroad to Sub-Saharan beadworking sites.3

===Beadworking Sites===

Archaeological evidence, coupled with historical documentation and oral tradition provide evidence of numerous Sub-Saharan beadmaking sites.  Found Nupe beads from Nigeria suggest native individuals produced beads from scrap glass and bottles.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; Remains from the Ashanti region in Ghana imply beadmaking from moulds using imported powdered glass.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;  Sites such as Gao, Mali and Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria provide evidence for the production of Carnelian Bead.  It is not known whether the Carnelian was a local material; however, bead production has been confirmed due to the discovery of lumps of imported raw glass and other glassworking equipment.5 Mapungbwe, South Africa provides another example of beadmaking.  This site dates between 600-1200AD and contains evidence of glass working from pulverized bottles, ingots and other beads.&lt;ref name=Dubin/&gt;

===Primary Production Evidence===

The most conclusive archaeological evidence for the primary production of glass in Sub-Saharan Africa comes from Ile-Ife, Nigeria, though finds in Gao, Mali, Benin and Ghana also support such inferences.4 Crucibles with glass layering and exterior vitrification indicative of production from raw materials prompted further compositional analysis.  Archaeologist concluded that the glass found in the crucibles of Ile-Ife had a uniquely high percentage of lime and alumina compounds,4 a glass formula known only to exist in Korea.  Importation of glass from Korea can be ruled out as this area only produced small quantities of glass, supplies no evidence of glass bead production and mainly only experimented with glazing.4 European, Middle Eastern, Indian and Chinese origins for the glass found at Ile-Ife can also be excluded as none of these traditions produced glass high in both lime and alumina.4 It has been suggested that this unique high-lime, high alumina glass could represent an entirely new glass making technology6 in which the alkali (soda) and alumina were derived from separate mineral sources.  The lime source would also have been added separately; most probably in the form of limestone, marble or shell.6 These proposed sources for lime, native to Nigeria and other Sub-Saharan regions, comprise a novel yet plausible primary production process.  Neighbouring areas, such as the sites at Ita Yemoo and Igbo-Ukwu, contain glass working evidence such as crucibles, cullets, and beads, all with high-lime, high-alumina glass compositions suggesting the secondary production of glass imported from Ile-Ife.4 Whether primary production technology was learned and transferred from abroad or locally invented is unknown.  Most reasonably, the presence of imported glass beads pre-existed primary production technology which was later developed through processes of trial and error.4 6 The invention of glass distinctive to Sub-Saharan Africa could have been spurred due to a shortage of imported glass beads as material accessibility and supply often directed the course of glass production technology throughout the course of history (See History of Glass).

'''Hyperreality''', in [[semiotics]] and [[postmodernism]], is an inability of [[consciousness]] to distinguish [[reality]] from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced postmodern [[Society|societies]]. Hyperreality is seen as a condition in which what is real and what is fiction are seamlessly blended together so that there is no clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins.&lt;ref name="Tiffin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tiffin|first=John|author2=Nobuyoshi Terashima|title=Paradigm for the third millennium|journal=Hyperreality|year=2005|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows the co-mingling of physical [[reality]] with [[virtual reality]] (VR) and [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]] with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).&lt;ref name="Tiffin" /&gt; Individuals may find themselves, for different reasons, more in tune or involved with the hyperreal world and less with the physical real world. Some famous theorists of hyperreality/hyperrealism include [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], [[Neil Postman]] and [[Umberto Eco]].

==Origins and usage==
The postmodern semiotic concept of "hyperreality" was contentiously coined by French sociologist [[Jean Baudrillard]] in ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]''. Baudrillard defined "hyperreality" as "the generation by models of a real without origin or reality";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|title=Simulacra &amp; Simulation|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=The Precession of Simulacra|page=1|url=https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/baudrillard-simulacra_and_simulation.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309115319/https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/baudrillard-simulacra_and_simulation.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; hyperreality is a representation, a sign, without an original referent. Baudrillard believes hyperreality goes further than confusing or blending the 'real' with the symbol which represents it; it involves creating a symbol or set of signifiers which represent something that does not actually exist, like Santa Claus. Baudrillard in particular suggests that the world we live in has been replaced by a copy world, where we seek simulated stimuli and nothing more. Baudrillard borrows, from [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' "[[On Exactitude in Science]]" (already borrowed from [[Lewis Carroll]]),the example of a society whose [[Cartography|cartographers]] create a map so detailed that it covers the very things it was designed to represent. When the empire declines, the map fades into the landscape.  He says that, in such a case, neither the representation nor the real remains, just the hyperreal.  Baudrillard's idea of hyperreality was heavily influenced by [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[semiotics]], and [[Marshall McLuhan]]. Baudrillard challenges McLuhan's famous statement that the 'medium is the message', by suggesting that information devours its own content. Hyperreality is the inability of consciousness to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced societies.&lt;ref&gt;Zompetti, J. P., &amp; Moffitt, M. A. (2008). Revisiting Concepts of Public Relations Audience Through Postmodern Concepts of Metanarrative, Decentered Subject, and Reality/Hyperreality. Journal of Promotion Management, 14(3/4), 275-291. doi:10.1080/10496490802623762.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baudrillard's hyperreality theory goes a step further than McLuhan's medium theory: "There is not only an implosion of the message in the medium, there is, in the same movement, the implosion of the medium itself in the real, the implosion of the medium and of the real in a sort of hyperreal nebula, in which even the definition and distinct action of the medium can no longer be determined".&lt;ref name="Laughey, D. 2010"&gt;Laughey, D. (2010). Key themes in media theory. Maidenhead: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian author [[Umberto Eco]] explores the notion of hyperreality further by suggesting that the action of hyperreality is to desire reality and in the attempt to achieve that desire, to fabricate a false reality that is to be consumed as real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eco |first=Umberto |title=Travels in Hyperreality |url=http://public.callutheran.edu/~brint/American/Eco.pdf |work=The fortress of Solitude |accessdate=16 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521085018/http://public.callutheran.edu/~brint/American/Eco.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linked to contemporary [[western culture]] Umberto Eco and [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] would argue, that in current cultures fundamental ideals are built on desire and particular [[Sign system|sign-systems]].

Hyperreality can also be thought of as "reality by proxy"; simply put, an individual takes on someone else's version of reality and claims it as his or her own. For example, persons who watch soap operas for an extended period of time may develop a view of interpersonal relationships (reality) that are skewed by how the writers depict the characters and situations within the show. Individuals may begin to believe that these extreme dramatic relationships are authentic and real, and they may begin to judge social relationships and situations by this heightened lens of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crystal|first=Garry|title=What is Hyperreality|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-hyperreality.htm|publisher=wiseGEEK|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Hyperreality is significant as a [[paradigm]] to explain current cultural conditions. [[Consumerism]], because of its reliance on sign exchange value (e.g. brand X shows that one is fashionable, car Y indicates one's wealth), could be seen as a contributing factor in the creation of hyperreality or the hyperreal condition. Hyperreality tricks consciousness into detaching from any real emotional engagement, instead opting for artificial simulation, and endless reproductions of fundamentally empty appearance. Essentially (although Baudrillard himself may balk at the use of this word), fulfillment or [[happiness]] is found through simulation and imitation of a transient [[simulacrum]] of reality, rather than any interaction with any "real" [[reality]].

While hyperreality is not a relatively new concept, its effects are more relevant today than when it was first conceptualized.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} This is attributed to the way it effectively captured the postmodern condition, particularly how people in the postmodern world seek stimulation by creating unreal worlds of spectacle and seduction and nothing more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Social and Sociological Theory: Visualizing Social Worlds|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=9781412978200|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are dangers to the use of hyperreality within our culture; individuals may observe and accept hyperreal images as role models when the images don't necessarily represent real physical people. This can result in a desire to strive for an unobtainable ideal, or it may lead to a lack of unimpaired role models. [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] cautions against confusing celebrity worship with hero worship, "we come dangerously close to depriving ourselves of all real models. We lose sight of the men and women who do not simply seem great because they are famous but who are famous because they are great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel J.|title=The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America|year=1992|publisher=Random House|location=New York, NY|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bemoans the loss of old heroes like [[Moses]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Aeneas]], [[Jesus]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Muhammad|Muhammed]], [[Joan of Arc]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[George Washington]], [[Napoleon]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]], who did not have [[public relations]] (PR) agencies to construct hyperreal images of themselves. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel J.|title=The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America|year=1992|publisher=Random House|location=New York, NY|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dangers of hyperreality are also facilitated by information technologies, which provide tools to dominant powers that seek to encourage it to drive consumption and materialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge and Critical Pedagogy: An Introduction|last=Kincheloe|first=Joe|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2008|isbn=9781402082238|location=New York|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The danger in the pursuit of stimulation and seduction emerge not in the lack of meaning but, as Baudrillard maintained, "we are gorged with meaning and it is killing us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mapping the Subject: Geographies of Cultural Transformation|last=Pile|first=Steve|last2=Thrift|first2=Nigel|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=0415102251|location=London|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperreality, some sources point out, may provide insights into the postmodern moment by analyzing how simulations disrupt the [[binary opposition]] between reality and [[illusion]] but  it does not address or resolve the contradictions inherent in this tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Postmodernism, Page 2|last=Taylor|first=Victor|last2=Winquist|first2=Charles|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=0415152941|location=London|pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key relational themes==
Simulation/Simulacra: 
The concepts most fundamental to hyperreality are those of simulation and the simulacrum, first conceptualized by [[Jean Baudrillard]] in his book ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]''.  The two terms are separate entities with relational origin connections to Baudrillard's theory of hyperreality.

===Simulation===
[[Simulation]] is characterized by a blending of 'reality' and representation, where there is no clear indication of where the former stops and the latter begins. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance; "It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|title=Simulacra &amp; Simulation|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=The Precession of Simulacra|page=1|url=https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/baudrillard-simulacra_and_simulation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard suggests that simulation no longer takes place in a physical realm; it takes place within a space not categorized by physical limits i.e., within ourselves, technological simulations, etc.

===Simulacrum===
The [[simulacrum]] is often defined as a copy with no original, or as [[Gilles Deleuze]] (1990) describes it, "the simulacrum is an image without resemblance". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boundas|first=Gilles Deleuze ; translated by Mark Lester with Charles Stivale ; edited by Constantin V.|title=The logic of sense|year=1990|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231059831|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right. He created four steps of reproduction: (1) basic reflection of reality, (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretense of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which "bears no relation to any reality whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Doug|title=Jean Baudrillard|url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~dmann/baudrillard1.htm|work=A Very Short Introduction|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotations ==
"Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory—precession of simulacra—it is the map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map." — Jean Baudrillard, "The Precession of Simulacra," ''Simulacra and Simulation''

== Examples ==

=== Disneyland ===
Both [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]] refer to [[Disneyland]] as an example of hyperreality. Eco believes that Disneyland with its settings such as Main Street and full sized houses has been created to look "absolutely realistic", taking visitors' imagination to a "fantastic past".&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''Travels In Hyperreality'', New York, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1986, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; This false reality creates an illusion and makes it more desirable for people to buy this reality. Disneyland works in a system that enables visitors to feel that technology and the created atmosphere "can give us more reality than nature can".&lt;ref&gt;Eco, ''Travels In Hyperreality'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The "fake nature" of Disneyland satisfies our imagination and daydream fantasies in real life.The idea is that nothing in this world is real. Nothing is original, but all are endless copies of reality. Since we do not imagine the reality of simulations, both imagined and real are equally hyperreal, for example, the numerous simulated rides, including the submarine ride and the Mississippi boat tour.&lt;ref name="Laughey, D. 2010"/&gt; When entering Disneyland, consumers form into lines to gain access to each attraction. Then they are ordered by people with special uniforms to follow the rules, such as where to stand or where to sit. If the consumers follow each rule correctly, they can enjoy "the real thing" and see things that are not available to them outside of Disneyland's doors.&lt;ref&gt;Eco, ''Travels In Hyperreality'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'', Baudrillard argues the "imaginary world" of Disneyland magnetizes people inside and has been presented as "imaginary" to make people believe that all its surroundings are "real". But he believes that the Los Angeles area is not real; thus it is hyperreal. Disneyland is a set of apparatuses which tries to bring imagination and fiction to what is called "real". This concerns the American values and way of life in a sense and "concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the reality principle."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, "Simulacra and Simulations," in ''Selected Writings'', Mark Poster, ed. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Disneyland imaginary is neither true or false: it is a deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real. Whence the debility, the infantile degeneration of this imaginary. It's meant to be an infantile world, in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the "real" world, and to conceal the fact that real childishness is everywhere, particularly among those adults who go there to act the child in order to foster illusions of their real childishness."&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, "Simulacra and Simulations," pp. 166-184&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Inside the Neolithic Mind: Consciousness, Cosmos and the Realm of the Gods''''' is a [[cognitive archaeology|cognitive archaeological]] study of [[Neolithic]] religious beliefs in Europe co-written by the archaeologists [[David Lewis-Williams]] and David Pearce, both of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. It was first published by [[Thames and Hudson]] in 2005. Following on from Lewis-Williams' earlier work, ''[[The Mind in the Cave]]'' (2002), the book discusses the role of human cognition in the development of religion and Neolithic art.

The premise of ''Inside the Neolithic Mind'' is that irrespective of cultural differences, all humans share in the ability to enter into [[altered states of consciousness]], in which they experience [[entoptic phenomenon]], which the authors discern as a three-stage process leading to visionary experiences. Arguing that such altered experiences have provided the background to religious beliefs and some artistic creativity throughout human history, they focus their attention on the Neolithic, or "New Stone Age" period, when across Europe, communities abandoned their nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles and settled to become sedentary agriculturalists.

Adopting case studies from the opposite ends of Neolithic Europe, Lewis-Williams and Pearce discuss the archaeological evidence from both the Near East &amp;ndash; including such sites as [[Nevalı Çori]], [[Göbekli Tepe]] and [[Çatalhöyük]] &amp;ndash; and Atlantic Europe, including the sites of [[Newgrange]], [[Knowth]] and [[Bryn Celli Ddu]]. The authors argue that these monuments illustrate the influence of altered states of consciousness in constructing cosmological views of a tiered universe, in doing so drawing ethnographic parallels with [[shamanism|shamanistic]] cultures in Siberia and Amazonia.

Academic reviews published in such peer-reviewed journals as ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' were mixed. Critics argued that the use of evidence was selective, and that there was insufficient evidence for the authors' three-stage model of entopic phenomenon. Others praised the accessible and engaging writing style.

==Synopsis==
In their preface, Lewis-Williams and Pearce explain their approach, and their reasons for comparing megalithic art and archaeology from the Near East and Atlantic Europe. They express their opinion that such comparisons are made possible &amp;ndash; despite the cultural and geographical differences &amp;ndash; because of the "universal functioning of the human brain" which unites all ''Homo sapiens'' and leads different societies to develop similar religious and cosmological beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 6&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:GobeklitepeHeykel.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Monolith]] with animals in high and low [[relief]] from Göbekli Tepe.]]

Chapter one, "The Revolutionary Neolithic", explores the background to [[Neolithic|this period of time]], in which humans became increasingly sedentary and developed agriculture. Discussing the various different understandings of the Neolithic advocated within archaeology, they propose that it should be seen as a "revolutionary" period than as "a revolution" in itself, in this way challenging the view made famous by [[V. Gordon Childe]]. Moving on to an exploration of why humans adopted agriculture, they proclaim their adherence to [[Jacques Cauvin]]'s concept of the Symbolic Revolution. From there, they discuss the role of religion, suggesting that it should be understood as a tripartite system uniting experience, practice and belief. This leads on to a discussion of some of the earliest archaeological evidence for the Neolithic, at [[Nevalı Çori]] and [[Göbekli Tepe]], both in Southeastern Turkey, referring to the theory that the ritual beliefs practiced here resulted in the development of agriculture. Lewis-Williams and Pearce round off the chapter by quoting [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem "[[Kubla Khan, or A Vision in a Dream. A Fragment|Kubla Khan]]", written after an experience in an [[altered state of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 13&amp;ndash;36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second chapter, "The Consciousness Contract", the authors explore such altered states of consciousness, beginning with a discussion of the life and work of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Listing the symptoms of such altered states, they put forward their three-stage model for how the human brain experiences these states, and then interprets them as recognisable images.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 37&amp;ndash;59.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter three, "Seeing and Building a Cosmos", proceeds to discuss early humanity's conceptions of [[cosmology]], which the authors argue was probably divided into several tiered realms through which shamans were believed to traverse while in an altered state of consciousness. They follow this with a discussion of the shamanic symbolism of the eye, drawing comparisons with the eyes in the clay statues from 'Ain Ghazal and the [[Plastered human skulls|plastered skulls]] from other Near Eastern sites.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 60&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter four, "Close Encounters with a Built Cosmos", examines two Neolithic settlements in the Near East &amp;ndash; 'Ain Ghazal and [[Çatalhöyük]] &amp;ndash; and argues that their layout and design may have reflected shamanistic conceptions of cosmology. In doing so, the authors draw parallels with the ethnographically-recorded [[Barasana]] people of Amazonia, whose ''maloca'' buildings were understood as cosmological microcosms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 88&amp;ndash;122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fifth chapter, "Domesticating Wild Nature", the authors seek to explore how the people of the Neolithic Near East might have understood the concepts of "death", "birth" and the "wild", drawing on ethnographic examples from various recorded shamanistic societies in order to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 123&amp;ndash;148.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter six, "Treasure the Dream Whatever the Terror", discusses how aspects of consciousness and cosmology can make their way into myth, expanding on the problematic nature of defining "myth". Turning to the [[structuralism|structuralist]] ideas of anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], they discuss Lévi-Strauss's ideas of neurologically based "mythemes" that provided the building blocks for myths; although rejecting his structuralism, they concur that there is a neuropsychological "deep structure" behind mythology, and proceed to compare the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' with a [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] narrative, "The Cave of the Reindeer Woman."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 149&amp;ndash;168.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Newgrange, Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The entrance stone to Newgrange; Lewis-Williams and Pearce argue that these motifs represent entopic phenomenon that have resulted from altered states of consciousness.]]

The seventh chapter, "The Mound in the Dark Grove", turns its attention to Atlantic Europe, on the western end of the continent. Opening with a reference to [[William Blake]], the authors focus their attention on two Early Neolithic tombs on the island of [[Anglesey]] off the Welsh coast: [[Bryn Celli Ddu]] and [[Barclodiad y Gawres]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 169&amp;ndash;197.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter eight, "Brú na Bóinne", examines the [[Brú na Bóinne|valley of the same name]] in [[County Meath]], Ireland, the home to a number of Early Neolithic tombs. Lewis-Williams and Pearce turn their attention to the most prominent two, [[Newgrange]] and [[Knowth]], arguing that their architectural designs reflect cosmological views of the world influenced by altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 198&amp;ndash;249.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the penultimate chapter, "Religion de Profunais", the authors examine a number of recurring features in Neolithic Western Europe which they believe can shed light on the religious beliefs of the period. Exploring ritual elements to the act of flint mining at such sites as [[Grimes Graves]], they discuss the potential shamanic symbolism of [[quartz]]. From there, they look at the art motifs found at sites in this part of the continent, highlighting the argument of Dronfield that such motifs were an attempt to depict entopic phenomenon, in doing so drawing ethnographic parallels with the artworks created by shamans among the [[Tukano people]] of Amazonia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 250&amp;ndash;280.&lt;/ref&gt; The concluding chapter, "East is East and West is West", discusses the authors' views on the potential of their theory, making reference to [[Christopher Hawkes|Hawkes' ladder of inference]]{{Failed verification|date=January 2014}} and arguing for the need to consider [[emic and etic|emic]] perspectives when dealing with past societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 281&amp;ndash;290.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic reviews===
Susan A. Johnston of [[George Washington University]] reviewed the book for the ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' journal, in which she noted that many of the authors' analyses were "interesting, and sometimes quite new and innovative." However, she also felt that there was a disconnection between the theoretical underpinnings to the tome and the analyses that followed; noting that while they were trying to avoid the neurological determinism which had been critiqued by [[Paul Bahn]] and Patricia Helvenston in their ''Waking the Trance Fixed'' (2005), she nevertheless thought their approach similar to it. Ultimately acknowledging that the analysis on offer do not require the neurological backing that the authors provide, Johnston suggested that the contemporary preoccupation with rooting archaeological interpretations in "biological reality" was a part of the "21st-century mind".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Joh06|Johnston 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' journal published a review of ''Inside the Neolithic Mind'' authored by [[Chris Scarre]] of [[Durham University]], in which he noted the controversial nature of Lewis-Williams' "three stages of trance" model, proclaiming that those already unconvinced by the theory will get little from the new book. Scarre noted that inevitably, there was "much to question and to applaud" in the work, before highlighting that the use of evidence was selective, and that the art on the Breton megaliths was not included.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sca07|Scarre 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[American Scientist]]'' published a review authored by Brian D. Hayden of [[Simon Fraser University]], in which he described it as a "very enjoyable" book, praising the book's vignettes as making it "eminently readable". Although remarking that the authors' "endorse cognitive interpretations that are quite different from the more economic and practical interpretations that I generally favor", Hayden nevertheless commented that he agreed with their basic premise. He comments that while some of their assertions do seem plausible, others &amp;ndash; for instance their claims that the idea of a tiered cosmos has a neurological basis &amp;ndash; are less so, being the sort of "speculative indulgences" that he believes typify "English archaeology". Moving on to discuss the authors' views on the relationship between altered states of consciousness and power elites, he expresses his disagreement with them, noting that "the issues of domestication and the emergence of socioeconomic complexity are poorly served by cognitively based explanations."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hay06|Hayden 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

David S. Webster of [[Durham University]]'s Archaeological Services reviewed the work for the ''European Journal of Archaeology'' in which he highlighted its "popular tone and style" and use of the "contentious" three mode-model of trance states, a model he dismisses as a "myth".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Web05|Webster 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Archaeology'', the publication of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], Michael Balter positively reviewed ''Inside the Neolithic Mind'', praising its "superb writing" and "lavishly illustrated descriptions" of archaeological sites. Although he notes that most archaeologists would concur that Neolithic people probably believed in a spirit world, he expressed his belief that "they may balk at the idea" that the act of climbing down step ladders at Çatalhöyük symbolized the descent into the underworld or that hearths in the floors of 'Ain Ghazal symbolized the transformation of fire, rather than the remnants of cookery. He also noted that archaeologists would be more receptive to their idea that geometric patterns on European megaliths have parallels with similarities in Southern Africa and California. Concluding his review, Balter remarked that the authors "can be assured that their foray into the Neolithic mind will not be ignored."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bal05|Balter 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the German Aerospace Center the '''Institute of Aerospace Medicine''' is the only research institution that primarily deals with life science problems concerning space flight, aviation and traffic.


==Research activities==

The Institute's research activities are focussed on the central task of providing for the health and performance of the persons involved (pilot, crew, passenger, astronaut, motorist, resident etc.)
Furthermore, from a medical point of view the development of countermeasures to protect humans from the effects of [[weightlessness]], like the loss of bone and muscle mass, is one of our main tasks to enable long-term stays of humans in space. At the same time, when conducting research under microgravity conditions, basic functions of the human body are examined by eliminating the interfering influence of gravity in a system-physiological approach. In the field of psychology, the selection of qualified personnel (pilots, astronauts, air traffic controllers) and the development of suitable scientific instruments for the selection procedure are another main task of the Institute. Finally, we also deal with the problem of adaptation of life to extreme environments and take part in projects that are concerned with the search for life in space.

==Core tasks and working groups==

===Medical Operations===

Medical Operations is an interdisciplinary field covering aviation, space and travel medicine. Work carried out here includes the study of the physical, physiological, psychological, ergonomic and medical characteristics of air and space travel. The department is also responsible for the health and well-being of flight personnel and passengers and regularly carries out medical examinations on those groups.

===Biomedical Science Support Center===

This division integrates all activities in ME that provide support for ME internal as well as for external scientists in the field of gravity-relevant applications in the biomedical sciences. The profile reaches from scientific and administrational support when planning experiments in [[microgravity]] over concrete experiment preparation and operational support for accepted flight experiments and corresponding ground experiments up to data management. This expertise is also applied in projects of related fields like [[telemedicine]] and ground systems for satellite communications.

===Flight Physiology===

The research activities of the flight physiology division focus on "workload of aviation personnel", "effects of aircraft noise on humans" and within the field of "performance and environment" on basic and special questions about effects of external stressors on humans (e.g. jet-lag, sleep-deprivation, decompression problems in space).

===Aviation and Space Psychology===

The Institute's Department of Aviation and Space Psychology is located in Hamburg and is largely responsible for personnel selection and certain areas of behavioural training for operation staff (pilots, air traffic controllers and astronauts). In April 2002 the Departments' Quality management system was ISO 9001 certified. As the first Q-System worldwide, this certificate covers all stages of psychological diagnostics.

===Radiation Biology===

The Radio Biology Department is concerned with aviation and space relevant questions regarding the effects of radiation on humans and the biosphere. These include, amongst radiation health and protection issues for astronauts and aircraft crews, monitoring the biological consequences of environmental radiation and genotoxic conditions by biological [[dosimetry]] and [[biosensor]]s and [[bioassays]], the assessment of habitability of other planets with special consideration of possible Mars mission scenarios.

===Space Physiology===

The research of space physiology focusses on the influence of weightlessness, nutrition, physical inactivity, unloading, and aging processes on human health. The investigations are performed in an integrative approach - from the cell to the whole organism - on ground and in space.

===Transport Safety===

The working group Transport Safety uses competences and technological innovations from aviation and space research to develop new solutions for problems of road and rail transport.

'''Kinesin-like protein KIF1A''', also known as '''axonal transporter of synaptic vesicles''' or '''microtubule-based motor KIF1A''', is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''KIF1A'' [[gene]].&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: kinesin family member 1A| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=547| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7539720"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Okada Y, Yamazaki H, Sekine-Aizawa Y, Hirokawa N | title = The neuron-specific kinesin superfamily protein KIF1A is a unique monomeric motor for anterograde axonal transport of synaptic vesicle precursors | journal = Cell | volume = 81 | issue = 5 | pages = 769–80 |date=June 1995 | pmid = 7539720 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(95)90538-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10323250"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keller MP, Seifried BA, Rabin BA, Chance PF | title = Mapping of the kinesin-related gene ATSV to chromosome 2q37 | journal = Hum.

== Function ==

KIF1A is a member of the [[kinesin]] family. This protein is highly similar to mouse heavy-chain kinesin member 1A protein, which is an anterograde motor protein that transports membranous organelles along [[axon]]al [[microtubule]]s. It is thought that this protein may play a critical role in the development of axonal [[neuropathy|neuropathies]] resulting from impaired axonal transport. There are multiple [[polyadenylation]] sites found in this gene.&lt;ref name="entrez"/&gt; [[Sexual orientation]] has been linked to the regulatory domain of the gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://ep70.eventpilotadmin.com/web/page.php?page=IntHtml&amp;project=ASHG15&amp;id=150123267|title = PgmNr 95: A novel predictive model of sexual orientation using epigenetic markers.|last = Ngun|first = Tuck|date = October 8, 2015|journal = American Society of Human Genetics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==
KIF1A is associated with [[hereditary spastic paraplegia|hereditary spastic paraparesis]].&lt;ref name="pmid21487076"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Erlich Y, Edvardson S, Hodges E, Zenvirt S, Thekkat P, Shaag A, Dor T, Hannon GJ, Elpeleg O | title = Exome sequencing and disease-network analysis of a single family implicate a mutation in KIF1A in hereditary spastic paraparesis | journal = Genome Res | volume = 21| issue = 5| pages = 658–64|date=April 2011 | pmid = 21487076 | doi = 10.1101/gr.117143.110 | pmc=3083082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4140">The '''Langkawi Declaration on the Environment''' was a declaration issued by the assembled [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on the issue of [[environmental sustainability]].  It was issued on October 21, 1989 at [[Langkawi]], [[Malaysia]], during the tenth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM).

The declaration covers a wide range of topics related to the environment, blaming 'past neglect in managing the natural environment and resources'.&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/171730/1989_langkawi_declaration_on_the_environment.htm |date=21 October 1989 |title=Langkawi Declaration on the Environment 1989 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202064714/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/171730/1989_langkawi_declaration_on_the_environment.htm |archivedate=2 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It lists what the Heads of Governments perceived to be the main environmental problems: the [[greenhouse effect]], damage to the [[ozone layer]], [[acid rain]], [[marine pollution]], [[land degradation]], and species [[extinction]].  These, the declaration affirmed, were issues that transcended national borders, and hence required the involvement of international organisations, such as the Commonwealth, to coordinate strategies to solve them.&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt;

A key agreement in the formulation of the agreement was the pledge by [[developed country|developed countries]] not to connect future international [[development aid]] to commitment to environmental sustainability or introduce [[trade barrier]]s.&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;{{cite book |title=International Law and the Conservation of Biological Diversity |last=Bowman |first=Michael |author2=Redgwell, Catherine  |year=1996 |publisher=Kluwer Law International |location= |isbn=978-90-411-0863-0 |pages=239 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This, the developing countries argued, would prevent economic growth (described as a 'compelling necessity'),&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt; and hence reduce their ability to develop sustainable natural environments.  In exchange, the developing countries conceded to the Commonwealth's developed members (particularly [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]]), their interest in protecting the environment.&lt;ref name="Bowman" /&gt;

Amongst the commitments made by members in the Langkawi Declaration were:&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt;
* Support the development of an international sustainable development funding mechanism.
* Support the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and recommend the Commonwealth's own report on [[climate change]].
* Promote [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].
* Promote [[afforestation]] and sustainable forest management in developing countries, and the conservation of [[Old growth forest|virgin forest]] to protect [[biodiversity]].
* Restrict non-[[sustainable fisheries]], including banning tangle nets and pelagic driftnet fishing, as part of a general trend amongst international organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthtrust.org/dnpaper/intllaw.html |date=May 1994 |title=International Law Governing Driftnet Fishing on the High Seas |accessdate=2008-08-31 |publisher=[[Earthtrust]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prevent dumping of toxic or hazardous materials in the oceans or in developing countries.
* Promote public awareness of environmental risks and issues.

'''Lipid droplets''', also referred to as lipid bodies, [[oil body|oil bodies]] or adiposomes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Sally|author2=Parton, Robert G. |title=Lipid droplets: a unified view of a dynamic organelle|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|date=8 March 2006|volume=7|issue=5|pages=373–378|doi=10.1038/nrm1912|pmid=16550215}}&lt;/ref&gt; are lipid-rich cellular [[organelle]]s that regulate the storage and [[hydrolysis]] of neutral lipids and are found largely in the adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="mehta"&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/10/mobilization-and-cellular-uptake-of-stored-fats-triacylglycerols-with-animation/ Mobilization and cellular uptake of stored fats and triacylglycerol (with Animation)]&lt;/ref&gt; They also serve as a reservoir for [[cholesterol]] and acyl-glycerols for membrane formation and maintenance. Lipid droplets are found in all eukaryotic organisms and store a large portion of [[lipids]] in mammalian [[adipocyte]]s. Initially, these lipid droplets were considered to merely serve as fat depots, but since the discovery in the 1990s of proteins in the lipid droplet coat that regulate lipid droplet dynamics and lipid metabolism, lipid droplets are seen as highly dynamic organelles that play a very important role in the regulation of intracellular lipid storage and lipid metabolism. The role of lipid droplets outside of lipid and cholesterol storage has recently begun to be elucidated and includes a close association to inflammatory responses through the synthesis and metabolism of [[eicosanoid]]s and to metabolic disorders such as [[obesity]], cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bozza|first=PT|author2=Viola, JP |title=Lipid droplets in inflammation, cancer|journal=Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, and Essential Fatty Acids|date=Apr–Jun 2010|volume=82|issue=4–6|pages=243–50|pmid=20206487|doi=10.1016/j.plefa.2010.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melo|first=Rossana C.

Alternatively, fatty acids can be converted to lipid intermediates like diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramides and fatty acyl-CoAs. These lipid intermediates can impair insulin signaling, which is referred to as lipid-induced insulin resistance and lipotoxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosma | first1 = M | last2 = Kersten | first2 = S | last3 = Hesselink | first3 = MKC | last4 = Schrauwen | first4 = P | year = 2012 | title = Re-evaluating lipotoxic triggers in skeletal muscle: Relating intramyocellular lipid metabolism to insulin sensitivity | url = | journal = Prog Lipid Res | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 36–49 | doi = 10.1016/j.plipres.2011.11.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipid droplets also serve as platforms for protein binding and degradation.

==Structure==

Lipid droplets are composed of a neutral lipid core consisting mainly of [[Triglyceride|triacylglycerols]] (TAGs) and cholesteryl esters surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer.&lt;ref name="mehta"/&gt; The surface of lipid droplets is decorated by a number of proteins which are involved in the regulation of [[lipid metabolism]].&lt;ref name="mehta"/&gt; The first and best-characterized family of lipid droplet coat proteins is the perilipin protein family, consisting of five proteins.

Lipid droplets vary greatly in size, ranging from 20-40&amp;nbsp;nm to 100&amp;nbsp;um.&lt;ref name="Guo 749–52"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Guo Y, Cordes KR, Farese RV, Walther TC |title=Lipid droplets at a glance.|journal=Journal of Cell Science|date=Mar 15, 2009|volume=122|issue=Pt 6|pages=749–52|pmid=19261844|doi=10.1242/jcs.037630|pmc=2714424}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adipocytes, lipid bodies tend to be larger and they may compose the majority of the cell, while in other cells they may only be induced under certain conditions and are considerably smaller in size.

==Formation==

Although the exact mechanism of formation of lipid droplets is still unknown, it is proposed that they bud off the membrane of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] as TAGs are collected between the two layers of its [[lipid bilayer|phospholipid membrane]]. Lipid droplet growth can consequently happen through direct diffusion of fatty acids, endocytosis of sterols or by fusion of smaller lipid droplets through the aid of [[SNARE (protein)|SNARE proteins]].&lt;ref name="Guo 749–52"/&gt; Lipid droplets have also been observed to be created by the fission of existing lipid droplets, though this is thought to be less common than ''de novo'' formation.&lt;ref name="Wilfling 39-45"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilfling|first=Florian|author2=Haas, J.|author3=Walther, T.|author4=Farese, R.|title=Lipid droplet biogenesis|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|date=August 2014|volume=29|pages=39–45|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2014.03.008|pmc=4526149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of lipid droplets from the endoplasmic reticulum begins with the synthesis of the neutral lipids to be transported. The manufacture of TAGs from diacylglycerol (by the addition of a fatty acyl chain) is catalyzed by the [[Diglyceride acyltransferase|DGAT]] proteins, though the extent to which these and other proteins are required depends on cell type.&lt;ref name="Harris 657-667"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Charles|author2=et. al.|title=DGAT enzymes are required for triacylglycerol synthesis and lipid droplets in adipocytes|journal=Journal of Lipid Research|date=April 2011|volume=52|issue=4|pages=657–667|doi=10.1194/jlr.M013003|pmid=21317108|pmc=3284159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither DGAT1 nor DGAT2 is singularly essential for TAG synthesis or droplet formation, though mammalian cells lacking both cannot form lipid droplets and have severely stunted TAG synthesis. DGAT1, which seems to prefer exogenous fatty acid substrates, is not essential for life; DGAT2, which seems to prefer endogenously synthesized fatty acids, is.&lt;ref name="Wilfling 39-45"/&gt;

In non-adipocytes, lipid storage, lipid droplet synthesis and lipid droplet growth can be induced by various stimuli including [[growth factor]]s, long-chain [[Unsaturated fat|unsaturated fatty acids]] (including [[oleic acid]] and [[arachidonic acid]]), oxidative stress and inflammatory stimuli such bacterial [[lipopolysaccharide]]s, various microbial pathogens, [[platelet-activating factor]], [[eicosanoids]], and [[cytokines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melo|first=R.

The technique has primarily been used to select galaxies at redshifts of ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3–4 using [[ultraviolet]] and [[Visible spectrum|optical]] filters, but progress in [[ultraviolet astronomy]] and in [[infrared astronomy]] has allowed the use of this technique at lower&lt;ref&gt;

The Lyman-break galaxy selection technique relies on the fact that radiation at higher energies than the [[Lyman limit]] at 912&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]] is almost completely absorbed by neutral gas around [[star formation|star-forming]] regions of galaxies.  In the [[rest frame]] of the emitting galaxy, the emitted [[emission spectrum|spectrum]] is bright at wavelengths longer than 912&amp;nbsp;Å, but very dim or imperceptible at shorter wavelengths—this is known as a "[[dropout (astronomy)|dropout]]", or "break", and can be used to find the position of the Lyman limit.  Light with a wavelength shorter than 912&amp;nbsp;Å is in the far-ultraviolet range and is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere, but for very distant galaxies the wavelengths of light are [[redshift|stretched]] considerably because of the [[Hubble's Law|expansion of the Universe]].  For a galaxy at redshift ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, the Lyman break will appear to be at wavelengths of about 3600&amp;nbsp;Å, which is long enough to be detected by ground- or space-based [[telescopes]].

Candidate galaxies around redshift ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 can then be selected by looking for galaxies which appear in optical images (which are sensitive to wavelengths greater than 3600&amp;nbsp;Å), but do not appear in ultraviolet images (which are sensitive to light at wavelengths shorter than 3600&amp;nbsp;Å).  The technique may be adapted to look for galaxies at other redshifts by choosing different sets of filters—the method works as long as images may be taken through at least one filter above and below the wavelength of the redshifted Lyman limit. In order to confirm the redshift estimated by the color selection, follow-up [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopy]] is performed.  Although spectroscopic measurements are necessary to obtain a high-precision redshift, spectroscopy is typically much more time-consuming than imaging, so the selection of candidate galaxies via the Lyman-break technique greatly improves the efficiency of high-redshift galaxy surveys.&lt;ref&gt;

The issue of their far-infrared emission is still central to the study of Lyman-break galaxies to better understand their evolution and estimate their total star formation rate. So far, only a small sample has been detected in far-infrared. Most of the individual results rely on an information gathered from lensed Lyman-break galaxies or from the rest-frame ultraviolet, or from a few objects detected by the Herschel satellite &lt;ref&gt;

The National Institute of Radiological Sciences hospital established in 1961 is a research hospital with a basic focus on [[radiation therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medical-excellence-japan.org/en/hospital/002/index.html Charged Particle Therapy Research Center Hospital, National Institute of Radiological Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) of NIRS was launched, and in 1997 the Research Center for Charged Particle Therapy was opened as one of the leading medical centers using [[particle therapy|carbon ions]] are in operation.

On April 1, 2016, the [[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]] (JAEA) transferred some of its laboratories to the NIRS, and the NIRS body was renamed to the National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST) which includes existing laboratories of the NIRS; the NIRS is currently a radiological research division of the QST.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47927">{{Political campaigning}}
In the [[politics of the United States]], '''opposition research''' (also called '''oppo research''') is the practice of collecting information on a political opponent or other adversary that can be used to discredit or otherwise weaken them. The information can include biographical, legal, criminal, medical, educational, or financial history or activities, as well as prior media coverage, or the voting record of a politician. Opposition research can also entail using "trackers" to follow an individual and record their activities or political speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-05-22/opposition-research-romney-obama/55138756/1 |title=Researchers dig deeper for dirt on political opposition |last=Schouten |first=Fredreka |date=23 May 2012 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research is usually conducted in the time period between announcement of intent to run and the actual election; however political parties maintain long-term databases that can cover several decades. The practice is both a tactical maneuver and a cost-saving measure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephanie |last=Mencimer |title=Dirty Politics |publisher=[[Center for Public Integrity]] |date=30 May 2008 |url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2008/05/30/3104/dirty-politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is frequently used to refer not just to the collection of information but also how it is utilized, as a component of [[negative campaigning]].

==Origins and history==
In the 1st century BC, [[Cicero]] is said to have gathered information that was damaging to opponents and using it in attacks against them. He accused one political opponent, [[Catiline]], of murdering one wife to make room for another. He attacked [[Mark Antony]] in speeches known as the ''[[Philippicae]]'', eventually prompting Antony to chop off his head and right hand and display them at the Roman Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kamber |first=Victor |author-link=Victor Kamber |title=Poison Politics |location=New York |publisher=Insight Books |year=1997 |page=9 |isbn=978-030645628-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition research also has its origins in military planning, as evident in such ancient texts as ''[[The Art of War]]'', published in the 5th century BC by [[Sun Tzu]]. This manual for warriors describes the necessity for understanding an opponent's weaknesses, for using spies, and for striking in moments of weakness.

In 18th century England, opposition research took the form of scandalmongering pamphlet wars between the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] parties. Writers such as [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Jonathan Swift]], and [[Henry Fielding]] participated, often writing under assumed names.&lt;ref&gt;Kamber, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition of robust attack was replicated later in the American colonies, when writers such as [[Thomas Paine]] or [[Benjamin Franklin]] conducted opposition research and published their results.

The first appearance of the phrase "opposition research" in the ''New York Times'' occurred on December 17, 1971, in an article that describes the infiltration of the [[Edmund Muskie]] presidential campaign by a female Republican volunteer:  "...an article appeared in a Washington newspaper describing the 'opposition research' program at Republican headquarters..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  |accessdate=2012-02-03}}  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition research became systematized in the 1970s when [[Ken Khachigian]], in the [[Nixon Administration]] suggested that the GOP keep files on individuals as insurance against future races, rather than "scramble" in an ''ad hoc'' fashion race by race.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Methods==

Opposition research differs immensely depending on the size and funding of a campaign, the ethics of the candidate, and the era in which it is conducted. Information gathering can be classified into three main categories: open-source research enabled by the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], [[covert operations]] or "[[tradecraft]], " and maintenance of human systems of informants. Increasingly, data-mining of electronic records is used. Information is then stored for future use, and disseminated in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John J. |last=Pitney |title=The Art of Political Warfare |location=Norman OK |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=2000 |pages=120–139 |isbn=978-080613263-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local election sometimes has a [[political campaign staff|staff member]] dedicated to reading through all of the opponents' public statements and their voting records; others initiate whisper campaigns that employ techniques of [[disinformation]] or "black ops" to deliberately mislead the public by advancing a pre-determined "narrative" that will present the opponent in a negative light.

Another technique is to infiltrate the opposition's operations and position a paid informant there. "Gray propaganda" techniques are often used to release damaging information to news media outlets without its source being identified properly, a technique inherited from disinformation tactics employed by intelligence agencies such as the [[Office of Strategic Services]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Pitney, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

File-sharing between operatives of political parties is quite common.  In the 2008 presidential election, a dossier of opposition research against Republican Vice-Presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]] was posted in its entirety on a political blog site, [[Politico.com]]. The file was compiled by the staff of her opponent in the 2006 Alaska gubernatorial race, [[Tony Knowles (politician)|Tony Knowles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Ben |last1=Smith |first2=John |last2=Bresnehan |title=Documents Detail Palin's Political Life |website=Politico |date=2 September 2008 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2008/09/documents-detail-palins-political-life-013084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Oppo dumps" are used by political campaigns to systematically supply files of damaging information to press outlets, including matters of the public record, video footage from party archives and private collections, as well as private intelligence gathered by operatives. Many prime time television and radio news commentaries rely on this supply of party-generated material because it is free, and therefore more cost-effective than paying investigative reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Megan |last=McArdle |title=Prime Time for Oppo Dumps |magazine=[[Atlantic Monthly]] |date=31 March 2008 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2008/03/prime-time-for-oppo-dumps/3157/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Scherer |title=The Matt Drudge Primary |website=Salon.com |date=14 May 2007 |url=https://www.salon.com/2007/05/14/drudge_11/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates and incumbents who benefit from opposition research often choose to remain uninformed about their campaign's operations and tactics, to insure [[plausible deniability]] should criminal charges be brought against researchers.

==="Trackers" and videography===
Yet another technique is to position information or personnel within media outlets. Often the information is video footage gathered in campaign-funded "tracker programs" wherein videographers use candidates' itineraries to track them and record as many remarks as possible, since anything they say can and will be used against them, as was the case in former Senator George Allen's "macaca moment."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In  the 2006 election cycle, a Virginia senator, [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]], was unseated because of videotape of the senator calling a videographer/opposition researcher as "macaca" or monkey. The name was considered to be an ethnic slur, and Allen's campaign could not overcome the damage when the incident was broadcast widely in mainstream media and on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Bass |title=In Dixie, Signs of a Rising Biracial Politics |publisher=New York Times |date=May 11, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/weekinreview/11bass.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital media and Wikipedia ===
A 2005 analysis of digital media strategies published by the American Academy of Political Science took the view that new technologies enable "political elites" to use database and Internet technologies to do opposition research more easily, but they use data-mining techniques that outrage privacy advocates and surreptitious technologies that few Internet users understand. Data becomes "richer" about political actors, policy options, and the diversity of actors and opinion in the public sphere, but citizenship is "thinner" by virtue of "the ease in which people can become politically expressive without being substantively engaged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Howard |first=Philip N. |author-link=Philip N.

[[Facebook]] photos became a tool of opposition researchers in [[California's 32nd congressional district special election, 2009]] to replace [[Hilda Solis]].  Front-runner [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Gil Cedillo]] sent out mailers targeting 26-year-old Emanuel Pleitez, grouping Pleitez's Facebook photos to suggest that he parties to excess with alcohol, and fraternizes with [[gangs]].  The text of the mailer suggested Pleitez, posing with a Latino stage actress and using a Latino [[voter registration drive]] hand sign, was "flashing gang signs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Blake |title=Facebook Photos Used as Opposition Research |website=The Hill |date=May 7, 2009 |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/campaigns/35943-facebook-photos-used-as-opposition-research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the campaign manager of Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate [[Cathy Cox]], Morton Brilliant, resigned after Cox's opponent, Lt. Gov, [[Mark Taylor (American politician)|Mark Taylor]], revealed Cox's campaign had added information from an opposition research dossier to a Wikipedia page on Taylor. Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] confirmed that the material had come from an IP address affiliated with the Cox campaign. Citing an Associated Press analysis, CNN reported that Wikipedia being used as a "popular tool" for opposition researchers became so widespread a problem that Wikipedia altered its submission guidelines and set up alerts so that its operators know when [[Capitol Hill]] staffers alter Wikipedia content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Hamby |title=Campaign Manager Resigns Amid Wikipedia Flap |work=CNN Politics |date=April 26, 2006 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/26/cox.wikipedia/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, anyone who wanted to could simply bypass this by using an IP address not associated with Capitol Hill.

===Grassroots oppo-research===
Opposition research is a necessary component of "grassroots" activist groups. Research on corporate or political opponents may enable activist groups to target neighborhoods from which to increase their numbers, to refine their focus or "target," to pinpoint the target's vulnerabilities, to reveal hidden sources of funding or little-known connections, to investigate scare tactics, and to augment a legislative initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lee |last=Staples |title=Roots to Power:  A Manual for Grassroots Organizing |edition=2nd |location=Westbury, CT |publisher=Praeger |date=2003 |page=227, passim |isbn=978-027596997-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the presidential election of 2008, the blog [[Talking Points Memo]] pioneered "collaborative citizen-reporting projects" based on groups of volunteers examining public documents that shed light on the George W. Bush administration's U.S. attorneys firings controversy.  Other organizations such as the [[Sunlight Foundation]] encouraged citizen examination of such public domain records as Mitt Romney's financial disclosure statements and Bill Clinton's income statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Arnoldy |title=Army of Average Joes Culls Through Candidates' Files, Bios |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=October 17, 2007 |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1017/p03s03-uspo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventative measures===
Political strategies for campaigns often include coaching on preventive measures to avoid providing too much information in public disclosure procedures that can provide ammunition for opponents' opposition researchers, particularly in itemized expenditure reports. "To eliminate some of these potential issues your campaign should take the time to review the wording of your campaign finance reports," advises one strategist writing for ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Instead of reporting that you spent $3,000 on a 'background check and public records search on Congressman X,' list the expenditure as 'issue research' or simply 'research'... One bonus financial filing tip:  warn your candidate about spending campaign funds on fancy restaurants for 'strategy meetings.' Eating at [[Ruth's Chris Steak House|Ruth's Chris]] or [[Morton's The Steakhouse|Morton's Steak House]] on your campaign's dime just looks bad.  The press may poke a little fun at your candidate's expense; your donors may feel their donation in being misspent and may never give again.&lt;ref&gt;Brent Barksdale, quoted in [http://www.politicsmagazine.com/blog_post/show/425 "TMI Can Sink Your Report,"] Campaigns &amp; Elections/Politics blog, ''The Hill'', July 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Funding and institutions===
Congressional and presidential opposition research is often conducted by or funded by a political party, lobbying group, [[political action committee]] (PAC), or a [[527 group]] that coalesces around a certain issue. In the U.S., both the Republican and Democratic parties employ full-time "Directors of Research" and maintain databases on opponents. In recent years the task of opposition research has been privatized in many areas. Full-time companies with permanent staff specializing in media productions or "grassroots" operations have replaced volunteers and campaign officials. Political media consultants may also opt for [[astroturfing]] techniques, which simulate wide popular appeal for a candidate's platform.

== In presidential elections ==
Opponents of [[Andrew Jackson]] in the 1824 and 1828 presidential elections unearthed his marriage records to imply that he was an [[adultery|adulterer]] for marrying Rachel Robards before she was legally divorced from her first husband.  Jackson had married her in 1791 on the strength of a statement from her husband that he had divorced her; Jackson had two wedding ceremonies, the not-recognizable one of 1791 and the legally corrective one of 1794.  His political opponents used this information decades later against him, and he fought many duels over his wife's honor.  Rachel Robards died before Jackson took office in his first term; he maintained that the stress of the opposition had killed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The life of Andrew Jackson |last=Remini|first=Robert Vincent |year=2001 |publisher=Perennial |isbn=0060937351 |edition=1st Perennial classics |location=New York |oclc=46951836 |pages=17–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], the law partner of [[Abraham Lincoln]], did research in the Illinois State Library to collect "all the ammunition Mr. Lincoln saw fit to gather" to prepare for the run against [[Stephen A. Douglas]] in the 1860 presidential race.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Harold Holzer, ed.  The Lincoln-Douglas Debates, New York: HarperCollins, 1994, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for Ronald Reagan’s debate with President [[Jimmy Carter]] in the presidential race 1980, Reagan’s campaign staff acquired under mysterious circumstances a 200-page briefing book, including information on Carter’s strategy, which staffers [[David Stockman]] and [[David Gergen]] had used to prepare Reagan.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department investigated to see how the information had been obtained by the Reagan camp. Two law professors filed suit in federal district court in Washington to request a special investigation, based on the 1978 [[Ethics in Government Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, “Special Prosecutor Sought in Briefing Book Case,”  October 26, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter’s staff believed the book to have been stolen from the White House, but the inquiry did not uncover any credible evidence that any law had been violated. The House of Representatives conducted its own investigation, and concluded in a 2,314-page report that the Reagan staff had two copies of the book, one from Reagan’s campaign director [[William J. Casey]], future head of the Central Intelligence Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Rottinghaus |first1=Brandon |last2=Bereznikova |first2=Zlata |date=September 2006 |title=Exorcising Scandal in the White House: Presidential Polling in Times of Crisis |journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=493–505 |doi=10.1111/j.1741-5705.2006.02559.x |issn=0360-4918}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Baker]] attributed the acquisition of the documents to Casey, who claimed to know nothing about them, and an analysis of Carter campaign documents found in the “Afghanistan” files of Reagan aide [[David Gergen]] indicated they came from three White House offices: the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] and Domestic Adviser [[Stuart Eizenstat]].&lt;ref&gt;Ed Magnuson, “I Never Knew There Was Such a Thing,” Time, July 11, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Many years afterward, Carter himself stated in a PBS interview that the book had been taken by columnist [[George Will]], but Will denied it, calling Carter "a recidivist liar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Will |title=Briefing Book Baloney |work=Washington Post |date=August 11, 2005 |page=A23 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001796.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Atwater]] is considered to be the "father" of modern aggressive "oppo" techniques.  Atwater honed his style working in his native South Carolina for Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] and to elect Congressman (later Governor) [[Carroll Campbell]].  From his posts on the 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]], Atwater encouraged and helped direct what was then the advanced oppo work of the [[Republican National Committee]] against Democrats [[Walter Mondale]] and [[Michael Dukakis]]. During the 1988 presidential campaign, dozens of RNC researchers worked three shifts around the clock to feed the then-burgeoning [[24-hour news cycle]].  The now-infamous “Willie Horton” TV ads crafted by [[Floyd Brown]] helped turn voters away from Dukakis and towards the Republican, although Atwater and Bush were protected by [[plausible deniability]] because Brown's ads were independently funded and produced.  Academic research into the Bush archives decades later revealed that a Bush staffer, Candice Strother, had released a dossier of information on Willie Horton to Elizabeth Fediay, of the non-profit group that contracted for the ad.&lt;ref&gt;Tali Mendelburg, ''The Race Card'', Princeton University Press, 2004, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Horton story had been completely public for an entire year, part of news coverage that won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for the Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune newspaper.) [[Willie Horton]] was an African-American convicted murderer released on a weekend furlough during Governor Dukakis’s tenure, who escaped and committed a brutal rape in Maryland, also stabbing his victim's husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Beloved Mug Shot For the Bush Forces |work=New York Times |date=October 3, 1988 |page=A22 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/03/us/campaign-trail-a-beloved-mug-shot-for-the-bush-forces.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atwater is also credited with originating "push polls" and "whisper campaigns" that use disinformation strategies to alienate voters from opponents.  A biography of Atwater, quotes him as saying in an interview toward the end of his life that he regretted some of his less ethical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Joseph |last=Brady |title=Bad Boy: The Life and Politics of Lee Atwater |year=1997 |isbn=0201627337}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992 presidential campaign, Republicans reported that they spent $6 million on a "state of the art (opposition research) war machine" to investigate Bill Clinton, who was running against [[George H. W. Bush]].  In the same election, the Clinton campaign paid more than $100,000 to a private investigator to look into allegations about Clinton's womanizing, investigating more than two dozen women.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Johnson, ''No Place for Amateurs'', 2nd edition. New York: Routlege, Taylor, and Francis Group, 2007, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000 presidential election, longtime opposition researcher and Nixon loyalist [[Roger Stone]] was recruited by former Secretary of State [[James Baker]] to oversee the recount of the disputed Presidential election in Miami-Dade County in 2000. Stone is credited with organizing the street demonstrations and eventual shut-down of the recount in that pivotal county.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Toobin, ''Too Close to Call'',&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004 presidential race, [[Chris Lehane]], a Democratic opposition researcher attracted notoriety and built a reputation not for deploying his skills against Republican opponents, but for using them against other Democrats in the primary races.  Working for retired Army general Wesley Clark, Lehane sought to establish a media "narrative" that Howard Dean was hypocritical and dishonest, based on surveys of his administrative archive as governor of Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Joshua |last=Green |title=Playing Dirty |work=The Atlantic Monthly |date=June 2004 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/06/playing-dirty/302960/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A protege of Atwater's, [[Karl Rove]], is considered to be the "architect" of George W. Bush's election to the governor's office in Texas, and to the presidency in 2000 and 2004. In the 2000 race, Rove is credited with masterminding the push poll that initiated the "[[John McCain]] has a black love child" whisper campaign in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Dirty Tricks, South Carolina and John McCain |magazine=The Nation |date=January 14, 2008 |last=Banks |first=Ann |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/dirty-tricks-south-carolina-and-john-mccain/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anonymous telephone pollsters, upon determining that a voter was pro-McCain, asked the question, "Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain if you knew he had fathered a black child out of wedlock?" The question was not overt slander, but it prompted the president of [[Bob Jones University]] to launch his own internet campaign against McCain, and succeeded in crippling the trust of voters McCain had attracted. The Bush camp knew, as the general public did not, that in reality, John McCain was the adoptive father of a dark-skinned Bangladeshi refugee who was rescued by his wife Cindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard H. |last=Davis |title=The Anatomy of a Smear Campaign |work=Boston Globe |date=March 21, 2004 |url=https://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 presidential election, opposition researchers for Barack Obama unearthed the fact that John Edwards had paid $400 for haircuts at campaign expense, and supplied Politico's Ben Smith with the tip, according to a memoir later published by campaign manager David Plouffe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Smith |title=A Haircut Tip |work=Politico |date=November 10, 2009 |url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2009/11/a-haircut-tip-022732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Democratic National Committee]] continues to fund a research department, after the 2008 presidential election, the New York Times reported that "The legacy of the Democratic National Committee itself is hardly clear going forward.

==Executive branch==
* '''Franklin Roosevelt Administration''': In 1940, the White House accidentally taped a conversation of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] instructing a lower level aide to disseminate a rumor about his opponent [[Wendell Willkie]] having an extramarital affair: "We can't have any of our principal speakers refer to it, but the people down the line can get it out."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Roosevelt, quoted in John J. Pitney, ''The Art of Political Warfare'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Johnson Administration''': In 1964, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] sent 30 FBI agents to the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, N.J., to avert assassination attempts, and to monitor his political rival [[Robert Kennedy]] and civil rights activists. Johnson later also placed his Republican challenger, [[Barry Goldwater]], under FBI surveillance, with a federal wiretap.&lt;ref&gt;Pitney, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nixon Administration''': During the [[Richard Nixon]] administration, White House staffers compiled lists of names of political opponents, journalists who had criticized Nixon, and artists and actors (such as [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Paul Newman]]) who had dissented with Nixon policy, especially on the subject of Vietnam, with the intent of prompting Internal Revenue Service investigations. The full extent of Nixon's surveillance of private citizens solely on the basis of their dissent was not known until years after Nixon was forced to resign, as former staff members such as [[Charles Colson]] and [[John Dean]] began to disclose details.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  [[Nixon's Enemies List]] is the informal name of what started as a list of President Richard Nixon’s major political opponents compiled by Charles Colson, written by George T. Bell [1] (assistant to Colson, special counsel to the White House) and sent in memorandum form to John Dean on September 9, 1971. The list was part of a campaign officially known as “Opponents List” and “Political Enemies Project.” The official purpose, as described by the White House Counsel’s Office, was to “screw” Nixon’s political enemies, by means of tax audits from the IRS, and by manipulating “grant availability, federal contracts, litigation, prosecution, etc.”&lt;ref&gt;"List of White House 'Enemies' and Memo Submitted by Dean to the Ervin Committee," ''Facts on File, Watergate and the White House'', vol. 1, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ford Administration''': During the [[Gerald Ford]] presidency, Deputy Assistant [[Dick Cheney]] suggested in a now-infamous memo to [[Donald Rumsfeld]] that the White House use the [[United States Justice Department]] to conduct opposition research and retaliate against political opponents and critical journalists such as [[Seymour Hersh]] and the [[New York Times]], arguing that the executive branch had the power to prosecute journalists as they saw fit, under the provisions of the [[Espionage Act of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newswar/preview/documents.html Dick Cheney's Memos from 30 Years Ago] – Frontline.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reagan Administration''': In 1984, during the [[Ronald Reagan]] presidency, the [[Republican National Committee]] formed [[The Opposition Research Group]], with its own budget of $1.1 million. These staff amassed information on eight Democratic presidential candidates based on data from voting records, Congressional Record speeches, media clippings and transcripts, campaign materials, all of which was stored on a computer for easy access. In this way the Reagan team was able to track inconsistencies and attack them. This original data base evolved into a network that linked information gleaned by Republicans in all 50 states, creating a master data base accessible to high-ranking Republican staff, even aboard [[Air Force One]].&lt;ref&gt;J.M Bayer &amp; J. Rodota, "Computerized Opposition Research," ''Campaigns &amp; Elections'', 6, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this RNC database was accessible to both the Reagan White House and campaign team, no evidence has surfaced that U.S. federal dollars funded [[The Opposition Research Group]] or its efforts.
* '''Clinton Administration''': During the [[Bill Clinton]] administration, the "[[White House FBI files controversy|Filegate]]" scandal erupted when White House staffers said to be acting on the directions of First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] improperly accessed 500 FBI files compiled for security checks of Reagan and Bush staffers in previous administrations. Craig Livingstone, said to be hired by Mrs. Clinton with dubious credentials, resigned amid public outcry. In testimony under oath during the [[Kenneth Starr]] special prosecutor's investigation, Mrs. Clinton stated that she had neither hired Livingstone nor improperly perused the files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=George Lardner Jr. |author2=Susan Schmidt |title=Livingstone Resigns, Denying Ill Intent |work=Washington Post |date=June 27, 1996 |page=A01 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/stories/wwtr960627.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''George W. Bush Administration''': Two former opposition researchers for the RNC appointed to Justice Department posts, [[Timothy Griffin]] and [[Monica Goodling]], were implicated in efforts to use data collected on Democratic-appointed federal attorneys as ground for dismissal. See [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy]]. See also [[Karl Rove]].  Also during this administration,  [[Counterintelligence Field Activity]] (CIFA), an intelligence gathering arm of [[the Pentagon]] was disbanded in 2008, after investigations into the bribery activities directed at [[Duke Cunningham]] revealed that the U.S. government kept a sizeable database of information about 126 domestic peace activist groups, including [[Quakers]], about 1,500 "suspicious incidents" including peace demonstrations outside armed forces recruiter offices, even though the groups posed no specified threat to national security.  The program was known as Talon. About two years elapsed between the program's disbanding and the ''Post'' report. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' quoted an unnamed "official" as saying,"On the surface, it looks like things in the database that were determined not to be viable threats were never deleted but should have been," the official said. "You can also make the argument that these things should never have been put in the database in the first place until they were confirmed as threats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Walter |last=Pincus |title=Pentagon Will Review Database on U.S. Citizens |work=Washington Post |date=December 15, 2001 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/14/AR2005121402528.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Barack Obama Administration:'''  In February 2009, Shauna Daly, a former opposition researcher for the Democratic National Committee was appointed as a researcher for the White House's Office of Legal Counsel. Daly was [[Barack Obama]]'s deputy research director during the presidential campaign, spent much of the cycle rebutting viral online attacks on Obama's character and biography under the rubric of "Stop the Smears." Shortly thereafter, amid speculations that she would be conducting research against political opponents,  she was reassigned as Research Director to the DNC.  Politico.com reported on February 27, 2009 that "the counsel's office – which doesn't face the sort of rapid-response demands that were common in the late Clinton years – doesn't plan to fill the research post."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Smith, ''Politico.com'', February 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The American Spectator]]'' reported on its "Washington Prowler" blog that Daly was posted in the White House Counsel's Office for "about a month," and thus had access to "reams of Bush administration documents related to such things as the firings of U.S. Attorney, the use and internal debate over the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] and the [[Scooter Libby]] and [[Karl Rove]] investigations.  The "Prowler" quoted  "a DNC staffer" as saying, "She realized that she could do more with all the material she saw outside of the building than inside where she'd be bound by the rules and legalities of the White House Counsel's Office.  Now she isn't.  She's good at what she does; her time at the White House means we've got a mother load (''sic'') of material that will have Republicans scrambling.  At least that's what we hope."&lt;ref&gt;"The Washington Prowler," [[The American Spectator]], March 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court==

In 1916, after President [[Woodrow Wilson]] nominated [[Louis Brandeis]] for the Supreme Court, "concerned" citizens seeking to block his confirmation offered information that Brandeis was a "radical Zionist," even though he was not a practicing Jew. Brandeis aggressively outmaneuvered his detractors by mounting his own opposition research efforts, including a carefully constructed chart that exposed the social and financial connections of the group, mostly from Boston's Back Bay, and including Harvard president [[Lawrence Lowell]], as well as a group headed by former President [[William Howard Taft]] and a host of [[American Bar Association]] past presidents. Brandeis sent the chart to [[Walter Lippman]] at the ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' who penned an editorial condemning "the most homogeneous, self-centered, and self-complacent community in the United States."  Brandeis was confirmed after four months of hearings, in a Senate vote of 47–22.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boudin|first=Michael|date=1976|editor-last=Urofsky|editor-first=Melvin I.|editor2-last=Levy|editor2-first=David W.|editor3-last=Brandeis|editor3-first=Louis D.|title=Justice Brandeis: The Confirmation Struggle and the Zionist Movement|jstor=795344|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=85|issue=4|pages=591–596|doi=10.2307/795344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Reagan]] nominated Judge [[Robert Bork]] for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987, prompting a Senate floor speech from Democratic Massachusetts senator [[Ted Kennedy]], which later became known as the "Robert Bork's America" speech:
::&lt;small&gt;Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is – and is often the only – protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy.&lt;/small&gt;

Kennedy's speech prompted a rapid-response opposition research effort from Democrats, but the White House waited two and a half months to respond. The [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], under the direction of Delaware senator and presidential hopeful [[Joseph Biden]], commissioned a report in response to the materials Reagan's staff had released in support of Bork's nomination. Prepared by a panel of lawyers, including two Duke University law professors, the 78-page became known as "The Biden Report." The report detailed Bork's record, and analyzed the pattern of his rulings, and deeming him to be a conservative "activist" rather than an impartial jurist  Ultimately, Bork's embattled nomination failed, and Anthony Kennedy (no relation to Ted) was later confirmed to fill the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report Assails Bork's Record On Constitutional Questions |agency=AP |work=New York Times |date=September 4, 1987 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/us/report-assails-bork-s-record-on-constitutional-questions.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Christopher H. |last1=Schroeder |first2=Jeffrey |last2=Peck |title=Response Prepared to White House Analysis of Judge Bork’s Record (Biden Report) |date=September 2, 1987 |journal=Cardozo Law Review |volume=9 |pages=219–296 |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fierce research-based opposition to Bork's nomination attracted significant media attention, even though a [[Gallup Poll]] on the eve of the confirmation vote showed that very few Americans could name the nominee in question, much less recall his rulings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gallup Poll'' (2007), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; A new verb was later coined; "to bork" a candidate or nominee by mounting such voluminous research and vocal opposition that the person in question would be forced to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]] (2001, May 27).

After President [[George W. Bush]] nominated [[Harriet Miers]] to the U.S. Supreme Court, the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reported that Republican conservative advocacy groups were conducting opposition research against her: "Groups are circulating lists of questions they want members of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] to ask Miers at her confirmation hearings. The activists' thinly veiled hope is that Miers will reveal ignorance of the law and give senators a reason to oppose her."&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Savage, "Guess Who's Doing Opposition Research Against Harriet Miers?" ''Boston Globe'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Miers later withdrew her name from consideration for the court.

On July 7, 2005, soon after the resignation of Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], the [[Democratic National Committee]] gathered and circulated information on the "anti-civil rights" and "anti-immigrant" rulings of [[Samuel A. Alito, Jr.]], by then nominated by President [[George W. Bush]] to replace her. Upon inspection, the documents were revealed to have been amended by [[Devorah Adler]], research director for the DNC. Alito's "record" had been pointedly altered to present him in a negative light. While the incident was not unusual, it received publicity in prominent places because it drew attention to the "meta-data" that is often unwittingly stored in documents that are altered and forwarded electronically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Zeller, Jr.]], "Beware Your Trail of Digital Fingerprints," ''New York Times'', November 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2009, after Supreme Court Justice [[David Souter]] announced his intent to retire from the court, the ''New York Times'' reported that Curt Levey, executive director of the Committee for Justice, had noted that conservatives were "focusing opposition research efforts on 17 women, whom they have divided into two tiers based on their perceived chances."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie Savage]], "Wider World of Choices to Fill Souter's Vacancy," ''New York Times'', May 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven aides to members of the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] pleaded guilty on January 7, 2010, to illegal use of state resources for campaign activities, including opposition research against the political opponents of incumbent officeholders during 2007. These seven were Democrats; a total of 25 indictments have been handed down to a mix of Democrats and Republican politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Seven Former House Aides Plead Guilty in State Corruption Scandal," ''Themorningcall.com'', January 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Lamar Alexander]]'s 2002 campaign for the U.S. Senate, Alexander's campaign staff received an anonymous mailing of a photograph of opponent [[Bob Clement]] obviously serving as a board member of a failed bank whose owners had been imprisoned for bank fraud.  When the Alexander campaign raised the issue of Clement's financial ties with the convicted felons, Clement denied any connection.  When the Alexander campaign produced the photograph as evidence, Clement claimed his role was only an informal advisory one.&lt;ref&gt;Erik, Schellzig (Associated Press) "Opposition Research is 'Dark Art' for Campaigns," Jackson, Tennessee, ''Sun'', August 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early July 2009 Alaska governor Sarah Palin announced that she would be resigning as governor, partly due to complications from opposition research and ethics inquiries after her inclusion on the 2008 GOP presidential race ballot as John McCain's running mate. At a later news conference Palin told reporters, "Obviously conditions had changed so drastically on August 29, the day I was tapped to be VP," she said. "The opposition research and the games that began there — which I think is the new normal in Alaska politics, until I hand the reins over to Sean Parnell — have been so distracting."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pennsylvania state legislature in July 2009, former state House Democratic Campaign Committee Chair, Rep. [[Stephen Stetler]] found himself amidst an investigation when he rejected a plan that would have shifted the job of opposition research from employees on the state payroll to private firms.  Attorney General [[Tom Corbett]] alleged that millions in public funds were paid to state employees who did such research on the 2006 and 2004 campaigns of Democrats in the state.  Stetler left the House after 2006 to become the state's revenue secretary. A former aide, Dan Wiedemer testified before grand jurors that the suggestion to remove politically motivated research from the hands of public employees "was more or less shot down."  Though Stetler has not been charged, 12 former House members and members of their staff were charged with diverting public funds for political campaign work.&lt;ref&gt;Tracie Mauriello and [[Dennis B. Roddy]], "Ex-aide's Testimony in Probe Revealed," ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Stetler was among those subpoenaed, said Chuck Ardo, a spokesman for Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell.

== In other countries ==

'''Australia'''

In October 2011, a media storm erupted in Australia over the leaking of 'dirt files' compiled by the [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] and further revelations that a former [[Australian Labor Party]] operative had been engaged to help compile the dossiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2011/s3337736.htm LNP caught with 'personal dirt files'] – The World Today.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite protestations that key party personnel had no knowledge of the dossiers it was later revealed a [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] opposition research strategist had been compiling the files as part of a [[SWOT analysis]] at previous elections which formed the basis of negative attack messaging for a 'rapid response unit'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/swot-tactics-used-in-2009/story-e6freoof-1226166240001 SWOT tactics used in 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===

In January 2017, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) was exposed when [[Sihle Bolani]] filed an affidavit in the [[Gauteng Division|Johannesburg High Court]], demanding payment for her part in project War Room. The War Room's mandate was to “disempower [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|DA]] and [[Economic Freedom Fighters|EFF]] campaigns” and set a pro-ANC agenda using a range of media, without revealing the [[African National Congress|ANC’s]] hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amabhungane.co.za/article/2017-01-24-inside-the-ancs-black-ops-election-campaign|title=Inside the ANC’s "black ops" election campaign|website=amabhungane.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass media ethics==

The practice of using tips from opposition research sources was examined in 1994 by [[Howard Kurtz]], media analyst for ''The Washington Post''. Kurtz surveyed the major networks, ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and other influential media outlets, and found varying levels of use of oppo research information on [[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]] as a witness in the [[Whitewater controversy]]. At this time, Brown confirmed that he had been the source of four mainstream media stories that had received attention from the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' because they bore striking resemblance to the opposition research being disseminated by Citizens United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Kurtz |title=Muckrakers and the Mudslinger: Should Media Treat Floyd Brown Seriously? |work=The Washington Post |date=April 19, 1994 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-886599.html |url-access=subscription |via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Far from being detached observers, reporters constantly call oppo staffs looking for tidbits and sometimes trading information," wrote three reporters, [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]], [[Gloria Borger]], and [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]], for ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Cooper, Gloria Borger, and Michael Barone, "Dirty Tricks?  Cheap Shots?  Says Who?" ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'', July 6, 1992, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political infighting==

In the spring of 2007, [[Roger Stone]], a political consultant in the employ of New York state senator [[Joseph Bruno]], was forced to resign after leaving threatening phone messages on the answering machine of the 85-year-old father of New York Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]], alleging that Spitzer's campaign finances were conducted improperly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |title=Political Consultant Resigns After Allegations of Threatening Spitzer's Father |date=April 23, 2007 |page=1 |last1=Hakim |first1=Danny |last2=Confessore |first2=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/23/nyregion/23stone.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November of that same year, Stone sent a letter to the FBI detailing Spitzer's sexual preferences with prostitutes and sexual props, right down to his black calf-length socks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Murray |last=Weiss |title='Two on One' vs. Spitzer |work=New York Post |date=April 24, 2008 |page=1 |url=https://nypost.com/2008/04/24/two-on-one-vs-spitzer/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone was considered to be an authoritative source because he frequented the same prostitutes as a client himself. A subsequent Justice Department investigation produced evidence that ultimately led to Spitzer's resignation as governor. [[Joseph Bruno]], Stone's client, has been a longtime political enemy of Eliot Spitzer.

==In popular culture==
The television show ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' depicts many examples of opposition research, particularly the character of Doug Stamper, the loyal adviser to [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Francis "Frank" Underwood]], who regularly engages in the practice with little morality and few ethics.

'''Petrophysics''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πέτρα, ''petra'', "rock" and φύσις, ''[[physis]]'', "nature") is the study of physical and chemical rock properties and their interactions with [[fluid]]s.&lt;ref name="Tiabb"&gt;{{cite book |title= Petrophysics|author1=Tiabb, D.  |author2=Donaldson, E.C. |lastauthoramp=yes |year= 2004|publisher= Elsevier|location= Oxford|isbn= 0-7506-7711-2|page= 1|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pGb6jaa5IVYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major application of petrophysics is in studying [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoirs]] for the [[hydrocarbon industry]].  Petrophysicists are employed to help [[reservoir engineering|reservoir engineers]] and [[Earth science|geoscientists]] understand the rock properties of the reservoir, particularly how pores in the subsurface are interconnected, controlling the accumulation and migration of hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name="Tiabb"/&gt;  Some of the key properties studied in petrophysics are [[lithology]], [[porosity]], [[water saturation]], [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] and [[density]].  A key aspect of petrophysics is measuring and evaluating these rock properties by acquiring [[well log]] measurements – in which a string of measurement tools are inserted in the borehole, [[coring|core]] measurements – in which rock samples are retrieved from subsurface, and [[Seismic exploration|seismic]] measurements.  These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical studies and reservoir engineering to give a complete picture of the reservoir.

While most petrophysicists work in the hydrocarbon industry, some also work in the mining and water resource industries.  The properties measured or computed fall into three broad categories: conventional petrophysical properties, rock mechanical properties, and ore quality.

Petrophysical studies are used by [[petroleum engineering]], [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[exploration geophysics]] and other related studies.

==Conventional petrophysical properties==
Most petrophysicists are employed (SS) to compute what are commonly called conventional (or reservoir) petrophysical properties.  These are:

''[[Lithology]]:'' A description of the rock's physical characteristics, such as grain size, composition and texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lithology|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=lithology|work=Earthquake Glossary|publisher=[[US Geological Survey]]|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By studying the lithology of local geological [[outcrop]]s and [[core sample]]s, geoscientists can use a combination of log measurements, such as [[Gamma ray logging|natural gamma]], [[Formation Evaluation Neutron Porosity|neutron]], [[Density logging|density]] and [[Resistivity logging|resistivity]], to determine the lithology down the well.

''[[Porosity]]:'' &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (Anti=tattilization)The percentage of a given volume of rock that is pore space and can therefore contain fluids.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/p/porosity.aspx Porosity]", ''[[Schlumberger]] Oilfield Glossary''. Retrieved 12 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically calculated using data from an instrument that measures the reaction of the rock to bombardment by [[Formation Evaluation Neutron Porosity|neutrons]] or by [[Density logging|gamma rays]] but can also be derived from [[Sonic logging|sonic]] and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance in porous media|NMR]] logging.

''[[Water saturation]]:'' The fraction of the pore space occupied by water.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/w/water_saturation.aspx Water saturation]", ''[[Schlumberger]] Oilfield Glossary''. Retrieved 12 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically calculated using data from an instrument that measures the resistivity of the rock and is known by the symbol &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt;.

''[[Permeability (fluid)|Permeability]]:'' The quantity of fluid (usually hydrocarbon) that can flow through a rock as a function of time and pressure, related to how interconnected the pores are.  [[Drill Stem Test|Formation testing]] is so far the only tool that can directly measure a rock formation's permeability down a well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  In case of its absence, which is common in most cases, an estimate for permeability can be derived from empirical relationships with other measurements such as [[porosity]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance in porous media|NMR]] and sonic logging.

''Thickness'' of rock with enough permeability to deliver fluids to a well bore.  This property is often called “''Net reservoir rock''.”  In the oil and gas industry, another quantity “''Net Pay''” is computed which is the thickness of rock that can deliver hydrocarbons to the well bore at a profitable rate.

Reservoir models are built upon their measured and derived properties to estimate the amount of hydrocarbon present in the reservoir, the rate at which that hydrocarbon can be produced to the Earth’s surface through wellbores and the fluid flow in rocks.  In the water resource industry, similar models are used to compute how much water can be produced to the surface over long periods of time, without depleting the aquifer.

==Rock mechanical properties==
Some petrophysicists use acoustic and density measurements of rocks to compute their mechanical properties and strength. They measure the compressional (P) wave velocity of sound through the rock and the shear (S) wave velocity and use these with the density of the rock to compute the rocks' ''compressive strength'', which is the compressive stress that causes a rock to fail, and the rocks' ''flexibility'', which is the relationship between stress and deformation for a rock. [[Converted-wave analysis]] is also used to determine subsurface lithology and porosity.

These measurements are useful to design programs to drill wells that produce oil and gas. The measurements are also used to design dams, roads, foundations for buildings, and many other large construction projects. They can also be used to help interpret seismic signals from the Earth, either man-made seismic signals or those from earthquakes.

==Ore quality==
Bore holes can be drilled into ore bodies (for example coal seams or gold ore) and either rock samples taken to determine the ore or coal quality at each bore hole location or the wells can be wireline logged to make measurements that can be used to infer quality.  Some petrophysicists do this sort of analysis.  The information is mapped and used to make mine development plans.

==Methods of analysis==
''[[Coring]] and [[core analysis]]'' is a direct measurement of petrophysical properties. In the petroleum industry rock samples are retrieved from subsurface and measured by core labs of oil company or some commercial core measurement service companies. This process is time consuming and expensive, thus can not be applied to all the wells drilled in a field.

[[File:wikipedia petrophysics figure 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 1]]
''[[Well logging|Well Logging]]'' is used as a relatively inexpensive method to obtain petrophysical properties downhole. Measurement tools are conveyed downhole using either [[Wireline logging#Wireline log|wireline]] or [[Logging while drilling|LWD]] method.

An example of wireline logs is shown in Figure 1.  The first “track”, shows the natural gamma radiation level of the rock.  The gamma radiation level “log” shows increasing radiation to the right and decreasing radiation to the left.  The rocks emitting less radiation have more yellow shading.  The detector is very sensitive and the amount of radiation is very low.  In clastic rock formations, rocks that have smaller amounts of radiation are more likely to be coarser grained and have more pore space, rocks with higher amounts of radiation are more likely to have finer grains and less pore space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poupon|first=A.|author2=Clavier, C., Dumanoir, J., Gaymard, R., Misk, A.|title=Log Analysis of Sand-Shale SequencesA Systematic Approach|journal=Journal of Petroleum Technology|year=1970|volume=22|issue=7|pages=867–881 |doi=10.2118/2897-PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second track over in the plot records the depth below the reference point which is usually the Kelly bush or rotary table in feet, so these rocks are 11,900 feet below the surface of earth.

In the third track, the electrical resistivity of the rock is presented. The water in this rock is salty and the salt in the water causes the water to be electrically conductive such that lower resistivity is caused by increasing water saturation and decreasing hydrocarbon saturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Brown |first=G. A. |title=A Mathematical Comparison of Common Saturation Equations |conference=SPWLA twenty-seventh annual logging symposium |date=June 1986 |id=1986-T |url=http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=SPWLA-1986-T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth track, shows the computed water saturation, both as “total” water (including the water bound to the rock) in magenta and the “effective water” or water that is free to flow in black.  Both quantities are given as a fraction of the total pore space.

The fifth track shows the fraction of the total rock that is pore space, filled with fluids.  The display of the pore space is divided into green for oil and blue for movable water. The black line shows the fraction of the pore space which contains either water or oil that can move, or be “produced.” In addition to what is included in blackline, the magenta line includes the water that is permanently bound to the rock.

The last track is a representation of the solid portion of the rock.  The yellow pattern represents the fraction of the rock (excluding fluids) that is composed of coarser grained sandstone.  The gray pattern represents the fraction of rock that is composed of finer grained “shale.”  The sandstone is the part of the rock that contains the producible hydrocarbons and water.

==Rock volumetric model for shaly sand formation==
''Symbols and Definitions:''
[[File:wikipedia petrophysics figure 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 2, a petrophysical rock model for clastic rock formation]]

The following definition and petrophysics model are a typical shaly sand formation model which assumes:
1. Shale is composed of silt, clay and their bounded water which will not flow. 
2. Hydrocarbon are stored only in pore space in sand matrix.

ΦT –	Total porosity (PHIT), which includes the pore space in sand and shale.

Sw –	Total water saturation, the fraction of the pore space occupied by water.

Φe –	Effective shale corrected porosity which includes only the pore space in sand. The pore space in shale which is filled with bounded water is excluded.

Swe –	Effective shale corrected water saturation. The volumetric fraction of Φe which is occupied by water.

Vsh – Volumetric fraction of shale.  This includes medium to very fine silt plus clay and the shale bound water.

Φsh – Shale porosity. Volumetric fraction of pore space in shale. These pore space is filled with bounded water by definition.

Key equations:

(1-Φe-Vsh) + Vsh + Φe*Swe + Φe*(1-Swe) = 1

Sandstone matrix volume  +  shale volume  +   water volume in sand   +  hydrocarbon volume in sand  = total rock volume

Φe  = ΦT – Vsh *Φsh

The '''physiological density''' or '''real population density''' is the [[Population|number of people]] per unit area of [[arable land]].

A higher physiological density suggests that the available agricultural [[land]] is being used by more and may reach its output limit sooner than a country that has a lower physiological density.  [[Egypt#Demographics|Egypt]] is a notable example, with physiological density reaching that of Bangladesh, despite much desert.

In [[developmental biology]], an [[embryo]] is divided into two hemispheres: the '''animal pole''' and the '''vegetal pole''' within a [[blastula]].

The animal pole consists of small cells that divide rapidly, in contrast with the vegetal pole below it. In some cases, the animal pole is thought to differentiate into the later embryo itself, forming the three primary [[germ layers]] and participating in [[gastrulation]].

The vegetal pole contains large yolky cells that divide very slowly, in contrast with the animal pole above it. In some cases, the vegetal pole is thought to differentiate into the [[extraembryonic membranes]] that protect and nourish the developing embryo, such as the [[placenta]] in mammals and the [[chorion]] in birds.

In the frog ''[[Xenopus laevis]]'', a pigment pattern provides the [[oocyte]] with features of a radially symmetrical body with a distinct polarity. The animal hemisphere is dark brown, and the vegetal hemisphere is only weakly pigmented. The axis of symmetry passes through on one side the animal pole, and on the other side the vegetal pole. The two hemispheres are  separated by an unpigmented equatorial belt. Polarity has a major influence on the emergence of the embryonic structures. In fact, the axis polarity serves as one coordinate of geometrical system in which early [[embryogenesis]] is organized.&lt;ref&gt;P. Hausen, M. Riebesell: The Early Embryonic Development of Xenopus Laevis - An Atlas of the Histology {{ISBN|0387537406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
The animal pole draws its name from its liveliness relative to the slowly developing vegetal pole. Hence the vegetal pole is named for its relative inactivity relative to the animal pole.

'''Popular culture studies''' is the [[academic discipline]] studying [[popular culture]] from a [[critical theory]] perspective. It is generally considered as a combination of [[communication studies]] and [[cultural studies]]. The first department to offer Popular Culture bachelor's and master's degrees is the [[Bowling Green State University Department of Popular Culture]] which was founded by [[Ray B. Browne]].&lt;ref name="raybrowne"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/education/28browne.html?_r=0 | title=Ray Browne, 87, Founder of Pop-Culture Studies, Dies | publisher=[[New York Times]] | date=27 October 2009 | accessdate=12 March 2014 | author=Fox, Margalit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the work of the [[Frankfurt School]], popular culture has come to be taken more seriously as a terrain of academic inquiry and has also helped to change the outlooks of more established disciplines. Conceptual barriers between so-called [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture]] have broken down, accompanying an explosion in scholarly interest in popular culture, which encompasses such diverse media as [[comic books]], [[television]], and the [[Internet]]. Reevaluation of mass culture in the 1970s and 1980s has revealed significant problems with the traditional view of mass culture as degraded and elite culture as uplifting. Divisions between high and low culture have been increasingly seen as political distinctions rather than defensible aesthetic or intellectual ones.&lt;ref&gt;Mukerji &amp; Schudson 1991:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional theories of popular culture==

===The theory of mass society===
[[Mass society]] formed during the 19th-century [[industrialization]] process through the [[division of labor]], the large-scale industrial organization, the concentration of urban populations, the growing centralization of decision making, the development of a complex and international communication system and the growth of mass political movements. The term "mass society", therefore, was introduced by [[anticapitalism|anticapitalist]], aristocratic ideologists and used against the values and practices of industrialized society. Theories of popular culture are often subjected to bias and originate from a generalist perspective.

As [[Alan Swingewood]] points out in ''The Myth of Mass Culture'',&lt;ref&gt;Swingewood 1977:5-8&lt;/ref&gt; the aristocratic theory of mass society is to be linked to the moral crisis caused by the weakening of traditional centers of authority such as family and religion. The society predicted by [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and others would be dominated by philistine masses, without centers or hierarchies of moral or cultural authority. In such a society, art can only survive by cutting its links with the masses, by withdrawing as an asylum for threatened values. Throughout the 20th century, this type of theory has modulated on the opposition between disinterested, pure autonomous art and commercialized mass culture.

===The theory of culture industry===
Diametrically opposed to the aristocratic view would be the theory of [[culture industry]] developed by [[Frankfurt School]] [[critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]]. In their view, the masses are precisely dominated by an all-encompassing culture industry obeying only to the logic of [[consumer capitalism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s concept of hegemony (see: [[cultural hegemony]]), that is, the domination of society by a specific group which stays in power by partially taking care of and partially repressing the claims of other groups, does not work here anymore. The principle of hegemony as a goal to achieve for an oppressed [[social class]] loses its meaning. The system has taken over; only the state apparatus dominates.

===The theory of progressive evolution===
A third view on popular culture, which fits in the liberal-pluralist ideology and is often called "progressive evolutionism", is overtly optimistic. It sees capitalist economy as creating opportunities for every individual to participate in a culture which is fully democratized through mass education, expansion of leisure time and cheap records and paperbacks. As Swingewood points out in ''The Myth of Mass Culture'',&lt;ref&gt;Swingewood 1977:22&lt;/ref&gt; there is no question of domination here anymore. In this view, popular culture does not threaten [[high culture]], but is an authentic expression of the needs of the people.

==Contemporary popular culture studies==
Aside from precursors such as [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Roland Barthes]], popular culture studies as we know them today were developed in the late seventies and the eighties. The first influential works were generally politically left-wing and rejected the "aristocratic" view. However, they also criticized the pessimism of the Frankfurt School: contemporary studies on mass culture accept that, apparently, popular culture forms do respond to widespread needs of the public. They also emphasized the capacity of the consumers to resist indoctrination and passive reception. Finally, they avoided any monolithic concept of mass culture. Instead they tried to describe culture as a whole as a complex formation of [[discourse]]s which correspond to particular interests, and which can be dominated by specific groups, but which also always are dialectically related to their producers and consumers.

An example of this tendency is Andrew Ross's ''No Respect. Intellectuals and Popular Culture'' (1989). His chapter on the history of jazz, blues and rock does not present a linear narrative opposing the authentic [[popular music]] to the commercial record industry, but shows how popular music in the U.S., from the twenties until today, evolved out of complex interactions between [[Popular culture|popular]], [[avant-garde]] and [[commerce|commercial]] circuits, between lower- and middle-class youth, between [[African American|blacks]] and [[whites]].

===Traces of the theory of culture industry===
{{Cleanup|section|date=July 2010}}
Still the traditional views have a long life.&lt;ref&gt;overview based on Clem Robyns, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The theory which has been abandoned most massively is the monolithic, [[Cultural pessimism|pessimistic]] view on the culture industry of the [[Frankfurt School]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}{{Dubious|date=July 2010}} However, it is still hotly debated. The criticism raised can be summarized in three main arguments. First of all, the culture industry theory has completely abandoned the [[Marxist]] [[dialectic]] conception of society. Every impulse, according to this view, comes from above. Resistance and contradiction are impossible, and the audience is manipulated into passivity. Alan Swingewood and others emphasize that the Frankfurt theory has to be seen in the light of left-wing frustrations about the failure of proletarian revolutions early this century, and the easy submission of the European nations to [[fascism]].

A second reproach is that this view may be as elitist as its aristocratic counterpart. Both establish the lonely, autonomous, avant-garde intellectual as the only light in a zombie society. Thus the former Marxists arrive at an uncritical praise of the elitist and antirevolutionary upper-class culture. This brings us to a third argument, already made in the sixties by [[Umberto Eco]].&lt;ref&gt;Eco 1988&lt;/ref&gt; In a state-dominated mass society, the lonely, lucid, intellectual [[Übermensch]] can only retreat in his ivory tower. The historicity of the contemporary situation is not taken into account, so its internal contradictions are ignored, and thus revolution can only be seen as purely utopian. The culture industry theory, therefore, would lead to passivity and thereby becomes an objective ally of the system it pretends to criticize.

It is of course mainly the influence exercised by the Frankfurt School which matters here: not all of their texts present the same rigid view. In ''Das Schema der Massenkultur'',&lt;ref&gt;Adorno 1973-1986:331&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, Adorno discusses a "nucleus of individuality" that the culture industry cannot manipulate, and which forces him to continuously repeat his manipulation.

However questioned this view on popular culture may be, it still leaves some traces, for instance, in theories depicting [[narrative]] as necessarily ideologically conservative, like Charles Grivel's ''Production de l'intérêt romanesque''.&lt;ref&gt;Grivel 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Such theories see dominant ideology as purely a matter of messages, propagated in this case through the forms of narrative fiction. Thus they easily arrive at an exaltation of experimental literature as necessarily revolutionary. However, they may neglect the fact that the ideology is never simply in the message, but in the position of the message in the general social discourse, and in the position of its producers in the social formation.

Other theories easily yielding to monolithic thought stem from the emancipation movements of oppressed groups. Early [[feminist theory]], for instance, often described society as universally and transhistorically dominated by patriarchy in every aspect of life, thereby presenting a pejorative view of the women they claim to defend. As Andrew Ross&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989&lt;/ref&gt; argues, the same remark goes for the widely accepted account of rock history as a continuous appropriation of [[Afro-American music|black music]] by a white [[music industry]]. Only studies analyzing the cultural oppression of homosexuality seem to take a less deterministic position.

===Contemporary liberal pluralism===
In liberal-pluralist accounts of popular culture, the theorizing on its supposedly liberating, democratizing function is nowadays most often pushed to the background. This type of criticism, often produced by people who are also active in popular literary writing themselves, often amounts to paraphrase and suffers from an uncritical identification with the study object. One of the main aims of this type of criticism is the establishment of ahistorical [[wiktionary:canon|canon]]s of and within popular genres in the image of legitimized culture. This approach, however, has been accused of [[elitism]] as well.

To put it simply: the [[intellectual]], in this view, can fully enjoy junk culture because of his or her high culture background, but the average reader can never raise to the learned intellectual discourse of which he or she is the object. An example of this form of appropriation is Thomas Roberts's ''An Aesthetics of Junk Fiction'' (1990). Though Roberts claims to take a distance from studies of canonical fiction, he justifies his (implicit) decision to impose canonical models on [[popular fiction]] as follows: "If people who read [[Goethe]] and [[Alessandro Manzoni]] and [[Pushkin]] with pleasure are also reading [[detective fiction]] with pleasure, there is more in the detective story than its critics have recognized, perhaps more than even its writers and readers have recognized",&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1989:5&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates a frequent strategy: the legitimation of popular fiction on the basis of its use of canonized [[literary fiction]], and of the legitimized public's response to it.

If we consider all the views depicted in the present article as instances of both the thesis and the antithesis of an argument, it is a less known scholar, [[Blanca de Lizaur]] who manages to finally produce the synthesis. In the sociological line of Mims and Lerner, she sees Literature as a ''necessary'' social institution -id est: fulfilling an essential social need: That of explaining, justifying and promoting its society's world-view, values, ideas and beliefs, through depicting them "in action" in lyrics and narratives from which we all learn. Not only this: The expression of the feelings that may be expected to accompany depicted actions and events, also constitutes a fundamental part of its social role, as we naturally expect Literature to constructively account for, inform, modulate and educate our feelings. Hence why Literature is present in every human culture, all along history.

Because of its fundamental role and our need for it, Literature will always find its way to, and adapt to the latest technologies and to the furthest reaching distribution channels available. It is also because of this reason that works that successfully represent their audiences' values, ideas and beliefs, and attain commercial success, will at the same time become the subject of unsurmountable pressures -...losing success once power actors manage to substitute their society's message for their own.

De Lizaur, emerging from the field of Literary Studies, also developed a full literary theory that accounts for popular works' aesthetics, strategies, resources, genres, and meaningful criticism, as opposed to ideologized or prejudiced criticism.

===Contemporary apocalyptic thought===
[[Image:MarshallMcLuhan.png|thumb|205px|right|[[Marshall McLuhan]] caused wide irritation with his statement that the traditional, book-oriented intellectuals had become irrelevant for the formulation of cultural rules in the [[electronic age]].]]
Equally alive is the aristocratic apocalyptic view on mass culture as the destruction of genuine art. As Andrew Ross&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989:5&lt;/ref&gt; writes, a history of popular culture is also a history of intellectuals, of cultural experts whose self-assigned task it is to define the borders between the popular and the legitimate. But in contemporary society the dispersed authority is ever more exercised by "technical" intellectuals working for specific purposes and not for mankind. And in the academic world, growing attention for popular and marginal cultures threatens the absolute values on which intellectuals have built their autonomy.

In the sixties, [[Marshall McLuhan]] caused wide irritation with his statement that the traditional, book-oriented intellectuals had become irrelevant for the formulation of cultural rules in the electronic age. This is not to say that they lost any real political power, which humanist intellectuals as such hardly ever had. It does mean, however, that they are losing control of their own field, the field of art, of restricted symbolical production ([[Pierre Bourdieu]]). While in the 19th century, intellectuals managed to construct art as a proper, closed domain in which only the in-crowd was allowed to judge, they have seen this autonomy become ever more threatened by 20th-century mass society. The main factor here was not the quantitative expansion of consumption culture, nor the intrusion of commerce into the field of art through the appearance of paperbacks and [[Book sales club|book clubs]]. After all, protecting art from simplicity and commerce was precisely the task intellectuals set for themselves.

More important is the disappearance of what has been called the [[Metanarrative|"grand narratives"]] during this century, the questioning of all-encompassing world views offering coherent interpretations of the world and unequivocal guides for action. As Jim Collins argues in Uncommon Cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1989:2&lt;/ref&gt; there is no master's voice anymore, but only a decentralized assemblage of conflicting voices and institutions. The growing awareness of the historical and cultural variability of moral categories had to be a problem for an intellectual class which had based its position on the defense of secular but transhistorical values.

This brings us to a second problem humanist intellectuals face, that is, the fragmentation of the public. 19th-century intellectuals could still tell themselves that they were either writing for their colleagues, or teaching the undifferentiated masses. 20th-century intellectuals face a heterogeneous whole of groups and media producing their own discourses according to their own logic and interests. Thus they cannot control the reception of their own messages anymore, and thereby see their influence on the structuring of culture threatened. Many neo-apocalyptic intellectuals, such as [[Alain Finkielkraut]] and [[George Steiner]], emphasize their concern about the growing "illiteracy" of the masses. In practice they seem to be mainly concerned with high culture illiteracy, the inability to appreciate difficult art and literary classics.

The neo-aristocratic defense of so-called transhistorical and universal human values may also often be linked to a conservative political project. A return to universal values implies the delegitimation of any group which does not conform to those values. It is no coincidence, therefore, that attempts in the United States to define a common "American cultural legacy" tend to neglect the cultures of ethnic minority groups. Or that the fight against [[franglais]] (French "contaminated" by American English) in France was mainly fought by intellectuals seeing their traditional position in French society threatened by the import of American cultural products, as Clem Robyns&lt;ref&gt;Robyns 1995&lt;/ref&gt; describes.

==Recurring issues in popular culture studies==

===The interactions between popular and legitimized culture===
The blurring of the boundaries between [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture]] is one of the main complaints made by traditional intellectuals about contemporary mass society.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, John Edgar. “Horror and the Gothic’s utility as a cultural resource and critical tool.” ''Palgrave Communications'' 4 (2018): 1-4. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-018-0092-x.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of sociological studies on literary institutions which are held responsible for this mix.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Among the first were commercial [[Book sales club|book clubs]], such as the [[Book of the Month Club|Book-of-the-Month-Club]], appearing from the twenties on. The aggressive reactions they provoked are described by [[Janice Radway]]&lt;ref&gt;Radway 1989&lt;/ref&gt; in "The Scandal of the Middlebrow". According to Radway, the book clubs were perceived as scandalous because they blurred some basic distinctions of cultural discourse. In a society haunted by the spectre of cultural standardization and leveling towards below, they dared to put "serious" fiction on the same level as detective stories, adventure stories, biographies and popular nonfiction. Book clubs were scandalous because they created a space where high and low could meet.

Soon, the term "[[middlebrow]]" was introduced to qualify this phenomenon and to dismiss it as a threat to the authenticity of both high and popular culture. After the book clubs came the mass-production of the [[paperback]] format, and its influence was even more wide-ranging. More about this can be found in Thomas Bonn's book.&lt;ref&gt;Bonn 1989&lt;/ref&gt; It shows through what elaborate strategies the respectable hardcover editors had to go in order to hide the fact that, from the sixties on, paperback publishers had taken over the control on the production of serious literature.

===The possibility of a "subversive" popular culture===
The question whether popular culture or mass culture is inherently conservative, or whether it can be used in a [[Subversion (political)|subversive]] strategy as well,&lt;ref&gt;Browning 2018: 3&lt;/ref&gt; is equally hotly debated. It seems widely accepted that popular culture forms can function at any moment as anti-cultures. [[taste (aesthetics)|"Bad taste"]] products such as [[pornography]] and [[horror fiction]], says for instance Andrew Ross,&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989:231&lt;/ref&gt; draw their popular appeal precisely from their expressions of disrespect for the imposed lessons of educated taste. They are expressions of social resentment on the part of groups which have been subordinated and excluded by today's "civilized society".

The question whether popular culture can actually resist dominant ideology, or even contribute to social change, is much more difficult to answer. Many critics easily read popular fiction and film as "attacks against the system", neglecting both the exact ways in which the so-called revolutionary message is enacted, and the capacities of dominant doctrines to recuperate critical messages. Tania Modleski in "The Terror of Pleasure",&lt;ref&gt;Modleski 1986:159&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, presents [[Exploitation film|exploitation horror films]] as attacks on the basic aspects of bourgeois culture. Thus a loving father cannibalizes his child, and priests turn into servants of the devil. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Clem Robyns 1991&lt;/ref&gt; claim that, by presenting their [[perversion]] as supernatural, or at least pathological, [[horror film]]s precisely contribute to perpetuating those institutions.

Similarly, many critics exalt stories which feature a lone hero fighting for his ideals against an inert and amoral system. Thus Jim Collins in ''Uncommon Cultures''&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1989:30-31&lt;/ref&gt; sees [[crime fiction]] opposing a smart private detective and an inefficient police force as a critique of state justice. On the other hand, Thomas Roberts demonstrates in ''An Aesthetics of Junk Fiction'',&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1990:173-174&lt;/ref&gt; a study of the historical background of the private detective model, how the detective story came into existence in the middle of the 19th century, at the time the institution of state police was developed. This force consisted mainly of lower-class people, but nevertheless disposed of a certain authority over the upper class. The fears among the upper classes for this uncontrolled force were eased by domesticating the police in stories explicitly devoted to them. Their inability to pass on correct judgment was amply demonstrated, and forced them to bow for the individual intellect of the detective, who always belonged to the threatened upper class.

Finally, Umberto Eco's studies on [[Superman]] and [[James Bond]]&lt;ref&gt;Eco 1988:211-256, 315-362&lt;/ref&gt; as myths of a static good-and-evil world view should be mentioned as very early and lucid examples of a combination of [[semiotic]] and political analysis.

Still, there may be ways to wage revolt in an age of [[mass media]]. One way could be to introduce small gradual changes in products otherwise conforming to the requirements of a dominant ideology. The problem here, of course, is that isolated messages get drowned in the discourse as a whole, and that they can be used to avoid real changes. Some scholars, however, describe how opposition forces use the logic of the media to subvert them. In ''No Respect'',&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989:123&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Ross mentions the late sixties [[Yippie]] movement. Yippies would stage media events, such as the public burning of dollar bills in [[Wall Street]], thereby drawing heavy media coverage. This politics of the spectacle brought the [[counterculture]] right into the conservative media and filled their forms with subversive content.

Whether this strategy is effective or not, it points to an important fact: the mass media are not above, but dependent on the public. As Alan Swingewood states in ''The Myth of Mass Culture'',&lt;ref&gt;Swingewood 1977:84&lt;/ref&gt; the ideological messages the mass media receive are already mediated by a complex network of institutions and discourses. The media, themselves divided over innumerable specific discourses, transform them again. And finally the public meaningfully relates those messages to individual existences through the mediation of social groups, family networks, etc., which they belong to.

Pouncing has been a common technique for centuries, used to create copies of portraits and other works that would be finished as oil paintings, engravings, and so on. The most common method involves laying semi-transparent paper over the original image, then tracing along the lines of the image by creating pricked marks on the top sheet of paper.  This pounced drawing made of pricked holes is laid over a new working surface. A powder such as chalk, graphite or pastel is forced through the holes to leave an outline on the working surface below, thus transferring the image. The powder is applied by being placed into a small bag of thin fabric such as cheesecloth, then dabbed onto the pricked holes of the pounced drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Roland Barthes was born on 12 November in the town of [[Cherbourg]] in [[Normandy]]. His father, naval officer Louis Barthes, was killed in a battle during [[World War I]] in the [[North Sea]] before Barthes' first birthday. His mother, Henriette Barthes, and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of Urt and the city of [[Bayonne]]. When Barthes was eleven, his family moved to [[Paris]], though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life.

=== Student years ===
Barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he earned a ''[[Licentiate (degree)#France|licence]]'' in classical literature. He was plagued by ill health throughout this period, suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which often had to be treated in the isolation of [[sanatorium|sanatoria]].&lt;ref name=indep&gt;{{cite news|title=ROLAND BARTHES: A Biography by Louis-Jean Calvet|newspaper=The Independent|author=Ben Rogers|date=8 January 1995|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/death-of-the-author-roland-barthes-a-biography-by-louisjean-calvet-trs-sarah-wykes-polity-press-16325-1567120.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His repeated physical breakdowns disrupted his academic career, affecting his studies and his ability to take qualifying examinations. They also exempted him from military service during [[World War II]].

His life from 1939 to 1948 was largely spent obtaining a ''[[Licentiate (degree)#France|licence]]'' in grammar and [[philology]], publishing his first papers, taking part in a medical study, and continuing to struggle with his health. He received a ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] by thesis) from the [[University of Paris]] in 1941 for his work in [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Schrift, ''Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes and Thinkers'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Feb 4, 2009, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early academic career ===
In 1948, he returned to purely academic work, gaining numerous short-term positions at institutes in [[France]], [[Romania]], and [[Egypt]]. During this time, he contributed to the leftist Parisian paper ''Combat'', out of which grew his first full-length work, ''[[Writing Degree Zero]]'' (1953).

In 1952, Barthes settled at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]], where he studied [[lexicology]] and [[sociology]]. During his seven-year period there, he began to write a popular series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine ''Les Lettres Nouvelles'', in which he dismantled myths of [[popular culture]] (gathered in the ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' collection that was published in 1957). Consisting of fifty-four short essays, mostly written between 1954–1956, ''Mythologies'' were acute reflections of French popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huppatz|first=D.J.|year=2011|title=Roland Barthes, Mythologies|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=3|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing little English, Barthes taught at [[Middlebury College]] in 1957 and befriended the future English translator of much of his work, [[Richard Howard]], that summer in New York City.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Richard Howard. "Remembering Roland Barthes," ''[[The Nation]]'' (November 20, 1982): "Mutual friends brought us together in 1957. He came to my door in the summer of that year, disconcerted by his classes at Middlebury (teaching students unaccustomed to a visitor with no English to speak of) and bearing, by way of introduction, a fresh-printed copy of ''Mythologies''. (''Michelet'' and ''Writing Degree Zero'' had already been published in France, but he was not yet known in America&amp;mdash;not even in most French departments. Middlebury was enterprising.)" Reprinted in ''Signs in Culture: Roland Barthes Today'', edited by Steven Ungar and Betty R. McGraw, University of Iowa Press, 1989, p. 32 ({{ISBN|0-877-45245-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rise to prominence ===
Barthes spent the early 1960s exploring the fields of [[semiology]] and [[structuralism]], chairing various faculty positions around France, and continuing to produce more full-length studies. Many of his works challenged traditional academic views of [[literary criticism]] and of renowned figures of literature. His unorthodox thinking led to a conflict with a well-known Sorbonne professor of literature, [[Raymond Picard]], who attacked the French [[New Criticism]] (a label that he inaccurately applied to Barthes) for its obscurity and lack of respect towards France's literary roots. Barthes' rebuttal in ''Criticism and Truth'' (1966) accused the old, [[bourgeois]] criticism of a lack of concern with the finer points of language and of selective ignorance towards challenging theories, such as [[Marxism]].

By the late 1960s, Barthes had established a reputation for himself. He traveled to the [[United States|US]] and [[Japan]], delivering a presentation at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. During this time, he wrote his best-known work{{According to whom|date=August 2018}}, the 1967 essay "[[Death of the author|The Death of the Author]]," which, in light of the growing influence of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]], would prove to be a transitional piece in its investigation of the logical ends of [[Structuralism|structuralist]] thought.

=== Mature critical work ===
Barthes continued to contribute with [[Philippe Sollers]] to the [[avant-garde]] literary magazine ''[[Tel Quel]]'', which was developing similar kinds of theoretical inquiry to that pursued in Barthes' writings. In 1970, Barthes produced what many consider to be his most prodigious work,{{Who|date=September 2010}} the dense, critical reading of [[Balzac]]'s ''[[Sarrasine]]'' entitled ''[[S/Z]]''. Throughout the 1970s, Barthes continued to develop his literary criticism; he developed new ideals of [[textualism|textuality]] and novelistic neutrality. In 1971, he served as visiting professor at the [[University of Geneva]].

In 1975 he wrote an autobiography titled ''Roland Barthes'' and in 1977 he was elected to the chair of Sémiologie Littéraire at the [[Collège de France]]. In the same year, his mother, Henriette Barthes, to whom he had been devoted, died, aged 85. They had lived together for 60 years. The loss of the woman who had raised and cared for him was a serious blow to Barthes. His last major work, ''[[Camera Lucida (book)|Camera Lucida]]'', is partly an essay about the nature of [[photography]] and partly a meditation on photographs of his mother. The book contains many reproductions of photographs, though none of them are of Henriette.

=== Death ===
On 25 February 1980, Roland Barthes was knocked down by a laundry van while walking home through the streets of Paris. One month later, on March 26,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1980/03/28/le-plaisir-des-sens_2814902_1819218.html?xtmc=roland_barthes&amp;xtcr=436|title=Le plaisir des sens|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; he died from the chest injuries he sustained in that accident.&lt;ref name="wash"&gt;{{cite news|title=Roland Barthes, French Writer, dies at 64|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=27 March 1980|author=J. Y. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings and ideas==

===Early thought===
Barthes' earliest ideas reacted to the trend of [[existentialist]] philosophy that was prominent in France during the 1940s, specifically to the figurehead of existentialism, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Sartre's ''[[What Is Literature?]]'' (1947) expresses a disenchantment both with established forms of writing and more experimental, [[avant-garde]] forms, which he feels alienate readers. Barthes’ response was to try to discover that which may be considered unique and original in writing. In ''Writing Degree Zero'' (1953), Barthes argues that conventions inform both language and style, rendering neither purely creative. Instead, form, or what Barthes calls "writing" (the specific way an individual chooses to manipulate conventions of style for a desired effect), is the unique and creative act. A writer's form is vulnerable to becoming a convention, however, once it has been made available to the public. This means that creativity is an ongoing process of continual change and reaction.

In ''Michelet'', a critical analysis of the French historian [[Jules Michelet]], Barthes developed these notions, applying them to a broader range of fields. He argued that Michelet's views of history and society are obviously flawed. In studying his writings, he continued, one should not seek to learn from Michelet's claims; rather, one should maintain a critical distance and learn from his errors, since understanding how and why his thinking is flawed will show more about his period of history than his own observations. Similarly, Barthes felt that [[avant-garde]] writing should be praised for its maintenance of just such a distance between its audience and itself. In presenting an obvious artificiality rather than making claims to great subjective truths, Barthes argued, avant-garde writers ensure that their audiences maintain an objective perspective. In this sense, Barthes believed that art should be critical and should interrogate the world, rather than seek to explain it, as Michelet had done.

===Semiotics and myth===
Barthes' many monthly contributions, collected in his ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' (1957), frequently interrogated specific cultural materials in order to expose how [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society asserted its values through them. For example, the portrayal of wine in French society as a robust and healthy habit is a bourgeois ideal that is contradicted by certain realities (i.e., that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating). He found [[semiotics]], the study of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], useful in these interrogations. Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were "second-order signs," or "[[connotation (semiotics)|connotation]]s." A picture of a full, dark bottle is a [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]] that relates to a specific signified: a fermented, alcoholic beverage. However, the bourgeoisie relate it to a new signified: the idea of healthy, robust, relaxing experience. Motivations for such manipulations vary, from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the [[status quo]]. These insights brought Barthes in line with similar Marxist theory. Barthes used the term "myth" while analyzing the popular, consumer culture of post-war France in order to reveal that "objects were organized into meaningful relationships via narratives that expressed collective cultural values."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In ''The Fashion System'' Barthes showed how this adulteration of signs could easily be translated into words. In this work he explained how in the fashion world any word could be loaded with idealistic bourgeois emphasis. Thus, if popular fashion says that a ‘blouse’ is ideal for a certain situation or ensemble, this idea is immediately naturalized and accepted as truth, even though the actual sign could just as easily be interchangeable with ‘skirt’, ‘vest’ or any number of combinations. In the end Barthes' ''Mythologies'' became absorbed into bourgeois culture, as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon, being interested in his control over his readership. This turn of events caused him to question the overall utility of demystifying culture for the masses, thinking it might be a fruitless attempt, and drove him deeper in his search for individualistic meaning in art.

===Structuralism and its limits===
As Barthes' work with [[structuralism]] began to flourish around the time of his debates with Picard, his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing, which he felt was overlooked by old criticism. Barthes' "Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.uv.es/fores/Barthes_Structural_Narrative.pdf|title= An Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative|website=uv.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; is concerned with examining the correspondence between the structure of a sentence and that of a larger narrative, thus allowing narrative to be viewed along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] lines. Barthes split this work into three hierarchical levels: ‘functions’, ‘actions’ and ‘narrative’. ‘Functions’ are the elementary pieces of a work, such as a single descriptive word that can be used to identify a character. That character would be an ‘action’, and consequently one of the elements that make up the narrative. Barthes was able to use these distinctions to evaluate how certain key ‘functions’ work in forming characters. For example, key words like ‘dark’, ‘mysterious’ and ‘odd’, when integrated together, formulate a specific kind of character or ‘action’. By breaking down the work into such fundamental distinctions Barthes was able to judge the degree of realism given functions have in forming their actions and consequently with what authenticity a narrative can be said to reflect on reality. Thus, his structuralist theorizing became another exercise in his ongoing attempts to dissect and expose the misleading mechanisms of [[bourgeois]] culture.

While Barthes found [[structuralism]] to be a useful tool and believed that discourse of literature could be formalized, he did not believe it could become a strict scientific endeavour. In the late 1960s, radical movements were taking place in literary criticism. The [[post-structuralist]] movement and the [[deconstruction]]ism of [[Jacques Derrida]] were testing the bounds of the structuralist theory that Barthes' work exemplified. [[Derrida]] identified the flaw of structuralism as its reliance on a transcendental signifier; a symbol of constant, universal meaning would be essential as an orienting point in such a closed off system. This is to say that without some regular standard of measurement, a system of criticism that references nothing outside of the actual work itself could never prove useful. But since there are no symbols of constant and universal significance, the entire premise of structuralism as a means of evaluating writing (or anything) is hollow.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Transition===
Such thought led Barthes to consider the limitations not just of signs and symbols, but also of Western culture's dependency on beliefs of constancy and ultimate standards. He travelled to [[Japan]] in 1966 where he wrote ''Empire of Signs'' (published in 1970), a meditation on Japanese culture's contentment in the absence of a search for a transcendental signifier. He notes that in Japan there is no emphasis on a great focus point by which to judge all other standards, describing the centre of [[Tokyo]], the Emperor's Palace, as not a great overbearing entity, but a silent and nondescript presence, avoided and unconsidered. As such, Barthes reflects on the ability of signs in Japan to exist for their own merit, retaining only the [[Meaning (semiotics)|significance]] naturally imbued by their signifiers. Such a society contrasts greatly to the one he dissected in ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', which was revealed to be always asserting a greater, more complex significance on top of the natural one.

In the wake of this trip Barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work, the essay "[[The Death of the Author]]" (1968). Barthes saw the notion of the author, or authorial authority, in the criticism of literary text as the forced projection of an ultimate meaning of the text. By imagining an ultimate intended meaning of a piece of literature one could infer an ultimate explanation for it. But Barthes points out that the great proliferation of meaning in language and the unknowable state of the author's mind makes any such ultimate realization impossible. As such, the whole notion of the ‘knowable text’ acts as little more than another delusion of Western [[bourgeois]] culture. Indeed, the idea of giving a book or poem an ultimate end coincides with the notion of making it consumable, something that can be used up and replaced in a capitalist market. "The Death of the Author" is considered to be a [[post-structuralist]] work,&lt;ref&gt;Jay Clayton, Eric Rothstein, ''Influence and Intertextuality in Literary History'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1991, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; since it moves past the conventions of trying to quantify literature, but others see it as more of a transitional phase for Barthes in his continuing effort to find significance in culture outside of the [[bourgeois]] norms {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. Indeed, the notion of the author being irrelevant was already a factor of structuralist thinking.

===Textuality and ''S/Z''===
Since Barthes contends that there can be no originating anchor of meaning in the possible intentions of the author, he considers what other sources of meaning or significance can be found in literature. He concludes that since meaning can’t come from the author, it must be actively created by the reader through a process of textual analysis. In his ''[[S/Z]]'' (1970), Barthes applies this notion in an analysis of a short story by Balzac called ''[[Sarrasine]]''. The end result was a reading that established [[five major codes]] for determining various kinds of significance, with numerous lexias throughout the text – a "lexia" here being defined as a unit of the text chosen arbitrarily (to remain methodologically unbiased as possible) for further analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=S/V|last=Barthes|first=Roland|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1974|isbn=0631176071|location=New York|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codes led him to define the story as having a capacity for plurality of meaning, limited by its dependence upon strictly sequential elements (such as a definite timeline that has to be followed by the reader and thus restricts their freedom of analysis). From this project Barthes concludes that an ideal text is one that is reversible, or open to the greatest variety of independent interpretations and not restrictive in meaning. A text can be reversible by avoiding the restrictive devices that ''[[Sarrasine]]'' suffered from such as strict timelines and exact definitions of events. He describes this as the difference between the writerly text, in which the reader is active in a creative process, and a readerly text in which they are restricted to just reading. The project helped Barthes identify what it was he sought in literature: an openness for interpretation.

===Neutral and novelistic writing===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
In the late 1970s Barthes was increasingly concerned with the conflict of two types of language: that of popular culture, which he saw as limiting and pigeonholing in its titles and descriptions, and neutral, which he saw as open and noncommittal. He called these two conflicting modes the [[Doxa]] and the [[paradox|Para-doxa]]. While Barthes had shared sympathies with Marxist thought in the past (or at least parallel criticisms), he felt that, despite its anti-ideological stance, Marxist theory was just as guilty of using violent language with assertive meanings, as was [[bourgeois]] literature. In this way they were both Doxa and both culturally assimilating. As a reaction to this he wrote ''[[The Pleasure of the Text]]'' (1975), a study that focused on a subject matter he felt was equally outside the realm of both conservative society and militant leftist thinking: [[hedonism]]. By writing about a subject that was rejected by both social extremes of thought, Barthes felt he could avoid the dangers of the limiting language of the Doxa. The theory he developed out of this focus claimed that, while reading for pleasure is a kind of social act, through which the reader exposes him/herself to the ideas of the writer, the final [[catharsis|cathartic]] climax of this pleasurable reading, which he termed the bliss in reading or [[jouissance]], is a point in which one becomes lost within the text. This loss of self within the text or immersion in the text, signifies a final impact of reading that is experienced outside the social realm and free from the influence of culturally associative language and is thus neutral with regard to social progress.

Despite this newest theory of reading, Barthes remained concerned with the difficulty of achieving truly neutral writing, which required an avoidance of any labels that might carry an implied meaning or identity towards a given object. Even carefully crafted neutral writing could be taken in an assertive context through the incidental use of a word with a loaded social context. Barthes felt his past works, like ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', had suffered from this. He became interested in finding the best method for creating neutral writing, and he decided to try to create a novelistic form of rhetoric that would not seek to impose its meaning on the reader. One product of this endeavor was ''[[A Lover's Discourse: Fragments]]'' in 1977, in which he presents the fictionalized reflections of a lover seeking to identify and be identified by an anonymous amorous other. The unrequited lover's search for signs by which to show and receive love makes evident illusory myths involved in such a pursuit. The lover's attempts to assert himself into a false, ideal reality is involved in a delusion that exposes the contradictory logic inherent in such a search. Yet at the same time the novelistic character is a sympathetic one, and is thus open not just to criticism but also understanding from the reader. The end result is one that challenges the reader's views of social constructs of love, without trying to assert any definitive theory of meaning.

===Photography and Henriette Barthes===
Throughout his career, Barthes had an interest in photography and its potential to communicate actual events. Many of his monthly myth articles in the 50s had attempted to show how a photographic image could represent implied meanings and thus be used by bourgeois culture to infer 'naturalistic truths'. But he still considered the photograph to have a unique potential for presenting a completely real representation of the world. When his mother, Henriette Barthes, died in 1977 he began writing ''[[Camera Lucida (book)|Camera Lucida]]'' as an attempt to explain the unique significance a picture of her as a child carried for him. Reflecting on the relationship between the obvious symbolic meaning of a photograph (which he called the studium) and that which is purely personal and dependent on the individual, that which ‘pierces the viewer’ (which he called the punctum), Barthes was troubled by the fact that such distinctions collapse when personal significance is communicated to others and can have its symbolic logic rationalized. Barthes found the solution to this fine line of personal meaning in the form of his mother's picture. Barthes explained that a picture creates a falseness in the illusion of ‘what is’, where ‘what was’ would be a more accurate description. As had been made physical through Henriette Barthes' death, her childhood photograph is evidence of ‘what has ceased to be’. Instead of making reality solid, it reminds us of the world's ever changing nature. Because of this there is something uniquely personal contained in the photograph of Barthes' mother that cannot be removed from his subjective state: the recurrent feeling of loss experienced whenever he looks at it. As one of his final works before his death, ''Camera Lucida'' was both an ongoing reflection on the complicated relations between subjectivity, meaning and cultural society as well as a touching dedication to his mother and description of the depth of his grief.

===Posthumous publications===
A posthumous collection of essays was published in 1987 by [[François Wahl]], ''Incidents''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Culler]], ''Barthes: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford and New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1983, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; It contains fragments from his journals: his ''Soirées de Paris'' (a 1979 extract from his erotic diary of life in Paris); an earlier diary he kept (his erotic encounters with boys in Morocco); and ''Light of the Sud Ouest'' (his childhood memories of rural French life). In November 2007, [[Yale University Press]] published a new translation into English (by Richard Howard) of Barthes' little known work ''What is Sport''. This work bears a considerable resemblance to ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' and was originally commissioned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] as the text for a documentary film directed by [[Hubert Aquin]].

In February 2009, [[Éditions du Seuil]] published ''Journal de deuil'' (Journal of Mourning), based on Barthes' files written from 26 November 1977 (the day following his mother's death) up to 15 September 1979, intimate notes on his terrible loss:
{{quote|The (awesome but not painful) idea that she had not been everything to me. Otherwise I would never have written a work. Since my taking care of her for six months long, she actually had become everything for me, and I totally forgot of ever have written anything at all. I was nothing more than hopelessly hers. Before that she had made herself transparent so that I could write.... Mixing-up of roles. For months long I had been her mother. I felt like I had lost a daughter.}}

He grieved his mother's death for the rest of his life: "Do not say mourning. It's too psychoanalytic. I'm not in mourning. I'm suffering." and "In the corner of my room where she had been bedridden, where she had died and where I now sleep, in the wall where her headboard had stood against I hanged an icon—not out of faith. And I always put some flowers on a table. I do not wish to travel anymore so that I may stay here and prevent the flowers from withering away."

In 2012 the book ''Travels in China'' was published. It consists of his notes from a three-week trip to China he undertook with a group from the literary journal [[Tel Quel]] in 1974. The experience left him somewhat disappointed, as he found China "not at all exotic, not at all disorienting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Sideways Gaze: Roland Barthes' Travels in China|author=Dora Zhang|journal=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=23 June 2012|url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=714&amp;fulltext=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114183654/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=714&amp;fulltext=1|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Roland Barthes' incisive criticism contributed to the development of theoretical schools such as [[structuralism]], [[semiotics]], and [[post-structuralism]]. While his influence is mainly found in these theoretical fields with which his work brought him into contact, it is also felt in every field concerned with the representation of information and models of communication, including computers, photography, music, and literature. One consequence of Barthes' breadth of focus is that his legacy includes no following of thinkers dedicated to modeling themselves after him. The fact that Barthes’ work was ever adapting and refuting notions of stability and constancy means there is no canon of thought within his theory to model one's thoughts upon, and thus no "Barthesism".

==Key terms==
''Readerly'' and ''writerly'' are terms Barthes employs both to delineate one type of literature from another and to implicitly interrogate ways of reading, like positive or negative habits the modern reader brings into one's experience with the text itself. These terms are most explicitly fleshed out in ''[[S/Z]]'', while the essay "From Work to Text", from ''[[Image—Music—Text]]'' (1977), provides an analogous parallel look at the active–passive and postmodern–modern ways of interacting with a text.

===Readerly text===
A text that makes no requirement of the reader to "write" or "produce" their own meanings. The reader may passively locate "ready-made" meaning. Barthes writes that these sorts of texts are "controlled by the principle of non-contradiction" (156), that is, they do not disturb the "common sense," or "Doxa," of the surrounding culture. The "readerly texts," moreover, "are products [that] make up the enormous mass of our literature" (5). Within this category, there is a spectrum of "replete literature," which comprises "any classic (readerly) texts" that work "like a cupboard where meanings are shelved, stacked, [and] safeguarded" (200).&lt;ref name="S/Z"&gt;Barthes, Roland. S/Z: An Essay. Trans. Richard Miller. New York: Hill and Wang, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writerly text===
A text that aspires to the proper goal of literature and criticism: "... to make the reader no longer a consumer but a producer of the text" (4). Writerly texts and ways of reading constitute, in short, an active rather than passive way of interacting with a culture and its texts. A culture and its texts, Barthes writes, should never be accepted in their given forms and traditions. As opposed to the "readerly texts" as "product," the "writerly text is ourselves writing, before the infinite play of the world is traversed, intersected, stopped, plasticized by some singular system (Ideology, Genus, Criticism) which reduces the plurality of entrances, the opening of networks, the infinity of languages" (5). Thus reading becomes for Barthes "not a parasitical act, the reactive complement of a writing", but rather a "form of work" (10).

===The ''Author'' and the ''scriptor''===
''Author'' and ''scriptor'' are terms Barthes uses to describe different ways of thinking about the creators of texts. "The author" is our traditional concept of the lone genius creating a work of literature or other piece of writing by the powers of his/her original imagination. For Barthes, such a figure is no longer viable. The insights offered by an array of modern thought, including the insights of [[Surrealism]], have rendered the term obsolete. In place of the author, the modern world presents us with a figure Barthes calls the "scriptor," whose only power is to combine pre-existing texts in new ways. Barthes believes that all writing draws on previous texts, norms, and conventions, and that these are the things to which we must turn to understand a text. As a way of asserting the relative unimportance of the writer's biography compared to these textual and generic conventions, Barthes says that the scriptor has no past, but is born with the text. He also argues that, in the absence of the idea of an "author-God" to control the meaning of a work, interpretive horizons are opened up considerably for the active reader. As Barthes puts it, "the death of the author is the birth of the reader."&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland. ''Image—Music—Text''. Essays selected and translated by Stephen Heath. New York: Noonday, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 1964, Barthes wrote "The Last Happy Writer" ("''Le dernier des écrivains heureux''" in ''Essais critiques''), the title of which refers to [[Voltaire]]. In the essay he commented on the problems of the modern thinker after discovering the relativism in thought and philosophy, discrediting previous philosophers who avoided this difficulty. Disagreeing roundly with Barthes' description of Voltaire, Daniel Gordon, the translator and editor of ''[[Candide]]'' (The Bedford Series in History and Culture), wrote that "never has one brilliant writer so thoroughly misunderstood another."{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The sinologist [[Simon Leys]], in a review of Barthes' diary of a trip to China during the [[Cultural Revolution]], disparages Barthes for his seeming indifference to the situation of the Chinese people, and says that Barthes "has contrived—amazingly—to bestow an entirely new dignity upon the age-old activity, so long unjustly disparaged, of saying nothing at great length."&lt;ref&gt;[[Leys, Simon]] ''The Hall of Uselessness: Collected Essays'', New York, New York Review Books, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Barthes' ''[[A Lover's Discourse: Fragments]]'' was the inspiration for the name of 1980s [[new wave music|new wave]] duo [[The Lover Speaks]].

[[Jeffrey Eugenides]]' ''[[The Marriage Plot]]'' draws out excerpts from Barthes' ''A Lover's Discourse: Fragments'' as a way to depict the unique intricacies of love that one of the main characters, Madeleine Hanna, experiences throughout the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.publicbooks.org/fiction/the-euphoria-of-influence-jeffrey-eugenidess-the-marriage-plot |title=The Euphoria of Influence: Jeffrey Eugenides's The Marriage Plot |publisher=Publicbooks.org |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2012-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113065904/http://publicbooks.org/fiction/the-euphoria-of-influence-jeffrey-eugenidess-the-marriage-plot |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]'' (2014) by [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], a journalist quotes to the protagonist Riggan Thompson an extract from [[Mythologies (book)|''Mythologies'']]: "The cultural work done in the past by gods and epic sagas is now done by laundry-detergent commercials and comic-strip characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/10/7-secrets-birdman-labyrinth|title=7 Secrets of the 'Birdman' Labyrinth|date=10 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs]]'' (1996) by [[Michael Lehmann]], Brian is reading an extract from ''[[Camera Lucida (book)|Camera Lucida]]'' over the phone to a woman whom he thinks to be beautiful but who is her more intellectual and less physically desirable friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=390|title=CTheory.net|website=www.ctheory.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Elegy (film)|Elegy]]'', based on [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Dying Animal]]'', the character of Consuela (played by [[Penelope Cruz]]) is first depicted in the film carrying a copy of Barthes' ''[[The Pleasure of the Text]]'' on the campus of the university where she is a student.&lt;ref&gt;Manohla Dargis, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/movies/08eleg.html Extracurricular Lessons for Student and Teacher]," review of ''Elegy'', New York Times, August 8, 2008, accessed on 12-9-2015: Of the character of Consuela, Dargis writes, "She was his student and ripe for the plucking, especially in the film, where she enters clutching Roland Barthes's "Pleasure of the Text" to her lush bosom."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurent Binet]]'s novel ''The 7th Function of Language'' is based on the premise that Barthes was not merely accidentally hit by a van but that he was instead murdered, as part of a conspiracy to acquire a document known as the "Seventh Function of Language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956750580|title=The 7th function of language|last=Laurent,|first=Binet,|others=Taylor, Sam, 1970-|isbn=9781910701591|location=London, England|oclc=956750580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22811">The '''science wars''' is a series of [[intellectual]] exchanges, between [[Scientific realism|scientific realists]] and [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] critics, about the nature of scientific theory and intellectual inquiry. They took place principally in the [[United States]] in the 1990s in the academic and mainstream press. Scientific realists (such as [[Norman Levitt]], [[Paul R. Gross]], [[Jean Bricmont]] and [[Alan Sokal]]) argued that scientific knowledge is real, and accused the postmodernists of having effectively rejected scientific [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]],  the [[scientific method]], [[Empiricism]], and scientific knowledge.  Postmodernists interpreted [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ideas about [[scientific paradigm]]s to mean that scientific theories are [[social constructs]], and philosophers like [[Paul Feyerabend]] argued that other, non-realist forms of knowledge production were better suited to serve people's personal and spiritual needs.

Though much of the theory associated with 'postmodernism' (see [[poststructuralism]]) did not make any interventions into the [[natural sciences]], the scientific realists took aim at its general influence. The scientific realists argued that large swaths of scholarship, amounting to a rejection of objectivity and realism, had been influenced by major 20th Century [[poststructuralist]] philosophers (such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and others), whose work they declare to be incomprehensible or meaningless. They implicate a broad range of fields in this trend, including  [[cultural studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[feminist studies]], [[comparative literature]], [[media studies]], and [[science and technology studies]]. They accuse those postmodernist critics who did actually discuss science of having a limited understanding of it.

==Historical background==
Until the mid-20th century, the [[philosophy of science]] had concentrated on the viability of scientific method and knowledge, proposing justifications for the truth of scientific theories and observations and attempting to discover at a philosophical level why science worked. 
[[Karl Popper]], an early opponent of [[logical positivism]] in the 20th century, repudiated the classical observationalist/[[Inductivism|inductivist]] form of [[scientific method]] in favour of [[Falsifiability|empirical falsification]]. He is also known for his opposition to the classical [[justificationism|justificationist]] account of knowledge which he replaced with [[critical rationalism]], "the first ''non justificational philosophy of criticism'' in the history of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[William W. Bartley|Bartley, William W.]] (1964). [http://www.the-rathouse.com/2008/Bartley1964CCR.html "Rationality versus the Theory of Rationality".] In Mario Bunge: ''The Critical Approach to Science and Philosophy''. The Free Press of Glencoe, section IX.&lt;/ref&gt;
His criticisms of scientific method were adopted by several postmodernist critiques.&lt;ref&gt;
[[David Stove|Stove, David Charles]] (1982). ''[[Popper and After]]: [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/stove/500-600.htm Four Modern Irrationalists]'', Oxford: [[Pergamon Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of 20th-century philosophers maintained that logical models of pure science do not apply to actual scientific practice. It was the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' in 1962, however, which fully opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that it did not operate under the simple logical laws put forward by the logical positivist school of philosophy.

Kuhn described the development of scientific knowledge not as a linear increase in truth and understanding, but as a series of periodic revolutions which overturned the old scientific order and replaced it with new orders (what he called "[[paradigm]]s"). Kuhn attributed much of this process to the interactions and strategies of the human participants in science rather than its own innate logical structure. (See [[sociology of scientific knowledge]]).

Some interpreted Kuhn's ideas to mean that scientific theories were, either wholly or in part, ''[[social construction|social constructs]]'', which many interpreted as diminishing the claim of science to representing objective reality (though many social constructivists do not put forward this claim), and that reality had a lesser or potentially irrelevant role in the formation of scientific theories. In 1971,  [[Jerome Ravetz]] published ''[[Scientific knowledge and its social problems|Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems]]'', a book describing the role that the scientific community, as a social construct, plays in accepting or rejecting objective scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="isbn0195197216 "&gt;{{cite book |author=Ravetz, Jerome R. |title=Scientific knowledge and its social problems |publisher=Oxford Univ. Press |location=Oxford |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-519721-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postmodernism ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
{{Further information|New Left|Critical theory}}
A number of different philosophical and historical schools, often grouped together as "[[postmodernism]]", began reinterpreting scientific achievements of the past through the lens of the practitioners, often positing the influence of politics and economics in the development of scientific theories in addition to scientific observations. Rather than being presented as working entirely from positivistic observations, many scientists of the past were scrutinized for their connection to issues of gender, sexual orientation, race, and class. Some more radical philosophers, such as [[Paul Feyerabend]], argued that scientific theories were themselves incoherent and that other forms of knowledge production (such as those used in [[religion]]) served the material and spiritual needs of their practitioners with equal validity as did scientific explanations.

[[Imre Lakatos]] advanced a midway view between the "postmodernist" and "realist" camps. For Lakatos, scientific knowledge is progressive; however, it progresses not by a strict linear path where every new element builds upon and incorporates every other, but by an approach where a "core" of a "research program" is established by auxiliary theories which can themselves be falsified or replaced without compromising the core. Social conditions and attitudes affect how strongly one attempts to resist falsification for the core of a program, but the program has an objective status based on its relative explanatory power. Resisting falsification only becomes ''ad-hoc'' and damaging to knowledge when an alternate program with greater explanatory power is rejected in favor of another with less. But because it is changing a theoretical core, which has broad ramifications for other areas of study, accepting a new program is also revolutionary as well as progressive. Thus, for Lakatos the character of science is that of being both revolutionary and progressive; both socially informed and objectively justified.

==The science wars==
In ''[[Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science]]'' (1994), the scientists [[Paul R. Gross]] and [[Norman Levitt]] accused postmodernists of [[anti-intellectualism]], presented the shortcomings of [[relativism]], and suggested that postmodernists knew little about the scientific theories they criticized and practiced poor [[scholarly method|scholarship]] for political reasons. 
The authors insist that the "science critics" misunderstood the theoretical approaches they criticized, given their "caricature, misreading, and condescension, [rather] than argument".&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Michael J.  (1995). "Review of ''Higher Superstition'' ", ''Contemporary Sociology'', Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 113–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' (Vol. 87, No. 2, 1996), ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' (Vol. 98, No. 2, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Social Studies of Science]]'' (Vol. 26, No. 1, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The review in ''[[The Journal of Higher Education]]'' (Vol. 66, No. 5, 1995) snidely suggested that book's final sentence proved that politics, the epistemology, philosophy, and science are inter-related.&lt;/ref&gt; The book sparked the so-called science wars. ''Higher Superstition'' inspired a [[New York Academy of Sciences]] conference titled ''The Flight from Science and Reason'', organized by Gross, Levitt, and [[Gerald Holton]].&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Levitt, and Martin W. Lewis. (1997). ''The Flight from Science and Reason'' (New York: New York Academy of Science.)&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees of the conference were critical of the [[Polemics|polemical]] approach of Gross and Levitt, yet agreed upon the intellectual inconsistency of how laymen, non-scientist, and social studies intellectuals dealt with science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://picpal.com/sciart.html Kramer, Jennifer. "Who's Flying – And In What Direction?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510055127/http://picpal.com/sciart.html |date=2006-05-10 }} Coverage of the NYAS Flight from Science and Reason conference.  Accessed 15 may 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science wars in ''Social Text''===
In 1996, ''[[Social Text]]'', a [[Duke University]] publication of [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] [[critical theory]], compiled a "Science Wars" issue containing brief articles by postmodernist academics in the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]], that emphasized the roles of society and politics in science. In the introduction to the issue, the ''Social Text'' editor, [[Andrew Ross (academic)|Andrew Ross]], said that the attack upon [[science studies]] was a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Reactionary|reaction]] to reduced funding for scientific research, characterizing the ''Flight from Science and Reason'' conference as an attempted "linking together a host of dangerous threats: [[scientific creationism]], [[New Age]] alternatives and cults, [[astrology]], [[Ufology|UFO-ism]], the radical science movement, postmodernism, and critical science studies, alongside the ready-made historical specters of [[Deutsche Physik|Aryan-Nazi science]] and the Soviet error of [[Lysenkoism]]" that "degenerated into name-calling".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Andrew.  (1996). "Introduction" ''[[Social Text]] 46/47'', Vol. 14, Nos. 1 &amp; 2, pp. 1–13, esp. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Dorothy Nelkin]] characterised Gross and Levitt's vigorous response as a "call to arms in response to the failed marriage of Science and the State"&amp;mdash;in contrast to the scientists' historical tendency to avoid participating in perceived political threats, such as [[creation science]], the [[animal rights movement]], and anti-abortionists' attempts to curb fetal research.{{clarify|date=April 2013}} At the end of the Soviet–American [[Cold War]] (1945–91), [[military funding of science]] declined, while funding agencies demanded accountability, and research became directed by private interests. Nelkin suggested that postmodernist critics were "convenient scapegoats" who diverted attention from problems in science.&lt;ref&gt;Nelkin, Dorothy.  (1996). "The Science Wars: Responses to a Marriage Failed" ''Social Text'' 46/47, Vol. 14, Nos. 1 &amp; 2, pp. 93–100., p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1996, physicist [[Alan Sokal]] had submitted an article to ''Social Text'' titled "[[Sokal affair|Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity]]", which proposed that [[quantum gravity]] is a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] and [[social construct]] and that [[quantum physics]] supports postmodernist criticisms of scientific [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]]. After holding the article back from earlier issues due to Sokal's refusal to consider revisions, the staff published it in the "Science Wars" issue as a relevant contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Bruce and Ross, Andrew. [http://physics.nyu.edu/sokal/SocialText_reply_LF.pdf Editorial Response to the hoax, explaining Social Text's decision to publish]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the May 1996 issue of ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', in the article "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies", Sokal exposed his [[parody]]-article, "Transgressing the Boundaries" as an experiment testing the [[intellectual rigor]] of an [[academic journal]] that would "publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions".&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan. (1996).  "[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity]" ''[[Social Text]] 46/47'', Vol. 14, Nos. 1 &amp; 2, pp 217–252.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter became known as the "[[Sokal Affair]]" and brought greater public attention to the wider conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan. (1996).  "[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies]," ''Lingua Franca'', May/June, pp 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]], a frequent target of "anti-relativist" criticism in the wake of Sokal's article, responded to the hoax in "Sokal and Bricmont Aren't Serious", first published in ''[[Le Monde]]''. He called Sokal's action sad (''triste'') for having overshadowed Sokal's mathematical work and ruined the chance to sort out controversies of scientific objectivity in a careful way. Derrida went on to fault him and co-author Jean Bricmont for what he considered an act of intellectual bad faith: they had accused him of scientific incompetence in the English edition of a follow-up book (an accusation several English reviewers noted), but deleted the accusation from the French edition and denied that it had ever existed. He concluded, as the title indicates, that Sokal was not serious in his approach, but had used the spectacle of a "quick practical joke" to displace the scholarship Derrida believed the public deserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derrida |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Derrida |title=Paper Machine |origyear=1994 |year=2005 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford |page=70 |nopp=true |isbn=978-0-8047-4619-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued conflict===
In the first few years after the 'Science Wars' edition of ''Social Text'', the seriousness and volume of discussion increased significantly, much of it focused on reconciling the 'warring' camps of postmodernists and scientists.  One significant event was the 'Science and Its Critics' conference in early 1997; it brought together scientists and scholars who study science, and featured Alan Sokal and [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]] as keynote speakers.  The conference generated the final wave of substantial press coverage (in both news media and scientific journals), though by no means resolved the fundamental issues of [[social construction]] and [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in science.&lt;ref&gt;Baringer, Philip S. (2001). "Introduction: 'the science wars'", from ''After the Science Wars'', eds. Keith M. Ashman and Philip S. Baringer. New York: Routlege, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attempts have been made to reconcile the two camps. Mike Nauenberg, a physicist at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], organized a small conference in May 1997 that was attended by scientists and sociologists of science alike, among them [[Alan Sokal]], [[N. David Mermin]] and [[Harry Collins]]. In the same year, Collins organized the Southampton Peace Workshop, which again brought together a broad range of scientists and sociologists. The Peace Workshop gave rise to the idea of a book that intended to map out some of the arguments between the disputing parties. ''The One Culture?:  A Conversation about Science'', edited by chemist Jay A. Labinger and sociologist Harry Collins, was eventually published in 2001. The book, the title of which is a reference to [[C.P. Snow]]'s ''[[The Two Cultures]]'', contains contributions from authors such as Alan Sokal, Jean Bricmont, [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Steven Shapin]].&lt;ref&gt;Labinger, Jay A. and [[Harry Collins]]. (2001). "Preface", in: ''The One Culture?:  A Conversation about Science'', eds. Labinger, Jay A and [[Harry Collins]]. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. ix–xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important publications related to the science wars include ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' by Sokal and [[Jean Bricmont]] (1998), ''The Social Construction of What?'' by [[Ian Hacking]] (1999) and ''Who Rules in Science'' by [[James Robert Brown]].

To [[John C. Baez]], the [[Bogdanov Affair]] in 2002&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite web | last = Monastersky | first = Richard | title = French TV Stars Rock the World of Theoretical Physics | work = [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date = November 2, 2002 | url = http://chronicle.com/free/2002/11/2002110501n.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-20 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080207103228/http://chronicle.com/free/2002/11/2002110501n.htm |archivedate = 2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; served as the bookend to the Sokal controversy: the review, acceptance, and publication of papers, later alleged to be nonsense, in peer-reviewed physics journals. [[Cornell University|Cornell]] physics professor [[Paul Ginsparg]], argued that the cases are not at all similar, and that the fact that some journals and scientific institutions have low standards is "hardly a revelation".&lt;ref name="ginsparg"&gt;[[Ginsparg, Paul]]. (2002, November 12). "'Is It Art?'  Is Not a Question for Physics".  ''[[New York Times]]'', section A, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The new editor in chief of the journal ''[[Annals of Physics]]'', who was appointed after the controversy along with a new editorial staff, had said that the standards of the journal had been poor leading up to the publication since the previous editor had become sick and died.&lt;ref name=Chronicle /&gt;

Interest in the science wars has waned considerably in recent years.  Though the events of the science wars are still occasionally mentioned in mainstream press, they have had little effect on either the scientific community or the community of critical theorists.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Both sides continue to maintain that the other does not understand their theories, or mistakes constructive criticisms and scholarly investigations for attacks. As [[Bruno Latour]] recently put it, "Scientists always stomp around meetings talking about 'bridging the two-culture gap', but when scores of people from outside the sciences begin to build just that bridge, they recoil in horror and want to impose the strangest of all gags on free speech since [[Socrates]]: only scientists should speak about science!"&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (1999). ''[http://www.bruno-latour.fr/livres/vii_tdm.html  Pandora's Hope.  Essays on the Reality of Science Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904092247/http://www.bruno-latour.fr/livres/vii_tdm.html |date=2007-09-04 }}'', [[Harvard University Press]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Latour has suggested a re-evaluation of sociology's epistemology based on lessons learnt from the Science Wars: "...&amp;nbsp;scientists made us realize that there was not the slightest chance that the type of social forces we use as a cause could have objective facts as their effects".&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (2005). ''Reassembling the Social.  An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory'', Oxford University Press, USA, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their critiques have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests.

Writing about these developments in the context of [[global warming]], [[Bruno Latour]] noted that "dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives.  Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we said?"&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (2004). ''[http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/89-CRITICAL-INQUIRY-GB.pdf Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern]'', ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'' 30, pp. 225–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kendrick Frazier]] notes that Latour is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that Latour has said that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title='Science Wars' Veteran Latour Now Wants to Help Rebuild Trust in Science |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3895">'''Ship launching airbags''' are specialized air bags that are used for [[Ceremonial ship launching|launching]] marine vessels. This method of launching ships is called [[Airbag launching|airbag launching]]. These air bags are made of synthetic-tire-cord reinforcement layers and rubber layers,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;ISO14409-Ships and marine technology of Ship launching air bags&lt;/ref&gt; and are also known as marine airbags. They were invented in 1980.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The first known use of marine airbags occurred on January 20, 1981 with the launch of a [[tank barge]] from the [[Xiao Qinghe]] [[shipyard]]. From then on, more and more shipyards, especially in [[China]] and [[Southeast Asia]], began to use air bags to launch small and medium-sized vessels.

In recent years, higher strength materials have been used in air bag production, allowing them to have much more bearing capacity. Hence, they have begun to be used at the launchings of larger vessels. In October 2011, the successful launch of one vessel with a [[deadweight tonnage]] (DWT) of 75000 tonnes set a world record for ship launches utilizing air bags.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The following year, on June 6, 2012, the ship "He Ming" ([[IMO number]] 9657105), with a DWT of 73541 tonnes, total length of 224.8m, breadth of 34m, and depth of 18.5m, also launched successfully using air bags&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=He Ming |url=https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:649866/mmsi:414124000/imo:9657105/vessel:HE_MING |website=MarineTraffic |accessdate=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Air bag structure ==

[[File:Airbag structure.pdf|centre|frameless|606x606px]]

Marine air bags consist of three parts:
# '''Air bag body''': the main, cylindrical part of the air bag after being fully inflated with compressed air,
# '''Air bag heads''': conical parts connecting the body and the mouths of the air bag, and
# '''Air bag mouths''': either metal valves mounted on both ends of the air bag for inflating with air or a valve on one end and a metal lug on the other end used to haul the air bag.

== Air bag size and model ==

=== Size ===
The diameter of an air bag varies; sizes include 0.8 m, 1.0 m, 1.2 m, 1.5 m, 1.8 m, etc.

The length of an air bag is specified by the customer when it is manufactured.

=== Model ===
Air bags are commonly divided into three to six tire-cord reinforcement layers. There can be more layers, though there are normally less than ten.

=== Air bag bearing capacity ===
The '''maximum load carrying capacity''' of an air bag, which is the maximum load under which it will suffer no permanent deformation or damage, can be found as follows:
[[File:An air bag being compressed.jpg|border|left]]

'''Let:'''

&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; be the original diameter of the air bag

&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be the height of the compressed air bag

&lt;math&gt;W_{1}&lt;/math&gt; be the width of the air bag contacting the ship bottom

&lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; be the internal pressure of the air bag

&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be the effective length of the air bag

Given these variables,
&lt;math&gt;\text{bearing capacity} = P_{1} \times W_{1} \times L&lt;/math&gt;

=== Air bag materials ===
Ship launching air bags are constructed of synthetic-tire-cord layers; inner and outer rubber layers are sometimes added. All materials used are [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]].

== Air bag test ==

Air tightness test: Without carrying any load, fill the air bag till the internal pressure of the air bag reaches rated working pressure. After 1 hour. The pressure loss should be less than 5 % of initial pressure.

Bursting test： Fill the air bag with water until the air bag bursts. The water pressure at the time of bursting shall be no less than three times of rated working pressure&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The '''Signature Bridge''' is a [[Cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge|cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge]] which spans the [[Yamuna]] river at Wazirabad section, connecting [[Wazirabad, Delhi|Wazirabad]] to [[East Delhi]].&lt;ref name=NDTV&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/signature-bridge-to-be-ready-by-october-arvind-kejriwal-1878987|title= Signature Bridge To Be Ready By October: Arvind Kejriwal|date= 6 July 2018| accessdate=6 July 2018|publisher= www.ndtv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is India's first asymmetrical [[cable-stayed bridge]].&lt;ref name=NDTV/&gt; The [[Tower#Transportation support|pylon]] of the Signature bridge is the tallest structure in Delhi and is double the height of [[Qutb Minar]] with its 154-metre high viewing box, which acts as selfie points for visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/154-metre-high-viewing-box-selfie-points-delhi-s-signature-bridge-opens-tomorrow/story-ss5rUlwFk5PI7Tkz2SV2AL.html|title=154-metre high viewing box, selfie points: Delhi’s Signature Bridge opens today}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shortens the travel time between north and northeast Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/as-signature-bridge-opens-rush-to-ease-on-ring-road-and-nh-9/articleshow/66493331.cms?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=TOIDesktop|title=As Delhi's Signature Bridge opens, rush to ease on Ring Road and National Highway-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Wazirabad bridge on sahibi river.jpg|thumb|left|The old wazirabad bridge]]
In 1997, 28 school students died in an accident on the narrow Wazirabad bridge.&lt;ref name= kolkata24x7/&gt; Since then, the Delhi government had plans to build another parallel wide bridge nearby to alleviate traffic congestions. By the end of 1998, the [[Government of Delhi|Delhi government]] finalised the draft plan for this bridge.&lt;ref name= kolkata24x7/&gt; The bridge was inaugurated on 4 November 2018 by the Chief Minister of Delhi [[Arvind Kejriwal]] with the aim to ease the burgeoning traffic congestion on the existing [[Wazirabad]] bridge.&lt;ref name= Y/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDTV_inaugration"&gt;{{cite news |title=Delhi's Signature Bridge To Have Selfie Spots, Glass Viewing Deck |url=https://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/delhi-signature-bridge-opens-to-public-on-monday-heres-what-it-offers-1942195 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |publisher=NDTV |date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By the end of 1998, the Delhi government finalized the draft plan made by Divyansh Sharma for the construction of the bridge. However, the construction of the bridge was stuck due to multiple reasons - lack of manpower and financial difficulties, being the major reason. When the project started, its cost was estimated to be ₹1,100&amp;nbsp;crore. Now it has surpassed  ₹1,875&amp;nbsp;crores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= More funds for Signature Bridge may help it meet latest dead|url= https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/more-funds-for-signature-bridge-may-help-it-meet-latest-deadline/articleshow/64890739.cms|date=  7 July 2018| accessdate= 7 July 2018 |publisher=Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theweekendleader&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theweekendleader.com/Headlines/13516/delhi-government-clears-signature-bridge-project.html|title=Delhi government clears signature bridge project |date= 6 July 2018| accessdate=7 July 2018|publisher=www.theweekendleader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Delhi|Delhi government]] was tight handed and it was very difficult for it to shell out the extra rising budget. ₹1,244&amp;nbsp;crores of rupees have been sanctioned recently through PBDB. The work had started in full swing in 2004 on the bridge. A fresh deadline of end 2016 was set in 2013.&lt;ref name=theweekendleader/&gt; Since then half a dozen times, deadlines have been missed and fresh deadlines set. Finally, the bridge was inaugurated in November 2018.&lt;ref name=kolkata24x7&gt;{{cite news|url=https://kolkata24x7.com/delhi-may-get-indias-first-asymmetrical-cable-stayed-bridge-by-october-will-decongest-wazirabad-bridge.html|title= নজির গড়ে দেশের বুকে তৈরি হচ্ছে প্রথম ‘অ্যাসমিট্রিক্যাল’ ব্রিজ|date= 6 July 2018| accessdate=6 July 2018|publisher= kolkata24x7.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The bridge is a [[Cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge]], a type of [[Cable-stayed bridge]] and in which cables were in a combination of radial and semi-harp arrangement, in which cables are spaced apart on the pylon, like the harp design, but connect to one point or a number of closely spaced points on the deck.&lt;ref name="Dayaratnam2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=T.K.

'''Soil zoology''' is the study of animals living fully or partially in the [[soil]] ([[soil fauna]]). The term was apparently first used for a conference of soil zoologists presenting their research at the [[University of Nottingham]], UK, in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Soil Zoology. Proceedings of the University of Nottingham, Second Easter School in Agricultural Science, 1955. by D. [[Keith McE. Kevan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry''' ('''SUNY-ESF''', or '''ESF''') is an American, specialized, doctoral-granting institution based in [[Syracuse, New York]]. It is immediately adjacent to [[Syracuse University]], within which it was founded, and with whom it maintains a special relationship. ESF is a part of the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system. ESF also operates facilities in the [[Adirondack Park]] (including the [[SUNY-ESF Ranger School|Ranger School]] in [[Wanakena, New York|Wanakena]]), the [[Thousand Islands]], elsewhere in central New York, and [[Costa Rica]]. The College's curricula focus on the understanding, [[natural resource management|management]] and [[sustainability]] of the environment and natural resources. ESF is considered by [[Peterson's]] to be the premier college in the U.S. for the study of environmental and natural sciences, design, engineering, policy and management of natural resources and the environment.&lt;ref name="petersons.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petersons.com/college-search/state-university-of-new-york-college-of-environmental-science-and-forestry-000_10000544.aspx|title=State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|publisher=Peterson's|accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college has expanded its initial emphasis on forestry to include professional education in environmental science, landscape architecture, environmental studies, and engineering in addition to distinguished programs in the biological and physical sciences.&lt;ref name="petersons.com"/&gt; ESF is ranked at 43rd in the 2017 ''US News &amp; World Report'' rankings of the top public national universities.&lt;ref name=usnwr2019 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/suny-environmental-science-and-forestry-2851|title=SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry - SUNY Environmental Science and Forestry - Best College - US News|publisher=|accessdate=13 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commemorated its centennial in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esf.edu/centennial/ |title=SUNY-ESF Centennial Celebration |publisher=Esf.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|History of the New York State College of Forestry}}

=== Founding ===

The New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was established in 1911 through a bill signed by [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[John Alden Dix]]. The previous year, Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes|Hughes]] had vetoed a bill authorizing such a college.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, A.D. ''Liberty Hyde Bailey: A Story of American Plant Sciences''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Both bills followed the state's defunding, in 1903, of the [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |title=Department of Natural Resources - History |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007112429/http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |archivedate=October 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foresthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cornell_Roots-of-American-Forestry-Education.pdf |format=PDF |title=Roots of American Forestry Education |website=Foresthistory.org |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally a unit of [[Syracuse University]], in 1913, the College was made a separate, legal entity.

Syracuse native and constitutional lawyer [[Louis Marshall]], with a summer residence at [[Knollwood Club]] on Saranac Lake and a prime mover for the establishment of the Adirondack and Catskill [[Forest Preserve (New York)]], became a Syracuse University Trustee in 1910. He confided in Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James R. Day]] his desire to have an agricultural and forestry school at the University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" - 1900-1919 |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315135440/http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1911 his efforts resulted in a New York State bill to fund the project: the aforementioned appropriation bill signed by Governor Dix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Herbert Alpert| title = Louis Marshall: 1856-1929| date = 2008-11-03| isbn = 978-0-595-48230-6| page = 36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall was elected president of the college's Board of Trustees at its first meeting, in 1911; at the time of his death, eighteen years later, he was still president of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Marshall,"Champion of Liberty", selected papers and addresses(in 2 volumes), edited by Charles Reznikoff,1957. Jewish Publication Society, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first dean of the College was [[William L. Bray]], a Ph.D., graduate from the University of Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/ecology/aepsp3.html |title=American Environmental Photographs, 1891-1936 - Ecology and the American Environment (American Memory from the Library of Congress) |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; botanist, plant ecologist, biogeographer and Professor of Botany at Syracuse University. In 1907 he was made head of the botany department at Syracuse, and in 1908 he started teaching a forestry course in the basement of Lyman Hall. Bray was an associate of [[Gifford Pinchot]], who was the first Chief of the [[United States Forest Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = William L.

Retrieved on October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, in addition to assuming the deanship of forestry, Bray organized the Agricultural Division at Syracuse University. He remained at Syracuse until 1943 as chair of botany and Dean of the Syracuse Graduate School.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/BRAY1865.htm Chrono-Biographical Sketch: William Bray]".

In 1915, the same year that Dr. Bray published ''The Development of the Vegetation of New York State'', he became one of the founding members, along with [[Raphael Zon]] and [[Yale School of Forestry]]'s second dean, James W. Toumey, of the [[Ecological Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.org/history/ |title=The Ecological Society of America's History and Records – by the ESA Historical Records Committee |publisher=Esa.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the 1917 "activist wing" of that Society formed today's [[The Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/newyork/preserves/art25679.html |title=New York Nature Conservation, Environment Issues &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=2012-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325075148/http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/newyork/preserves/art25679.html# |archive-date=2010-03-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/pressroom/ip/press/forests.html |title=Conservation &amp; Green News &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the professors, in the early years of the College of Forestry at Syracuse and the Department of Forestry at Cornell's [[New York State College of Agriculture]] were educated in forestry at the [[Yale School of Forestry]]. The forestry students at Syracuse but not at Cornell were referred to as "stumpies" by their classmates.

Fifty-two students were enrolled in the school's first year, the first 11 graduating two years later, in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;SUNY-ESF. 2008. ''Alumni Directory. 100th Anniversary Edition''. Syracuse, NY, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the hallmarks of the College, its research, dates back to 1912, beginning with a study on what firms were using lumber in the state of New York as well as the wood species and quantities.

=== Expansion ===

In 1912, the College opened its [[SUNY-ESF Ranger School|Ranger School]] in [[Wanakena, New York]], in the [[Adirondacks]]. The College began enrolling women as early as 1915, but the first women to complete their degrees—one majoring in landscape engineering and two in pulp and paper—graduated in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.esf.edu/welcome/history.htm A History of ESF]". SUNY-ESF website. Retrieved on October 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1930, Governor [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], recommending an allocation of $600,000 towards construction of the college's second building, in honor of Louis Marshall, recently deceased, noted that: "under [Marshall's] leadership and the leadership of its late dean, [[F. Franklin Moon|Franklin Moon]], the School of Forestry made giant strides until it became recognized as the premier institution of its kind in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Cyrus, "Louis Marshall: A Biographical Sketch", American Jewish Year Book, 1930-31, pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone of Louis Marshall Memorial Hall was laid in 1931 by former Governor and presidential candidate [[Alfred E. Smith]] who was elected to assume the presidency of the college's Board of Trustees.

=== Affiliation with SUNY ===

With the formation of the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) in 1948, the College became recognized as a specialized college within the SUNY system, and its name was changed to State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. In 1972, the College's name was changed yet again to State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Unlike other state-supported degree-granting institutions which had been created at private institutions in New York State, the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was an autonomous institution not administratively part of Syracuse University. In 2000, SUNY System Administration established ESF's "primacy" among the 64 SUNY campuses and contract colleges for development of new undergraduate degree programs in Environmental Science and Environmental Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esf.edu/es/documents/GuidelinesforConsidofnewugDegreePgms6302000.pdf | title=Guidelines for Consideration of New Undergraduate Degree Programs in Environmental Science/Studies| accessdate=2009-07-09| author=Peter D.

ESF's main campus, located in [[Syracuse, New York]], is where most academic and administrative activity takes place. The campus is made up of nine main buildings:

* '''Baker Laboratory''': Named after [[Hugh P. Baker]], Dean of the College from 1912–1920 and again 1930-33. The building is the location of several [[computer cluster]]s and auditorium-style classrooms. It is home to the Department of Environmental Resources Engineering and the Division of Environmental Science. The building underwent a $37 million overhaul in the early 2000s, providing updated space for the Tropical Timber Information Center and the [[Nelson C. Brown]] Center for Ultrastructure Studies. Baker Lab is the site of ESF's NASA-affiliated Research Center. Baker Laboratory houses two multimedia lecture halls, a "smart" classroom outfitted for computer use and distance learning, and two construction management and planning studios. It also has a full-scale laboratory for materials science testing, including a modern dry kiln, a wood identification laboratory, shop facilities (including portable sawmill) and wood preservation laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.esf.edu/communications/news/2000/03.29.baker.htm ESF's Baker Laboratory Revamped for Engineering]". ESF Office of Communications. Retrieved on October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bray Hall''': The building is the oldest on campus, completed in 1917, the largest building devoted to Forestry at the time. It is named after [[William L. Bray]], a founder of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University and its first dean, 1911-12. It is the location of most administrative offices and the Department of Forest and Natural Resources Management. The [[New York State University Police|State University Police]] department is located in the basement.
* '''Gateway Center''': The campus' newest building, opened in March 2013, "sets a new standard for LEED buildings, producing more renewable energy than it consumes," according to [[Cornelius B. Murphy, Jr.]] The building is "designed to achieve LEED Platinum Certification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esf.edu/communications/view.asp?newsID=415 |title=SUNY-ESF Breaks Ground for Gateway Building |publisher=Esf.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/gateway.htm "Gateway Building" (with webcam), SUNY-ESF.] Accessed: June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The ESF College Bookstore, Trailhead Cafe, and Office of Admissions are located in the Gateway Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/gateway.htm "The Gateway Center"], ESF website. Accessed: October 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Illick Hall''': The building was completed in 1968, and is home to the Department of Environmental and Forest Biology. It is named after [[Joseph S. Illick]], a dean of the State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. There is a large lecture hall (Illick 5) on the ground floor. Several greenhouses are located on the fifth floor. The Roosevelt Wildlife Museum is also located in the building.
* '''Jahn Laboratory''': Named after [[Edwin C. Jahn]], former head of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. The building was completed in 1997. Home to the Department of Chemistry.
* '''Marshall Hall''': Named after [[Louis Marshall]], one of the founders of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. Home to the Landscape Architecture and Environmental Studies departments. The Alumni ([[Eustace B. Nifkin|Nifkin]]) Lounge, Tree House (snack bar) and Marshall Auditorium are located within. Twin brass plaques in the entryway commemorate the contributions of Marshall and his son, alumnus [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Bob Marshall]].
* '''Moon Library''': Dedicated to [[F. Franklin Moon]], an early dean of the College. Completed in 1968, along with Illick Hall. A computer cluster and student lounge are located in the basement.
* '''Walters Hall''': Named after [[J. Henry Walters]], who served on the College's Board of Trustees. Completed in 1969. Home to the Department of Paper and Bioprocess Engineering. The pilot plant in the building includes two paper machines and wood-to-ethanol processing equipment.
*'''Centennial Hall''': ESF's on-campus student [[dormitory]], named in commemoration of the college's 100th anniversary. The facility is capable of accommodating 280-300 freshman (in double or triple studio rooms with private bath), 116 upperclassmen (in single bedroom suits with private bath), and an additional 56 upperclassmen (in 4-bedroom, 2-bath apartments). A $31 million project, Centennial Hall opened in fall 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centennial Hall|url=http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/centennial.htm|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bray Hall, Marshall Hall, Illick Hall, and Moon Library border the quad. Other buildings on the Syracuse campus include one for maintenance and operations, a garage, and a greenhouse converted to office space. Among planned new buildings is a research support facility.

The historic Robin Hood Oak (photo below) is located behind Bray Hall. The tree is said to have grown from an acorn brought back by a faculty member from the Sherwood Forest in England. It was the first tree listed on the National Registrar of Historic Trees in the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Many students identify themselves as a "Stumpy" (or "Stumpie"). The nickname was given to students by their neighbors at Syracuse University, probably in the 1920s, and most-likely refers to forestry "stump jumpers". Although originally used as an insult, today, most students embrace the nickname with pride.

Students at the Syracuse campus enjoy many activities on and off campus. There are a number of student clubs and organizations at ESF, including the Undergraduate Student Association, Graduate Student Association, Woodsmen Team, [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Bob Marshall]] Club, Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/org/axs/ "Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society,"] SUNY-ESF website.

Wanakena students have their own woodsmen and ice hockey teams. A number of professional organizations are also open to student membership, including the [[Society of American Foresters]], [[The Wildlife Society]], [[Conservation biology|Conservation Biology]] club, American Fisheries Association, and the (currently defunct) American Water Resources Association.

ESF has an agreement with adjacent [[Syracuse University]] that allows ESF students to enjoy many amenities offered by SU. ESF students take courses at their sister institution, can apply for admission to concurrent degree and joint certificate programs, and may join any SU organization except for NCAA sports teams. SU students are also welcome to enroll in ESF classes. Because of this, students feel a certain degree of integration with the Syracuse University community. Every May, ESF holds a joint commencement ceremony with Syracuse University in the [[Carrier Dome]]. ESF's baccalaureate diplomas bear the seals of both the State University of New York and Syracuse University.

Students also enjoy a variety of shops, restaurants, museums, and theaters in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and nearby [[Marshall Street, Syracuse|Marshall Street]] and [[Westcott, Syracuse|Westcott Street]].

== Gateway Center ==
ESF has launched several programs, both within the confines of campus and other locations to reduce its [[carbon emission]]s. The Gateway Center utilizes sustainable energy resources to generate power and heat utilized across the campus. The building includes a state-of-the-art, combined heat-and-power (CHP) system, producing 65% of campus heating needs along with 20% of its electrical needs. The CHP system uses [[biomass]] to drive a [[steam turbine]] and produce electricity, while natural gas is used for steam heating along with additional electricity. It has been estimated this building alone is responsible for reducing ESF's carbon footprint by 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gateway Center|url=http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/gateway.htm|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ESF-Gateway-Green-Roof-2014.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Gateway Center's [[green roof|green roof/ garden]] (foreground)]]

Increased global awareness of global warming and reduced nonrenewable resources has driven ESF to invest in biomass.  Biomass is a renewable resource that draws light energy, carbon dioxide, and water from the environment; in return oxygen is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Shijie|author2=Abrahamson, L. |author3=Scott, G. |title=Biorefinery: Ensuring biomass as a sustainable renewable source of chemicals, materials, and energy|journal=Biomass and Bioenergy|year=2012|volume=39|issue=April|pages=1–4|doi=10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.12.042}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be harvested without negatively affecting the environment.  For this reason, SUNY-ESF has launched a program to grow its own biomass, known as the ''[[Willow Biomass Project]]''. Benefits of woody willow include, high yields and fast growth times, quick re-sprouting, and high heat energy is produced when burned. Woody willow also increases habitat diversity significantly contributes to carbon neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Willow Biomass Project|url=http://www.esf.edu/pubprog/brochure/willow/willow.htm|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gateway Center was one of the final stages in the school's ''Climate Action Plan'', that encompasses the vision of [[carbon neutrality]] and reduced [[fossil fuel]] dependence by 2015. Currently, the school rests in Phase III of the program and is on track to reach its goal. Included in Phase III is the opening of The Gateway Center, retrofits to Illick Hall, and rooftop greenhouse replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heavey|first=Justin|title=Climate Action Plan for SUNY ESF|year=2009|publisher=Department of Renewable Energy Systems|page=6,21|author2=Kelleher, Michael |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One other advancement towards carbon neutrality can be seen on top of the campus's buildings. [[Green roof|Rooftop gardens]] provide reduced [[energy consumption]] and water runoff. Shrubbery, soil thickness, and moisture content all can contribute to increased [[energy conservation|energy savings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=N.

=== Athletics history ===

In one notable part of the College's history, [[Laurie D. Cox]], professor of [[Landscape architecture|Landscape Architecture]], was responsible for establishing [[Syracuse University]]'s renowned [[Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse|lacrosse program]] in 1916, including players from the New York State College of Forestry.&lt;ref name =father&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-118716843.html|title=Cox began lacrosse legacy at Syracuse|last=Herron|first=Frank|date=June 27, 2004|publisher=The Post-Standard (Syracuse, NY)|accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliation with Syracuse University==
ESF was founded in 1911 as the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]] at Syracuse University, under the leadership of Syracuse University Trustee [[Louis Marshall]], with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day. Its founding followed several years after the cessation of state funding to the earlier [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]].&lt;ref&gt;Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University, 1963, by Gould P. Colman, page 161, Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

ESF is an autonomous institution, administratively separate from Syracuse University, while some resources, facilities and infrastructure are shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206063046/http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html |archivedate=2013-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two schools share a common Schedule of Classes; students may take courses at both institutions, and baccalaureate diplomas from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with that of the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools. ESF receives an annual appropriation as part of the SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college's educational facilities. The state has somewhat similar financial and working relationships with five [[statutory college]]s that are at [[Alfred University]] and [[Cornell University]], although unlike ESF, these statutory institutions are legally and technically part of their respective host institutions and are administered by them as well.

ESF faculty, students, and students' families join those from Syracuse University (SU) in a joint convocation ceremony at the beginning of the academic year in August and combined commencement exercises in May. ESF and SU students share access to library resources, recreational facilities, student clubs, and activities at both institutions, except for the schools' intercollegiate athletics teams, affiliated with the USCAA and NCAA, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esf.edu/welcome/esfsu.htm |title=The ESF-SU Relationship |publisher=State University of New York|accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
The best known tradition among ESF students is that walking across the quad is shunned. The tradition, which dates back to at least the early 1960s, is intended to inhibit tracks from being worn into the lawn. Hecklers have been known to yell and even tackle people walking across the quad. However, other activities such as [[frisbee]] and soccer playing are encouraged on the Quad.

Eustace B. Nifkin, ESF's previous mascot, is an unofficial student. He first appeared in the 1940s after a group of students summering in the Adirondacks thought him up. Ever since, he has appeared on class rosters, written articles for ''The Knothole'', and sent mail to the College from around the world. He has a girlfriend, the lesser-known Elsa S. Freeborn. SUNY granted him a bachelor's degree in 1972. The Alumni Lounge in Marshall Hall is dedicated to Nifkin.

Another well known legend is that of Chainer or Chainsaw who supposedly graduated in 1993.

The '''Stone Age Institute''' is an independent research center dedicated to the [[archeology|archaeological]] study of human origins and technological development. The institute conducts research and education in human origins studies, publishes books and articles, and mentors prospective scientists The institute is housed in a {{convert|11400|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility located on a {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}} rural site outside [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. 

The Stone Age Institute is an autonomous research facility, but it has strong ties with [[Indiana University]], especially CRAFT (the [[Center for Research into the Anthropological Foundations of Technology]]) and the Human Evolutionary Studies Program.

The facility includes a research library on early prehistory and an extensive artifact collection donated by the late [[J. Desmond Clark]], professor of Anthropology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19448">[[Image:Gramsci.png|thumb|The subaltern identity is conceptually derived from the cultural-hegemony work of the Italian Marxist intellectual Antonio Gramsci.]]

In [[critical theory]] and [[postcolonialism]], the term '''subaltern''' designates the populations which are socially, politically, and geographically outside of the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[Hierarchy|power structure]] of the [[colony]] and of the colonial [[homeland]]. In describing "history told from below", ''subaltern'' was coined by [[Antonio Gramsci]], notably through his work on [[cultural hegemony]], which identified the groups that are excluded from a society's established institutions and thus denied the means by which people have a voice in their society.

The terms ''subaltern'' and ''[[Subaltern Studies]]'' entered postcolonial studies through the works of the [[Subaltern Studies|Subaltern Studies Group]], a collection of historians of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] who explored the political-actor role of the men and women who constitute the mass population, rather than the political roles of the social and economic elites, in the history of the Indian Subcontinent. &lt;ref&gt;David Ludden (ed) ''Reading Subaltern Studies: Critical History, Contested Meaning and the Globalisation of South Asia''. Delhi: Permanent Black, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marx's theory of history|Marxist historians]] had already been investigating colonial history as told from the perspective of the [[proletariat]], using the concept of social classes as being determined by economic relations. In the 1970s, ''subaltern'' began to denote the [[Colonization|colonized]] peoples of the Indian subcontinent and described a new perspective of the history of an [[Imperialism|imperial]] colony as told from the point of view of the colonized rather than that of the colonizers. In the 1980s, the scope of enquiry of Subaltern Studies was applied as an "intervention in South Asian [[historiography]]".

As a method of intellectual discourse, the concept of the ''subaltern'' is contentious because it originated as a [[Eurocentric]] method of historical enquiry for studying the non-Western people of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. From its inception as an historical-research model for studying the colonial experience of the  peoples  of the Indian Subcontinent, subaltern studies transformed from a model of intellectual discourse into a method of "vigorous post-colonial critique". The term "subaltern" is used in the fields of [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[human geography]], [[literary criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;Prakash, Gyan. "Subaltern Studies as Postcolonial Criticism", ''The American Historical Review'', December, 1994,  Vol. 99, No. 5, 1475–1490, 1476.&lt;/ref&gt; [[musicology]], and art history.

== Denotations ==
In postcolonial theory, the term ''subaltern'' describes the lower classes and the social groups who are at the margins of a society: a subaltern is a person rendered without [[human agency|agency]] by [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert J. C. ''Postcolonialism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the literary critic [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Gayatri Spivak]] spoke against an overly broad application of the term in 1992:

{{Quotation|...''subaltern'' is not just a classy word for "oppressed", for [the] [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], for somebody who's not getting a piece of the pie.... In post-colonial terms, everything that has limited or no access to the cultural imperialism is subaltern—a space of difference. Now, who would say that's just the oppressed? The [[working class]] is oppressed. It's not subaltern.... Many people want to claim subalternity. They are the least interesting and the most dangerous. I mean, just by being a discriminated-against minority on the university campus; they don't need the word 'subaltern'.... They should see what the mechanics of the discrimination are. They're within the hegemonic discourse, wanting a piece of the pie, and not being allowed, so let them speak, use the hegemonic discourse. They should not call themselves subaltern.&lt;ref&gt;de Kock, Leon. "Interview With Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak: New Nation Writers Conference in South Africa." ''[http://ariel.synergiesprairies.ca/ariel/index.php/ariel/article/viewFile/2505/2458 ARIEL: A Review of International English Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706205400/http://ariel.synergiesprairies.ca/ariel/index.php/ariel/article/viewFile/2505/2458 |date=2011-07-06 }}''. 23(3) 1992: 29-47. ARIEL&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Marxist theory]], the civil sense of the term ''subaltern'' was first used by the Italian communist intellectual [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937). In discussions of the meaning of the "subaltern" in Gramsci's writings, Spivak and others have argued that he used the word as a synonym for the proletariat (a [[code word]] to deceive the prison censor to allow his manuscripts out the prison),&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Stephen. "The Subaltern: Genealogy of a Concept", in ''Gayatri Spivak: Ethics, Subalternity and the Critique of Postcolonial Reason''. Malden, MA: Polity, 2007: pp. 96-97; and Hoare, Quintin, and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith. "Terminology", in ''Selections from the Prison Notebooks''. New York: International Publishers, pp. xiii-xiv&lt;/ref&gt; but that interpretation has been contested, with evidence indicating that it was a novel concept in Gramsci's political theory.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Marcus E. "[https://www.academia.edu/1548708/Rethinking_the_subaltern_and_the_question_of_censorship_in_Gramscis_Prison_Notebooks Rethinking the Subaltern and the Question of Censorship in Gramsci's Prison Notebooks]," Postcolonial Studies, Volume 14, Number 4 (2011): 385-402.&lt;/ref&gt; In several essays, the postcolonial critic [[Homi K. Bhabha]] emphasized the importance of [[social power]] relations in defining subaltern social groups as oppressed, racial minorities whose social presence was crucial to the self-definition of the majority group; as such, subaltern social groups, nonetheless, also are in a position to subvert the [[authority]] of the social groups who hold hegemonic power.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Morena, Laura and Pfeiffer, Peter C. Eds. "Unsatisfied: Notes on Vernacular Cosmopolitanism", ''Text and Nation: Cross-Disciplinary Essays on Cultural and National Identities''. Columbia, SC: Camden House, 1996: pp. 191–207 and "Unpacking my library... again", ''The Post-colonial Question: Common Skies, Divided Horizons''. Iain Chambers, Lidia Curti, eds. New York: Routledge, 1996: 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Toward a New Legal Common Sense'' (2002), the sociologist [[Boaventura de Sousa Santos]] applies the term ''subaltern cosmopolitanism'' to describe the counter-hegemonic practice, social movement, resistance, and struggle against [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[globalization]], especially the struggle against [[social exclusion]]. Moreover, de Sousa Santos applies ''subaltern cosmopolitanism'' as interchangeable with the term ''cosmopolitan legality'' to describe the diverse [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] framework for an ''equality of differences'' in which the term ''subaltern'' specifically denotes the oppressed peoples at the margins of a society who are struggling against hegemonic globalization. However, context, time, and place (but perhaps not the Marxist emphasis on the economic relations) determine who, among the peoples at the margins of a society, is a Subaltern; in India women, [[dalit]]s, rural, tribal, immigrant laborers are part of subaltern.

== Theory ==
Postcolonial theory studies the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and the continued dominance of Western ways of knowing, of intellectual enquiry. The work of [[Edward Said]] in the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' conceptually addresses oppressed subaltern peoples, to explain how the Eurocentric perspective of Orientalism produced the foundations and the justifications for the [[dominance hierarchy|domination]] of [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]], by means of colonialism. Before their explorations of ''The Orient'', the Europeans had created an imagined geography of the Orient, predefined images of savage and monstrous places that lay beyond the horizon of the known world. During their initial Oriental explorations, the Europeans' mythologies were reinforced, when the travellers returned to Europe with reports of monsters and savage lands. The concepts of the "difference" and the "strangeness" of the Orient were perpetuated through the mass communications media of the time and through discourse that created an "Us" and "Them" binary social relation with which the Europeans defined themselves by defining the differences of the Orient from the Occident, the European West. The Us-and-Them binary social relation was a foundation of colonialism, because it represented the Orient as backward and irrational lands, and, therefore, in need of European help to become modern, in the Western sense. Hence, the [[discourse]] of Orientalism is Eurocentric, and does not seek to include the voices of the Oriental peoples, the subalterns, themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Race and Racialization: Essential Readings'' by T. Das Gupta, ''et al.'' (eds). Toronto: Canadian Scholars Press. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne. ''Geographies of Postcolonialism'', chapter 1, On Orientalism. SAGE Publications. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] argued that the power of discourse created and reinforced Western dominance. The discourses on how Europe described differences between itself (The West) and others, used European cultural categories, languages, and ideas to represent "The Other." The knowledge produced by such a discourse becomes praxis, which then becomes reality; by producing a discourse of "[[Difference (philosophy)|difference]]" Europe was able to maintain its dominance over "The Other", with a binary social relation between the European and The Other, thereby creating and establishing the Subaltern, made possible by excluding The Other from the production of the discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. "The West and the Rest: Discourse and Power". ''Race and Racialization: Essential Readings''. Das Gupta, T. et al (eds). Toronto: Canadian Scholars Press. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The voice of the subaltern ==
[[Image:Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak at Goldsmiths College.jpg|thumb|175px|Engaging the Subaltern voice: the philosopher and theorist Gayatri Spivak.]]

[[Gayatri Spivak]]'s line of reasoning was developed in Joanne Sharp's ''Geographies of Post colonialism'' (2008), who proposed that Western intellectuals relegate other, non-Western (African, Asian, Middle Eastern) forms of "knowing", of acquiring knowledge of the world, to the margins of intellectual discourse, by re-formulating these forms of knowing as myth and as folklore. To be heard and known, the subaltern must adopt Western ways of knowing, of thought, reasoning, and language; because of such [[Westernization]], a subaltern people can never express their ways of knowing (thought, reasoning, language) and instead must conform expression of their non-Western knowledge of colonial life to Western ways of knowing the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne  ''Geographies of Postcolonialism'', Chapter 6: Can the Subaltern Speak? SAGE Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Subalterns' abandonment of culturally customary ways of thinking and the subsequent adoption of Western ways of thinking are necessary in many situations. The subordinated can be heard by oppressors only by speaking the language of the rulers; thus, intellectual and cultural filters of conformity muddle the true voice of the subaltern. For example, in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Colonial Latin America]], non-elites must conform to the colonial culture and use the filters of religion and servitude, in the language, when addressing the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Imperial]] rulers. To make their appeals to the crown effective, slaves and natives would address the rulers in ways that might mask their own ways of speaking.

Early modern historian [[Fernando Coronil]] said that the goal of the investigator must be "to listen to the subaltern subjects, and to interpret what I hear" and to engage them and interact with their voices. We cannot ascend to a position of dominance over the voice, subjugating its words to the meanings we desire to attribute to them. That is simply another form of discrimination. The power to narrate somebody's story is a heavy task, and we must be cautious and aware of the complications involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coronil|first=Fernando|title=Listening to the Subaltern: The Poetics of Neocolonial States|jstor=1773104|journal=Poetics Today|year=1994|volume=15|issue=4|series=4|pages=643–658|doi=10.2307/1773104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spivak and [[bell hooks]] question the academic's engagement with the Other, and argue that, to truly engage with the subaltern, the academic would have to remove him or herself as "the expert" at the center of the Us-and-Them binary social relation. Traditionally, the academic wants to know about the subaltern's experiences of colonialism, but does not want to know the subaltern's (own) explanation of his or her experiences of colonial domination.  According to the received view in Western knowledge, hooks argued that a true explanation can come only from the expertise of the academic, thus, the subordinated subject, the subaltern surrender knowledge of colonialism for the use of the Western academic; hooks describes the relationship between the academic and the subaltern:

{{Quotation|[There is] no need to hear your voice, when I can talk about you better than you can speak about yourself. No need to hear your voice. Only tell me about your pain. I want to know your story. And then I will tell it back to you in a new way. Tell it back to you in such a way that it has become mine, my own. Re-writing you, I write myself anew. I am still author, authority. I am still [the] colonizer, the speaking subject, and you are now at the center of my talk.|"Marginality as a Site of Resistance" (1990)&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. "Marginality as a Site of Resistance", in R. Ferguson et al. (eds), ''Out There: Marginalization and Contemporary Cultures''. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 1990: pp. 241-43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a means of constructing a greater historical picture of society, the Subaltern's story is a revealing examination of society; the perspective of the subaltern man and woman, the most powerless people who live within colonial confines; therefore, the investigator of post-colonialism must not assume a lumbering cultural superiority in the course of studying the voices of the oppressed subalterns.

== Development discourse ==
Mainstream development discourse, which is based upon knowledge of colonialism and [[Orientalism]], concentrates upon [[modernization theory]], wherein the modernization of an underdeveloped country ''should'' follow the path to modernization taken (and established) by the developed countries of the West. As such, modernization is characterized by free trade, open markets, capitalist economic systems, and democratic systems of governance, as the means by which a nation should modernize their country ''en route'' to becoming a developed country in the Western style. Therefore, mainstream development discourse concentrates upon the application of universal social and political, economic and cultural policies that would nationally establish such modernization.&lt;ref name="lawson"&gt;Lawson, Victoria. ''Making Development Geography''. UK: Hodder Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Making Development Geography'' (2007), Victoria Lawson presents a critique of mainstream development discourse as mere recreation of the Subaltern, which is effected by means of the subaltern being disengaged from other social scales, such as the locale and the community; not considering regional, social class, ethnic group, sexual- and gender-class differences among the peoples and countries being modernized; the continuation of the socio-cultural treatment of the subaltern as a subject of development, as a subordinate who is ignorant of what to do and how to do it; and by excluding the voices of the subject peoples from the formulations of policy and practice used to effect the modernization.&lt;ref name="lawson" /&gt;

As such, the subaltern are peoples who have been silenced in the administration of the colonial states they constitute, they can be heard by means of their political actions, effected in protest against the [[discourse]] of mainstream development, and, thereby, create their own, proper forms of modernization and development. Hence do subaltern social groups create social, political, and cultural movements that contest and disassemble the exclusive claims to power of the Western imperialist powers, and so establish the use and application of local knowledge to create new spaces of opposition and alternative, non-imperialist futures.&lt;ref name="lawson" /&gt;

==Versus sweatshop==

===Sweatshop===
A sweatshop is a factory or workplace, especially in the garment industry, where workers are employed at very low wages for long hours and under poor working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jOaTCNNtbIC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=sweatshop&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=93FTVMy0BY_g7QbshoH4Dg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sweatshop&amp;f=false|title=Making Sweatshops|work=Google.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sweatshop factories in developing countries such as India, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh employ low-pay worker or even child labour around 10–14 years old to work in their factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/NLC_childlabor.html|title=Children Found Sewing Clothing For Wal-Mart, Hanes &amp; Other U.S. &amp; European Companies  - National Labor Committee|work=Harvard.edu|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workers are forced to work up to 16 hours a day seven days a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waronwant.org/overseas-work/sweatshops-and-plantations/sweatshops-in-bangladesh|title=Sweatshops in Bangladesh|work=War On Want|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not receive any basic employee benefits such as health care, maternity leave, sick pay and holiday pay from their employers. They sometime make the female workers to take birth control and take regular pregnancy test to stop maternity leave. And these workers only earn 25p an hour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waronwant.org/overseas-work/sweatshops-and-plantations/china-sweatshops|title=Sweatshops in China|work=War On Want|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is much lower than the legal national [[minimum wage]]. Even labours work long hours everyday, their salaries are usually just enough to cover their basic living cost.

Besides, sweatshop factories usually have harsh working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/business/worldbusiness/05sweatshop.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=In Chinese Factories, Lost Fingers and Low Pay |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, no rest break, no air-conditioning and workers have to stand for their entire shift. Some workers even had to work in unsafe and hazardous conditions which may causes working injuries or even fatal factory incidents. Take China as an example, in 2009 alone, approximately one million workers were injured at work and about 20,000 suffered from diseases due to their occupation. The reason for this is that the sweatshop factories did not provide any safety guidance for their employees. Lots of sweatshop workers are also suffering from labour abuse, sexual harassment and discrimination in their workplaces. To avoid labours organising protests or any campaign against unfair labour practise, many sweatshop factories find ways to prevent the establishment of the trade unions.

===Sweatshop-free===
In sweatshop, labours have to work for long hours but receive very low salary which is only half or even less than the legal [[minimum wage]] under a harsh working condition. The aim of sweatshop-free wish to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and products are made in good working conditions. Sweatshop-free standards include the right to collective bargaining, non-poverty wages, safe workplaces, back wages, and non-harassment.

Take American Apparel as an example, they provide all employees and their families lots of employee benefits including health insurance, parking, subsidised public transport, subsidised lunches, free on site massages, a bike lending program, a program of paid days off as well as opening an onside medical clinic for their employees.&lt;ref name="americanapparel.net"/&gt; American Apparel make sure that their workers are treated fairly and working in a good working conditions. They pay average skilled-sewers 25,000 US dollar per year and 12 US dollar per hour&lt;ref name="americanapparel.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1C73D94TwNYC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=sweatshop+free&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWZTVOeiFsOu7AbSzYCwBw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sweatshop%20free&amp;f=false|title=Fashion Brands|work=Google.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that twice the national [[minimum wage]], which is in big contrast to 25p per hour wage commonly found in sweatshop factories abroad.

===Sweatshop-free clothing===
There are a few ways to know that you are buying sweatshop-free clothing:
* Look at the garment label. For example, Unite is an international union which makes sweatshop free clothing.
* Many organisations, for example Green America, publish ethical consumer guides which list their recommendations for sources of sweatshop free clothing.
* The price of sweatshop-free clothing is relatively higher than sweatshop products.

==Sweatshop scandals==

===Apple Inc.===

[[File:Iphonee5ss.jpg|thumb|right|The "S" is for Sweatshop]]
[[Apple Inc]]  the world's most valuable technology multinational corporation has been accused that their contractors are forcing workers to do overtime involuntarily at sweatshop working conditions and employing underage workers in its factories. Some labourers are forced to work 24 hours at a time and others are forced to stand for their entire shift. And some workers even had to work at unsafe and hazardous condition. In December 2011, 61 workers in the Riteng Computer Accessory Co factory were injured in a gas explosion whilst trialling aluminium iPad 2 back panels.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2103798/Revealed-Inside-Apples-Chinese-sweatshop-factory-workers-paid-just-1-12-hour.html|title=Revealed: Inside Apple's Chinese 'sweatshop' factory where workers are paid just £1.12 per hour|work=Mail Online|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the pressurised working conditions, in 2009, 18 workers who work in Foxconn factory, one of the Apple manufacturer, committed suicide after losing an iPhone prototype.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; Over next two years, at least 18 other Apple workers try to commit suicide. Besides, undercover Inspectors have been monitoring Pegatron factory, one of the Apple contractor in Taiwan, for five months and found Apple supplier broke 86 laws and regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-2381182/Apple-accused-sweatshop-conditions-Far-Eastern-factories.html|title=Apple accused of sweatshop conditions at Far-Eastern factories - This is Money|work=This is Money|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; including workers are forced to work up to 70 hours per week as well as hiring more than 100,000 underage labour to work on the production lines. These sweatshop scandals strongly affected the reputation of the company.

[[File:Portestorr.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters stand outside the Primark shop on Oxford St with SWEATSHOP SHAME banner]]

===Primark===
[[Primark]], a leading high street fashion chain, has been blamed that three of its Indian suppliers are using child labour in their factories. After BBC Panorama’s six months undercover investigation, they discovered the Indian suppliers were sub-contracting middlemen who employed children at Bhavanisagar refugee camp. Investigators found a 9-year-old boy who is working in the refugee camp sweatshop “Sometimes we get major orders in and we have to work double quick. I get paid a few rupees for finishing each garment, but in a good day I can make 40 rupees (60p)” and “The beads we sew are very small and when we work late at night we have to work by candle - the electricity in the camp is poor.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/exposed-primarks-sweatshops-that-pay-children-just-60p-a-day-6875294.html|title=Exposed: Primark's sweatshops that pay children just 60p a day|work=The Evening Standard|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primark sub-contractors hired young children to work under poor working conditions, paying them as little as 13p an hour and they have to work up to 48 hours a week.  After BBC Panorama investigation discovered that the Indian suppliers had used child labour to carry out embroidery and sequin work, Primark then fired the Indian suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7824291.stm|title=BBC News - Primark linked to UK sweatshops|work=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC also reported that TNS Knitwear,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nosweat.org.uk/story/2009/01/12/primark-clothes-made-sweatshop-labour-uk-factory|title=Primark: clothes made by sweatshop labour in UK factory|work=Nosweat.org.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Manchester-based supplier that provide Primark with about 20,000 garment a week, was not only employing illegal immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and India, but also paying them as little as £3 per hour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/872736/primark-linked-manchester-sweatshop/ |title=Primark linked with Manchester sweatshop |publisher=Managementtoday.co.uk |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is well below than the legal [[minimum wage]] but the company has denied all the allegations.

==Sweatshop-free legislation and activism==
In October 2008, the City of Portland, Oregon passed the "City of Portland Sweatshop Free Procuremenat Policy” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=26882&amp;a=264837|title=ADM-1.17 - Sweatshop Free Procurement Policy Administrative Rules|date=30 January 2013|work=Portlandonline.com|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the pacific northwest’s first city to adopt this policy. Portland Sweatshop-Free Purchasing Policy requires the local apparel manufacturers to guarantee their garments were produced in workplaces free of sweatshop conditions. Local apparel manufacturers have to disclose their manufacturing facility locations and meet ethical souring practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2008/10/20/newscolumn1.html?page=all|title=Portland city officials adopt sweatshop-free policy|work=Portland Business Journal|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from monitoring the local apparel manufacturers, the city also participate and collaborate with public agencies and other non- profit organisation to promote sweatshop free procurement practices &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=26882&amp;a=218021|title=ADM-1.16 - Sweatshop Free Procurement Policy and Code of Conduct for Apparel Contractors|date=30 January 2013|work=Portlandonline.com|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is institutionalizing meaningful change. A not-for-profit organisation called SweatsHope &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweatshope.org|title=SweatsHope|work=SweatsHope.org|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to produce ethical factories in Kolkata, India to stop human trafficking (women and children), we also aim to create an ethical place of work for the victims of abuse, freeing them from sex trade. This workplace will become a place of refuge, education, childcare and provide a decent wage. They believe Shutting down one sweatshop, will only create less jobs for people who are already struggling with employment, or that another sweatshop will just open up next door. Retailers are always trying to get cheaper manufacturing costs, this is why we need to stand up and demand ethical treatment and wages for staff. If the consumers demand this, and demand an ‘open book’ of their suppliers, we will create a sweatshop free world.

The [[Ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator|Yager's OWA (ordered weighted averaging) operators]]{{R|yagerOWA}} are used to aggregate the crisp values in decision making schemes (such as multi-criteria decision making, multi-expert decision making and  multi-criteria/multi-expert decision making).{{R|Yager|YagerBeliakov}} It is widely accepted that [[Fuzzy set]]s{{R|Zadeh}} are more suitable for representing preferences of criteria in decision making.

The type-1 OWA operators{{R|fssT1OWA|kdeT1OWA}} have been proposed for this purpose. The type-1 OWA operators provides a technique for directly aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights via OWA mechanism in soft decision making and [[data mining]], where these uncertain objects are modelled by fuzzy sets.

The two definitions for type-1 OWA operators are based on Zadeh's Extension Principle and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-cuts of fuzzy sets. The two definitions lead to equivalent results.

==Definitions==

===Definition 1===
Let &lt;math&gt;F(X)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of fuzzy sets with domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a type-1 OWA operator is defined as follows:{{R|kdeT1OWA}}

Given n linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i = 1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, a type-1 OWA operator is a mapping, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi \colon F(X)\times \cdots \times F(X)  \longrightarrow  F(X)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A^1 , \cdots ,A^n)  \mapsto   Y&lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{Y} (y) =\displaystyle \sup_{\displaystyle \sum_{k =1}^n \bar {w}_i a_{\sigma (i)}  = y }\left({\begin{array}{*{1}l}\mu _{W^1 } (w_1 )\wedge \cdots \wedge \mu_{W^n } (w_n )\wedge \mu _{A^1 } (a_1 )\wedge \cdots \wedge \mu _{A^n } (a_n )\end{array}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar {w}_i = \frac{w_i }{\sum_{i = 1}^n {w_i } }&lt;/math&gt;,and &lt;math&gt;\sigma \colon \{1, \cdots ,n\} \longrightarrow \{1, \cdots ,n\}&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation function such that &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} \geq a_{\sigma (i + 1)},\ \forall i = 1, \cdots ,n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma(i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th highest element in the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {a_1 , \cdots ,a_n } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Definition 2===
Using the alpha-cuts of fuzzy sets:{{R|kdeT1OWA}}

Given the n linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,\;\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, then for each &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, an &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operator with &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W_\alpha ^i } \right\}_{i = 1}^n &lt;/math&gt; to aggregate the &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-cuts of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {A^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; is:

: &lt;math&gt;
\Phi_\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right) =\left\{ {\frac{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} } }{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } }\left| {w_i \in W_\alpha ^i ,\;a_i } \right. \in A_\alpha ^i ,\;i = 1, \ldots ,n} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;W_\alpha ^i= \{w| \mu_{W_i }(w) \geq \alpha \}, A_\alpha ^i=\{ x| \mu _{A_i }(x)\geq \alpha \}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma :\{\;1, \cdots ,n\;\} \to \{\;1, \cdots ,n\;\}&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation function such that &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} \ge a_{\sigma (i + 1)} ,\;\forall \;i = 1, \cdots ,n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th largest
element in the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {a_1 , \cdots ,a_n } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Representation theorem of Type-1 OWA operators==

Given the ''n'' linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,\;\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, and the fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A^1, \cdots ,A^n&lt;/math&gt;, then we have that{{R|kdeT1OWA}}
:&lt;math&gt;Y=G&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the aggregation result obtained by Definition 1, and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the result obtained by in Definition 2.

==Programming problems for Type-1 OWA operators==

According to the Representation Theorem of Type-1 OWA Operators, a general type-1 OWA operator can be decomposed into a series of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operators. In practice, this series of  &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operators is used to construct the resulting aggregation fuzzy set. So we only need to compute the left end-points and right end-points of the intervals &lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the resulting aggregation fuzzy set is constructed with the membership function as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{G} (x) = \operatorname{ \bigvee} \limits_{\alpha :x \in \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots
,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_\alpha } \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

For the left end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{-} = \operatorname {\min }\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

while for the right end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots , A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{+} = \operatorname {\max }\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i  A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i =
1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

A fast method has been presented to solve two programming problem so that the type-1 OWA aggregation operation can be performed efficiently, for details, please see the paper.{{R|kdeT1OWA}}

==Alpha-level approach to Type-1 OWA operation==

Three-step process:{{R|kdeT1OWA}}
* Step 1&amp;mdash;To set up the &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;- level resolution in [0, 1].
* Step 2&amp;mdash;For each &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;,
:*Step 2.1&amp;mdash;To calculate &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0^\ast } &lt;/math&gt;
# Let &lt;math&gt;i_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;;
# If &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0 } \ge A_{\alpha + }^{\sigma (i_0 )} &lt;/math&gt;, stop, &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0 } &lt;/math&gt; is the solution; otherwise go to Step 2.1-3.
# &lt;math&gt;i_0 \leftarrow i_0 + 1&lt;/math&gt;, go to Step 2.1-2.

:*Step 2.2 To calculate&lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0^\ast } &lt;/math&gt;
# Let &lt;math&gt;i_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;;
# If &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0 } \ge A_{\alpha - }^{\sigma (i_0 )} &lt;/math&gt;, stop, &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0 } &lt;/math&gt; is the solution; otherwise go to Step 2.2-3.
#&lt;math&gt;i_0 \leftarrow i_0 + 1&lt;/math&gt;, go to step Step 2.2-2.

* Step 3&amp;mdash;To construct the aggregation resulting fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; based on all the available intervals &lt;math&gt;\left[ {\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0^\ast } ,\;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0^\ast } } \right]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{G} (x) = \operatorname \bigvee \limits_{\alpha :x \in \left[ {\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0^\ast } ,\;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0^\ast } } \right]} \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

==Special cases==
* Any OWA operators, like maximum, minimum, mean operators;&lt;ref name="yagerOWA" /&gt;
* Join operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets,{{R|MT}} i.e., fuzzy maximum operators;
* Meet operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets,{{R|MT|zadehJ}} i.e., fuzzy minimum operators;
* Join-like operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets;{{R|kdeT1OWA|bookT1OWA}}
* Meet-like operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets.{{R|kdeT1OWA|bookT1OWA}}

==Generalizations==
Type-2 OWA operators{{R|Zhou}} have been suggested to aggregate the [[Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems|type-2 fuzzy sets]] for soft decision making.
