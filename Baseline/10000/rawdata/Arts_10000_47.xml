'''''All the President's Men''''' is a 1974 [[non-fiction]] book by [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward]], two of the journalists who investigated the first [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] break-in and [[Watergate scandal|ensuing scandal]] for ''[[The Washington Post]]''. The book chronicles the [[investigative reporting]] of Woodward and Bernstein from Woodward's initial report on the [[Watergate break-in]] through the resignations of [[H. R. Haldeman]] and [[John Ehrlichman]], and the revelation of the [[Watergate tapes|Nixon tapes]] by [[Alexander Butterfield]] in 1973. It relates the events behind the major stories the duo wrote for the ''Post'', naming some sources who had previously refused to be identified for their initial articles, notably [[Hugh Sloan]]. It also gives detailed accounts of Woodward's secret meetings with his source [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]], whose identity was kept hidden for over 30 years.&lt;ref name="deep"&gt;In 2005, Deep Throat was revealed to be then-[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Associate Director [[W. Mark Felt]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Roberts (journalist)|Gene Roberts]], the former executive editor of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' and former managing editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', has called the work of Woodward and Bernstein "maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time."&lt;ref&gt;Roy J. Harris, Jr., ''Pulitzer's Gold,'' 2007, p. 233, Columbia: University of Missouri Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8262-1768-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[All the President's Men (film)|film adaptation]], produced by [[Robert Redford]], starring Redford and [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Woodward and Bernstein, respectively, was released in 1976.  That same year, a sequel to the book, ''[[The Final Days]]'', was published, which chronicled the last months of [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]'s presidency, starting around the time their previous book ended.

==Background==
Woodward and Bernstein had considered the idea of writing a book about Watergate, but did not commit until actor [[Robert Redford]] expressed interest in purchasing the film rights. In ''Telling the Truth About Lies: The Making of "All the President's Men"'', Woodward noted that Redford played an important role in changing the book's narrative from a story about the Watergate events to one about their investigations and reportage of the story.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0778867/ Telling the Truth about Lies: the Making of 'All the President&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Men']''from [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the book alludes to the [[nursery rhyme]] about [[Humpty Dumpty]] ("All the king's horses and all the king's men / Couldn't put Humpty together again"). An allusion similar to that was made more explicitly a quarter-century earlier in the [[Robert Penn Warren]] novel ''[[All the King's Men]]'', which describes the career of a fictional corrupt governor, loosely based on [[Huey Long]].

== Publication ==
{{Watergate}}
[[Richard E. Snyder|Dick Snyder]] of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] purchased the right to publish the book through the agent [[David Obst]]. The authors received an advance of $55,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/30/business/profits-dick-snyder-s-ugly-word.html|title=Profits - Dick Snyder's Ugly Word|last=Cohen|first=Roger|date=1991-06-30|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, Michael Korda said of the book's publication that it "transformed book publishing into a red-hot part of media" and books became "news" instead of history.

Because the book was embargoed until publication day, there were no advance copies for reviewers. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] became known as the "[[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]" publisher by following up ''All the President's Men'' with books by [[John Dean]], Maureen Dean, [[John Ehrlichman]] and [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Another Life: A Memoir of Other People|last = Korda|first = Michael|publisher = Random House|year = 1997|isbn = 0679-456597|location = United States of America|pages = 364–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3853">The '''American Writers Association''' ('''AWA''') was an organization formed in 1946 in opposition to an attempt to introduce a form of [[trade unionism]] for authors. Its members included writers such as [[Bruce Barton]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]], [[James T. Farrell]], [[John T. Flynn]], [[Rupert Hughes]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Clarence Budington Kelland]], [[Clare Boothe Luce]], [[Eugene Lyons]], [[Margaret Mitchell]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[Dorothy Thompson]] and [[Louis Waldman]].&lt;ref name="moser168"&gt;{{harvnb|Moser|2005|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="burns101"&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hoopes398"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoopes|1982|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization formed as a response to the "Cain Plan", a proposal put forth by the novelist and screenwriter [[James M. Cain]]. In July 1946, Cain proposed that an "American Authors' Authority" be created to act as a central repository for copyrights, and additionally negotiating collectively for authors to give them greater bargaining power. The AWA opposed this plan. Many AWA members considered the Cain Plan to be an attempt by [[Communism|Communists]] to gain control over copyrights. Flynn compared the Authority's board of governors to the [[politburo]] of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="moser168"/&gt; Cain responded by referring to members of the AWA as "reactionary, almost incomprehensibly censorious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cain Denounces Authors League |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 22, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1946, a group of 50 writers signed a joint letter to [[Elmer Rice]], president of the Authors League of America, to announce the group's formation.&lt;ref name="hoopes398"/&gt; The AWA soon found backing from radio and film producers, as well as newspaper editors and publishers.&lt;ref name="moser168"/&gt; The group held meetings and began a newsletter.&lt;ref name="burns101"/&gt; Erskine was initially elected as the group's leader,&lt;ref name="hoopes400"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoopes|1982|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was soon succeeded by Hughes.&lt;ref name="fine208"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1992|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn, Lyons and Waldman were selected for a "strategy committee".&lt;ref name="moser168"/&gt;

The Cain Plan was quickly defeated, but the AWA continued to exist for several years after. In 1949, the group supported the [[Contempt of Congress]] citations against the [[Hollywood Ten]] by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Against Hollywood Ten |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 16, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the AWA denounced the [[Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace]] as a "fraud", saying its Russian delegates were "prisoners" of that country's Communist authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anti-Red Session Is Hailed by Tobin |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 26, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ancha Icon of the Savior''', known in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] as '''Anchiskhati''' ({{lang-ka|ანჩისხატი}}), is a medieval Georgian [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] [[icon]], traditionally considered to be the ''Keramidion'', a "holy tile" imprinted with the face of [[Jesus Christ]] miraculously transferred by contact with the [[Image of Edessa]] (''Mandylion''). Dated to the 6th-7th century, it was covered with a [[chasing|chased]] silver [[riza]] and partly repainted in the following centuries. The icon derives its name from the Georgian [[Ancha monastery|monastery of Ancha]] in what is now [[Turkey]], whence it was brought to [[Tbilisi]] in 1664.

== History ==

Medieval Georgian sources identify the Ancha icon with the ''Keramidion'', a "holy tile" imprinted with the face of Christ miraculously transferred by contact with the ''[[Image of Edessa|Mandylion]]''. According to the Georgian hymnist Ioann, [[Bishopric of Ancha|bishop of Ancha]] (fl. 1195), the icon was brought in Georgia by [[Apostle Andrew]] from [[Hierapolis]]. An 18th-century inscription on the icon covering associates the Anchiskhati with the Image of Edessa, an "[[Acheiropoieta|icon not made by hand]]", brought to the cathedral of Ancha in the Georgian princedom of [[Klarjeti]] to preserve it from the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] campaign by the Byzantine emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]].&lt;ref name="pravenc"/&gt;

After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the Georgian [[Principality of Samtskhe]], of which Klarjeti was part, in the 16th century, Christianity went in decline in the area. In 1664, the merchant Amirjan Ievangulishvili brought the icon of Ancha to Tbilisi, where it was acquired by the [[Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia|Georgian catholicos]] [[Domentius III of Georgia|Domenti III]] for 2,000 silver coins for the newly refurbished church of the [[Nativity of the Theotokos]] in Tbilisi, henceforth known as the [[Anchiskhati Basilica|Anchiskhati church]].&lt;ref name="CJSS1"&gt;Chichinadze, Nino (2008), [http://www.nplg.gov.ge/dlibrary/collect/0001/000945/CJSS%201.pdf "Precious metal revetments on Georgian medieval painted icons: some observations on a devotional practice"], in: ''Caucasus Journal of Social Sciences'', vol. 1, issue 1: pp. 261–262&lt;/ref&gt; The icon remained one of the most venerated relics of Georgian Christianity until after the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Soviet takeover of Georgia]] it was moved to the National Art Museum of Georgia in the 1920s. The Anchiskhati church was closed down and would only be reopened in the last years of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Since then, there have been repeated calls from the Orthodox Christians to return the icon to the church’s property.&lt;ref name="pravenc"/&gt;

== Description == 
[[File:Анчийский Спас в Каннах.jpg|thumb|A copy of the Ancha icon at the Eastern Orthodox Church in [[Cannes]] in 2010.]]
Ancha Icon of the Savior is an encaustic icon dated to the 6th-7th century as it was identified by the detailed analysis by art historian [[Shalva Amiranashvili]] in the 1920s. By the end of the 12th century the icon was covered with gilded chasing by the Georgian master [[Beka Opizari]] at the behest of the bishop of Ancha, Ioann Rkinaeli, and the queen [[Tamar of Georgia]].&lt;ref name="Djobadze"&gt;[[Wachtang Djobadze|Djobadze, Wachtang Z.]] (1992), ''Early Medieval Georgian Monasteries in Historic Tao, Klarjet'i, and Šavšet'i'', p. 18. F. Steiner, {{ISBN|3-515-05624-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 14th century, the icon was converted into a [[triptych]] at the expense of the [[Jaqeli]] princes of Samtskhe. The chasing was amended several times and embellished with various inscriptions that date to the 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th centuries. The 14th and 17th-century chasing of the lateral leaves depicts 12 scenes from the [[New Testament]], from the [[Annunciation]] to the [[Ascension of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="pravenc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CJSS1"/&gt;

The icon (105X71X4.6&amp;nbsp;cm without a ''kiot'', an icon box) is enclosed into the middle panel of the triptych so that only the face of the Savior remains visible. The silver chasing, remodeled in 1825, presents [[Christ Pantocrator]], while the original encaustic painting shows the bust of Jesus. The frame of the central panel is adorned with Beka Opizari's work, a high point of the medieval Georgian art. The two symmetrically located standing figures of [[John the Baptist]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], combined with the icon of Jesus, creates the scene of ''[[deesis]]''. The [[archangel]]s [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] and the [[apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] can be seen in the corners of the frame.&lt;ref name="pravenc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CJSS1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4608">The '''antiquarian book trade in the United States''' is an aspect of [[book collecting]] and [[publishing]]. The term ''[[antiquarian]]'', in general, refers to [[antiquities]] and collectible items usually considered old and rare, usually in reference to books, but is not limited to books. The word antiquarian could also be used to describe a person who collects rare books or other antique items. 

Two key figures who have written a great deal on the U.S. antiquarian book trade specifically are [[Leona Rostenberg]] (1908&amp;ndash;2005) and [[Madeleine B. Stern]] (1912&amp;ndash;2007), both of whom were also in the business of collecting and selling [[rare books]]. Other histories having covered the topic include [[Isaiah Thomas (publisher)|Isaiah Thomas]], writing in 1810 his ''History of printing in America''; Henry Walcott Boynton’s ''Annals of American Bookselling, 1638-1850'', first published in 1932; Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt’s ''The Book in America: A History of the Making, the Selling, and the Collecting of Books in the United States'' (1939).

The antiquarian book trade has roots in Colonial America, and may be considered in the study of American history and literature, print culture, and book history. Antiquarian book fairs have long been an important aspect of the trade. Today, the [[Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America]] (ABAA) is the primary organization of the trade in the United States. Other organizations include the [[Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing]] (SHARP). The [[Rare Book School]] at the University of Virginia is the premier institution for those seeking an advanced education in the field.

==History==

The beginnings of the antiquarian book trade can be traced to British North America, specifically Boston of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;Stern, M. B. (1985). Antiquarian bookselling in the United States: A History from the origins to the 1940s. Westport, CT: Greenwood. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; There is no established date of when this business of book collecting actually begins, however Stern attributes the beginnings to [[John Dunton]]’s visit to Boston in 1686, in which he brought along numerous books from his native England. Printed materials and books however were already available in Boston, the first book shop having been opened in 1647 by [[Hezekiah Usher]].&lt;ref&gt;  tern, M. B. (1985). Antiquarian bookselling in the United States: A History from the origins to the 1940s. Westport, CT: Greenwood. p. 3p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The act of collecting and selling books as a form of business increases later in seventeenth century, with 1693 being the date of the earliest printed catalogue of books in the American colonies.     

Events in Boston during the eighteenth century proved both difficult and advantageous for the antiquarian book trade. For example, a fire broke out in 1711 that consumed nearly every bookshop then in existence in Boston. In the next two decades antiquarian booksellers rebuilt and gradually began to thrive, with the presence of [[Harvard College]], as well as a certain literary and educational milieu in Boston allowing the development of the antiquarian book trade.

In the later eighteenth century, the heart of the antiquarian trade shifted to Philadelphia and New York City, growing with an increasingly educated public and independence from Britain. With the movement of people westward bookselling spread, and soon, small cities like Cincinnati become known in the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, W. (1961). The Western book trade: Cincinnati as a nineteenth century publishing and book-trade center. Columbus, OH: Ohio State University. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The trade spread to Richmond and New Orleans, then to Texas,  St. Louis, Chicago, and eventually, following the gold rush, to California.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15593">{{Culture of Tuvalu}}
The '''Art of [[Tuvalu]]''' has traditionally been expressed in the design of clothing and traditional handicrafts such as the decoration of mats and fans. Tuvaluan clothing was traditionally made from ''Fala'' leaves (Screw Pine or [[Pandanus]]).&lt;ref name="CHF1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hedley |first1= Charles|title= General account of the Atoll of Funafuti|url= http://australianmuseum.net.au/Uploads/Journals/16686/487_complete.pdf |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1896 |publisher= Australian Museum Memoir 3(2): 1–72 |location= |language= |isbn=|oclc= |doi= |id= |page=|pages=40–41|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[material culture]] of [[Tuvalu]] uses traditional design elements in artifacts used in everyday life such as the design of canoes and fish hooks made from traditional materials. The design of women's skirts (''titi'') and tops (''teuga saka''), that are used in performances of the [[Music of Tuvalu|traditional dance songs of Tuvalu]], represents contemporary Tuvaluan art and design.&lt;ref name="TPwa"&gt;{{cite web| last =  Mallon | first = Sean |title= Wearable art: Tuvalu style| publisher= Museum of New Zealand (Te Papa) blog|chapter=|date = 2 October 2013|url= http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2013/10/02/wearable-art-tuvalu-style/| accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The material culture of Tuvalu==
In 1960–1961 [[Gerd Koch]] a German anthropologist, visited the atolls of [[Nanumaga]], [[Nukufetau]] and [[Niutao]], which resulted in his publication of a book on the material culture of the Ellice Islands, which described, with illustrations, the design of traditional handicrafts and artifacts. Following the change of name to [[Tuvalu]], the English translation by Guy Slatter was published under the title ''The Material Culture of Tuvalu''.&lt;ref name="GKT"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gerd Koch (translated by Guy Slater)|title=The Material Culture of Tuvalu|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1981 |month= |origyear= |publisher= University of the South Pacific|location=Suva |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id=ASIN B0000EE805 |page= |pages= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Hedley]], a naturalist at the [[Australian Museum]], had earlier written the ''General Account of the Atoll of Funafuti'' (1896) which described some uses of the native plants and trees on [[Funafuti]].&lt;ref name="CH1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hedley |first1= Charles|title= General account of the Atoll of Funafuti|url= http://australianmuseum.net.au/Uploads/Journals/16686/487_complete.pdf |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1896 |publisher= Australian Museum Memoir 3(2): 1–72 |location= |language= |isbn=|oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chic''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|iː|k}}, meaning "stylish" or "smart", is an element of fashion.

==Etymology==
''[[:wikt:chic#French|Chic]]'' is a French word, established in English since at least the 1870s. Early references in English dictionaries classified it as slang and [[New Zealand]]-born [[lexicographer]] [[Eric Partridge]] noted, with reference to its [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] meaning, that it was "not so used in Fr[ench]."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', several ed 1937–61.{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustave Flaubert]] notes in ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (published in 1856) that "chicard" (one who is chic) is then Parisian very current slang for "classy" noting, perhaps derisively, perhaps not, that it was bourgeoisie. There is a similar word in German, ''[[:wikt:schick|schick]]'', with a meaning similar to ''chic'', which may be the origin of the word in French; another theory links ''chic'' to the word ''[[:wikt:chicane#French|chicane]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|chic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the French pronunciation (/ˈʃiːk/ or "sheek") is now virtually standard and was that given by [[H. W. Fowler|Fowler]],&lt;ref&gt;''Modern English Usage'', 1926&lt;/ref&gt; ''chic'' was often rendered in the anglicised form of "chick".&lt;ref&gt;An example was in [[Simon Raven]]'s ''[[Edward and Mrs Simpson]]'' (Thames, 1978), a television drama based on the events leading to the [[Abdication crisis]] of 1936, when the leader of the Labour Party, [[Clement Attlee]] (played by Patrick Troughton), used the word slightly contemptuously during a meeting with Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] (David Waller).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Monte Carlo Casino 2.JPG|thumb|280px|left|[[French Riviera|Riviera]] chic—[[Monte Carlo]].]]
In a fictional [[vignette (literature)|vignette]] for ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (''c''. 1932) Mrs F. A. Kilpatrick attributed to a young woman who 70 years later would have been called a "[[chavette]]" the following assertion: "It 'asn't go no buttons neither ... That's the latest ideer. If you want to be chick you just 'ang on to it, it seems".&lt;ref&gt;''Round the Year with Mr Punch'', vol XIX&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in [[Anita Loos]]' novel, ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' (1925), the diarist Lorelei Lee recorded that "the French use the word 'sheik' for everything, while we only seem to use if for gentlemen when they seem to resemble [[Rudolf Valentino]]" (a pun derived from the latter's being the star of the 1921 silent film, ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'').

The [[Oxford Dictionary]] gives the comparative and superlative forms of ''chic'' as ''chicer'' and ''chicest''. These are wholly English words: the French equivalents would be ''plus chic'' and ''le/la plus chic''. ''Super-chic'' is sometimes used: "super-chic Incline bucket in mouth-blown, moulded glass".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 8 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

An adverb ''chicly'' has also appeared: "Pamela Gross ... turned up chicly dressed down".&lt;ref&gt;''Tatler'', May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the French ''très chic'' (very chic) by an English speaker – "Luckily it's ''très'' chic to be neurotic in New York"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plum Sykes]] (2004) ''[[Bergdorf Blondes]]''&lt;/ref&gt; – is usually rather pretentious, but sometimes merely facetious—[[Micky Dolenz]] of [[The Monkees]] described the [[Red Indian|Indian]]-style suit he wore at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967 as ''"très chic"''.&lt;ref&gt;Micky Dolenz &amp; Mark Bego (1993) ''I'm a Believer''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Über]]-chic'' is roughly the mock-German equivalent: "Like his clubs, it's super-modern, über-chic, yet still comfortable".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of "chic" is ''unchic'': "the then uncrowded, unchic little port of [[Saint Tropez|St Tropez]]".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lewis (1978) ''The Fifties''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
Over the years "chic" has been applied to, among other things, social events, situations, individuals, and modes or styles of dress. It was one of a number of "slang words" that [[H. W. Fowler]] linked to particular professions – specifically, to "society journalism" – with the advice that, if used in such a context, "familiarity will disguise and sometimes it will bring out its slanginess."&lt;ref&gt;H W &amp; [[Francis George Fowler|F G Fowler]], ''The King's English '', 3rd ed revised H W Fowler, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1887 ''[[The Lady (magazine)|The Lady]]'' noted that "the ladies of New York ... think no form of entertainment so ''chic'' as a luncheon party."&lt;ref&gt;''The Lady'', 20 January 1887&lt;/ref&gt;
*Forty years later, in [[E. F. Benson]]'s novel ''[[Mapp and Lucia|Lucia in London]]'' (1927), Lucia was aware that the arrival of a glittering array of guests ''before their hostess'' for an impromptu post-opera gathering was "the most ''chic'' informality that it was possible to conceive."
*In the 1950s, [[Edith Head]] designed a classic dress, worn by [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the film [[Sabrina (1954 film)|''Sabrina'']] (1954), of which she remarked, "If it had been worn by somebody with no ''chic'' it would never have become a style."&lt;ref&gt;Ian Woodward (1984) ''Audrey Hepburn''&lt;/ref&gt;
*By the turn of the 21st century, the travel company [[Thomas Cook]] was advising those wishing to sample the nightlife of the sophisticated Mediterranean resort of [[Monte Carlo]] that "casual is fine (except at the Casino) but make it expensive, and very chic, casual if you want to blend in."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Medbourne (2006) ''City Spots: Monte Carlo''&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to American magazine ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' (referring to the "dramatic simplicity" of the day-wear of couturier [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]], 1895–1972), "elimination is the secret of chic."&lt;ref&gt;See ''New Yorker'', 3 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7891">[[File:XuBeihong.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Xu Beihong]], the first chairman of the China Artists Association]]

The '''China Artists Association''' ({{zh|s=中国美术家协会}}), originally the '''China National Art Workers' Association''' ({{zh|s=中华全国美术工作者协会|links=no}}), is the official national association of Chinese artists, with its headquarters in [[Beijing]]. It was established in July 1949, with [[Xu Beihong]] as its first chairman. It has 6,000 members, and the current chairman is [[Liu Dawei]].

==Organization==
The China Artists Association is under the leadership of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee]], and managed by the [[Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee Publicity Department]].&lt;ref name="Wiseman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wiseman |first1=Mary |last2=Liu |first2=Yuedi |title=Subversive Strategies in Contemporary Chinese Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xURshm0rC8QC&amp;pg=PA284 |date=21 March 2011 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-18795-2 |page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; It previously operated provincial-level branches in all of China's provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, but in 1990 the provincial branches were reorganized into provincial artists associations and admitted into the national association as group members.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caanet.org.cn/AboutCAA/jianjie.aspx |title=中国美协简介 |accessdate=2016-02-26 |language=Chinese |publisher=China Artists Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national association oversees many specialized subordinate committees, including those for [[Chinese painting]], [[oil painting]], sculpture, architecture, ceramics, print, fresco, animation, ethnic art, and children's art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caanet.org.cn/yiweihui/yiweihui.aspx |title=各专业委员会 |publisher=China Artists Association |language=Chinese |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association organizes the national art exhibition, China's largest art exhibition, every five years.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt; Ten sessions have been held as of 2011. Regional artists associations would select works from artists in the local area and submit them to the higher level for consideration. For individual artists, having works selected for the national exhibition brings fame and improves prospects for promotion. Many of them become heads of lower-level artists associations.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt;

The association's headquarters are located in the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall in Beijing. Its official publication is ''Fine Arts'', a monthly magazine.&lt;ref name=culture&gt;{{cite web |title=China Artists Association |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artists/2003-09/24/content_26939.htm |publisher=Chinese Ministry of Culture |accessdate=2016-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111819/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artists/2003-09/24/content_26939.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13413">'''''Ciutat Morta''''' ("Dead City" in Catalan) is a Spanish documentary film about the [[4F case]] directed by [[Xavier Artigas]] and [[Xapo Ortega]] in 2013.
It has been honored at the [[Guía de Isora]] Festival, [[MiradasDoc]], with an honorable mention, and also as best documentary at the [[Málaga Film Festival]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/documental-caso-premiado-festival-Malaga_0_243925848.html|title=Un documental sobre el caso 4F, premiado en el festival de Málaga|work=eldiario.es|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premiere ==

The documentary '''''4F: ni obit ni perdó''''' ("4F: neither forgetting nor forgiveness" in Catalan) was pre-screened in [[Barcelona]] on June 8, 2013 with an action of civil disobedience. This action consisted of the [[squatting|occupation]] by 800 people of a cinema closed 11 years ago, in the center of [[Barcelona]]: the ''Palacio del Cine'' of [[Vía Layetana]]. The cinema was renamed ''Cinema Patricia Heras''. ''Ciutat Morta'' includes images of the occupation of the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20130609/54375821114/palau-cinema-documental-desmuntatge-4f.html|title=Cientos de jóvenes ocupan el Palau del Cinema para proyectar el documental sobre el 'caso 4F'|work=La Vanguardia|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/noticia/article/5-cultura/19-cultura/752311-poeta-morta.html|title=Poeta morta|work=El Punt Avui|access-date=2017-05-26|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ciutat Morta'' was officially premiered on March 24, 2014 at the Malaga Spanish Film Festival.

== Synopsis ==

June 8, 2013. 800 people enter an abandoned cinema in the center of Barcelona in order to project a documentary. The old building is renamed ''Cinema Patricia Heras'' in honor of a girl who committed suicide two years earlier. But who is Patricia? Why did she decide to take her own life? How does her death relate to Barcelona? The answers to these questions are exactly what they want to publicize with this illegal action as well as a great media impact: to know the truth about one of the worst cases of police and judicial corruption in Barcelona.

=== 4F case ===

The night of February 4, 2006 ended with a police charge in the center of Barcelona. It was around an old busy theater where a party was being held. Among nightsticks hits, objects started to fall from the occupied house’s rooftop. As the [[Mayor of Barcelona]] reported on the radio a few hours later, one of the city policemen, who wore no helmet, was in a coma by the impact of a stone.

The arrests that came immediately after the tragic incident tell us the chronicle of revenge. Three young detainees, of South American origin, were severely tortured in police stations and later sent to provisional prison, being deprived of their freedom for two years, awaiting trial, without being able to clarify what they were accused of. Two other detainees that night - Patricia and Alfredo - deny they had been present at the scene: they were detained in a nearby hospital and found suspected because of the way they dressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lacriticanyc.com/ciudades-muertas-sistemas-deficientes/|title=Ciudades muertas, sistemas deficientes {{!}} La Crítica|website=www.lacriticanyc.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the evidence that exonerated all defendants, in the trial that was held against them, individuals were not being judged, but an entire collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cronicaglobal.com/es/notices/2014/06/ciutat-morta-9058.php|title=Ciutat morta|work=Cronica global|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a generic enemy built by the press and politicians of the model city Barcelona. Barcelona, had just released its so-called "civic ordinance," a hygienist law, a perfect legal framework for the [[gentrification]] plans of some downtown neighborhoods for tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diagonalperiodico.net/culturas/22488-ciutat-morta-videoactivismo-rompe-silencio.html|title='Ciutat morta': El vídeoactivismo rompe el silencio  {{!}} Periódico Diagonal|website=www.diagonalperiodico.net|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boys arrested that night were scapegoats that fit perfectly, for its aesthetics, with the image of the [[anti-system]] dissident: the internal enemy that the model city had been generating lately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://numerocero.es/cine/critica/ciutat-morta/2433|title=Ciutat morta - numerocero.es|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, the news appeared in the media that two policemen had been sentenced to prison, with sentences of more than two years, for having tortured a young Latin American in police stations. The conviction showed that officers lied and manipulated evidence during the trial. In order to cover up the torture they subjected to the young Latin American, they accused him of being a drug trafficker. However, in the course of the judicial inquiry the judge found that the accusation was false and was a police coverup: the young man was actually the son of the honorary consul of [[Norway]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and was in Barcelona studying for university studies. These officers turned out to be the same ones who had tortured the young detainees that night of February 4, 2006, in addition to having declared as witnesses against the defendants during the celebration of the trial. It became clear that the torturers used the same ''modus operandi'' in both cases. The only difference in the second case was the social origin of the victims: being the son of a diplomat, the tortured young man had a fair trial; Those accused of the process of February 4, 2006 did not have it. It is the umpteenth history of police impunity, accompanied by good doses of racism, classism and the violation of fundamental rights, all protected by a police-judicial apparatus and politicians obsessed with the real estate business that offers the Barcelona brand at the expense of its citizens.

=== Patricia Heras, the dead poetess ===

Beyond the city of Barcelona, the main character of ''Ciutat Morta'' is Patricia, who we get to know through her poetry, the testimony of her friends and her ex-partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eldiario.es/interferencias/Mantener-vida-poeta-muerta_6_274082620.html|title=Mantener con vida a la poeta muerta|work=eldiario.es|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a young student of literature, extremely sensitive, which hides her insecurities behind an eccentric aesthetic, fueled by the [[queer]] culture with which it is identified.

The experience that runs through that morning of February 4, 2006, when she is arrested along with her friend Alfredo in a hospital, gives a radical change to her life. Two years of anguish awaiting trial, exhausting all the savings of her life to pay lawyers. Three years in prison. Apart of shredding her life, these events trigger her literary productivity that is being recorded in a blog titled in a premonitory way: ''Poeta Muerta'' ("Dead Poet" in Spanish).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poetadifunta.blogspot.com/|title=poeta muerta|website=poetadifunta.blogspot.com|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patricia commits suicide during a release from jail in April 2011. The authors of this film tried to pay homage.

The documentary ''Ciutat Morta'' was financed exclusively with a campaign of [[crowdfunding]] on the platform [[Verkami]] from microdonations, obtaining 4,720 € of the 4,211 € requested. The surplus was allocated directly to the support group to Patricia Heras and Rodrigo Lanza with the "''Des-Montaje 4F''" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.verkami.com/projects/994-ciutat-morta-des_montaje-4f/blog/955-exit-de-la-campanya|title=Èxit de la campanya – CIUTAT MORTA (Des_Montaje 4F)|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real cost, if all the expenses of realization had been covered, would amount to approximately €90,000.

=== Censure ===

The media minimized the coverage of its premiere and its winning prizes at different festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publico.es/politica/caso-mas-grave-torturas-barcelona.html|title=El caso más grave de torturas en Barcelona, silenciado por los medios|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], the Catalan public television, refused the coproduction of the film once the shooting was concluded, and tried to delay as much as possible the airing of the documentary, even when it was offered to air for free. [[Eugeni Sallent]] (director of TV3) even lied about this fact in the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://directa.cat/actualitat/cinc-correus-electronics-demostren-que-director-de-tv3-ha-mentit-amb-relacio-al|title=Cinc correus electrònics demostren que el director de TV3 ha mentit amb relació al documental 'Ciutat Morta'|last=Directa|work=Directa|access-date=2017-05-26|language=ca-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the documentary was broadcast on January 17, 2015 on [[Canal 33|Channel 33]] in prime time but not in its full version, obtaining a [[screen share]] in [[Catalonia]] of 20% and an audience of 569,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4227631/20150118/censura-dispara-lexpectacio-ciutat-morta.html|title=La censura dispara l'expectació per 'Ciutat Morta'|last=associats|first=Partal, Maresma i|work=VilaWeb.cat|access-date=2017-05-26|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version broadcast on TV had around 5 minutes deleted, in compliance with a judicial ruling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://directa.cat/un-jutjat-de-barcelona-ordena-que-tv3-emeti-ciutat-morta-amb-cinc-minuts-de-censura|title=Un jutjat de Barcelona ordena que TV3 emeti 'Ciutat Morta' amb cinc minuts de censura|last=Directa|work=Directa|access-date=2017-05-26|language=ca-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was considered as a possible form of partial censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/tele/juzgado-censura-cinco-minutos-ciutat-morta-3860866|title=Un juzgado censura cinco minutos de 'Ciutat morta'|last=BARCELONA|first=EL PERIÓDICO /|date=2015-01-17|work=El Periódico|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Barque de Dante (Delacroix 3820).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Vergil]] leading [[Dante]] on his journey in the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', an image that dramatizes the continuity of the classical tradition&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, Glenn W. Most, and Salvatore Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. viii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Dante and Vergil in Hell'' by [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], 1823)]]
The [[Western culture|Western]] '''classical tradition''' is the [[reception theory|reception]] of [[classical antiquity|classical Greco-Roman antiquity]] by later cultures, especially the post-classical West,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Grafton]], [[Glenn W. Most]], and Salvatore Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt; involving texts, imagery, objects, ideas, institutions, monuments, architecture, cultural artifacts, rituals, practices, and sayings.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'', p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Philosophy]], [[History of political thinking|political thought]], and [[classical mythology|mythology]] are three major examples of how classical culture survives and continues to have influence.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, entry on "mythology," in ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 614 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; The West is one of a number of world cultures regarded as having a classical tradition, including the [[Classical India|Indian]], [[Chinese classics|Chinese]], [[Judaism|Judaic]], and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'', p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the classical tradition differs from [[classical philology]], which seeks to recover "the meanings that ancient texts had in their original contexts."&lt;ref&gt;Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''A Companion to the Classical Tradition'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It examines both later efforts to uncover the realities of the [[Greco-Roman world]] and "creative misunderstandings" that reinterpret ancient values, ideas and aesthetic models for contemporary use.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'', p. vii; Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The classicist and translator [[Charles Martindale]] has defined the reception of classical antiquity as "a two-way process … in which the present and the past are in dialogue with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Martindale, "Reception," in ''A Companion to the Classical Tradition'' (2007), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The beginning of a self-conscious classical tradition is usually located in the [[Renaissance]], with the work of [[Petrarch]] in [[Italian Renaissance|14th-century Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Petrarch believed that he was recovering an unobstructed view of a classical past that had been obscured for centuries, the classical tradition in fact had continued uninterrupted during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no single moment of rupture when the inhabitants of what was formerly the [[Roman Empire]] went to bed in antiquity and awoke in the medieval world; rather, the cultural transformation occurred over centuries. The use and meaning of the classical tradition may seem, however, to change dramatically with the emergence of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Aeneas]] carrying his father and leading his son from fallen [[Troy]], a popular image in the Renaissance for the retrieval of the past as a way to make possible the future; the figure of his wife, [[Creusa]], who did not survive, represents that which was lost&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gillgren, ''Siting Federico Barocci and the Renaissance Aesthetic'' (Ashgate, 2011), pp. 165–167.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Federico Barocci]], 1598)]]
The phrase "classical tradition" is itself a modern label, articulated most notably in the [[Post-war#Year spans of the post-World War II era|post-World War II era]] with ''The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature'' of [[Gilbert Highet]] (1949) and ''The Classical Heritage and Its Beneficiaries'' of [[R. R. Bolgar]] (1954). The English word "tradition," and with it the concept of "handing down" classical culture, derives from the Latin verb ''trado, tradere, traditus'', in the sense of "hand over, hand down."&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 1.&lt;!--note--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers and artists influenced by the classical tradition may name their ancient models, or [[allusion|allude]] to their works. Often scholars infer classical influence through [[Comparative literature|comparative methods]] that reveal patterns of thought. Sometimes authors' copies of Greek and Latin texts will contain handwritten annotations that offer direct evidence of how they read and understood their classical models; for instance, in the late 20th century the discovery of [[Montaigne]]'s copy of [[Lucretius]] enabled scholars to document an influence that had long been recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 2.&lt;!--here--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Van Eyck - The Crucifixion; The Last Judgment.jpg|thumb|500px|[[Jan van Eyck]], ''Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych'', c. 1430–40. Oil on canvas, transferred from wood. Each 56.5&amp;nbsp;cm × 19.7&amp;nbsp;cm (22.25&amp;nbsp;in × 7.75&amp;nbsp;in); [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]
 
The '''''Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych''''' (or '''''Diptych with Calvary and Last Judgement''''')&lt;ref name="v362"&gt;Vermij et al., 362&lt;/ref&gt; consists of two small painted panels attributed to the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] artist [[Jan van Eyck]], with areas finished by unidentified followers or members of his workshop. This [[diptych]]  is one of the early [[Northern Renaissance]] [[Panel painting|oil on panel]] masterpieces, renowned for its unusually complex and highly detailed [[iconography]], and for the technical skill evident in its completion. It was executed in a miniature format; the panels are just {{convert|56.5|cm|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|19.7|cm|abbr=on}} wide. The diptych was probably commissioned for private devotion.

The left-hand wing depicts the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion.]] It shows Christ's followers grieving in the foreground, soldiers and spectators milling about in the mid-ground and a portrayal of three crucified bodies in the upper-ground. The scene is framed against an azure sky with a view of [[Jerusalem]] in the distance. The right-hand wing portrays scenes associated with the [[Last Judgment|Last Judgement]]: a hellscape at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of [[Christ in Majesty]] flanked by a [[Deesis|Great Deësis]] of saints, [[apostles]], clergy, virgins and nobility in the upper section. Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110000722 The Crucifixion; The Last Judgment]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 20 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Gilding|gilt]] frames contain Biblical passages in Latin drawn from the [[Books of the Bible|books]] of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse, the panels were [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]] supports in 1867.

The earliest surviving mention of the work appears in 1841, when scholars believed the two panels were wings of a lost [[triptych]].&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt; The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] acquired the diptych in 1933. At that time, the work was attributed to Jan's brother [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]]&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al., 216&lt;/ref&gt; because key areas formally resembled pages of the ''[[Turin-Milan Hours]]'', which were then believed to be of Hubert's hand.&lt;ref name="B86" /&gt; On the evidence of technique and the style of dress of the figures, the majority of scholars believe the panels are late works by Jan van Eyck, executed in the early 1430s and finished after his death. Other art historians hold that van Eyck painted the panels around the early 1420s and attribute the weaker passages to a younger van Eyck's relative inexperience.&lt;ref name="B86"&gt;Borchert, 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B89"&gt;Borchert, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format and technique ==
Along with [[Robert Campin]] and later [[Rogier van der Weyden]], Van Eyck revolutionised the approach towards naturalism and [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in Northern European painting during the early to mid 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al., 378&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to manipulate oils to give the close detailing that infused his figures with the high degree of realism and complexity of emotion  seen in this diptych.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 163&lt;/ref&gt; He coupled this with a mastery of glaze to create luminous surfaces with a deep perspective—most noticeable in the upper portion of the ''Crucifixion'' panel—which had not been achieved before.&lt;ref name="V70"&gt;Viladesau, 70&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1420s and 1430s, when oil and panel painting were still in their infancy, vertical formats were often used for [[Doom paintings|depictions of the Last Judgement]], because the narrow framing particularly suited a hierarchical presentation of heaven, earth and hell. By contrast, depictions of the [[Crucifixion in the arts|Crucifixion]] were usually presented in a horizontal format. To fit such expansive and highly detailed representations onto two equally small and narrow wings, van Eyck was forced to make a number of innovations, redesigning many elements of the ''Crucifixion'' panel to match the vertical and condensed presentation of the Judgement narrative.&lt;ref name="SM144"&gt;Smith, 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt; The result is a panel with the crosses rising high into the sky, an unusually packed crowd scene in the mid-ground, and the moving spectacle of the mourners in the foreground, all rendered in a continuous slope from bottom to top in the style of medieval [[Tapestry|tapestries]]. Art historian [[Otto Pächt]] says it "is the whole world in one painting, an [[Orbis Pictus]]".&lt;ref name="P192"/&gt;

In the ''Crucifixion'' panel, van Eyck follows the early 14th-century tradition of presenting the biblical episodes using a narrative technique.&lt;ref name="l14"&gt;Labuda, 14&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Jeffrey Chipps Smith]], the episodes appear as "simultaneous, not sequential" events.&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt; Van Eyck condenses key episodes from the gospels into a single composition, each placed so as to draw the viewer's eye upward in a logical sequence.&lt;ref name="l14"/&gt; This device allowed van Eyck to create a greater [[Perspective (graphical)|illusion of depth]] with more complex and unusual spatial arrangements.&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt; In the ''Crucifixion'' panel, he uses different indicators to show the relative closeness of particular groupings of figures to Jesus. Given the size of the mourners in the foreground relative to the crucified figures, the soldiers and spectators gathered in the mid-ground are far larger than a strict adherence to perspective would allow. In the ''Last Judgement'' the damned are placed in hell in the lower mid-ground while the saints and angels are positioned higher in the upper foreground.&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt; Pächt writes of this panel that the scene is "assimilated into a single spatial cosmos", with the archangel acting as a divider in the pictorial space between heaven and hell.&lt;ref name="P192"/&gt;

Art historians are unsure as to whether the panels were meant to be a diptych or a triptych.&lt;ref name ="P190"/&gt; They may have formed the outer wings of a triptych, with a since-lost panel representing the [[Adoration of the Magi]] at the centre,&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt; or, as the German art historian [[Johann David Passavant|J.D. Passavant]] speculated in 1841, the lost centre panel may have been a [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]].&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; It is now thought unlikely that a lost panel could be the postulated original companion to the outer wings; such a coupling would have been very odd to painters of the 1420s and 1430s. It has also been proposed that a central piece was added later, or as Albert Châtelet writes, the central panel may have been stolen.&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CA74"&gt;Châtelet, 74&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] believed the ''Crucifixion'' and ''Last Judgement'' panels were intended as a diptych. He argued that it would have been unusual for mere outer wings to have been given the "sumptuous treatment" afforded these two panels.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 454&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is reminiscent of the medieval [[reliquary|reliquaries]].&lt;ref name="B86" /&gt; Others have observed that triptychs were usually much larger works intended for public display, and they tended towards gilded and heavily inscribed frames; typically only the central panel would have been as lavishly decorated as these panels. Contemporary diptychs, in contrast, were usually produced for private devotion and were typically ungilded.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; There is no documentary evidence for an original central panel, however, and technical examination suggests the two works were intended as wings of a diptych, then an emerging format.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al., 78&lt;/ref&gt; Pächt believes there is not enough evidence to determine whether a third panel existed.&lt;ref name ="P190"&gt;Pächt, 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

== The diptych ==

=== ''Crucifixion'' panel ===
The ''Crucifixion'' panel comprises three horizontal planes, each representing different moments from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. The upper third shows the [[crucifixion]] before a view of [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]; the lower two thirds detail the crowds and Jesus' followers at [[Calvary|Golgotha]] (''Place of the Skull'').&lt;ref name="L9"&gt;Labuda, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Located outside the city walls amongst rock tombs and gardens, in the first century Golgotha was Jerusalem's place of execution,&lt;ref&gt;Sebag Montefiore, 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; and the visible patches of hill highlight the area's "stony, forbidding, and lifeless" nature.&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt; The atmosphere of bleakness is reinforced by the random figures in the upper ground that scramble for a better view.&lt;ref name="L9" /&gt; The gospels tell of Jesus' followers and relatives, as well as his prosecutors and assorted spectators, attending the crucifixion at Golgotha. In van Eyck's panel the former are represented in the foreground, while the latter, including [[High Priest (Judaism)|High Priests]] and [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple Elders]], are shown in the mid-ground.&lt;ref name="l10"&gt;Labuda, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck Diptych Detail Dying Christ.jpg|thumb|Death of Christ on the cross. Typically, a crucifixion victim's legs were broken to hasten death. According to the Gospel of John, when soldiers came to break Jesus' legs, they found him already dead. A soldier pierced his side with a lance; blood and water poured from the wound.&lt;ref&gt;Sebag Montefiore, 129&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The centre foreground shows a group of five mourners, with three other figures set to the right and left. In the center group, [[John the Evangelist]] supports the Virgin [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], surrounded by three women. Mary's [[Swoon of the Virgin|dramatic swoon]] in grief pushes her forward in the pictorial space, and according to Smith, places her "closest to the viewer's presumed position".&lt;ref name="s146" /&gt; Dressed in an enveloping blue robe that hides most of her face, she collapses and is caught by John, who supports her by her arms. [[Mary Magdalene]] kneels to the right, dressed in a white-trimmed green robe and red sleeves. Raising her arms aloft, she clenches her fingers in a distraught, agonised manner.&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, 16&lt;/ref&gt; She is the only figure from this group shown to look directly at Christ and serves as one of the key painterly devices to direct the viewer's gaze upwards towards the crosses.&lt;ref name="l12"&gt;Labuda, 12&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth and fifth mourners have been identified as prophesying [[sibyls]], and stand to the far left and right of the centre group. The sibyl to the left faces the cross with her back to the viewer while the turbaned mourner on the right faces the group and is either the [[Erythraean Sibyl|Erythraean]] or the [[Cumaean Sibyl|Cumaean]] sibyl,&lt;ref name="l12" /&gt; both of whom are attributed in Christian tradition with warning the occupying Romans of the cult of redemption that would develop around Christ's death and resurrection.&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt; She has an almost indifferent expression that has been interpreted both as satisfaction at seeing her prophesies realised,&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt; and as compassionate contemplation of the other women's grief.&lt;ref name="w146"&gt;Weale, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-ground shows a crowd scene above the group of mourners, separated by two soldiers who stand between the two groupings. The mourners from the foreground are reflected in the shield carried on the hip of the lance-bearing Roman soldier who leans on the man to his right wearing a red turban. Smith believes this serves to highlight the mourners' emotional and physical separation from the assorted figures gathered in the mid-ground.&lt;ref name="s146"&gt;Smith, 146&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Adam Labuda sees these two figures, positioned full-length between the chief mourners and mid-ground spectators, as a pictorial device that along with the Magdalene's upward gaze draws viewers' eyes upwards through the panel's dramatic sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Labuda, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck Diptych Detail Mounted on lookers.jpg|left|thumb|The taunting of the condemned. At the time there were many enemies of the Temple and Jesus was seen by the Jewish hierarchy merely as the charismatic successor to [[John the Baptist]]. Although he became enough of a legitimate threat to be executed, he was ultimately viewed by the elders as just another agitating pseudo-prophet.&lt;ref&gt;Sebag Montefiore, 114–127&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Van Eyck's depiction lays particular emphasis on the brutishness and indifference of the crowd witnessing Christ's suffering.&lt;ref name="b192"&gt;Burroughs, 192&lt;/ref&gt; They comprise a mixture of Roman legionaries, judges and various hangers-on arriving to witness the spectacle.&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt; A number are dressed in rich, brightly coloured clothes, a mixture of oriental and northern European styles,&lt;ref name="V70" /&gt; while several are mounted on horseback. Some openly jeer and taunt the condemned, others gape stupefied at "just another" execution,&lt;ref name="b192" /&gt; while others talk amongst themselves. The exception is the armoured [[centurion]], seated on a white horse at the extreme right edge of the panel, who looks up at Christ, arms spread wide, head thrown back, at "the very moment of his illumination" in recognition of Christ's divinity.&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt; The horsemen closely resemble both the ''[[:File:Ghent Altarpiece E - Knights of Christ.jpg|Soldiers of Christ]]'' and ''[[:File:Ghent Altarpiece E - Just Judges by Vanderveken.jpg|Righteous Judges]]'' from the lower inner panels of van Eyck's c. 1432 ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]''. Art historian [[Till-Holger Borchert]] observes that these figures are given "greater dynamism by being seen in rear rather than profile view", and that this vantage point draws the observer's eye upwards towards the mid-ground and the crucifixion.&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt;

Van Eyck extends the height of the crosses to an unrealistic degree to allow the crucifixion to dominate the upper third of the panel. Christ faces the viewer directly, while the crosses of the two thieves are set at angles to either side.&lt;ref name="V70" /&gt; The thieves are each bound with cords of rope rather than nails.&lt;ref name="w146" /&gt; The body of the thief to the right—the [[Penitent thief|repentant thief]] mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]]—is lifeless. The [[Impenitent thief|"bad" thief]] to his left is dying twisted in pain, and according to art historian [[William Henry James Weale|James W.H. Weale]], depicted as "struggling desperately, but in vain".&lt;ref name="w147"&gt;Weale, 147&lt;/ref&gt; Both men's hands have turned black from a lack of blood flow.&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt; A placard prepared by Pilate or Roman soldiers placed above Jesus' head reads "[[Jesus, King of the Jews|Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews]]" in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt;

[[File:14th-century painters - Page from the Très Belles Heures de Notre Dame de Jean de Berry - WGA16012.jpg|280px|thumb|Leaf from the ''[[Turin-Milan Hours]]'', unknown artist, c. 1440–1450. This illustration is often attributed to Jan van Eyck or a member of his workshop.]]
The panel captures the instant of Christ's death,&lt;ref name="w146" /&gt; traditionally the moment after the breaking of the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible.&lt;ref name="V70" /&gt; His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base.&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt; His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death.&lt;ref name="b192" /&gt; In the mid-ground, at the base of the cross, [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]], on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant,&lt;ref name="w146" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps a reference to his blindness in some later accounts.&lt;/ref&gt; stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a [[Holy Lance|lance]],&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt; as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured [[Stephaton]] holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt;

The first generation of [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painters did not usually pay much attention to landscape backgrounds. They were often included, showing strong influence from the Italian painters, but typically as minor elements of the composition, seen in the far distance and lacking any real observation of nature.&lt;ref name="B188"&gt;Burroughs, 188&lt;/ref&gt; This diptych, however, contains one of the most memorable landscape backgrounds in Northern 15th-century art. The panoramic view of Jerusalem extends upwards in the distance to the mountainous peaked range in the background. The sky, which continues to the upper part of the right hand panel, is rendered in deep blues and lined with [[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]] clouds. These clouds are similar to those in the ''Ghent Altarpiece'' and, as in that work, are included to give depth to and enliven the background skyscape.&lt;ref name="maxj53"&gt;Friedländer, 53&lt;/ref&gt; The sky seems to have just darkened, in keeping with the idea that the panel captures the moment of Jesus' death.&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt; Faint [[Cirrus cloud|cirrus]] clouds can be seen in the far high-ground, with the presence of the sun is suggested by a shadow falling on the top left area of the panel.&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt;

=== ''Last Judgement'' panel ===
The right hand wing, as with the ''Crucifixion'' wing, is divided horizontally into three areas. Here they represent, from top to bottom heaven, earth and hell. Heaven contains a traditional [[Deesis|Great Deësis]] with clergy and laity; earth, in the mid-ground, is dominated by the figures of [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] and a [[Death (personification)|personification of Death]]; while in the lower ground the damned fall into hell, where they are tortured and eaten by beasts.&lt;ref&gt;Pächt, 192–195&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the hell passage, art historian Bryson Burroughs writes that "the diabolical inventions of [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Brueghel]] are children's boggy lands compared to the horrors of the hell [van Eyck] has imagined."&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mm182"&gt;McNamee, 182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck Diptych the Fall3.jpg|left|thumb|380px|[[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael the Archangel]] bestrides the damned, while behind him the resurrected emerge from their graves before a burning city.&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt;]]
Pächt compares the scene to a medieval [[bestiary]], comprising a "whole fauna of zoomorphic fiends".  Van Eyck's hell is inhabited by demonic monsters whose only visible features are often "their glittering eyes and the white of their fangs".&lt;ref name="P192"&gt;Pächt, 192–194&lt;/ref&gt;  The sinners fall head first into their torment, at the mercy of devils taking recognisable forms such as rats, snakes and pigs, as well as a bear and a donkey.&lt;ref name="b192" /&gt; Daringly, van Eyck shows kings and members of the clergy among those condemned to hell.&lt;ref name="s146" /&gt;

The earth is represented by the narrow area between heaven and hell. The passage shows the resurrection of the dead as the fires of the last day rage. The dead rise from their graves to the left and from the stormy sea to the right.&lt;ref name="b192" /&gt; The Archangel Michael stands on death's shoulders,&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt; the largest figure in the painting, whose body and wings span the entire pictorial space.&lt;ref name="P192"/&gt; Michael wears jewel-studded golden armour and has curly blond hair and multicoloured wings similar to those seen in the [[donor portrait|donor panel]] of van Eyck's 1437 Dresden ''[[Dresden Triptych|Triptych of the Virgin and Child]]''.&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt; Michael appears, according to Smith, "like a giant on the earth, whose crust is revealed to be the wings of the skeletal figure of Death. The damned are excreted though Death's bowels into the dark slime of hell."&lt;ref name="s146" /&gt; The bat-like death figure, with skull extruding up to earth and skeletal arms and legs reaching down into hell, is the protagonist of the narrative according to Pächt, but death is vanquished by the slim and youthful looking [[archangel]] standing between the horrors of hell and the promise of heaven.&lt;ref name="P192"/&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck Diptych Crucifixion Right Detail 1.jpg|thumb|350px|A personification of death spreads its skeletal wings over the fallen and damned, a number of whom can be identified by their headdress as members of the clergy.]]
The upper portion of the panel shows the second coming as recorded in [[The Sheep and the Goats|Matthew 25:31]]: "But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory."&lt;ref name="u202"&gt;Underwood, 202&lt;/ref&gt; Christ, who was naked, frail and almost lifeless in the ''Crucifixion'' panel, is now resurrected and [[Christ in Majesty|triumphant in heaven]].&lt;ref name="s146" /&gt; He is dressed in a long red [[cope|mantle]] and is barefoot. His hands and feet are surrounded by circles of yellow light.&lt;ref name="w147" /&gt; The [[Holy Wounds]] are visible on his
palms held open; the puncture mark left by Longinus' spear is visible on his side through the opening in his robe, as are the nail holes on his feet.&lt;ref name="mm181"&gt;McNamee, 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Christ is seated at the centre of a large array of angels, saints and holy elders.&lt;ref name="mm181"/&gt; According to Pächt, in this scene in heaven that "all is sweetness, gentleness and order."&lt;ref&gt;Pächt, 195&lt;/ref&gt; Mary and [[John the Baptist]] kneel in prayer to his immediate right and left. Both have halos and are rendered at a far larger scale than the surrounding figures, over whom they seem to tower. Mary holds her right hand at her breast, while her left is raised as if to ask for mercy for the smaller naked figures sheltered by her cloak, evoking the conventional pose of the [[Virgin of Mercy]]. A choir of virgins gather directly under Christ's feet. They face outwards towards the viewer and sing Christ's praise.&lt;ref name="mm181" /&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck Diptych Detail.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Detail of the [[Christ in Majesty]]. This area is considered to have been painted more broadly and with less skill than the other sections of the panels, and is thus thought by some to have been painted by members of van Eyck's workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Most likely after his death around 1441.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Headed by [[Saint Peter]], the Apostles are dressed in white robes and sit on two facing benches set below Christ and to the right and left of the choir of virgins. Two angels attend to the groups gathered at each side of the benches.&lt;ref&gt;Weale, 147–148&lt;/ref&gt; A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ. They hold his cross and are dressed in white [[amice]] and [[alb]]s, with the right hand angel wearing an outer blue [[dalmatic]] vestment. They are flanked on either side by angels playing long wind instruments, probably trumpets.&lt;ref name="w147" /&gt; The two angels on either side of Christ bear the [[Arma Christi|symbols of the crucifixion]] already represented on the left hand panel. The angel on the left holds a lance and [[crown of thorns]], the angel on the right a [[Holy Sponge|sponge]] and [[Nail (relic)|nails]].&lt;ref name="mm182" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mm181" /&gt;

Van Eyck was a central influence on [[Petrus Christus]] and the younger painter is thought to have studied the panels while they were still in van Eyck's workshop.&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt;&lt;!--any more detail on this? When, how do we know?--&gt;&lt;!--yes, wait, but not very flattering to Christus, source him as deritive and simplifing--&gt; He made a much larger and adapted paraphrase of the panel in 1452, as part of a monumental altarpiece,  now in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Susan. "[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/eyck/hd_eyck.htm Jan van Eyck (ca. 1380/90–1441)]". In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 2000. Retrieved 7 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are significant differences between the two works, the influence of van Eyck on Christus' work is most evident in the vertical, narrow format and in the central figure of Saint Michael, who also divides the scene between heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, 39&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iconography ===
Art historian John Ward highlights the rich and complex [[iconography]] and symbolic meaning van Eyck employed to bring attention to what he saw as the co-existence of the spiritual and material worlds. In his paintings, iconographical features are typically subtly woven into the work, as "relatively small, in the background, or in the shadow [details]".&lt;ref name="W11"&gt;Ward, 11&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of the imagery is often so densely and intricately layered that a work has to be viewed multiple times before even the most obvious meanings become apparent. According to Ward, the iconographical elements are commonly positioned "initially to overlook, and eventually to discover".&lt;ref&gt;Ward, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the ''Last Judgement'' panel, Burroughs notes that "each of its several scenes requires attention for itself alone."&lt;ref name="b192" /&gt; According to Ward, van Eyck forces the viewer to search for the meaning in the iconography, creating a multi-layered surface which rewards the attentive viewer with deeper understanding of both the painting and its symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, 13, 32&lt;/ref&gt; Much of van Eyck's iconography intends to convey the idea of "the promised passage from sin and death to salvation and rebirth".&lt;ref&gt;Ward, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inscriptions ===
Both the frames and pictorial areas of the diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;Especially in his heavily inscribed, now lost, ''[[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal (van Eyck)|Portrait of Isabella of Portugal]]'' (1428). See Pächt, 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ML403ff"&gt;Lodewijckx, 403–404&lt;/ref&gt; which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning in a manner similar to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.&lt;ref name="s146" /&gt;

In this work, the inscriptions are in Roman capitals or Gothic miniature,&lt;ref name="ML403ff"/&gt; and in some places seem to contain misspellings, making interpretation difficult.&lt;ref name="It"&gt;"Italia 1:3.500.000. Cartina scolastica". Rome: Cartine da banco, 1976. 502&lt;/ref&gt; Its gold-lined frame and Latin inscriptions, with their subtle references to various passages in the two panels, indicate that the donor was wealthy and educated.&lt;ref name="B86" /&gt; The sides of each frame are lined with inscriptions from the [[Book of Isaiah]] ([[s:Bible_(Bishops%27)/Isaiah#Chapter_53|53]]:6–9, 12), [[Book of Revelation|Revelations]] ([[s:Bible_(Wycliffe)/Apocalips#Chapter_20|20]]:13, 21:3–4) or the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] ([[s:Bible_(Wycliffe)/Deuteronomy#Chapter_32|32]]:23–24).&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; In the right hand panel, the wings of the figure of death contain Latin inscriptions on either side; on the left are the words &lt;small&gt;''CHAOS MAGNVM''&lt;/small&gt; ("great chaos"), with &lt;small&gt;''UMBRA MORTIS''&lt;/small&gt; ("shadow of death") inscribed to the right.&lt;ref name="w148"&gt;Weale, 148&lt;/ref&gt; A warning from Matthew 25:41 is written on both sides of death's head and wings, and extends from earth down into the hell section. It reads, ''Ite vos maledicti in ignem eternam'' ("Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire"). In this way, van Eyck dramatically aligns the biblical extract in diagonal dual beams of light seemingly hurled from the heavens.&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt; Also in the section are letters reading &lt;small&gt;''ME OBVLIVI''.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="ML403ff"/&gt;

In the mid-ground, the Archangel Michael's armour is heavily inscribed with esoteric and often difficult to source phrases.&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt; Letters on his breast plate read &lt;small&gt;''VINAE(X)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="ML403ff"/&gt; while his jewel-encrusted oval [[buckler]] displays the cross and is decorated with Greek script reading &lt;small&gt;''ADORAVI TETGRAMMATHON AGLA''&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt; The meaning of this phrase has not been conclusively identified; some art historians believe it contains misspellings and has been misread.&lt;ref name="It" /&gt; Friedländer transcribed the first word as &lt;small&gt;''ADORAVI''&lt;/small&gt; while the final word &lt;small&gt;''AGLA''&lt;/small&gt; is thought be taken from the first four letters of the Hebrew words for "Thou Art Mighty", and thus may signify God; the word also appears in a floor tile in the ''Ghent Altarpiece''.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt;&lt;ref name="maxj53" /&gt; In the upper portion, gilded inscriptions running vertically across the edges of Christ's mantle read &lt;small&gt;''VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI''&lt;/small&gt; ("Come, ye blessed of my father").&lt;ref name="w147" /&gt;

== Attribution and dating ==
Over the years the panels have been attributed to  both Jan and [[Hubert van Eyck]] as well as Petrus Christus. In 1841, Passavant attributed the diptych jointly to Hubert and Jan van Eyck;&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; by 1853, he had revised his opinion and gave attribution exclusively to Jan.&lt;ref&gt;Passavant, 123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Gustav Waagen]], the first director of the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]], attributed them to Petrus Christus in the mid 19th-century, based on the left hand panel's similarity in composition to a 1452 ''Last Judgement'' signed by Christus now in Berlin. This view was rejected in 1887, and they once more became associated with Jan. The panels came into the possession of the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage Gallery]] in 1917, credited to Jan.&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt;
   
Bryson Burroughs, writing for the Metropolitan at the time of their acquisition in 1933, attributed the works to Hubert. Burroughs saw in the panels the hand of an expressive artist, "all nerves and sensibilities",&lt;ref name="B188"/&gt; overcome with sympathy for the plight of the central figures in the panels, but who was nonetheless weak in drawing line. This profile, he believed, was incompatible with the aloof and impassive master craftsman Jan is known to have been.&lt;ref name="B188" /&gt; Yet Burroughs acknowledged there was "no certain documented proof for the attribution [to Hubert]." He admitted his evidence was "limited, inevitably incomplete", and thus "circumstantial and presumptive".&lt;ref name="B184"&gt;Burroughs, 184&lt;/ref&gt; More recent scholarship tends to agree Jan painted the panels based on the evidence that they are stylistically closer to Jan than Hubert, who died in 1426; and that Jan, who travelled across the [[Alps]] to Italy that year, painted the mountain range.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt;

[[File:Petrus Christus - The Last Judgement - WGA04844.jpg|210px|thumb|[[Petrus Christus]]'s ''Last Judgement'' (1452) is a much larger, though more sparse and more easily "read", near-copy of van Eyck's panel. Panofsky commented that "what [Christus] thought difficult to understand, he explained; and what he chose to retain,
he rendered in simple, vernacular language."&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al., 78–79&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]

The paintings have often been compared to the seven pages of the ''[[Turin-Milan Hours]]'' [[illuminated manuscript]] attributed to the unidentified artist "Hand G", generally thought to have been Jan van Eyck.&lt;ref&gt;"The identification of Hand G with Jan van Eyck is considered very likely nowadays." See Ridderbos et al., 244&lt;/ref&gt; The closeness is seen to lie both in the miniaturist technique and the particular painterly style. The similarity of a Turin drawing of the crucified Christ to the figure in the New York diptych has led some art historians to conclude they were, at least, painted near the same time, during the 1420s and early 1430s. Most believe both the drawing and diptych panel at least originated from a prototype designed by Jan van Eyck.&lt;ref name="B86" /&gt; Panofsky attributed the New York panels to "Hand G".&lt;ref name="A89"&gt;Ainsworth, 89&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''Turin-Milan Hours'' miniatures were discovered they were at first believed to have been painted before the [[John, Duke of Berry|Duke of Berry]]'s death in 1416, an idea that was quickly rejected with the date extended to sometime in the early 1430s.&lt;ref name="Pächt 190"&gt;Pächt, 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Pächt writes of the diptych that it reflects the "personal style and unique scenic imagination" of "Hand G" (whom he believed to be either Hubert or Jan).&lt;ref name="Pächt 190"/&gt; Until [[Hans Belting]] and Dagmar Eichberger's 1983 ''Jan van Eyck als Erzähler'', academics tended to focus exclusively on the diptych's dating and attribution, with little attention paid to its source influences and iconography.&lt;ref name="L9" /&gt; Borchert estimates a completion of c. 1440, while Paul Durrieu suggests a dating as early as 1413.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; In 1983, Belting and Eichberger suggested a date of c. 1430 based on specific characteristics of the work:  the "birds-eye view" perspective and horizon, the densely packed figures and, especially, a pictorial narrative that moves logically across the areas of the image in the ''Crucifixion'' panel.&lt;ref name="l12" /&gt; Belting and Eichberger believe this style was employed during the early panel works, but was largely abandoned by the 1430s.&lt;ref name="v362" /&gt;

The 1430s dating is supported by the style of the [[underdrawing]], which is consistent with known signed works by van Eyck from that time. In addition, the figures are dressed in clothes fashionable in the 1420s with the exception of one of the possible donors, tentatively identified as [[Margaret of Bavaria]], who is depicted as the sybil standing in the right foreground of the crucifixion panel and wears clothes in style in the early 1430s.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt;

The upper portions of the ''Last Judgement'' panel are generally considered as the work of a weaker painter with a less individual style. It is thought that van Eyck left the panels unfinished with completed underdrawings, and the area was finished by workshop members or by followers after he died.&lt;ref name="B86" /&gt; [[Maryan Ainsworth]] of the Metropolitan takes a different view. She highlights the close relationship known to have existed between contemporary workshops in the Low Countries and France, and speculates that a French miniaturist or [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminator]], perhaps from the workshop of the [[Bedford Master]], travelled to Bruges to assist van Eyck on the right hand panel.&lt;ref name="A89" /&gt;&lt;!--note, as stated this really makes light of her claim, need to develop--&gt;

== Provenance ==
Nothing is known of the work's provenance before the 1840s. Given the panels' diminutive size—which is typical of early diptychs&lt;ref name="b192" /&gt;—it seems probable that the work was commissioned for private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated patron, with knowledge of and appreciation for the art of earlier centuries, is reinforced by both the classical language inscriptions and the abundant detail found across all areas of the panels.&lt;ref name="B86"/&gt;

Writing in 1841 in the journal ''Kunstblatt'',&lt;ref&gt;In [[Johann Friedrich Cotta]]'s supplement to Morgenblatt.&lt;/ref&gt; Passavant gave an account of how the panels were bought at auction from either a Spanish monastery or convent. The Russian diplomat [[Dmitry Tatishchev]] acquired the panels, possibly from a Spanish convent or monastery near Madrid or [[Burgos]], while living in Spain between 1814 and 1821.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; Tatishchev left his pictures to [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] in 1845, and they came into the possession of the Hermitage Gallery in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1917.&lt;ref name="A70"&gt;Ainsworth, 70&lt;/ref&gt;

The panels were included in the [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings]], which included another important van Eyck work, the 1434–1436 ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]''. They were purchased by Charles Henschel of New York art dealer [[M. Knoedler &amp; Company]]&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, 172&lt;/ref&gt; for $185,000, significantly less than the asking price of $600,000 when the works were offered in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;The decline in price reflected the general pressure on Russian foreign trade at the time; Soviet art prices were suffering, not helped by the impression that the Russians needed cash. See Williams, 227&lt;/ref&gt; The panels were shipped from Saint Petersburg to the Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin before M. Knoedler &amp; Company sold them on to the Metropolitan in New York that year.&lt;ref name="B184" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5812">'''DanceAbility International''' is a dance company that trains inclusive dance teachers worldwide, as well as offering Youth Outreach and education programs, and performances. DanceAbility promotes [[contemporary dance]] performance that mixes able and disabled dancers in the same performances. This dance genre is often called "inclusive dance", "MixedAbility" or "[[physically integrated dance]]".

According to the Mission Statement of DanceAbility International, "The work of DanceAbility International helps decrease prejudice and misconceptions about diversity in the field of dance, and by extension in society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.danceability.com/index.php|publisher=DanceAbility International|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
DanceAbility trains its dancers using improvisation techniques, mainly [[Contact Improvisation]]. This is "a forum in which able and disabled dancers learn to move together".&lt;ref name="Bertens-1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=International Postmodernism: Theory and Literary Practice|year=1997|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027234452|pages=154–5|editor=Bertens, Johannes Willem and Douwe Fokkema}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alessi has described Contact Improvisation as a technique that evolved 

{{quote|from an experiment to a method with a very specific approach for any combination of people [...] At first, I thought inclusion was the issue, but the real problem for people with most kinds of disabilities is not inclusion but isolation. So we teach that every person can make movement and any part of a person’s body can express emotion—this form of dance is a heightened ability to communicate. It’s about not labeling, about creating language.&lt;ref name="Bjornstad-2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bjornstad |first=Randi |title=Freedom to Move, Oregon Life |url=http://projects.registerguard.com/web/livinglifestyles/27111172-41/dance-alessi-alito-danceability-dancing.html.csp |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |newspaper=The Register Guard |location=Eugene, Oregon |date=November 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527172659/http://projects.registerguard.com/web/livinglifestyles/27111172-41/dance-alessi-alito-danceability-dancing.html.csp |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alessi has said that he was greatly influenced in his career by the experience of growing up with family members with disabilities: "I have three immediate relatives with disabilities—my mother was quadriplegic following a traffic accident when I was 7, my sister had polio, and my uncle had what I call 'unique mental capabilities'". Alessi was also influenced by the dance cultures of the various [[inner city|inner cities]] he was exposed to while moving often as a child.&lt;ref name="Bjornstad-2011"/&gt;

==Programmes==
Dancers who have worked with DanceAbility include Alito Alessi, Emery Blackwell, Karen Nelson, Scott Smith, and Charlene Curtis.&lt;ref name="Bertens-1997"/&gt; Alessi launched DanceAbility with Karen Nelson in 1987, after reading an article about Contact Improvisation in [[Contact Quarterly]] dance and improvisation journal. DanceAbility began as a project of the [[Joint Forces Dance Company]], giving a workshop on Contact Improvisation. DanceAbility became an international project beginning with workshops in Germany in 1991; teachers of inclusive and contemporary dance from several countries participated in DanceAbility gatherings annually during the early 1990s in [[Eugene, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.danceability.com/history.php|publisher=DanceAbility International|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of DanceAbility, the majority of inclusive dance teachers were self-taught. DanceAbility offered teacher certification in 1997. Teacher training remains one of its core projects. Teacher training is now given in several countries, including:
* the United States ([[Eugene, Oregon]])
* [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]
* [[Milan, Italy]]
* [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]]
* [[Trier, Germany]]
* [[Vienna, Austria]] (at ImPulsTanz Festival)
* [[Helsinki, Finland]]

Following a major donation in 2007 from Marisa De Leon, founder of a school for children with disabilities in [[Montevideo, Uruguay]], DanceAbility International has expanded into Latin America. Workshops have been held in [[Mexico City]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Puerto Madryn]], [[São Paulo]], and [[Montevideo]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

DanceAbility International has been the subject of three documentaries:
* ''Common Ground''
* ''All Bodies Speak''
* ''Joy Lab Research''
Alessi's writing on the topic of Contact Improvisation has appeared in [[Contact Quarterly]] dance journal, and in ''Dance, Human Rights, and Social Justice—Dignity in Motion'', edited by Naomi Jackson and Toni Shapiro-Phim.&lt;ref name="JFD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Artistic Director Biography|url=http://www.jointforcesdance.com/bioAlito.php|publisher=Joint Forces Dance|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth Outreach==
Alessi has performed with a partner in a wheelchair since 1995, exposing tens of thousands of children to physically integrated dance. Performances have been held in North, Central, and South America, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name="JFD"/&gt;

[[File:Turner Dido Building Carthage.jpg|thumb|300px|J. M. W. Turner, ''Dido building Carthage, or The Rise of the Carthaginian Empire'', 1815]]

'''''Dido building Carthage, or The Rise of the Carthaginian Empire''''' is an oil on canvas painting by [[J. M. W. Turner]].  The painting is one of Turner's most important works, greatly influenced by the luminous classical landscapes of [[Claude Lorraine]].  Turner described it as his [[chef d'oeuvre]].  First exhibited at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1815, Turner kept the painting until he left it to the nation in the [[Turner Bequest]].  It has been held by the [[National Gallery]] in London since 1856.  

The subject is a classical landscape taken from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''.  The figure in blue and white on the left is [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]], directing the builders of the new city of [[Carthage]].  The figure in front of her, wearing armour and facing away from the viewer, may be her [[Troy|Trojan]] lover [[Aeneas]].  Some children are playing with a flimsy toy boat in the water, symbolising the growing but fragile naval power of Carthage, while the tomb of her dead husband [[Sychaeus]], on the right side of the painting, on the other bank of the estuary, foreshadows the eventual doom of Carthage.  

The painting measures {{convert|155.5|cm}} by {{convert| 230|cm}} with the top half of the painting dominated by an intense yellow sunrise, symbolising the dawn of a new empire.  The [[1815 eruption of Mount Tambora|eruption of Mount Tambora]] in April 1815 created magnificent sunrises and sunsets which may have inspired Turner's paintings in this period.  The painting was widely admired when it was first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1815 together ''Crossing the Brook'', a pastoral landscape of the [[River Tamar]] in Devon also inspired by Claude.  However, Turner's work was criticised by Sir [[George Beaumont]], who complained that it was "painted in false taste, not true to nature" and did not reach the heights of Claude's works.  Turner exhibited a companion piece, ''[[The Decline of the Carthaginian Empire]]'', at the summer exhibition in 1817.

In the first draft of his first will in 1829, Turner stipulated that he should be buried in the canvas of ''Dido building Carthage'', but changed his mind to make a donation of the painting and ''The Decline of the Carthaginian Empire'' to the National Gallery, on condition that his two paintings should always be hung either side of Claude's ''[[Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba]]'', a painting that Turner first saw when it was part of the [[Angerstein collection]] which later became the nucleus for the National Gallery.  His revised will of 1831 changed the bequest, so ''Dido building Carthage'' would be accompanied by ''[[Sun rising through Vapour]]'', and the two works would be exhibited alongside ''Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba'' and ''[[Landscape with the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca]]'' (also known as ''The Mill'').  A codicil in 1848 donated the remainder of his completed works to the new National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, so they could be displayed together.  The [[Turner Bequest]] was contested by his relatives, but resolved by 1856 when the works were acquired by the National Gallery.  Most of Turner's works eventually moved to the [[Tate Gallery]] in the early 20th century, but ''Dido building Carthage'' and ''Sun rising through Vapour'' remain at the National Gallery, shown with the Claudes; a few other selected works by Turner, including ''[[Rain, Steam and Speed – The Great Western Railway|Rain, Steam and Speed]]'' and ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'' remain as examples of English painting at the National Gallery.

In [[sewing]] and [[handicraft|crafts]] an '''embellishment''' is anything that adds design interest to the piece.

==A few common examples of embellishment in sewing and craft==
* [[applique|appliqué]] can be made by sewing machine of decorative techniques and or 
* [[embroidery]], done either by machine or by hand
* [[piping (sewing)|piping]] made from either [[self-fabric]], [[contrast fabric]], or a simply a cord.
* [[trim (sewing)]]
* [[lace]], either pre-made or [[tatting|home-made]]
* [[Fringe (trim)]]
* [[bead]]s
* [[batik]]

Items that normally serve a function may also be used as embellishment. For example:
* [[button]]s can be placed anywhere on the piece
* [[zipper]]s can be unzipped and be used as piping, or simply stitched on
* [[buckle]]s can be placed anywhere on the piece
* [[grommet]]s can be placed anywhere even when there is no cord is looped through them
* [[sequin]]s can be placed anywhere

An '''epiphany''' (from the [[ancient Greek]] ἐπιφάνεια, ''epiphaneia'', "manifestation, striking appearance") is an experience of a sudden and striking realization. Generally the term is used to describe scientific breakthrough, religious or philosophical discoveries, but it can apply in any situation in which an enlightening realization allows a problem or situation to be understood from a new and deeper perspective. Epiphanies are studied by [[psychologist]]s&lt;ref name="Jarvis1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald2008"/&gt; and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of [[innovation]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeemingMadden2009"/&gt;

Epiphanies are relatively rare occurrences and generally follow a process of significant thought about a problem. Often they are triggered by a new and key piece of information, but importantly, a depth of prior knowledge is required to allow the leap of understanding.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include [[Archimedes]]'s discovery of a method to determine the density of an object ("[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!") and [[Isaac Newton]]'s realization that a falling apple and the orbiting moon are both pulled by the same force.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;

==History==
The word epiphany originally referred to insight through the [[divine]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platt, V. J. (2011) ''Facing the Gods. Epiphany and Representation in Graeco-Roman Art, Literature and Religion''. Cambridge University Press.'' ''&lt;/ref&gt; Today, this concept is more often used without such connotations, but a popular implication remains that the epiphany is [[supernatural]], as the discovery seems to come suddenly from the outside.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;

The word's secular usage may owe much of its popularity to Irish novelist [[James Joyce]]. The Joycean epiphany has been defined as "a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind — the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it."&lt;ref&gt;Morris Beja, ''Epiphany in the Modern Novel.'' Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1971. P. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The author used epiphany as a literary device within each entry of his short story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914); his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves and/or their social conditions. Joyce had first expounded on epiphany's meaning in the fragment ''[[Stephen Hero]],'' although this was only published posthumously in 1944. For the philosopher [[Emmanuel Lévinas]], epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another's face (see [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]]).
[[Image:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flammarion engraving]]. From "L'atmosphère", book of 1888]]
In traditional and pre-modern cultures, [[initiation]] rites and [[western esotericism|mystery religion]]s have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The [[Greek drama]]tists and [[Greek poetry|poets]] would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of ''[[catharsis]]'' or ''[[kenosis]]'', respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of [[William Burroughs]]' ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, "a frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of the fork." Both the [[Dadaist]] [[Marcel Duchamp]] and the [[Pop Art]]ist [[Andy Warhol]] would invert expectations by presenting commonplace objects or graphics as works of [[fine art]] (for example a [[Fountain (Duchamp)|urinal as a fountain]]), simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of "what art is" or is not.

==Process==
Epiphanies can come in many different forms, and are often generated by a complex combination of experience, memory, knowledge, predisposition and context. A contemporary example of an epiphany in education might involve the process by which a student arrives at some form of new insight or clarifying thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kounios|first1=John|last2=Beeman|first2=Mark|title=The Aha! Moment: The Cognitive Neuroscience of Insight|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=210–216|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01638.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.521.6014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this popular image, epiphany is the result of significant work on the part of the discoverer, and is only the satisfying result of a long process.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt; The surprising and fulfilling feeling of epiphany is so surprising because one cannot predict when one's labor will bear fruit, and our subconscious can play a significant part in delivering the solution; and is fulfilling because it is a reward for a long period of effort.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt;

==Myth==
A common myth predicts that most, if not all, innovations occur through epiphanies.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt; Not all innovations occur through epiphanies; Scott Berkun notes that "the most useful way to think of an epiphany is as an occasional bonus of working on tough problems".&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Most innovations occur without epiphany, and epiphanies often contribute little towards finding the next one.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Although epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, crowning a process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension are commonly responsible for leaps in technology and the sciences.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include Archimedes' realization of how to estimate the volume of a given mass, which inspired him to shout "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!" ("I have found it!").&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt; The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which were worked out in detail over the following years. For example, allegedly [[Albert Einstein]] was struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein's life occurred in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations. While taking a streetcar home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in [[Bern]] and realized that if the car sped up close to the speed of light, he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later remarked, "a storm broke loose in my mind," which would allow him to understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two years later in 1907 which he called "the happiest thought of my life" when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of falling, and the weightlessness of space - a thought which allowed him to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a curvature in spacetime. A similar flash of [[holistic]] understanding in a prepared mind was said to give [[Charles Darwin]] his "hunch" (about [[natural selection]]), and Darwin later stated that he always remembered the spot in the road where his carriage was when the epiphany struck. Another famous epiphany myth is associated with Isaac Newton's apple story,&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt; and yet another with Nikola Tesla's discovery of a workable alternating current induction motor. Though such epiphanies might have occurred, they were almost certainly the result of long and intensive periods of study those individuals had undertaken, rather than an out-of-the-blue flash of inspiration about an issue they had not thought about previously.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Another myth is that epiphany is simply another word for (usually spiritual) [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]. Actually, realism and psychology make epiphany a different mode as distinguished from vision, even though both vision and epiphany are often triggered by (sometimes seemingly) irrelevant incidents or objects.&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-11"/&gt;

==In religion==
{{Further information|Epiphany (holiday)|theophany|hierophany}}
In Christianity, the Epiphany refers to a realization that Christ is the Son of God. Western churches generally celebrate the [[Visit of the Magi]] as the [[revelation]] of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the infant Christ, and commemorate the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]] on January 6. Traditionally, Eastern churches, following the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, have celebrated Epiphany (or [[Theophany]]) in conjunction with Christ's baptism by [[John the Baptist]] and celebrated it on January 19; however, other Eastern churches have adopted the Western Calendar and celebrate it on January 6.&lt;ref name="The Season of Epiphany"/&gt; Some Protestant churches often celebrate Epiphany as a season, extending from the last day of Christmas until either [[Ash Wednesday]], or the Feast of the Presentation on February 2.

In more general terms, the phrase "religious epiphany" is used when a person realizes their faith, or when they are convinced that an event or happening was really caused by a deity or being of their faith. In Hinduism, for example, epiphany might refer to [[Arjuna]]'s realization that [[Krishna]] (incarnation of God serving as his charioteer in the "[[Bhagavad Gita]]") is indeed representing the Universe. The Hindu term for epiphany would be [[bodhodaya]], from Sanskrit [[bodha]] 'wisdom' and udaya 'rising'. Or in Buddhism, the term might refer to the Buddha obtaining enlightenment under the [[bodhi]] tree, finally realizing the nature of the universe, and thus attaining [[Nirvana]]. The Zen term ''[[kensho]]'' also describes this moment, referring to the feeling attendant on realizing the answer to a ''[[koan]]''.

'''Grusomhetens Teater''' (Norwegian: Theatre of Cruelty) is a Norwegian theatre company based in [[Oslo]]'s [[Hausmania]] cultural centre. The company produced its first performance in collaboration with [[Trøndelag Teater]] in 1989, and was established as an independent group in 1992.&lt;ref name="IE"&gt;''[[The Indian Express]]'' (7 December 2010). [http://www.indianexpress.com/news/-wind-beneath-my-wings-/721260/0 "Wind beneath my wings"]. Retrieved 15 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The theater's manager and director is [[Lars Øyno]]. In 2002 the theater company received support from the [[Norwegian Arts Council]] to launch its own performing space in Hausmania.

Grusomhetens Teater is inspired by [[Antonin Artaud]]'s ideas of a double and physical theater, where the body's musical breathing and expressions are actions meant to generate deconstruction and [[reteatralization]].

== Performances ==
Since its foundation and until today the theater produced 22 performances. One of the theater's greatest successes has been [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s unfinished opera libretto [[The Mountain Bird]]. In 2009 the theater made history premiering this unused and forgotten Ibsen play, exactly 150 years after the unfinished manuscript was written and set aside.&lt;ref&gt;Bryne, Silje (30 March 2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="87309">The '''history of advertising''' can be traced to ancient civilizations. It became a major force in [[capitalist]] economies in the mid-19th century, based primarily on [[newspaper]]s and magazines. In the 20th century, [[advertising]] grew rapidly with new technologies such as [[direct mail]], [[radio]], [[television]], the internet and mobile devices.

[[File:Advertising as a percent of Gross Domestice Product in the United States.svg|thumb|Advertising as a percent of Gross Domestic Product in the United States, 1919 to 2007 per Douglas Galbi.]]

Between 1919 and 2007 advertising averaged 2.2 percent of [[Gross Domestic Product]] in the United States.

==Pre-modern history==

[[File:Bronze printing plate for an advertisement.jpg|thumb|Bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the Liu family needle shop at [[Jinan]], [[Song dynasty]] China. It is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.]]
Egyptians used [[papyrus]] to make sales messages and wall posters. [[Advertising campaign|Commercial messages]] and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] and  [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. [[Lost and found]] advertising on papyrus was common in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian [[rock art]] paintings that date back to 4000 BC.&lt;ref name= Bhatia&gt;Bhatia (2000). ''Advertising in Rural India: Language, Marketing Communication, and Consumerism'', 62+68&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the [[Classic of Poetry]] (11th to 7th centuries BC) of bamboo flutes played to sell candy. Advertisement usually takes in the form of calligraphic signboards and inked papers. A copper printing plate dated back to the [[Song dynasty]] used to print posters in the form of a square sheet of paper with a rabbit logo with "[[Jinan]] Liu's Fine Needle Shop" and "We buy high quality steel rods and make fine quality needles, to be ready for use at home in no time" written above and below.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., "Pulling the White Rabbit Out of the Hat: Consuming Brands in Imperial China," ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' [European Conference Proceedings] Vol. 8, 2008; Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., "A Brief History of Branding in China," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Liu, ''Chinese Business: Landscapes and Strategies'' (2013), p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edo period advertising in Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Edo period]] LEL flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called ''Kinseitan'']]

In Europe, as the towns and cities of the [[Middle Ages]] began to grow, and the general populace was unable to read, instead of signs that read "cobbler", "miller", "tailor", or "blacksmith" would use an image associated with their trade such as a boot, a suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horse shoe, a candle or even a bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers ([[town crier]]s) to announce their whereabouts for the convenience of the customers. The first compilation of such advertisements was gathered in ''Les Crieries de Paris'' ([[Street cries]] of Paris), a thirteenth-century poem by Guillaume de la Villeneuve.&lt;ref&gt;Aimeé Boutin, "Sound Memory: Paris Street Cries in Balzac's Pere Goriot," ''French Forum,'' Volume 30, Number 2, Spring 2005, pp. 67–78, DOI:10.1353/frf.2005.0029&lt;/ref&gt; 

Three major forms of advertisement existed during the pre-printing period (before the 15th-century); those forms were trademarks (moon, stars etc.), town criers and [[signage|sign boards]]:

* '''Trademarks''': The practice of attaching seals or marks to products was widespread in antiquity. Around 4,000 years ago, producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;Wengrow, D., "Prehistories of Commodity Branding," ''Current Anthropology,''Vol. 49, No. 1, 2008, pp. 7-34&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest use of maker's marks, dating to about 1,300 BCE, have been found in India.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, M. and Mufti, S.U., ''The Hot History &amp; Cold Future of Brands'', ''Journal of Managerial Sciences'', vol. 1, no. 1, 2007, pp 75–87, http://qurtuba.edu.pk/jms/default_files/JMS/1_1/5_saif_ullah.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; By the medieval period, [[hallmark]]s were applied to high value goods such as precious metals, and assayers were appointed by governments to administer the system and ensure product quality.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, E.C., ''Byzantine Silver Stamps'', [Dumbarton Oaks Studies] Vol. 7, Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1961, pp 23–35&lt;/ref&gt; 

* '''Town criers''': In ancient towns and cities, where the majority of citizens were illiterate, town-criers were appointed to call out official announcements and general news. Before long, private individuals began to employ public criers to act as an auctioneer.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, S., ''A History of Advertising from the Earliest Times'', Chatto and, Windus, 1875, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, itinerant [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]] developed a system of [[street cries]] to promote their goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, V., "The Streets for the People: London's Street Markets 1850–1939, ''Urban History'', June, 2015, pp. 1–21,&lt;/ref&gt; These street cries provided an essential public service before the advent of mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Garrioch, D., "Sounds of the City: the soundscape of early modern European towns," ''Urban History,'' 2003, Vol. 30, no. 1, pp 5&amp;ndash;25, [http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0963926803001019 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Saracens Head pub sign.jpg|thumb|left|Saracens Head pub sign, Bath, England]]
*'''Sign-boards''':  The use of commercial signage has a very ancient history. Retail signage and promotional signs appear to have developed independently in the East and the West. In antiquity, the ancient Egyptians, Romans and Greeks were known to use signage for shop fronts as well as to announce public events such as market days.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, F.K.,  "The Ancient History of Advertising: Insights and Implications for Practitioners: What Today's Advertisers and Marketers Can Learn from Their Predecessors," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' vol. 57 no. 3, pp 239-244 DOI: 10.2501/JAR-2017-033&lt;/ref&gt; China also exhibited a rich history of early retail signage systems.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, K. and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding," ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008. pp. 419–32.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Medieval Britain and France and much of Europe, innkeepers were compelled to erect a sign-board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manton|first=Dafydd|title=Ale and Arty in Sheffield: The Disappearing Art of Pub Signs|year=2008|publisher=Arc Publishing and Print|location=Sheffield, England|isbn=978-1906722005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth.

==16th-18th centuries==

Modern advertising began to take shape with the advent of newspapers and magazines in the 16th and 17th centuries. The very first weekly [[gazette]]s appeared in Venice in the early 16th-century. From there, the concept of a weekly publication spread to Italy, Germany and Holland.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, J., "The 'Avvisi' of Venice: Toward an Archaeology of Media Forms." ''Journalism History'' 14#2, 1987, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the first weeklies appeared in the 1620s, and its first daily newspaper was the ''[[The Daily Courant]]'' published from 1702 to 1735.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B., ''From Grub Street to Fleet Street: An Illustrated History of English Newspapers to 1899'' (Ashgate, 2004; Hunt, M., "Hawkers, Bawlers, and Mercuries: Women and the London Press in the Early Enlightenment", ''Women &amp; History'', Vol. 3, no. 9, 1984 pp 41-68; Maxted, U., 'Mallet, Elizabeth (fl. 1672–1706)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/66880, accessed 27 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Almost from the outset, newspapers carried advertising to defray the cost of printing and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Barrès-Baker, M.C., ''An Introduction to the Early History of Newspaper Advertising'', [Brent Museum and Archive Occasional Publications, No. 2], Brent Heritage Services,   2006, &lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commercial advertisements were for books and quack medicines, but by the 1650s, the variety of products being advertised had increased markedly.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, E.E., ''The Shocking History of Advertising'', New York, Ballantine Books, 1980, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in printing allowed retailers and manufacturers to print [[Flyer (pamphlet)|handbills]] and [[trade card]]s. For example, Jonathon Holder, a London haberdasher in the 1670s, gave every customer a printed list of his stock with the prices affixed. At the time, Holder's innovation was seen as a "dangerous practice" and an unnecessary expense for retailers.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, S., ''A History of Advertising from the Earliest Times'', Chatto and, Windus, 1875, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest trade cards were not cards at all, instead they were printed on paper and did not include illustrations. By the 18th century, however, they were printed on the more substantial card and typically bore the tradesmen's name and address, and before street numbering was in common use, often included a long-winded set of directions on how to locate the store or premises. With the advent of commercial engraving and lithography, illustrations became a standard feature of even the most humble trade card. Eventually trade cards evolved into business cards, which are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;"Trade Cards," in ''The Encyclopedia of Ephemera: A Guide to the Fragmentary Documents of Everyday Life for the Collector, Curator, and Historian,'' Maurice Rickards (ed), Psychology Press, 2000, pp 334-335, pp 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
In June 1836, [[Émile de Girardin]] editor of the Paris newspaper ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'' was the first to rely on paid advertising to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its profitability. His formula was soon copied by all titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clyde Thogmartin|title=The National Daily Press of France|year=1998|isbn=978-1-883479-20-6|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the [[printing press]]; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after as modern people rejected traditional cures. However, [[false advertising]] and "[[Quackery]]" became common. British newspapers in the 1850s and 1860s appealed to the increasingly affluent middle-class that sought out a variety of new products. The advertisements announced new health remedies as well as fresh foods and beverages. The latest London fashions were featured in the regional press. The availability of repeated advertising permitted manufacturers to develop nationally known brand names that had a much stronger appeal than generic products.&lt;ref&gt;Beverley Ann Tudor, "Retail Trade Advertising in the 'Leicester Journal' and the 'Leicester Chronicle' 1855-71." ''European Journal of Marketing'' 20#9 (1986) pp: 41-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A leadership position in British advertising was held by [[Cope Bros &amp; Co]] tobacco company, founded in Liverpool in 1848 by Thomas and George Cope. Smoking, of course, had been common for centuries, but the innovations consisted in brand names, heavy advertising, and market segmentation according to class. An innovative appeal was to health consciousness; the ads directed at the middle-class men promised that  "smoke not only checks disease but preserves the lungs."   A rugged heavy taste was pitched to working men, soldiers and sailors,  while "delicately fragrant" was part of the appeal to the upper-class. The packaging was attractive, posters were omnipresent to show that smoking was a normal part of English life;  lobbying was used to undercut the anti-tobacco lobby.&lt;ref&gt;A. V. Seaton,"Cope's and the Promotion of Tobacco in Victorian England." ''European Journal of Marketing''  (1986) 20#9 pp: 5-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barratt]] was hailed as "the father of modern advertising".&lt;ref&gt;He was first described as such in T F G Coates, 'Mr Thomas J Barratt, "The father of modern advertising"', Modern Business, September 1908, pp. 107–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "mat"&gt;Matt Haig, ''Brand failures: the truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time'', Kogan Page Publishers, 2005, pp. 219, 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "nick"&gt;Nicholas Mirzoeff, ''The visual culture reader'', Routledge, 2002, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; Working for the [[Pears Soap]] company, Barratt created an effective advertising campaign for the company products, which involved the use of targeted slogans, images and phrases. One of his slogans, "Good morning. Have you used Pears' soap?" was famous in its day and into the 20th century.&lt;ref name = "obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/04/27/100310554.pdf |title=Obituary, Thomas J. Barratt Dead: Chairman of the Firm of A. &amp; F.

An advertising tactic that he used was to associate the Pears brand with high culture and quality. Most famously, he used the painting ''[[Bubbles (painting)|Bubbles]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]] as an advertisement by adding a bar of Pears soap into the foreground. Barratt continued this theme with a series of adverts of well groomed middle-class children, associating Pears with domestic comfort and aspirations of high society.

Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that "tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different – it hits the present taste."&lt;ref name = "mat"/&gt;

====United States====
In the United States around 1840, Volney B. Palmer set up the first [[advertising agency]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad – the copy, layout, and artwork – was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed in the late 19th century when the advertising agency of [[N.W. Ayer &amp; Son]] was founded in New York. It planned, created, and executed complete advertising campaigns for its customers. It created a number of memorable slogans for firms such as [[De Beers]], [[AT&amp;T]] and the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hower, ''The History of an Advertising Agency: N. W. Ayer &amp; Son 1869-1949'' (1949) p 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J. Walter Thompson Advertisement 1903.JPG|thumb|left|275px|J. Walter Thompson Co. promotes high-powered advertisement, 1903]]

By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.
&lt;ref name="eskilson-pg58"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Graphic Design: A New History |last=Eskilson |first=Stephen J. |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in newspapers.  [[N. W. Ayer &amp; Son]] was the first full-service agency to assume responsibility for advertising content. N.W. Ayer opened in 1869, and was located in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="eskilson-pg58"/&gt;

The amount of space available in newspapers grew rapidly. The ''Boston Transcript'' published in 19,000 "agate lines" Of advertising in 1860,  87,000 in 1900, and 237,000 in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Starch, ''Advertising Principles'' (1927)  p 485&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, 104 companies spent over $50,000 each on national advertising; most sold patent medicines, which faded away after the federal food and drug legislation of the early 20th century. Seven innovators had emerged in the big time: [[Quaker Oats]], Armour meat, Cudahy meat, American Tobacco Company, P. Lorillard tobacco, Remington Typewriters, and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] soap.  By 1914, two thirds of the top advertisers came from just five industries: 14 food producers, 13 in automobiles and tires,  nine in soap and cosmetics, and four in tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Pope, ''The making of modern advertising'' (1983) pp 42-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agencies were forever breaking up and reforming, especially when one executive would split taking with him a major client and his team of [[copywriter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hower, ''The History of an Advertising Agency '' (1949) pp 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In the late 19th century in France, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] extended the services of his news agency, [[Havas]] to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize.

== Since 1900:  Global==
Advertising in the developing world was dominated by agencies in the imperial powers, especially from London and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Ciochetto, ''Globalisation and Advertising in Emerging Economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China'' (2013) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  [[J. Walter Thompson]] became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899.  It expanded across the globe, becoming one of the first American agencies in Egypt, South Africa and Asia.  Much of the pressure to expand came from General Motors, which wanted to export its automobiles worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Spring,  "The Globalization of American Advertising and Brand Management: A Brief History of the J. Walter Thompson Company, Proctor and Gamble, and US Foreign Policy." ''Global Studies Journal'' (2013). 5#4&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford turned to N.W. Ayer, which began its expansion in Europe and Latin America in the 1930s.  The typical policy was to put an American manager in charge, and hire a staff drawn from locals who had a better understanding of the language and the culture.  In 1941-42, however, Ayer closed its foreign offices and decided to concentrate on the American market.&lt;ref&gt;Hower, 'The History of an advertising agency: N.W. Ayer &amp; Son at work, 1869-1949." (1949) pp 140-46, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, spending on advertising reached $143 billion in the United States and $467 billion worldwide.&lt;ref name="WPP Group Forecasts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/2011/dec/05/groupm-forecasts-global-ad-spending-to/ |title=GroupM forecasts 2012 global ad spending to increase 6.4% |publisher=WPP |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, internationally, the largest ("big four") advertising conglomerates are [[Interpublic]], [[Omnicom]], [[Publicis]], and [[WPP Group|WPP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parekh |first=Rupal |url=http://adage.com/article/agency-news/big-holding-firms-adland-anymore-big/236001/ |title=Not the 'Big Four' Holding Firms in Adland Anymore – Now It's the Big Five &amp;#124; Agency News – Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=July 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 1900: United States and Canada==

Advertising increased dramatically in the United States after 1870 as industrialization expanded the supply of manufactured products to a very large market. In order to profit from this higher rate of production, industry needed to recruit workers as consumers of factory products. It did so through the invention of mass marketing designed to influence the population's economic behavior on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), p. 33. "As Ford's massive assembly line utilized 'extensive single-purpose machinery' to produce automobiles inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods, the costly machinery of advertising that Coolidge had described set out to produce consumers, likewise inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods."&lt;/ref&gt; Total advertising volume in the United States grew from about $200 million in 1880 to nearly $3 billion in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Pope|title=The making of modern advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bElPAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Basic Books|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s and 1920s, many ad men believed that human instincts could be targeted and harnessed – "[[sublimation (psychology)|sublimated]]" into the desire to purchase commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Ewen|title=Captains Of Consciousness: Advertising and the Social Roots of the Consumer Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1R5S1DSC9kC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2008|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Bernays]], a nephew of [[Sigmund Freud]], promoted the approach making him [[Tobacco advertising|a pioneer of modern cigarette advertising.]]  Glantz argues, "it was really the tobacco industry, from the beginning, that was at the forefront of the development of modern, innovative, advertising techniques."&lt;ref name="GlantzModernAds"&gt;Stanton Glantz in ''[[Mad Men]] Season 3 Extra – Clearing the Air – The History of Cigarette Advertising'', part 1, min 3:38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, under [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]], the American government promoted advertising. Hoover himself delivered an address to the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World in 1925 called 'Advertising Is a Vital Force in Our National Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1929, the head of the U.S. [[Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce]], Julius Klein, stated "Advertising is the key to world prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=367|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of the "unparalleled" collaboration between business and government in the 1920s, according to a 1933 European economic journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising was a vehicle for [[cultural assimilation]], encouraging immigrants to exchange their traditional habits and tastes in favor of a modern American lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ewen|title=Captains Of Consciousness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1R5S1DSC9kC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2008|pages=56–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important tool for influencing immigrant workers was the [[American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers]] (AAFLN). The AAFLN was primarily an advertising agency but also gained heavily centralized control over much of the immigrant press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeanne D. Petit|title=The Men and Women We Want: Gender, Race, and the Progressive Era Literacy Test Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTubHqECr84C&amp;pg=PA66|year=2010|publisher=U of Rochester Press|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian media market===
In 1900, most Canadian newspapers were local affairs, designed primarily to inform local partisans about the provincial and national political scene. The publishers depended on loyal partisan subscribers, as well as  contracts for public printing  controlled by the political parties. With the rise of national advertising agencies after 1900, a major transformation was underway. The advertisers wanted them to reach the maximum possible circulation, regardless of partisanship. The result was a series of consolidations yielding much larger, largely nonpartisan newspapers, which depended more heavily on advertising revenue than on subscriptions from loyal party members. By 1900, three-fourths of the revenue of Toronto newspapers came from advertising. About two thirds of the newspapers' editorial pages loyally supported either the Conservative or the Liberal party, while the remainder were more independent. Across the board, the news pages increasingly featured more objectivity and bipartisanship, and the publishers were mostly focused on advertising revenues that were proportionate to overall circulation. A newspaper that appealed only to one party cut its potential audience in half. Simultaneously, the rapid growth of industry in Ontario and Quebec, coupled with the rapid settlement of the prairies, produced a large more affluent newspaper-reading population. The result was a golden age for Canadian newspapers peaking about 1911.  Many papers failed during the war era. Advertising agencies in 1915 gained a major advantage with the arrival of the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations]], which for the first-time provided reliable data on circulation, as opposed to the partisan boasting and exaggeration that had been the norm. the agencies now had a stronger hand in bargaining for lower advertising rates. The 1920s became a time of consolidation, budget-cutting and dropping of traditional party affiliation. By 1930 only 24% of Canada's dailies were partisan, 17% were "independent" partisan, and the majority, 50%, had become fully independent.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Johnston, "Partisan Politics, Market Research, and Media Buying in Canada, 1920," '' Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly'' (2006) 83#4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and psychology===
{{main article|Sex in advertising}}
[[File:1916-skin-touch-soap-ad.jpg|thumb|300px|1916 ''Ladies' Home Journal'' version of the famous ad]]

At the turn of the 20th century, there were few career choices for women in business; however, advertising was one of the few. Since women were responsible for most of the purchasing done in their household, advertisers and agencies recognized the value of women's insight during the creative process. [[Helen Lansdowne Resor]]  at J. Walter Thompson Agency, was one of the pioneers.

In 1911, the [[Woodbury Soap Company]] became the first to use images of sexual contact to sell a product. Their ad slogan, created by Helen Lansdowne, claimed that women who used the soap would have "Skin You Love To Touch". Her copy promised the soap would increase the beauty of one's skin; it offered a color print and a week's supply of the soap for 10 cents. The slogan became so popular that Woodbury used it until the 1940s. Albert Lasker said the ad's use of sex appeal made it one of three great landmarks in advertising history. It was ranked 31st on ''Advertising Age's'' list of the top 100 campaigns of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/resor-helen-lansdowne-1886-1964/98850/ "Resor, Helen Lansdowne (1886-1964)" in ''Advertising Age'' Sept 15, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nudity===
In 1936, Woodbury was one of the first companies to use nudity in its advertisements. The ad, known as "The Sun Bath", was photographed by [[Edward Steichen]] and showed a nude woman lying on stairs on her side with her back to the camera. The text advertised that Woodbury Soap was now enriched with "filter sunshine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherrow|first=Victoria |title=For Appearance' Sake: The Historical Encyclopedia of Good Looks, Beauty, and Grooming|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=1-573-56204-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many celebrities appeared in advertisements for Woodbury Soap.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Streitmatter, ''Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In international perspective, a 2008 comparison of nudity in advertising in Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States reveals that China and the United States have the most demure ads, while Germany and Thailand exposed more of the female body. There is little variation in male undress.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle R. Nelson and Hye-Jin Paek, "Nudity of female and male models in primetime TV advertising across seven countries," ''International Journal of Advertising'' (2008) 27#5 pp 715-744&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
In the early 20th century, psychologists Walter D. Scott and [[John B. Watson]] contributed applied psychological theory to the field of advertising. Scott said, "Man has been called the reasoning animal but he could with greater truthfulness be called the creature of suggestion. He is reasonable, but he is to a greater extent suggestible".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L.T., &amp; Baker, D.B. 2004. Industrial-organizational psychology: The new psychology and the business of advertising. ''From Séance to Science: A History of the Profession of Psychology in America''. 118-121. California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated this through his advertising technique of a direct command to the consumer. The former chair at [[Johns Hopkins University]], John B. Watson was a highly recognized psychologist in the 1920s. After leaving the field of academia he turned his attention towards advertising where he implemented the concepts of [[behaviorism]] into advertising. This focused on appealing to the basic emotions of the consumer: love, hate, and fear. This type of advertising proved to be extremely effective as it suited the changing social context which led to heavy influence of future advertising strategy and cemented the place of psychology in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;T. Jackson Lears,  "From salvation to self-realization: Advertising and the therapeutic roots of the consumer culture, 1880-1930."

===Albert Lasker:  Salesmanship in print===
{{main article|Albert Lasker}}
Chicago, along with New York, was the center of the nation's advertising industry. Albert Lasker, known as the "father of modern advertising," made Chicago his base 1898–1942. As head of the [[Draftfcb|Lord and Thomas agency]], Lasker devised a copywriting technique that appealed directly to the psychology of the consumer. Women seldom smoked cigarettes; he told them if they smoked [[Lucky Strikes]] they could stay slender. Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for [[Palmolive (soap)|Palmolive]] soap, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste, [[Kotex]] products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur W. Schultz, "Albert Lasker's Advertising Revolution," ''Chicago History,'' Nov 2002, Vol. 31#2 pp. 36–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasker had an inquiring mind about what advertising was and how it worked. Lasker believed that advertising consisted of news and information was news, He changed his mind when a colleague Johnny Kennedy told him, "News is a technique of presentation, but advertising is a very simple thing. I can give it to you in three words, it is 'salesmanship in print'".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Cruikshank &amp; Arthur W. Schultz, ''The Man Who Sold America,'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;  Lasker and Kennedy used this concept with [[Whirlpool Corporation|the 1900 Washer Co.]] (later Whirlpool). Their campaign was so successful that, within four months of running the first ad, they attracted additional clients and their "advertising spend" went from $15,000 a year to $30,000 a month. Within six months, their firm was one of the three or four largest advertisers in the nation.

In 1908 Lasker recruited [[Claude C. Hopkins]] to the firm, specifically to work on the Van Camp Packaging Company ([[Van Camp's]]) account. The relationship lasted for 17 years. Lasker helped create America's infatuation with orange juice. Lord &amp; Thomas acquired the [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated]] account in 1908, when the citrus industry was in a slump. Lasker created campaigns that not only encouraged consumers to eat oranges, but also to drink orange juice.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunther, ''Taken at the Flood'' (1960) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Lasker's pioneering contributions was the introduction into public schools of classes that explained to young girls about puberty and [[menstruation]] (done to promote [[Kotex]] [[tampons]]). He is also credited as the creator of the [[soap opera]] genre, and using radio and television as media driven by advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heinrich|first1=Thomas|last2=Batchelor|first2=Bob|title=Kotex, Kleenex, Huggies: Kimberly-Clark and the Consumer Revolution in American Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlPNB5HpRDIC&amp;pg=PA83|year=2004|publisher=Ohio State University Press|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cruikshank|first1=Jeffrey L.|last2=Schultz|first2=Arthur|title=The Man Who Sold America: The Amazing (but True!)

Morello, ''Selling the President, 1920: Albert D. Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the radio from the 1920s===
{{main article|History of broadcasting}}
[[File:1930.05.06 Advertisement for Radio Broadcast With Lisa Roma.gif|thumb|Advertisement for a live radio broadcast, sponsored by a milk company and published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on May 6, 1930]]

In the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio equipment manufacturers and retailers who offered programs in order to sell more radios to consumers. Madison Avenue early on recognized the importance of radio as a new advertising medium. Advertising provided the major funding for most stations. United States, never had a licensing fee for set users.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Smulyan]], ''Selling radio: The commercialization of American broadcasting, 1920-1934'' (Smithsonian Inst Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Britain Use the mandatory fee on set owners to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], Which to this day operates without commercials or advertising.  However, the government permitted
commercial television in 1954 and commercial radio in 1972.

[[Public service advertising]], [[non-commercial advertising]], public interest advertising, [[cause marketing]], and [[social marketing]] are different terms for (or aspects of) the use of sophisticated advertising and marketing communications techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-commercial, public interest issues and initiatives.

In the United States, the granting of television and radio licenses by the FCC is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of [[public service ad]]vertising. To meet these requirements, many broadcast stations in America air the bulk of their required public service announcements during the late night or early morning when the smallest percentage of viewers are watching, leaving more day and prime time commercial slots available for high-paying advertisers.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Public service advertising in the United States reached its height during the world wars.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Creel]], ''How we advertised America: The first telling of the amazing story of the Committee on Public Information that carried the gospel of Americanism to every corner of the globe'' (1920).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Hollihan, "Propagandizing in the interest of war: A rhetorical study of the committee on public information." ''Southern Journal of Communication'' 49#3 (1984): 241-257.&lt;/ref&gt; During WWII President Roosevelt commissioned the creation of The War Advertising Council (now known as the [[Ad Council]]) which is the United States' largest developer of PSA campaigns on behalf of government agencies and non-profit organizations, including the longest-running public service campaign, [[Smokey Bear]].&lt;ref&gt;Dannagal Goldthwaite Young, "Sacrifice, consumption, and the [[American way]] of life: Advertising and domestic propaganda during World War II." ''The Communication Review'' 8#1 (2005) pp: 27-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Griffith, "The Selling of America: The Advertising Council and American Politics, 1942–1960." ''Business History Review'' 57#3 (1983): 388-412 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3114050 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s and World War II===
Advertising came under heavy pressure in the 1930s. The [[Great Depression]] forced businesses to drastically cut back on their advertising spending. Layoffs and reductions were common at all agencies. The [[New Deal]] furthermore aggressively promoted [[consumerism]], and minimized the value or need of advertising.  Historian Jackson Lears argues that "By the late 1930s, though, corporate advertisers had begun a successful counterattack against their critics." They rehabilitated the concept of consumer sovereignty by inventing scientific public opinion polls, and making it the centerpiece of their own [[market research]], as well has the key to understanding politics. [[George Gallup]], the vice president of [[Young and Rubicam]], and numerous other advertising experts, led the way.  Moving into the 1940s, the industry played a leading role in the ideological mobilization of the American people for fighting the Nazis and Japanese in World War II. As part of that effort, they redefined the "American Way of Life" in terms of a commitment to free enterprise. "Advertisers," Lears concludes, "played a crucial hegemonic role in creating the consumer culture that dominated post-World War II American society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson Lears|title=Fables Of Abundance: A Cultural History Of Advertising In America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RgoXBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean M. Converse," ''Survey Research in the United States: Roots and Emergence 1960'' (1987) pp: 114-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar era===
In the prosperous postwar era, millions of Americans moved into new housing, especially in the rapidly growing suburbs. They spent heavily on housing, appliances, furniture, clothing and automobiles. The coming of television in the 1950s dramatically enlarged the arena for advertising. With most families having automobiles, and more leisure time, travel holidays became much more common, and the motel and [[tourism]] industries eagerly supported large-scale advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Richard K. Popp, ''The Holiday Makers: Magazines, Advertising and Mass Tourism in Postwar America'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the public service arena, the Ad Council aggressively promoted [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]] as a [[Cold War]] strategy, with campaigns such as the Freedom Train, the Crusade for Freedom, Religion in American Life, Adams for Piece, and Peoples Capitalism.  The new Brand Names Foundation sponsored conferences, local campaigns, and educational programs to promote brand loyalty, as well as free enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Spring, ''Advertising in the Age of Persuasion: Building Brand America, 1941-1961'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Hidden Persuaders'' (1957) popular writer [[Vance Packard]] exposes the use of consumer [[motivational research]] and other psychological techniques, including depth psychology and [[subliminal message|subliminal]] tactics. They had been used to manipulate expectations and induce desire for products since the 1920s, but the popular audience was caught by surprise. He identified eight "compelling needs" that advertisers promise products will fulfill. According to Packard these needs are so strong that people are compelled to buy products to satisfy them. The book questions the [[morality]] of using these techniques.&lt;ref name=DiRenzo&gt;Gordon Di Renzo (1958) ''The American Catholic Sociological Review'', Vol. 19, No. 4 (Dec., 1958) (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial themes====
Before the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, black people were largely missing from mainstream white advertising. Those who did appear typically followed the long-standing "hierarchy of skin color" whereby those with lighter skin tones were seen as being more socially and culturally acceptable than dark-skinned black people.&lt;ref&gt;Julia M.

Most national corporations before the 1960s ignored the black market, and paid little attention to working with black merchants or hiring blacks for responsible positions. [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola]] was a major exception, as the number two brand fought for parity with [[Coca-Cola]].  The upstart soda brand hired black promoters who penetrated into black markets across the South and the urban North. Journalist Stephanie Capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s: 
:The team members had a grueling schedule, working seven days a week, morning and night, for weeks on end. They visited bottlers, churches, "ladies groups," schools, college campuses, YMCAs, community centers, insurance conventions, teacher and doctor conferences, and various civic organizations. They got famous jazzmen such as Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton to give shout-outs for Pepsi from the stage. No group was too small or too large to target for a promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Capparell, "How Pepsi Opened Door to Diversity." ''CHANGE'' 63 (2007): 1-26 [http://www.comlabgames.com/45-870N/instructor/01_day/How_Pepsi_Opened_Door_to_Diversity.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:New-York tribune., November 07, 1909, Page 20, Image 44 Aunt Jemima.jpg|right|thumb|Quaker Oats 1909 newspaper ad directed at white consumers with stereotypical images and dolls.]]

Pepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted  one-dimensional [[Aunt Jemima]]s and [[Uncle Ben's|Uncle Bens]] whose role was to draw a smile from white customers. Instead it portrayed black customers as self-confident [[middle-class]] citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks. They were economical too, as Pepsi bottles were twice the size.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Capparell, ''The Real Pepsi Challenge: The Inspirational Story of Breaking the Color Barrier in American Business'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, more than a few token blacks were hired at advertising agencies, and the sensitivity to the problem increased.  The leading black  magazines [[Essence (magazine)|''Essence'']] and [[Jet (magazine)|''Jet'']] routinely deplored racism in mainstream media, especially in the negative depictions of black men and women. However ''Essence'' and ''Jet'' in the 21st century themselves ran about a dozen ads a year, especially for skin lighteners, that were pervaded with "racism and White supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Hazell and Juanne Clarke, "Race and Gender in the Media: A Content Analysis of Advertisements in Two Mainstream Black Magazines" ''Journal of Black Studies'' (2008) 39#1 pp 5-21. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40282545 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tobacco====
By the 1950s, fears of [[cancer]] from tobacco [[smoking]] caused consternation in the [[tobacco industry]], which turned to advertisers for help in avoiding falling consumer [[demand]] and increased regulation. British and American agencies separately arrived at similar solutions.  The Tobacco Industry Research Committee in the United States and the Tobacco Manufacturers' Standing Committee in Britain each assuaged public anxieties and encouraged the misperception that the cigarette makers were resolving the issues through filters and low tar formulations. The public relations approach was successful in the short run, but the accumulation of medical evidence led to a fall in smoking, heavier taxation, and increased regulation. The agencies responded with sophisticated advertising strategies designed to encourage adolescent smokers as well as to recruit new smokers in [[developing countries|less-developed foreign markets]].&lt;ref&gt;David T. Courtwright,  "'Carry on Smoking': Public Relations and Advertising Strategies of American and British Tobacco Companies since 1950," ''Business History'' (2005) 47#3 pp 421-432. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076790500056044?journalCode=fbsh20 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cable television from the 1980s===
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of cable television and particularly [[MTV]]. Pioneering the concept of the music video, MTV ushered in a new type of advertising: the consumer tunes in ''for'' the advertising message, rather than it being a [[by-product]] or afterthought. As cable and satellite television became increasingly prevalent, [[specialty channel]]s emerged, including channels entirely [[Shopping channel|devoted to advertising]], such as [[QVC]], [[Home Shopping Network]], and [[ShopTV Canada]].

===On the Internet from the 1990s===
{{main article|Online advertising}}
With the advent of the [[ad server]], marketing through the Internet opened new frontiers for advertisers and contributed to the "[[dot-com bubble|dot-com]]" boom of the 1990s. Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything from [[coupon]]s to free Internet access. At the turn of the 21st century, a number of websites, including the [[Web search engine|search engine]] [[Google]], started a change in [[online advertising]] by emphasizing contextually relevant ads based on an individual's browsing interests. This has led to a plethora of similar efforts and an increasing trend of [[interactive advertising]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The share of advertising spending relative to GDP has changed little across large changes in media. For example, in the US in 1925, the main advertising media were newspapers, magazines, signs on [[Tram|streetcars]], and outdoor [[poster]]s. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media. Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower – about 2.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm |title=Annual U.S. Advertising Expenditure Since 1919 |publisher=Galbithink.org |date=September 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 20, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090401205848/http://galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm| archivedate= April 1, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising business model has also been adapted since the 1990s.  In [[media for equity]], advertising is not sold, but provided to start-up companies in return for [[equity (finance)|equity]]. If the company grows and is sold, the media companies receive cash for their shares.

Chinese advertising is moving heavily to the smartphone, leaving television behind. Companies in China are increasingly more focused on mobile advertisements than on television advertisements. Central roles are played by Chinese-based social networking sites Weixin (also known as WeChat), and Sina Weibo, and the efforts of Western companies, including Coca-Cola, Burberry, and North Face, to market to Chinese consumers through their smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Stevenson and Shanshan Wang. "A Jump to Mobile Ads in China." ''New York Times'', 22 Dec 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restrictions on advertising====
Since the 1950s, the industry itself, or the government, has imposed some restrictions on advertising certain types of products, especially liquor and cigarettes. Tobacco bans exist in many major countries across the world and cover 2.3 billion people.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, ''WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic, 2013: enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship'' (World Health Organization, 2013) [http://www.who.int/tobacco/global_report/2013/en/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s Quebec banned some advertising directed at children. The restrictions have hindered competition in the breakfast cereal market when compared with the rest of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;C. Robert Clark, "Advertising Restrictions and Competition in the Children's Breakfast Cereal Industry," ''Journal of Law &amp; Economics'' (2007) 50#4 pp 757-780. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/519820 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 1900:  Europe==
[[File:Michelin Poster 1898.jpg|thumb|A poster by "[[Marius Rossillon|O'Galop]]" of [[Bibendum]], the Michelin Man, 1898]]
[[J. Walter Thompson]] became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Ciochetto, ''Globalisation and Advertising in Emerging Economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China'' (Routledge, 2013) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet]] (1906-1996) was the most prominent leader of French advertising in the 20th century. He founded [[Publicis]]. After 1945 his little-known Paris-based advertising agency grew rapidly, becoming the world's fourth largest agency. It was a leader in promoting France's post-war economic boom, especially the expansion of the advertising industry. It was successful because of its close ties with top officials of the French government, its clever use of symbols to promote itself, and its ability to attract clients from widely diverse growing industries.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Lorin, ''5 Giants of Advertising'' (Assouline Pub., 2001). pp 82-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark Hultquist, "Publicis and the French advertising world, 1946--1968" ''Essays in Economic &amp; Business History'' (2009) 27: 61-76&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of whether advertising reflects society or shapes society, can be seen in European models that diverged from the American style.  In France, [[Michelin]] dominated the tire industry and was one of the leading advertisers; to this day [[Michelin Guide|its famous guidebooks]] are very widely used by upscale travelers.  From 1894 to the present its symbol was [[Bibendum]] (the "Michelin Man" made of tires). He was a lord of industry, a master of all he surveyed, and a patriotic expounder of the French spirit. In the 1920s, Bibendum urged Frenchmen to adopt America's superior factory system, but to patriotically avoid using the "inferior" products of those factories.  As automobiles diffused to the middle classes, Michelin advertising likewise shifted downscale, and its restaurant and hotel guides covered a broader range of price categories.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Harp, ''Marketing Michelin. Advertising and Cultural Identity in Twentieth-Century France'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Martin,  "Le marché publicitaire Français et les grands médias 1918-1970." ''Vingtieme siecle. Revue d'histoire'' (1988): 75-90. [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/xxs_0294-1759_1988_num_20_1_2796 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

J Walter Thompson expanded successfully in many countries, but France was not one of them.  French businessmen did not like the American tone, and were fearful of Americanization. The French market was heavily regulated and protected to repel foreign interests, and the American admen in Paris were not good at hiding their condescension and insensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Eric Hultquist,  "Americans in Paris: The J. Walter Thompson Company in France, 1927–1968." ''Enterprise and Society'' 4#03 (2003): 471-501.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
As millions of American soldiers passed through  Britain during the Second World War, there were fearsof an "Americanization" of British commerce and culture. The Marshall Plan explicitly required and upgrading of the marketing and organizational skills of British industry. There were fears among the leaders of the  London advertising world of what the brash, rich Americans would do to them.    Radio and television was off limits to advertising, because BBC relied on fees paid by owners of radio receivers.  The question was whether the heavily funded American methods would prove irresistible. JWT London was an American owned  advertising agency controlled by J. Walter Thompson in New York City.   JWT London avoided being  the bold apostle of the American style. Instead  it is relied on soft persuasion, shedding its Americanness to adapt to the British understated style.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Nixon,  "Apostles of Americanization? J. Walter Thompson Company Ltd, Advertising and Anglo-American Relations 1945-67," ''Contemporary British History'' (2008) 22#4 pp 477-499.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the 1920s, most advertising was handled by manufacturing companies in-house. Numerous small advertising agencies handled purchase of space in the media, but did not design campaigns or the ads themselves. An important role was played by travelling salesmen in promoting products to wholesalers and retailers and providing feedback from the market to the producer.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela E. Swett, ''Selling under the Swastika: Advertising and Commercial Culture in Nazi Germany'' (2014) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Nazi era (1933–45), the advertising industry expelled its Jews, and came under the supervision of the "Ad Council for the German Economy," a department of the propaganda ministry of [[Joseph Goebbels]]. The relationship was friendly, For the industry learned a great deal from the Nazi propaganda techniques. The industry promoted Hitler's favorite products, such as the promised Volkswagen automobile for the people, and the construction of autobahns. It emphasized the availability of trusted brands despite growing shortages after the war began in 1939. It helped support the regime, articulating a vision of consumption that was well aligned with the Nazi spirit. In some environments and social movements, such as with post-WW2 East Germany Stasi's [[zersetzung]], criminology theorists estimated advertisement was used as a means to crime, the nature of the crime was the intentional exploitation of an individual to cause damage to the individual's ability to form social bonds and appropriate perceptions of the world. This is especially true in the case of manipulation, people take advantage of their underdeveloped social skills and exploit them for selfish gain, this was later criticized to be adopted by turpitude agents of modern advertising. Many major brands were off the market by 1944, because of severe shortages. When they returned after the war, they were welcomed as an index of normality and were not associated with Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Swett, ''Selling under the Swastika'' (2014) ch 2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, German advertising agencies were starting to mimic American methods.&lt;ref&gt;Harm G. Schröter, "Die Amerikanisierung der Werbung in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland," ["The Americanization of advertising in West Germany."] ''Jahrbuch für Wirtschaftsgeschichte'' (1997), Issue 1, pp 93-115, dates the Americanization to the 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coca-Cola was advising  "Mach mal Pause" ("Take a Rest!), and conservative Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was running for reelection with the slogan "Keine Experimente!" ("No Experiments!").&lt;ref&gt;Gries, Rainer et al. "Die Ära Adenauer: Zeitgeschichte im Werbeslogan. 'Mach Mal Pause,' 'Keine Experimente!'" ''Journal Geschichte'' (1989)  Issue 3, pp 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The German agencies have always remained small and limited in scope,&lt;ref&gt;"German agencies often overlooked on global scene." ''Marketing News'' (Aug 29, 1986) v. 20 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; even after the unification of East Germany and West Germany in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Cote and Dagmar Mussey, "German advertising growing together: unification of Germany, EC electrify market," ''Advertising Age'' (Feb. 11 1991), V. 62, pp 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; After unification, Germany became the third largest ad market in the world, with $18 billion in total ad spending in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;''Advertising Age'' (March 21, 1994) v. 65 p. I-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The American influence became strong in Italy after 1945.  The high risk of communist success led the American government to invest heavily in propaganda activities.&lt;ref&gt;Simona Tobia. ''Advertising America: The United States Information Service in Italy (1945–1956)'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several American firms opened offices, including Young &amp; Rubicon and Ogilvy &amp; Mather. Italian graphic designers, most prominently [[Armando Testa]], were inspired by modernist aesthetics and thinking brought in by the American advertising agencies and techniques in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Simona De Iulio,  and Carlo Vinti, "La publicité italienne et le modèle américain: le débat entre les artistes et techniciens, 1948-1960," [Italian advertising and the American model: the debate between artists and technicians, 1948-60] ''Vingtième Siecle'' (2009), Issue 101, pp 61-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  The advertising industry helped transform Italy into a consumer-oriented society.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Arvidsson, "Pubblicita E Consumi Nell'Italia Del Dopoguerra" [Advertising and consumerism in postwar Italy] ''Contemporanea: Rivista di Storia dell '800 e del '900'' (2001) 4#4 pp 649-672.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Oliviero Toscani International Journalism Festival 3.jpg|thumb|200px|Oliviero Toscani]]

A dramatic example of how advertising nudged the Italian middle-class into modern consumer society appears in the heavily advertised automatic washing machine. It appeared on the Italian market in 1958 and by 1965, 23% of families had purchased one, reaching 42% by 1970. Advertisers hailed the  mechanization of domestic tedium as the advent of a new women's "liberation."  Commentary appeared everywhere, from advertisements to the specialized press, to women's reviews. Architects and designers made room for the new marvel, as the promotional language celebrating the device became a chorus of praise for domestic appliances as the secret of  "progress" and "freedom" and "liberation."  On the other hand, husbands still insisted on driving the family automobile; it was off-limits to the liberated female.&lt;ref&gt;Enrica Asquer, "La Signora Candy e la sua lavatrice: storia di un'intesa perfetta nell'Italia degli anni Sessanta." [Mrs. Candy and her washing machine: a perfect love story in 1960s Italy] ''Genesis'' 1 (2006) pp: 1000-1022.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Armando Testa Set up a full-service advertising agency in 1956, specializing in the new medium of television advertising.  He was inspired by Eastern European animation techniques, and often use simple graphics like the blue hippo. His son Marco Testa, trained at Benton &amp; Bowles in New York, and maintained the fast-paced, witty style.&lt;ref&gt;Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' pp 138-43&lt;/ref&gt; Emmanuelle Pirella, who trained at the Italian offices of Young &amp; Rubicon and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, emerged as a leading copywriter.

[[Benetton Group|Benetton]] gained worldwide attention for its saucy advertising, inspired by its art director [[Oliviero Toscani]]. He started with multicultural themes, tied together under the campaign "United Colors of Benetton" then became increasingly provocative with interracial groupings, and unusual sexual images, such as a nun kissing a priest.&lt;ref&gt;Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' pp 146-49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Since 1900: Asia and Africa==

===Japan===
[[Dentsu]] is the dominant firm in Japan thanks to its origins as a media representative. It produced Japan's first newspaper advertisements as well as the first television commercials. It was established in 1901 as Japan Advertising Ltd. and Telegraphic Service Co. by Hoshiro Mitsunaga. In 1936, it sold off its news division to Doumei News Agency, to focus on advertising. In 1946, it purchased 16 small companies and set up operational bases in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Kyūshū. Dentsu company now offers a range of services, from traditional and creative marketing to specialty disciplines such as sports marketing, investing in feature film production and acquiring broadcasting rights, PR, digital contents, and a growing range of communications services.&lt;ref&gt;Kotaro Sugiyama and Tim Andree. ''The Dentsu Way: Secrets of Cross Switch Marketing from the World's Most Innovative Advertising Agency'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In the first 20 years of communist control of China (1947 to 1966) Mao Zedong tried to reverse the long-standing advertising practices of Chinese newspapers, considering it a capitalist infringement on the goals of socialism. Consumerism, which had been highly developed in Shanghai, was anathema, to Mao's peasant-based communist perspective. The regime emphasized maximum production rather than optimal consumption. The approach worsened the massive famines that happened when national resources were devoted to a highly inefficient factory production at the cost of basic food output. On the other hand, propaganda was highly developed art in the Communist Party, and so a sort of  compromise was reached. Socialist-oriented advertising emphasized the collective good, rather than the benefits of products for the individual consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Gerth, "Compromising with Consumerism in Socialist China: Transnational Flows and Internal Tensions in 'Socialist Advertising'", ''Past &amp; Present'' (2013 Supplement)  pp 203-232  [http://karl-gerth.pubs-hub.ucsd.edu/mm_uploads/gerth-past-y-present-2013.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, the strength of the private economy, and advertising, has grown dramatically.  By the 1980s much emphasis was placed on the role of advertising in promoting [[Chinese economic reform|the Four Modernizations]] emphasized by [[Deng Xiaoping]].  Lip service is still paid to old Maoist ideals by recycling images of historic places and episodes, but it does not inhibit the growth of consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;Xin Zhao and Russell W. Belk, "Politicizing Consumer Culture: Advertising's Appropriation of Political Ideology in China's Social Transition," ''Journal of Consumer Research'' (2008) 35#2 pp 231-244&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Chinese entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002, its advertising industry has fundamentally changed. It has become the world's fastest-growing advertising market and the country with the largest pool of netizens.  Major changes have come in terms of shifting cultural values, the growing role of brand names,  the attractiveness of English-language titles to the younger generation,  the redefinition of  acceptable/offensive advertising,  the very rapid growth of new media (especially the Internet and smart phones),  the emergence of on-line shopping in a country with an underdeveloped system of department stores in shopping centers, and much more advanced techniques of managing advertising agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Kineta Hung, et al.  "Advertising Research in the Post-WTO Decade in China," ''Journal of Advertising'' (2012) 41#3 pp 121-146&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Many elements of Indian culture and industry have British roots, so that British advertising models usually work well. In 1991, the government dramatically liberalized Indian economy, opening it to international business. The emergence of a moderately affluent middle-class numbering in the hundreds of millions attracts multinational corporations and international advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;William M. O'Barr, "Advertising in India." ''Advertising &amp; Society Review'' 9#.3 (2008) pp: 1-33. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/advertising_and_society_review/v009/9.3.o-barr.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aruna Chandra, David A. Griffith, and John K. Ryans, "Advertising standardisation in India: US multinational experience" ''International Journal of Advertising'' (2002) 21#1 pp47-66&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertising in India operates at two levels. Ads for high-value products appear in English-language papers such as ''The Hindu'' and ''The Madras Mail,'' which targeted Europeans and high-status Indians. By contrast, ads for low-value products are typically placed in vernacular papers and are aimed at a lower middle class with highly restricted spending power. The working class and peasant populations, with very low disposable incomes, are seldom targeted by the advertising agencies. Local merchants might use signs and posters to reach them.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E. Haynes, "Advertising and the History of South Asia, 1880–1950" p 363&lt;/ref&gt;  Cricket is one sport where the Indians have had an international success, so that cricket stars are prominent endorsers in national advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Sharma, "Indian cricket players are becoming big winners for many advertisers," ''Asian Wall Street Journal'' (May 11, 1998) p 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtle cultural norms can be easily transgressed. In 2002, widespread protests forced Hindustan Lever Ltd. (the Indian subsidiary of London-based Unilever) to cancel  a television ad campaign for its fairness cream because of its portrayal of women. The campaign was built around the theme of a father lamenting "If only I had a son" while showing his problem: a dark-skinned, unattractive daughter.  Fast-forward.  She uses the Fair &amp; Lovely cream and has become a gorgeous light-skinned beauty.  Clad in a stylish miniskirt, she is a successful airline flight attendant and takes her proud father to dine at a five-star hotel.  The All India Women's Democratic Association ([[AIDWA]]), a far left political organization, lodged a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission in New Delhi. It argued endorsing the traditional preference for sons strengthens gender discrimination, which is a major problem in India. Furthermore, said AIDWA, the ad perpetuated a culture of discrimination in a society where "fair skin" is synonymous with "beautiful."  The government's Ministry of Information and Broadcast sided with AIDWA and directed stations not to air the ads because they violated the Cable and Television Networks Act of 1995 which states that no advertisement shall be permitted which "derides any race, caste, color, creed and nationality" and furthermore states that, "Women must not be portrayed in a manner that emphasizes passive, submissive qualities and encourages them to play a subordinate secondary role in the family and society."  The minister told Parliament that if broadcasters do not regulate ad content the government will be forced to do so. The Mumbai-based Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a body of advertisers and media agencies, insisted that it should do the regulating not the government. ASCI had already told Hindustan Lever that its ad campaign was offensive and it was ended.&lt;ref&gt;Arundhati Parmar, "Objections to Indian ad not taken lightly" ''Marketing News'' (June 9, 2003) 37#12 pp 4-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing world===
During the decolonization era from the late 1940s to the 1970s, British and French firms operating  in Africa and Asia at first largely ignored local, nationalistic aspirations.  However they learned to  adjust to exploit  the new spirit of independence that was shaping consumer attitudes.  The new emergence of a middle class was the target audience.  Their advertising abandoned the traditional  paternalistic attitude toward the natives. Instead there was a portrayal of locals as up-and-coming middle class men  in control of developing their nations. These more positive images assisted business operations  during spells of military dictatorship, economic nationalism, and expropriation of foreign assets.&lt;ref&gt;Sephanie Decker, "Corporate Legitimacy and Advertising: British Companies and the Rhetoric of Development in West Africa, 1950-1970," ''Business History Review'' (2007) 81#1 pp 59-86&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco advertising was especially important. For example, in Egyptian popular culture the cigar was associated with elites, the water pipe with a lower-class and traditional lifestyle, and the cigarette with the new middle class which was striving to make the transition to modernity.  It was the third group that the cigarette industry targeted.&lt;ref&gt;Relli Shechter, "Reading advertisements in a colonial/development context: Cigarette advertising and identity politics in Egypt, c1919-1939." ''Journal of social history'' 39#2 (2005): 483-503. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3790779 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil is the largest country in Latin America, and number five in the world in terms of population. Its economy grew rapidly in the 21st century, until it began to stall in 2010. At that time it was the world's sixth-biggest advertising market, at $US 14.2 billion.  Brazil in 2010 ranks #1 in deodorants, #2 in children's products, #3 in cosmetics, and #4 in automobile sales&lt;ref&gt;Laurel Wentz and Claudia Penteado, "Why so many agencies are storming road to Sao Paulo" ''Advertising Age'' (Dec. 6 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
The start in 1994 of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] had a dramatic impact on the adveritising industry in Mexico, with its 130 full service agencies and 270 smaller operations under the auspisces of the Mexican Association of Advertising Agencies.  The flood of American brand-name products greatly expanded the scope of the advertising industry, and the Mexican agencies faced new competition from branch offices of international firms.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McCurry, "Advertising in transition: agencies change their image to meet market demand" ''Business Mexico'' (Sept. 1992) 2#4, Vol. 2, p4+&lt;/ref&gt;

A key to the new market was that upscale consumers in Mexico typically display [[Malinchism|"malinchismo"]], which is a preference for imported American brands rather than local Mexican brands. As a result, American products are sold mostly to the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas. They concentrate their efforts instead on Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, which purchase 70 percent of the American imports.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ueltschy, and John K. Ryans, Jr., "Employing standardized promotion strategies in Mexico: the impact of language and cultural differences," ''International Executive'' (July 1997) 39#4 pp 479+&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertising battles in Mexico, include not only issues of quality, but issues of national authenticity. For example, in Mexico in the 1990s, two American exporters Procter &amp; Gamble and Frito-Lay fought an advertising battle concerning whose potato chips are tastier, more natural, and more Mexican. Procter &amp; Gamble challenged Frito-Lay's Sabritas which controls 80 percent of the $1 billion chip market.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Friedland, "P&amp;G, Frito-Lay in Mexican—ad standoff," ''Wall Street Journal'' (March 19, 1999).

'''''Lady Jane Grey Preparing for Execution''''' is an 1835 [[oil painting]] by the American artist [[George Whiting Flagg]] which established his early fame. This fame was however to dwindle as a consequence of a decline in the role of historical painting in American art. It was originally meant to represent [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], but Flagg decided to change it to [[Lady Jane Grey]] in mid-work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Ives|title=Lady Jane Grey: A Tudor Mystery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZCMGgJzO2IC&amp;pg=PA237|date=19 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5426-3|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Lumen Reed on June 16, 1834, he said:

:"I have changed the name of my picture to Lady Jane Gray {{sic}}. I find that Mary was too old at the time of her exicution {{sic}} to make an interesting picture."

A heroic Lady Jane, Protestant martyr, clad in royal purple, head held high, is blindfolded for execution by sympathetic executioners. Notably absent are any crucifixes, beads, medallions or other signs of "[[popery]]" distinguishing the religious life of Catholics from that of Protestants.

The painting appears to show her being blindfolded indoors, in reality she was executed outdoors and would probably only have been blindfolded after she was led onto the scaffold.

'''''Landscape with the Good Samaritan''''' is a [[1638 in art|1638]] oil on oak panel painting by [[Rembrandt]]. It is one of only six oil landscapes by the artist and with ''[[The Girl in a Picture Frame]]'' and ''[[The Scholar at the Lectern]]'', it is also one of only three Rembrandt paintings in Polish collections. It shows the parable of the [[Good Samaritan]] from the [[Gospel of Luke]].

It was bought at a [[Paris]] auction by [[Jean-Pierre Norblin de La Gourdaine]] and therefore passed into the Polish noblewoman [[Izabela Czartoryska]]'s collection at the [[Dom Gotycki (Puławy)|Dom Gotycki]] at [[Puławy]]. That collection was later moved to [[Krakow]] and so it was one of several painting looted by the Germans in 1939. After World War Two, thanks to research by the art historian [[Karol Estreicher (junior)|Karol Estreicher]], it was returned to Krakow and is now in the city's [[Czartoryski Museum]]. That museum and its whole collection (including ''Landscape'') were sold to the Polish state for 100 million Euros in December 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16652">[[Charles-Auguste Lebourg]] was a French sculptor born in [[Nantes]] in 1829. He died in Paris in 1906. This is a listing of his main works.

==Main works==
These are listed below.

==Paris' Hôtel de ville==
In 1881, Lebourg executed an allegory of Nantes as part of the town hall's decoration.&lt;ref name=wkp/&gt;

=="Travail"==
Lebourg executed the bronze statue '''"Travail"''' for the École Diderot.&lt;ref name=wkp/&gt; It was shown at the 1885 Paris Salon and the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]].&lt;ref name=wkp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikiphidias.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=481:lebourg-charles-auguste&amp;catid=34:biographie&amp;Itemid=53#Synthèse|title=Biographical details|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leveilleurdenuit.pagesperso-orange.fr/|title=école Diderot|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bust of Richard Wallace, Fourth Marquess of Hertford and Lady Wallace==
[[Image:Charles Lebourg - buste de Mme Wallace.jpg|Bust of Lady Wallace|thumb|centre|200px|Lady Wallace]]
In 1872 Lebourg completed a posthumous bust in white marble based on a photograph of the Wallaces by Étienne Corjat of 1855. His white marble bust of Lady Wallace shown here was exhibited at the Paris salon in May 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lisburn.com/books/historical_society/volume8/volume8-8.html

=="Berger lisant"==
[[File:Statue Fontainebleau Charles Le Bourg.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marble statue "Berger lisant" by Charles-Auguste Lebourg (French sculptor, 1829-1906), in a niche of the wing of the "Galerie des Cerfs", Château de Fontainebleau]]

==The Louvre==
Lebourg has three of his sculptures decorating parts of the outside of the Louvre. The Mollien Pavilion and the Ailes Mollien (an "aile" is a wing) is part of the cour Napoléon and is named after a Treasury minister at the time of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] ([[Nicolas François, Count Mollien]]) and Lebourg's '''"La Chasse"''' is one of the group of children decorating what is known as the "aile en retour Mollien". The second of Lebourg's sculptures can be seen in the Richelieu pavilion where the tympanum of the arcade of the passage leading to the rue de Rivoli is decorated with Lebourg's bas relief '''"Vérite et Histoire"'''. The third sculpture, again part of the cour Napoléon, decorates the Apollon rotunda and is entitled '''"La Force"'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louvre.sculpturederue.fr/index.html

==[[Wallace Fountains]]==
Lebourg is arguably best known for his [[caryatid]]s for the famous cast-iron [[Wallace fountain]], a public drinking fountain seen all over France and in many parts of the world. They are named after the Englishman Richard Wallace, who financed their construction. A great aesthetic success, they are recognized worldwide as one of the symbols of Paris. A Wallace Fountain can be seen outside the Wallace Collection in London, the gallery that houses the works of art collected by Sir Richard Wallace and the first four Marquesses of Hertford. The caryatids depict '''"La Simplicité"''', '''"La Bonté"''', '''"La Sobriété"''' and '''"La Charite"''' as shown below.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Monument to the men of [[Loire-Inférieure]] who died in the 1870 war==
[[File:Nantes - Monum morts 1870 05.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Lemborg's Infantryman ("Le Fantassin") stands between Henri Émile Allouard.s " "Le Fusilier colonial" and Louis-Auguste Baralis' "Le Marin"]]
This monument stands in [[Nantes]]'s Place Duchesse-Anne. Four sculptors worked on the monument, Georges Bareau, Charles-Auguste Lebourg, Henri Émile Allouard and Louis-Auguste Baralis. Lebourg's contribution was the statue of the infantryman. The monument was erected in 1897 and the inauguration ceremony in April of that year was attended by [[Félix Faure]], Jules Méline, Louis Barthou, Admiral Armand Besnard and Hippolyte-Étienne Étiennez the Nantes mayor. The bronze at the monument's summit, entitled '''"Pour le drapeau"''' was by Georges Bareau and had been cast in bronze by Barbedienne. It depicted a man slaying an eagle and at the monuments base were '''"le Fantassin"''' by Lebourg, '''"le Marin"''' by Louis Baralis, '''"l’Artilleur"''' by Émile Allouard and '''"Le Fusilier colonial"''' also by Allouard. In 1940 the occupying Germans dismantled the bronze believing that the slain eagle could be construed as representing the German eagle but the municipal workers of Nantes delegated to carry out the dismantlement managed to hide the sculpture, so stopping it being melted down. The work was retrieved in 1981, restored and re-erected in 1987.

'''Mahmoud Taha''' ({{lang-ar|محمود طه}}) (born 1942) is a [[Jordan]]ian artist, [[Pottery|potter]] and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramicist]] noted for integrating calligraphy into his ceramics and is regarded as the leading ceramicist in the Arab world. 

==Life and career==
Mahmoud Taha was born in Jaffa in 1942. He studied at Baghdad Academy of Fine Arts where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1968. He then went on to study calligraphy with the renowned calligrapher [[Mohammad Al-Hafez]]. He later continued his training in ceramics at Cardiff College of Arts in Wales, graduating in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur. S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to Jordan, he established a studio specialising in ceramics, ceramic sculpture and calligraphy. &lt;ref&gt;Lama, N., "Pioneers of Jordan:Mahmoud Taha," Khalid Shoman Foundation, Online: http://thekhalidshomanfoundation.org/main/activit/curentl/mahmoud_taha/taha.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, his arts professor, Kadhim Haydar, advised the young artist to use Arabic calligraphic elements in some of his works, since the professor had noticed Taha's talent for calligraphy. According to Taha, "this piece of advice opened the door to a new stage in my work, in which I experimented with the Kufic script of different historical periods... [and subsequently] Thuluth script and elements of Islamic ornamentation." &lt;ref&gt;Taha, M, [Biographical Notes], cited on NABA Art Gallery, Online: http://www.nabadartgallery.com/?q=node/34&lt;/ref&gt; He is also credited with improving the writing and [[calligraphy]] skills of many students in Jordanian schools.

He has been described as the "leading ceramicist in the Arab world." &lt;ref&gt;Lama, N., "Pioneers of Jordan:Mahmoud Taha," Khalid Shoman Foundation, Online: http://thekhalidshomanfoundation.org/main/activit/curentl/mahmoud_taha/taha.htm; Teller, M., ''Jordan,'' Rough Guides, 2002, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; Taha became one of the first contemporary artists to use calligraphy as a graphic element in his work, and thus pioneered the Hurufiyah art movement which combines traditional art forms in innovative ways. His work has been described in the following terms; "Taha molds the clay of his native soil into full, smooth vessels that not only maintain an ancient tradition but also explores an innovative combination of textures, glazes and forms. In Taha's work, the viewer may trace the natural hues of his ancient heritage." &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Contemporary Art from the Islamic World,'' Scorpion Publishing, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Taha produces small ceramic discs or plates as well as very large murals. His ceramic work is featured in the permanent collection of the [[Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts]] in Amman and in the Majida Mouasher Collection, a collection devoted to contemporary artworks.

The '''necropolis of Is Loccis-Santus''' is an archaeological site located in the municipality of [[San Giovanni Suergiu]], [[Sardinia]].
Dated to the 3rd millennium BC and used until the early centuries of the 2nd millennium BC, consists of thirteen [[Domus de janas]]. The artefacts found inside the tombs, mostly ceramics and other grave goods, are attributable to the [[Ozieri culture]], [[Abealzu-Filigosa culture]], [[Monte Claro culture]], the [[Bell Beaker]] and [[Bonnanaro culture]] and are now exposed in the Villa Sulcis museum of [[Carbonia, Sardinia|Carbonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monumentiaperti.com/it/default/2693/Necropoli-di-Is-Loccis-Santus.html Monumenti aperti - Necropoli di Is Loccis-Santus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609130238/http://www.monumentiaperti.com/it/default/2693/Necropoli-di-Is-Loccis-Santus.html |date=2013-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of the hill where is located the necropolis there is a monotower nuraghe, built in the Nuragic era, and some buildings dating back to [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilportalesardo.it/archeo/sgsuergiu2.htm Il portale sardo-Necropoli di Is Loccis-Santus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nsukka group''' is the name given to a group of [[Nigeria]]n artists who were associated with the [[University of Nigeria, Nsukka]] in the 1970s.  They are known, as a group, for working to revive the practice of ''[[uli (design)|uli]]'' and incorporate its designs into contemporary art using media such as [[acrylic paint]], [[tempera]], [[gouache]], pen and ink, [[pastel]], [[oil paint]], and [[watercolor]].  Although traditionally ''uli'' artists were female, many of the artists of the group were male.  Some were poets and writers in addition to being artists.

Among the artists associated with the group are:
* [[Tayo Adenaike]]
* [[El Anatsui]]
* [[Chike Aniakor]]
* [[Olu Oguibe]]
* [[Uche Okeke]]
* [[Ada Udechukwu]]
* [[Obiora Udechukwu]]

* Product [[technical specifications]].
* [[Warranty]] information; sometimes provided as a separate sheet.

Until the last decade or two of the twentieth century it was common for an owner's manual to include detailed [[repair]] information, such as a [[circuit diagram]]; however as products became more complex this information was gradually relegated to specialized [[service manual]]s, or dispensed with entirely, as devices became too inexpensive to be economically repaired.

Owner's manuals for simpler devices are often [[multilingual]] so that the same boxed product can be sold in many different markets. Sometimes the same manual is shipped with a range of related products so the manual will contain a number of sections that apply only to some particular model in the product range.

With the increasing complexity of modern devices, many owner's manuals have become so large that a separate [[quickstart guide]] is provided. Some owner's manuals for computer equipment are supplied on [[CD-ROM]] to cut down on manufacturing costs, since the owner is assumed to have a computer able to read the CD-ROM. Another trend is to supply instructional video material with the product, such as a [[videotape]] or [[DVD]], along with the owner's manual.

Many businesses offer [[PDF]] copies of manuals that can be accessed or downloaded free of charge from their websites.

== Installation manual ==
An installation manual or installation guide is a [[Technical communication|technical communication]] [[Document|document]] intended to instruct people how to install a particular product. An installation manual is usually written by a [[Technical writer|technical writer]] or other technical staff. 

Installation is the act of putting something in place so that it is ready for use.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of “installation” from the Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; An installation manual most commonly describes the safe and correct installation of a product. The term product here relates to any consumer, non-consumer, hardware, software, electrical, electronic or mechanical product that requires installation. The installation of a computer program is also known as the [[Installation (computer programs)|setup]].
[[Image:Installatiehandleiding rollend hekwerk installatie.jpg|thumb|link=https://www.manualise.com/en/installation-manual/|250px|A sample of an installation manual]]
In case of an installation manual, the installation instruction is a separate document that focuses solely on the person(s) that will perform the installation. However, the installation instruction can also be an integrated part of the overall owner's manual.

The size, structure and content of an installation manual depend heavily on the nature of the product and the needs and capabilities of the intended target group. Furthermore, various standards and directives are available that provide guidance and requirements for the design of instructions.

The international standard IEC 82079&lt;ref&gt;IEC 82079-1:2012, p. 31, 5 Content of instructions for use&lt;/ref&gt; prescribes the required installation topics for an installation instruction. Among these topics, are procedures, diagrams and conditions for installation activities, such as unpacking, mounting and connecting.

For machines the European Machinery Directive prescribes that an instruction manual must contain assembly, installation and connecting instructions, including drawings, diagrams and the means of attachment and the designation of the chassis or installation on which the machinery is to be mounted.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC , p. 25-26, 1.7.4.2 Contents of the instructions.&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Car owner's manuals ==
All new cars come with an owner's manual from the manufacturer. Most owners leave them in the [[glove compartment]] for easy reference. This can make their frequent absence in [[rental car]]s frustrating because it violates the driver's [[user expectations]], as well as makes it difficult to use controls that aren't understood, which is not good because understanding control operation of an unfamiliar car is one of the first steps recommended in [[defensive driving]]. Owner's manuals usually cover three main areas: a description of the location and operation of all controls; a schedule and descriptions of maintenance required, both by the owner and by a mechanic; and specifications such as oil and fuel capacity and part numbers of light bulbs used. Current car owner's manuals have become much bigger in part due to many safety warnings most likely designed to avoid [[product liability]] lawsuits, as well as from ever more complicated audio and navigational systems, which often have their own manual.

If owners lose their car manual, they can either order a replacement from a dealer, pick up a used one secondhand, or download a PDF version of the manual online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.edmunds.com/how-to/how-to-find-your-car-owners-manual-online.html |title = How to Find Your Car Owner's Manual Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the next generation of digitized car manuals came online, which use [[Watson_(computer)|IBM Watson]] Artificial Intelligence to understand and answer questions in natural driver language&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2017/11/end-of-the-car-manual/&lt;/ref&gt;. "Ask Mercedes" was the first in a wave of these vehicle assistants which can support both speech and text-based input.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.diplomaticsales.mercedes-benz.com/passengercars/being-an-owner/ask-mercedes-campaign/stage.module.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
The [[noun phrase]] ''owner's manual'' has been used by [[analogy]] in the title of numerous instructional books about entities that are not manufactured products, such as [[pet]]s, body parts and [[business]]es.

== User guides ==
The equivalent document for [[computer software]] is called a [[user guide]] since [[User (computing)|users]] are typically [[license]]es rather than [[owner]]s of the software.

== Unicode ==
The OPEN BOOK ([[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs|📖]]) Unicode symbol equals ''read operator's manual''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F300.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; OPEN BOOK has Unicode code point U+1F4D6.

'''Photo-referencing''' in [[visual art]] is the practice of creating art based on a [[photograph]]. Art produced through this technique is said to be '''photo-referenced'''.

Almost all artists will photo-reference at some point; even if not in their daily work, artists may photo-reference as part of their [[training]], to improve their artistic eye.

Photo-referencing, rather than working with [[life|live]] [[model (art)|models]], is useful for cases in which an artist seeks to realistically produce a work of art based on some subject that is not readily available, such as specific person who is not there or a structure in another country.

Artists may use a [[lightbox]] as an aid in photo-referencing.

In the [[comic book]] industry, photo-referencing is criticized by some as a technique used to disguise the weakness of the artist's technical capability. However, others feel that photo-referencing is a legitimate technique and that there is nothing wrong with it. Artists that have been charged with excessive photo-referencing by their critics include [[Greg Land]] and [[Alex Ross]], though others defend the quality of their work.  Award-winning comic creator [[Alison Bechdel]] also uses extensive photo reference, frequently photographing herself in the poses of the characters she draws in order to convey body language accurately.&lt;ref name="tcj44-47"&gt;{{Citation

'''Popular history''' is a broad and somewhat ill-defined [[genre]] of [[historiography]] that takes a popular approach, aims at a wide readership, and usually emphasizes [[narrative]], [[Personality type|personality]] and vivid detail over scholarly analysis. The term is used in contradistinction to professional academic or scholarly history writing which is usually more specialized and technical and, thus, less accessible to the general reader.

Some popular historians are without academic affiliation while others are academics, or former academics, that have (according to one writer) "become somehow abstracted from the academic arena, becoming cultural commentators".&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, Jerome (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hexpdOj8t80C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22popular+historian%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yvNFz2kvUh&amp;sig=io51iX8gENuqr0egzP2J9JpLwGM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZBSxSpqCKYmf8Qbh7MHCDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22popular%20historian%22&amp;f=false ''Consuming History: Historians and Heritage in Contemporary Popular Culture''], [[Routledge]], pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Many worked as journalists, perhaps after taking an initial degree in history.

Popular historians may become nationally renowned or best-selling authors and may or may not serve the interests of particular political viewpoints in their roles as "public historians". Many authors of "official histories" and "authorized biographies" would qualify as popular historians serving the interests of particular institutions or public figures.

Popular historians aim to appear on the "general lists" of general publishers, rather than the [[university press]]es that have dominated [[academic publishing]] in recent years. Increasingly, popular historians have taken to television where they are able, often accompanying a series of documentaries with a [[tie-in]] book.

==Examples==
Recent examples of American popular historians with academic affiliations include [[Stephen Ambrose]], [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]] and [[Pauline Maier]]. Non-academics include [[Bruce Catton]], [[Shelby Foote]], [[David McCullough]], [[Daniel Boorstin]] and [[Barbara Tuchman]].

Recent examples of British popular historians who are also academics include [[Niall Ferguson]], [[Christopher Hibbert]] and [[Simon Schama]], and – from a previous generation – [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[A. J. P. Taylor]] (an early pioneer of history on television) and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]. Much of [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]'s output was also directed at a popular audience.

[[John Julius Norwich]], [[Nirad Chaudhuri]], [[Ramchandra Guha]], [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]] and [[Tariq Ali]] are popular historians who have never been academics.

'''Progress Theatre''' is a local theatre company at [[Reading, Berkshire]] in England with 'a reputation for excellence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2005/10/04/woman_who_cooked_review_feature.shtml|title=The Woman Who Cooked Her Husband – review|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] and it is a member of the [[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain|Little Theatre Guild]] (LTG) and the [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] (NODA).

==History==
Progress Theatre was established in 1946 with the aim of presenting new and challenging work.

Its first production was staged in 1947 in Palmer Hall, West Street, Reading. It moved to its present location, The Mildmay Hall, The Mount (near [[Reading University]]) in 1951.

In 1964, after a fund raising campaign, the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of the building was bought. After modernisation, the theatre now seats 97 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Kenneth Branagh]], who was a member of the theatre in the late 1970s (http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/kenneth-branaghs-latest-role-progress-4211832) became Progress Theatre [[patron]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="BBCBranagh"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-14261163|title=Kenneth Branagh becomes Reading Progress Theatre patron|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 July 2011|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational role==
In the 1950s a Student Group for 14- to 18-year-olds was set up. A charitable organisation, "The Progress Theatre" was established in 1962 with the object of promoting education in performing arts in Reading and the surrounding area.&lt;ref name="charity"&gt;{{Cite web

 |accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2009, the Progress Youth Theatre consists of two groups for 15- to 18-year-olds and groups for school years 4 to 6 (ages 8 to 11), 7 to 8 (ages 11 to 13) and 9 to 10 (ages 13 to 15).&lt;ref name="pyt"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups give a public performance each year.&lt;ref name="pyt" /&gt;

==Present day==
The theatre has a membership of around 150 people and puts on a regular menu of classic and contemporary theatre. All of these productions are managed by volunteers.

The theatre also stages a summer open-air event, predominantly a Shakespeare play, at the historic and newly-revovated ruins of [[Reading Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2006/06/28/winters_tale_abbey_ruins_feature.shtml

 |publisher=[[BBC]]
 |accessdate=18 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These productions are managed in partnership with [[Reading Borough Council]]. In 2007, the event was expanded to form the Reading Abbey Ruins Open Air Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ongoing restoration of the abbey, in 2011 the event temporarily moved to the gardens of [[Caversham Court]], the site of a Tudor manor house on the banks of the River Thames.

==Past productions==
Progress has presented contemporary plays since its founding and the first performances in England of ''[[The Good Person of Sezuan|The Good Woman of Setzuan]]'' by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and ''[[The Shadow of a Gunman]]'' by [[Seán O'Casey]] were produced at the theatre&lt;ref name="branagh"&gt;{{Cite web

'''Proof of insurance''' ('''POI''') is any type of documentation that a person can provide to another individual proving that the person has valid [[insurance]] with an [[insurance company]].

The most common form of a POI is a paper card provided by the insurance company listing policy information and effective dates.

Where [[vehicle insurance]] is compulsory, many states require that a person carry proof of insurance in their automobiles or on their person while driving.  If a person is questioned by a law enforcement official, they must provide proof of insurance.  A citation is generally issued if the person cannot provide such documentation.

With the country's ethnically diverse background, '''Puerto Rican art''' reflects many diverse influences.

== Santos ==
[[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] art includes an especially beloved form of [[folk art]], evolved from the Spanish church's use of [[sculpture]]s to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to [[Christianity]]. Santos, meaning "[[saints]]" in Spanish, depict figures of saints and other religious icons.  Families continue to pass this centuries-old craft down from generation to generation.  The artisans, called santeros, create Santos from native wood, clay, and stone.  After shaping simple [[Effigy|effigies]], they often finish by painting them in vivid colors.  Santos varies in size, from about eight to about twenty inches tall.  Traditionally, Santos was seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven.  As such, they occupied a special place on household [[altar]]s, where people prayed to them, asked for help, or tried to summon their protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/2aa/2aa559.htm Information from the Newark Museum's Santos de Palo exhibit.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Caritas ==
Caretas, masks are worn during [[carnival]]s, are also popular.  Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa, though for different purposes.  The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed [[Christians]] into returning to the church, while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented.  Puerto Rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs, true to their historical origins.  While they are usually constructed of [[papier-mâché]], coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well.  Though red and black were originally the typical colors for carnitas, their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lasalitacafe.com/puerto-rican-literature-culture/ | title=Puerto Rican Literature, Art &amp; Culture | publisher=La Salita Cafe | accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;§

==Visual arts==
Perhaps the strongest Spanish influenced on Puerto Rican arts was in painting.  During the colonial period, native-born painters emulated classic European styles.  The first of these artists to gain international acclaim, [[José Campeche]], learned techniques from both his father, who was also a painter and exiled Spanish artist [[Luis Paret]]. His work concentrated on religious themes and portraits of important citizens in Spanish Rococo style.  Still regarded as the most important 18th-century painter in the Americas, Campeche is also credited with creating the Puerto Rican national painting.
[[File: Hacienda La Fortuna Francisco Oller 1885 Brooklyn Museum.jpg|thumb|''Hacienda La Fortuna'' by [[Francisco Oller]] (1885). [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
In the 19th century, [[Francisco Oller]] followed in Campeche's footsteps.  He studied in both Madrid and Paris, which greatly influenced his work.  Although his paintings often show an Impressionist or Realist style, he altered his style with each piece to suit the subject matter.  Landscapes, portraits, and still lifes were all among his works.  After moving back to Puerto Rico in 1884, Oller became interested in portraying Puerto Rican subject matter.  He also founded an art academy and wrote a book on drawing and painting the natural world.

By the end of the 20th century, painting no longer defined Puerto Rican art as it once had. "A group of contemporary artists who came into maturity in the 1990s broke away from nationalistic agendas so crucial to previous generations of artists from Puerto Rico," according to curator Silvia Karman Cubiña. "Instead their works are informed by more personal issues, as well as broader topics such as gender, consumerism, world history, film, and literature."&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Karman Cubiña, “Notes on Neoconceptualism from Puerto Rico” in ''None of the Above: Contemporary Work by Puerto Rican Artists'' (Hartford, CT: Real Art Ways, 2004), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of artists such as [[Allora &amp; Calzadilla]], Rosado Seijo, and [[Arnaldo Morales]] was "their social dimension and the potential for interaction with others."&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Karman Cubiña, “Notes on Neoconceptualism from Puerto Rico” in None of the Above: Contemporary Work by Puerto Rican Artists (Hartford, CT: Real Art Ways, 2004), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; For others such as Manuel Acevedo, Javier Cambre, [[Nayda Collazo-Llorens]], and Carlos Rivera Villafañe, it was their multi-media and site-specific installations that expanded on the "nontraditional modes begun in earlier generations, by artists such as [[Rafael Ferrer (artist)|Rafael Ferrer]] and [[Rafael Montañez Ortiz]], and then [[Antonio Martorell]], José Morales, [[Pepón Osorio]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Cullen, “Here and There: Six Artists from San Juan” in Here &amp; There / Aquí y allá (New York: El Museo del Barrio, 2001), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Beatriz Santiago Muñoz]].

[[File:Saddle stitch stapler.svg|thumb|200px|right|A saddle stitch stapler]]

'''Saddle stitch staplers''' or simply '''saddle [[stapler]]s''' are [[bookbinding]] [[tool]]s designed to insert [[Staple (fastener)|staple]]s into the spine (saddle) of folded printed matter such as [[book]]lets, [[mail order|catalogues]], [[brochure]]s, and [[owners manual|manuals]]. They are distinguished by their unusual length (most traditional staplers are too short to staple booklets easily) and by the presence of a V-shaped hump or "saddle" which is used to precisely align the central fold of the material to be stapled.

A saddle stapler may also be used to staple fabric or other flexible material, as the material is bunched up inside the throat in order to reach the seam to be stapled. Most high-end [[Photocopying|photocopiers]] and digital production [[Computer printer|printers]] on the market have optional attached saddle stitch units that fold and staple booklets automatically.

'''The San Francisco Center for the Book (SFCB)''' is a [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1996 by Mary Austin and Kathleen Burch in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Karen Zuercher, [http://www.sfweekly.com/content/printVersion/321958/ "X and Why: The San Francisco Center for the Book at 10"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020044243/http://www.sfweekly.com/content/printVersion/321958/ |date=2012-10-20 }}, ''[[SF Weekly]]'', August 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first center of its kind on the West Coast, SFCB was modeled after two similar organizations, The [[Center for Book Arts]] in [[New York City]] and the [[Minnesota Center for Book Arts]] in [[Minneapolis]].

In their mission statement, SFCB is declared as "a center of inspiration for the book arts world, featuring the art &amp; craft of letterpress printing, bookbinding, and artists' book making."

Currently, SFCB offers over 300 workshops and 44 free events a year. In addition to workshops and events, they have a thriving exhibition program, Small Plates program, and collaborate with many local nonprofits, museums, and libraries. They also host special visits and hands-on demonstrations for students of all ages, teachers, librarians, corporate team building, collectors, visiting printers, artists, writers, and designers.&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Center for the Book. Web. 25 July 2011. &lt;http://sfcb.org&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The San Francisco Center for the Book was co-founded by Mary Austin and Kathleen Burch,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/S-F-Center-for-the-Book-brings-letterpress-alive-2997488.php "SF Center for the Book Brings Letterpress Alive", "[[SF Gate]]", February 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; who recognized a growing need in San Francisco and the Bay Area for a facility specifically designed and equipped for the book arts. The first center of its kind on the West Coast, SFCB was incorporated in March 1996 as a 501(c)3 [[non-profit organization]]. The grand opening on July 30, 1996, attracted an overflow crowd of more than 400 people. From their first season, with 64 students in a dozen classes, they have grown to more than 300 classes and nearly 2,000 per year. In early 2013, they moved to a {{convert|6385|sqft|m2|adj=on}} space, including a large print studio, exhibition gallery, a platemaking lab, a separate bindery, and administrative offices.

==Workshops==
SFCB offers more than 300 workshops each year in three broad categories: Printing, Binding, and Related Arts. Registration begins as soon as each trimester's workshops are announced, and continues throughout the trimester. Students are encouraged to register early, as class size is limited and workshops are filled on a first-come, first-served basis.[http://sfcb.org/workshops]

==Events==
The San Francisco Center for the Book offers a wealth of public programs, many of which are free. Events create opportunities for the community to cultivate ties with professional and amateur book artists, writers and scholars; share the pleasures of letterpress printing, bookbinding, letterforms and artists' books with a broader audience; and create an exciting dialogue between makers, collectors, and connoisseurs.

'''Roadworks: A Steamroller Printing Festival''' is a day-long annual street fair hosted by SFCB showcasing printmaking and the art of the book. Using seven-ton and 12-ton antique steamrollers, a team of artists and printers print large-scale linoleum carved block prints. In addition to the steamroller printing centerpiece, there are artists, vendors, and organizations presenting an assortment of fine and affordable wares. In 2016, Roadworks attracted more than 3,000 attendees. [http://sfcb.org/events/roadworks]

==Exhibitions==
SFCB has mounted over 70 book arts related exhibitions in the Austin Burch Gallery since its inception in 2006, ranging from group works to individual retrospectives and featuring local, nation, and international book artists. Named for the co-founders Mary Austin and Kathleen Burch, this {{convert|1400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} exhibition space is adjacent to the print and bindery studios, creating the perfect environment for visitors to see both works in progress and fully realized art work. They have also presented exhibitions at off-site venues including the [[Commonwealth Club of California|Commonwealth Club]], [[ODC/Dance]] at Project Artaud, and the Marin Community Center.

In 2010, they hosted Restless Dust: A Ghost Walk with Darwin and Los Angeles Loteria: An Exploration of Identity. 2011 brought the exhibition Blankets Impressions: Brad Freeman, Clifton Meador, and the Offset Printed Artist's Book,''  profiling two nationally prominent book artists whose work is rarely seen on the West Coast. SFCB's 15th Anniversary Exhibition opened on September 15, 2011.

The first exhibition of 2012 was "Paper Space: [[Kota Ezawa]]," with work by 2011 Imprint Artist in Residence Kota Ezawa, coinciding with an exhibition of new work by the artist at Haines Gallery, San Francisco. "Left to Chance: The Accidental Book Art," curated by Hanna Regev, opens February 17, 2012.

==Community==
As a non-profit organization, SFCB has maintained an essential role in providing for the local arts community. It offers a number of volunteering opportunities year-round as well as internships, and has maintained a book arts youth education program since 1996. Field trips focus primarily on providing workshops for K-12 and college students, adults, and classroom teachers. They also offer half and full day corporate activity workshops. The facility serves as a venue for the activities of other book arts organizations in the Bay Area, including the Pacific Center for the Book Arts and The Hand Bookbinders of California.

==Imprint Publications==
The Imprint of SFCB is the publishing arm of the San Francisco Center for the Book, and a home for a selected group of artists to learn the art and craft of the handmade book. The Imprint facilitates SFCB's mission of promoting the traditional book arts alongside exploration of experimental forms and techniques through two ongoing letterpress-based projects: the Artist in Residence Program and the Small Plates Edition Series.

'''Artist in Residence Program'''
The Imprint of the SFCB's Artist in Residence Program was initiated in 2005. The program provides emerging and established artists with technical and studio support to create handmade limited-edition books. Participants are chosen from a creative community of San Francisco Bay Area artists ranging from those in the fine arts and multi-media to photographers, poets and writers. The goal of the Artist in Residency is to raise awareness of book arts as a vital genre in contemporary art, to bring fresh perspectives to the field, and to support artists in their vocation. Residency artists share their skills, processes and perspective through public lectures, workshops and by welcoming volunteer participation in the production of their editions which are printed and bound at the SFCB. The Residency hosts one artist (or artist team) per year, and concludes in December with a signed and numbered artist's book project issued in trade edition and deluxe edition versions. The artist-in-residency program is made possible through book sales, donations and artist sponsorships.[http://sfcb.org/imprint]
Past Artists in Residence include: Michael Bartalos, Nora Pauwels and John DeMerritt, [[Amy Franceshini]] and [[Michael Swaine (artist)|Michael Swaine]], Kota Ezawa, [[Gail Wight]], [[Ala Ebtekar]], and Nigel Poor. 
SFCB's 2012 Imprint Artist in Residence is Paolo Salvagione.

'''Small Plates Edition Series'''
Small Plates is a series of 4" square letterpress-printed books issued in editions of 100 signed and numbered copies each. Released on a periodic basis, these editions feature creative interplay between word, image and book structure. Invited participants range from emerging to established artists, including at least one Bay Area art student per year. Small Plates book production is a collaborative process that was designed to benefit the artist, the SFCB and the wider community. The program is made possible through book sales, donations and artist sponsorships.[http://sfcb.org/imprint]

==Facilities==
SFCB offers daytime Studio Rental (Monday-Friday 10am-5pm) and evening Open Print Studio (designed evenings 5-10pm) for those who qualify. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110903064019/http://sfcb.org/facilities]

[[File:Coptic flat.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Modern model of [[Coptic binding]] with eight sections]]
[[File:Grecquage.jpg|thumb|Twelve gatherings can be seen in this spine-side view of a book being bound]] 

In [[bookbinding]], a '''section''', '''gathering''', or '''signature''' refers to a group of sheets, folded in the middle, and bound into the binding together.      

The section is the basic building block of codex bindings.  In Western bookbinding, sections are sewn through their folds, with the sewing thread linking each section to its neighboring sections.

The gatherings can be seen by looking at the top or bottom sides of the book, though cheaper modern books are [[perfect bound]] with no gatherings, gluing each sheet directly to the binding. The gatherings are sewn into the binding and the middle sheet of each gathering will have two or more short stretches of thread visible at the central fold.

In medieval manuscripts a gathering, or quire, was most often formed of 4 folded sheets of [[vellum]] or [[parchment]], i.e. 8 leaves, 16 sides. The term "quaternion" (or sometimes ''quaternum'') designates such a unit. A gathering made of a single folded sheet (i.e. 2 leaves, 4 sides) is a "bifolium" (plural "bifolia"); a "binion" is a quire of two sheets (i.e. 4 leaves, 8 sides); and a "quinion" is five sheets (10 leaves, 20 sides). This last meaning is preserved in the modern Italian meaning of quire, ''quinterno di carta''.  Later, when bookmaking switched to using paper and it became possible to easily stitch 5 to 7 sheets at a time, the number of sheets and pages in a gathering became more variable.

'''''The Adoration of the Kings''''' is a large [[panel painting|oil-on-oak]] painting by [[Jan Gossaert]] (born Jean Gossart, also known as Jan Mabuse), dated to 1510–15, depicting the [[Adoration of the Magi]].  Although Gossaert's name is signed on the border of [[Biblical Magi#Names|Balthazar]]'s richly embroidered headdress, and on a collar worn by Balthazar's turbaned attendant, the painting was occasionally attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer]] in the 17th and 18th centuries.  In 2010, Ainsworth suggested that the work was a collaboration between Gossaert and [[Gerard David]].

==Painting==
In the centre of the painting, the [[Madonna and child]] sit in the ruins of a building, receiving a gift from the kneeling [[Biblical Magi#Names|Caspar]] to the right; the Christ-child holds a gold coin in his left hand, almost as if he were offering Caspar a [[communion wafer]].  Six shepherds, an ass and a cow watch from behind, with a grey-bearded [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] – depicted in a bright red robe, contrasting with Mary's traditional garb of deep blue – standing behind a column to the left.  More shepherds and their flock are barely visible in the distance.

To the right of Caspar stands [[Biblical Magi#Names|Melchior]] holding aloft his gift, accompanied by four attendants, with more attendants approaching from the distance on horseback.  Balthazar stands to the left with his gift and three attendants.  Balthazar's richly decorated crown is inscribed with his name at its peak and Gossaert's name towards the bottom; Gossaert's name also appears on a collar worn by Balthazar's turbaned black attendant.  Further left, two more attendants in exotic dress watch from a window.

Nine angels (perhaps representing the [[Christian angelic hierarchy|nine orders of angels]]) look down through the structure of the ruined building, one holding a scroll bearing the words "[[Gloria in excelsis deo|Gloria in excelcis deo]]".  A bird – symbolising the [[Holy Spirit]] – hovers above, while the [[Star of Bethlehem]] shines brightly at the top of the painting.  Several babies appear as decorative details, in the architectural frieze and the capitals, and on the golden vessel for Balthazar's gift.  A tenth angel – possibly a self-portrait of Gossaert – is barely visible, in a doorway behind the ox.

==Technical details and composition==
The work was painted on a wooden panel consisting of six oak boards, laid vertically, measuring {{convert|177.2|cm|in}} high by {{convert|161.8|cm|in}} wide.  The paint was applied to a ground of chalk fixed with animal glue, with a thin [[primer (paint)|priming]] layer of [[lead white]] mixed with a little [[lead-tin-yellow]].  There is much [[underdrawing]], visible in some areas due to the paint having become more transparent.  A number of details were added at a late stage, over areas previously painted, including the two figures at the window to the left; the ox and the ass; the two shepherds behind the ass and the shepherds in the distance; Joseph's stick; Caspar's sceptre and the lid of Caspar's goblet.

Gossaert's composition draws from several sources.  It takes its main inspiration from the [[Monforte altarpiece]] by [[Hugo van der Goes]] (Gemäldegalerie, [[Staatliche Museen]], Berlin), which has a similar grouping of richly dressed Mary and [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] among ruined architecture, with their attendants and bystanders, and glimpses of the landscape behind and angels above.  The two dogs in the foreground, on a floor with many broken tiles, are copied from other engravings: one taken from the lower right corner of Dürer's engraving of [[Saint Eustace]] and the second is a reflection of the dog in an engraving of the "Adoration of the Kings" by [[Martin Schongauer]].  Other elements are drawn from other prints by Schongauer and Dürer.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==History==
The origins of the painting are unclear.  It may have been commissioned by [[David of Burgundy]], [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580)|Bishop of Utrecht]] from 1456 to 1496, or his half-brother, [[Philip of Burgundy (bishop)|Philip of Burgundy]], who was Bishop from 1517 to 1524. Lorne Campbell argues that the painting was commissioned by [[Daniel van Boechout]], Lord of Boerlare and Beverweerd, as the altarpiece of the [[Lady Chapel]] of the [[Benedictine]] Abbey of St Adrian in [[Geraardsbergen]], in East Flanders, south of Ghent and west of Brussels, where it first enters the historical record in 1600. It was bought by the rulers of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]], in 1601, who had seen it at the abbey the previous year.  They paid £2,100 to the abbot, and moved the painting to become the altar of the chapel of their palace in Brussels.  The palace was destroyed by a fire in February 1731, but the chapel and its contents survived.  The chapel was demolished in the 1770s, but the painting had already been removed by the Governor of the [[Austrian Netherlands]], [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]]. It was sold after Charles' death in 1781 to Emmanuel-Marie de Cock, [[Pensionary]] of Brussels and Greffier-Pensionary of the [[States of Brabant]].

A painting matching its description came to London in 1787 and was sold at an auction held in London by [[John Greenwood (artist)|John Greenwood]] the following year. It came into the possession of art dealer [[Michael Bryan (art historian)|Michael Bryan]] by 1795, and was sold to [[Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle]], who displayed it at [[Castle Howard]]. It was restored in 1884 by William Morrill, and then moved to [[Naworth Castle]].

[[George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle]] served as a Trustee of the [[National Gallery]] for more than 30 years, and offered to sell the painting to the National Gallery shortly before his death in 1911.  His widow honoured his wishes, and the painting was bought by the gallery later in 1911.  The £40,000 purchase price was funded by an advance of the gallery's annual purchase grant and other gallery funds, with contributions from [[The Art Fund]], [[Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner]], [[Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh]], [[Alfred de Rothschild]], and [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Curzon, Earl (later Marquess) Curzon of Kedleston]].  The gallery published a monograph by [[Maurice W. Brockwell]] to commemorate the acquisition – the first such publication by the gallery.

Copies are held by the [[Museo Nacional de San Carlos]] in Mexico City, the [[Wittelsbacher Ausgleichfonds]] in Munich, the church of St John the Baptist in Nethen, the [[National Gallery in Prague]], and the [[Tula Art Museum]].

'''''The Dream''''' (French: ''Le Rêve'', occasionally also known as ''Le Songe'' or ''Rêve exotique'') is a large [[oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] painting created by [[Henri Rousseau]] in 1910, one of more than 25 Rousseau paintings with a jungle theme.  His last completed work, it was first exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] from 18 March to 1 May 1910, a few months before his death on 2 September 1910.  Rousseau's earlier works had received a negative reception, but poet and critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] remarked on its debut: "The picture radiates beauty, that is indisputable. I believe nobody will laugh this year."

''The Dream'' is the largest of the jungle paintings, measuring 6' 8½" x 9' 9½"  (204.5 x 298.5&amp;nbsp;cm).  It features an almost [[surrealism|surreal]] portrait of Yadwigha (Jadwiga), Rousseau's Polish mistress from his youth, lying naked on a divan to the left of the painting, gazing over a landscape of lush jungle foliage, including [[lotus flower]]s, and animals including birds, monkeys, an elephant, a lion and lioness, and a snake.  The stylised forms of the jungle plants are based on Rousseau's observations at the [[Paris Museum of Natural History]] and its [[Jardin des Plantes]].   The nude's left arm reaches towards the lions and a black [[snake charmer]] who faces the viewer playing his flute, barely visible in the gloom of the jungle under the dim light of the full moon.  A pink-bellied snake slithers through the undergrowth, its sinuous form reflecting the curves of the woman's hips and leg.

Suspecting that some viewers did not understand the painting, Rousseau wrote a poem to accompany it, ''Inscription pour La Rêve'':
{{verse translation|lang=fra|
Yadwigha dans un beau rêve
S'étant endormie doucement
Entendait les sons d'une musette
Dont jouait un charmeur bien pensant.
Pendant que la lune reflète
Sur les fleuves [or fleurs], les arbres verdoyants,
Les fauves serpents prêtent l'oreille
Aux airs gais de l'instrument.
|
Yadwigha in a beautiful dream
Having fallen gently to sleep
Heard the sounds of a [[Oboe musette|reed instrument]]
Played by a well-intentioned [snake] charmer.
As the moon reflected
On the rivers [or flowers], the verdant trees,
The wild snakes lend an ear
To the joyous tunes of the instrument.
}}

One possible interpretation of the painting, offered by Rousseau in a letter to art critic [[André Dupont]], is that it depicts a woman reclining on a couch in Paris, dreaming she is listening to a flute player in the jungle.

The subject of a reclining nude draws from a classical tradition, from [[Titian]]’s 1538 painting ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'' to [[Manet]]'s 1863 painting ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]''.  Rousseau may have taken some inspiration from [[Émile Zola]]’s novel ''[[Le Rêve (novel)|Le Rêve]]'', which deals with the love between a painter and an embroideress.  While he was painting ''The Dream'', Rousseau was romantically involved with a shop assistant, Leonie.

French art dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]] bought the painting from Rousseau in February 1910.  It was sold through Knoedler Galleries in New York to clothing manufacturer and art collector [[Sidney Janis]] in January 1934.  Janis sold the painting to [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] in 1954, who donated it to the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]] to celebrate the Museum's 25th anniversary.  It remains on display at MoMA.

[[File:The Falling Man.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''The Falling Man'']]

'''''The Falling Man''''' is a photograph taken by [[Associated Press]] photographer [[Richard Drew (photographer)|Richard Drew]] of a man falling from the [[One World Trade Center|North Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] at 9:41:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. during the [[September 11 attacks]] in [[New York City]]. The subject of the image, whose identity remains uncertain, was one of the people trapped on the upper floors of the skyscraper who either fell searching for safety or jumped to escape the fire and smoke.

The photograph gives the impression that the man is falling straight down; however, a series of photographs taken of his fall showed him to be tumbling through the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/photographer-behind-9-11-falling-man-retraces-steps-recalls-unknown-soldier.html|title=Photographer behind 9/11 "Falling Man" retraces steps, recalls "unknown soldier"|first=Joe|last=Pompeo|date=August 29, 2011|publisher=''[[Yahoo! News]]''|accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photographer has noted that, in at least two cases, newspaper stories commenting on the image have attracted a barrage of criticism from readers who found the image "disturbing.”&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Peter (2001).

==Background==
Of the nearly 3,000 people killed on 9/11, at least 200 people are believed to have fallen or jumped to their deaths, while other estimates say the number is half of that or fewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/10/nyregion/10jumpers.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first1=Kevin | last1=Flynn | first2=Jim | last2=Dwyer | title=Falling Bodies, a 9/11 Image Etched in Pain | date=September 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitworth |first=Melissa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/september-11-attacks/8737671/911-Jumpers-from-the-World-Trade-Center-still-provoke-impassioned-debate.html |title=9/11: 'Jumpers' from the World Trade Center still provoke impassioned debate |publisher=Telegraph |date= September 3, 2011|accessdate=December 13, 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;Cauchon, Dennis. [https://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2002-09-02-jumper_x.htm "Desperation forced a horrific decision"]. ''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials could not recover or identify the bodies of those forced out of the buildings prior to the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse of the towers]]. All deaths in the attacks except those of [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|the hijackers]] were ruled to be homicides due to [[blunt trauma]] (as opposed to suicides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leonard|first=Tom|title=The 9/11 victims America wants to forget: The 200 jumpers who flung themselves from the Twin Towers who have been 'airbrushed from history'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2035720/9-11-jumpers-America-wants-forget-victims-fell-Twin-Towers.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=September 9, 2013|location=London|date=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York|New York City medical examiner's office]] said it does not classify the people who fell to their deaths on September 11 as "[[jumper (suicide)|jumpers]]". According to Ellen Borakove, the examiner's office spokeswoman, "A 'jumper' is somebody who goes to the office in the morning knowing that they will commit suicide. These people were forced out by the smoke and flames or blown out."&lt;ref name=usatoday /&gt;

==Publication history==
The photograph initially appeared in newspapers around the world, including on page 7 of ''[[The New York Times]]'' on September 12, 2001. The photo's caption read, "A person falls headfirst after jumping from the north tower of the World Trade Center. It was a horrific sight that was repeated in the moments after the planes struck the towers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|title=Images of Terror|journal=Dissent|year=2009|pages=75–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared only once in the ''Times'' because of criticism and anger against its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/jumpers/ |title=The Encyclopedia of 9/11: Jumpers: Why the most haunting images of 2001 were hardly ever seen. |date=August 27, 2011 |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |author=Susie Linfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later, it appeared on page 1 of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' on May 27, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boutin |first=Maurice |editor=Arvin Sharma |year=2009 |chapter=The Current State of the Individual: A Meditation on "The Falling Man" |title=The World's Religions after September 11 |pages=3–9 |isbn=0-275-99621-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the subject of the man has never been officially confirmed. The large number of people trapped in the tower has made identifying the man in the 12 photos difficult. It is thought, though the number is uncertain, that at least 200 people fell to their deaths.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

Reporter [[Peter Cheney]]  suggested in the nationally distributed Canadian newspaper ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' that the man pictured in the photo may have been Norberto Hernandez, a [[pastry chef]] at [[Windows on the World]], a restaurant located on the 106th floor of the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]]. Some members of Hernandez's family agreed with Cheney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/incoming/the-life-and-death-of-norberto-hernandez/article4153194/|title=The life and death of Norberto Hernandez |first=Peter |last=Cheney |date=September 22, 2001 |publisher="[[The Globe and Mail]]"|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after examining the entire photo sequence and noting details of his clothing, were no longer convinced.&lt;ref name="JunodEsquire"&gt;{{cite web |last=Junod |first=Tom |publisher= Esquire Magazine| year=2003 |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0903-SEP_FALLINGMAN |title=The Falling Man }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jonathan Eric Briley===
"The Falling Man", an article about the photograph by American journalist [[Tom Junod]], was published in the September 2003 issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine. It was adapted into a documentary film by the same name. The article gave the possible identity of the falling man as Jonathan Briley, a 43-year-old audio technician for Windows on the World. Briley, a resident of [[Mount Vernon, New York]], was a [[sound engineer]]. His brother [[Alex Briley|Alex]] is an original member of the 1970s [[disco]] group [[Village People]]. Briley had [[asthma]] and would have known he was in danger when smoke began to pour into the restaurant.&lt;ref name="JunodEsquire"/&gt;

[[Michael Lomonaco]], the Executive Chef/Director at Windows on the World, also suggested that the man was Briley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/people/2023.html|title=Jonathan Briley|work=September 11: A Memorial|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briley was initially identified by his brother, Timothy.&lt;ref name="JunodEsquire" /&gt; Lomonaco could identify Briley by his clothes and his body type. In one of the pictures, the Falling Man's shirt or white jacket was blown open and up, revealing an orange t-shirt similar to one shirt that Briley often wore. Briley's older sister, Gwendolyn, originally helped in identifying the victim. She told reporters of ''[[Daily Mirror|The Sunday Mirror]]'', "When I first looked at the picture [...] and I saw it was a man—tall, slim—I said, 'If I didn't know any better, that could be Jonathan.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/911-the-image-of-the-falling-man-that-still-152974|title=9/11: The image of The Falling Man that still haunts 10 years on|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
''9/11: The Falling Man'' is a 2006 [[documentary film]] about the picture and the story behind it. It was made by American filmmaker [[Henry Singer]] and filmed by Richard Numeroff, a New York-based director of photography. The film is loosely based on Junod's ''Esquire'' story. It also drew its material from photographer [[Lyle Owerko]]'s pictures of falling people. It debuted on March 16, 2006, on the [[United Kingdom|British]] television network [[Channel 4]]. It later made its [[North America]]n premiere on [[Canada]]'s [[CBC Newsworld]] on September 6, 2006, and has been broadcast in more than 30 countries. The U.S. premiere was September 10, 2007, on the [[Discovery Times|Discovery Times Channel]].

The novel ''[[Falling Man (novel)|Falling Man]]'', by [[Don DeLillo]], is about the September 11 attacks. The "falling man" in the novel is a performance artist recreating the events of the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Matthew J. Morgan |last=Versluys |first=Kristiaan |chapter=9/11 in the Novel |title=The Impact of 9/11 on the Media, Arts, and Entertainment: The Day that Changed Everything? |volume=4 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pages=142–143 |isbn=978-0-230-60841-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLillo says he was unfamiliar with the title of the picture when he named his book. The artist straps himself into a harness and jumps from an elevated structure in a high visibility area (such as a highway overpass), hanging in the pose of ''The Falling Man''.

'''''The Historical Novel''''' is a 1924 book by [[Herbert Butterfield]]. It originated in an undergraduate essay and gained the Le Bas Prize for Butterfield. It was originally published by [[Cambridge University Press]], one of the conditions for the prize.

==Summary==
The work was Butterfield's first publication. It developed from the embryo of a paper, presented to the Peterhouse History Society in the Michaelmas term, which he then expanded.

It examines the relationship between the form of the [[Historical fiction#Historical novel|historical novel]] on the one hand and the formal study of history on the other. It explores the style of historical fictions, the way in which they engage with evidence (and how that differs from the orthodox [[historical method]]) and the extent to which such a form of writing affects mainstream historical scholarship itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Historical Novel|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/regional-and-world-history-general-interest/historical-novel-essay|website=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfield sees the historical novel as a form which is a kind of 'fusion' of other styles and approaches. In particular, he sees a potential in it for a form of historical empathy that can provide deep insights into the motivations behind the actions of historical protagonists such as [[Napoleon]]; it can also be used to marshall a sense of nationalistic or patriot feeling becoming, itself, a "maker of history" rather than merely a reflector or mirror of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Groot|first1=Jerome|title=The Historical Novel|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=113525320X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82avWVrVeukC&amp;pg=PT3&amp;lpg=PT3&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fq9dzFHgBi&amp;sig=VSrtwqcq63ddSQzblX0xd-Z_smw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ftXTU-HTH-zZ0QWA5YCgAQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its purposes, according to Butterfield, was to help us 'feel' a particular epoch of the past in ways in which traditional historical writing might not because of the different role and importance of the imagination in the case of the historical novel. Another important element of historical fiction for Butterfield was its role in bringing to light the existence of uncertainty in human affairs as lived by real people: the historian, in his view, tends to have a retrospective reach which draws out trajectories and processes over time, but the characters in a historical novel live as real human beings do, being only aware of probabilities and potential situations rather than knowing precisely where certain events and phenomena are headed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowenthal|first1=David|title=The Past is a Foreign Country|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521294800|pages=226–227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMqsAQZmv5IC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G9jTU_bFBcOV7AbymYFw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work did not display Butterfield's later detestation of the form of the historical novel; later on, moreover, he referred to the arguments in his first publication in disparaging terms, arguing that it was 'a bad book'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Michael|title=The Life and Thought of Herbert Butterfield: History, Science and God|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1139502859|pages=45–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1r2DMbwZegC&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sNbTU86WN8_H7AaE_ID4CA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Triumph1-Mantegna-picture-bearers.jpg|thumb|320px|''Picture Bearers'' (first canvas)]]
The '''''Triumphs of Caesar''''' are a series of nine large paintings created by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Andrea Mantegna]] between 1484 and 1492&lt;ref&gt;Great Works, ''The Triumphs of Caesar (1484-92)'' Tom Lubbock, ''The Independent'', 6 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] [[Ducal Palace, Mantua]]. They depict a triumphal military parade celebrating the victory of [[Julius Caesar]] in the [[Gallic Wars]]. Acknowledged from the time of Mantegna as his greatest masterpiece, they remain the most complete pictorial representation of a [[Roman triumph]] ever attempted and together they form the world's largest metric area of Italian Renaissance paintings outside Italy. Acquired by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1629, they now form part of the [[Royal Collection]] at [[Hampton Court Palace]] near London, where they occupy a special gallery, with a new continuous frame intended to capture their original setting, mounted into panelling.

Originally painted in the fragile medium of egg and glue [[tempera]] on canvas, the paintings underwent successive repaintings and restorations through the centuries, and are damaged in many areas.  Each canvas measures 2.66 x 2.78&amp;nbsp;m. In total they cover an area more than 70 metres square.

== Subject ==
The series depicts Caesar on a triumphal chariot returning from his successful campaigns, in a procession of Roman soldiers, standard-bearers, musicians and the spoils of war including an assortment of booty (including arms, intricate sculpture and gold vases), exotic animals and captives. These paintings celebrate two of [[Julius Caesar]]'s greatest campaigns – his victory over the [[Gauls]] and the recovery of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Mantegna was inspired by written accounts of Caesar's celebratory processions through Rome as well as Roman antiquities in the Duke's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|1979|p=17,125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio Vasari]] described them as follows: "We can see grouped and cleverly arranged in the Triumph the ornate and beautiful chariot, the figure of a man cursing the victorious hero, the victor's relations, the perfumes, incense and sacrifices, the priests, the bulls crowned for sacrifice, the prisoners, the booty captured by the troops, the rank of the squadrons, the elephants, the spoils, the victories and the cities represented in various chariots, along with a mass of trophies on spears, and with helmets and armour, headgear of all kinds, ornaments and countless pieces of plate." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vasari|1965|pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ''Triumphs of Caesar'' were initially painted during 1484&amp;ndash;92&lt;ref&gt;Great Works, ''The Triumphs of Caesar (1484-92)'' Tom Lubbock,  ''The Independent'', 6 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[ducal Palace, Mantua|Ducal Palace]] in [[Mantua]], commissioned by either the Duke [[Federico I Gonzaga]] or, more likely, his son [[Francesco II Gonzaga|Francesco II]].
[[File:Triunphus Caesaris plate 6 - Andreani.jpg|thumb|One of a set of coloured [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s with added [[gouache]], among the finest in the technique, by [[Andrea Andreani]], 1598/99]]

The Gonzaga dynasty died out in the male line, and the major part of their painting collection was acquired by [[Charles I of England]] in 1629, using as an agent in Italy, the courtier [[Daniel Nys]]. The collection also included works by [[Titian]], [[Raphael]] and [[Caravaggio]]. The ''Triumphs'' arrived in 1630 at Hampton Court Palace, where they have remained ever since. The Lower [[Orangery]] was originally built to house [[Mary II of England]]'s larger tender plants. It was chosen as a setting for the series, since it re-creates the interior of the ''Palace of San Sebastiano'' in [[Mantua]], [[Italy]], where the paintings were hung from 1506 in a specially built gallery.  The paintings are displayed as a continuous [[frieze]], separated by small columns.

After the execution of Charles I in 1649, the ''Triumphs'' were listed in an inventory and valued at 1,000 pounds ({{Inflation|UK|1000|1649|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-4}});{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} the entire Gonzaga acquisition cost 25,000 pounds ({{Inflation|UK|25000|1629|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-4}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} [[Oliver Cromwell]] refrained from selling these paintings, almost alone among Charles's collection, due to their fame, and perhaps as they celebrated a general like himself rather than a monarch or Catholic religious theme.

==Reception and influence==
[[File:Rubens-roman-triumph.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Rubens]], c 1630: ''A Roman Triumph'', [[National Gallery]], [[London]]]]
The ''Triumphs of Caesar'' were described as "the best thing Mantegna ever painted" by [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his celebrated ''[[Lives of the Artists]]''.
They rapidly became extremely famous throughout Europe, principally through copies in [[old master print|print]] form, of which many different versions were made, starting with a contemporary set from Mantegna's own workshop. Between 1517 and 1519, [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], using prints, painted a copy of the work on nine exterior panels of the Hertenstein House in [[Lucerne]], now demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bätschmann|Griener|1997|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Aspertini]] (1558&amp;ndash;1629) made prints of the paintings in Mantua.

==Early C20 restoration==
The painter and critic [[Roger Fry]] undertook a restoration of ''The Picture Bearers'' starting in 1910. This was approved by [[Lionel Cust]], Keeper of the King's Pictures. Fry removed what [[Louis Laguerre]] had done a century before, and worked on and off for eleven years, with assistance from [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Dora Carrington]], to repaint parts of the canvas. The art historian [[Frances Spalding]] holds that Fry made many poor artistic and technical decisions, "and, worst of all, they changed the Negro standard bearer into a Caucasian". Fry did not attempt to restore any of the other paintings in the series, and said in 1925 that ''The Picture Bearers'' was "one of [his] maddest follies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spalding|first1=Frances|title=Roger Fry : art and life|date=1980|publisher=Univ. of California press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520041264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s restoration==
The paintings had so deteriorated that visitors in the 19th century deplored their condition. In the 1960s a careful restoration to reveal the original paintwork was conducted on all but the seventh canvas, where no trace had been left by previous restorers. Although now mere shadows of Mantegna's [[cinquecento]] paintings, they still convey a powerful impression of epic grandeur.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elam|2008|page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Anthony Blunt]], who as [[Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures]] supervised the restoration, "The ''Triumphs'' may be a ruin but it is a noble one, one as noble as those of ancient Rome which Mantegna so deeply admired."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|1978|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art critic Tom Lubbock, writing about the restored paintings called pictures " the epitome of Renaissance art in the service of state power – they carry a powerful sense of inexorable procession – impressing the viewer with the inexhaustible quantity of available power and plunder." &lt;ref&gt;Great Works, ''The Triumphs of Caesar (1484-92)'' Tom Lubbock,  The Independent, 6 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is now displayed to the public under low level electric light for conservation reasons.

Copies of the paintings were made in the early 17th century by [[Ludovico Dondi]].

|'''Canvas III''': ''Bearers of trophies and bullion''
|
|
|
|-
|Trophies of captured weapons
|On the second [day] was carried in a great many wagons the finest and richest armour of the Macedonians, both of brass and steel, all newly polished and glittering the pieces of which were piled up and arranged purposely with the greatest art, so as to seem to be tumbled in heaps carelessly and by chance: helmets were thrown upon shields, coats of mail upon greaves; Cretan targets, and Thracian bucklers and quivers of arrows, lay huddled amongst horses' bits, and through these there appeared the points of naked swords, intermixed with long Macedonian sarissas. 
|
|
|-
|Bearers of booty and coins
|After these wagons loaded with armour there followed three thousand men who carried the silver that was coined, in seven hundred and fifty vessels, each of which weighed three talents, and was carried by four men.
|then gold and silver coin and bullion, and whatever else they had captured of that kind
|
|-
|'''Canvas IV''': ''Vase bearers''
|
|
|
|-
|Bearers of booty and crowns
|Others brought silver bowls and goblets and cups, all disposed in such order as to make the best show, and all curious as well for their size as the solidity of their embossed work. 
|then came the crowns that had been given to the general as a reward for his bravery by cities, by allies, or by the army itself.
|
|-
|White oxen
|
|White oxen came next, ...

|'''Canvas V''': ''Elephants''
|
|
|
|-
|Trumpeters, white oxen
|On the third day, early in the morning, first came the trumpeters, who did not sound as they were wont in a procession or solemn entry, but such a charge as the Romans use when they encourage the soldiers to fight. Next followed young men wearing frocks with ornamented borders, who led to the sacrifice a hundred and twenty stalled oxen, with their horns gilded, and their heads adorned with ribbons and garlands; and with these were boys that carried basins for libation, of silver and gold. 
|
|
|-
|Elephants with candelabras
|
|and after them elephants
|and he mounted the Capitol by torchlight, with forty elephants bearing lamps on his right and his left.
|-
|'''Canvas VI''': ''Corselet bearers''
|
|
|
|-
|Bearers of booty and coins, trophies of arms
|After this was brought the gold coin, which was divided into vessels that weighed three talents, like those that contained the silver; they were in number seventy-seven. These were followed by those that brought the consecrated bowl which Aemilius had caused to be made, that weighed ten talents, and was set with precious stones. Then were exposed to view the cups of Antigonus and Seleucus, and those of the Thericlean make, and all the gold plate that was used at Perseus's table. Next to these came Perseus's chariot, in which his armour was placed, and on that his diadem. 
|
|
|-
|'''Canvas VII''': ''Captives''
|
|
|
|-
|Captives, buffoons
|And, after a little intermission, the king's children were led captives, and with them a train of their attendants, masters, and teachers, all shedding tears, and stretching out hands to the spectators, and making the children themselves also beg and entreat their compassion. There were two sons and a daughter, whose tender age made them but little sensible of the greatness of their misery, which very insensibility of their condition rendered it the more deplorable; insomuch that Perseus himself was scarcely regarded as he went along, whilst pity fixed the eyes of the Romans upon the infants; and many of them could not forbear tears, and all beheld the sight with a mixture of sorrow and pleasure, until the children were passed. 
|
|
|-
|'''Canvas VIII''': ''Musicians''
|
|
|
|-
|Musicians
|
|Lietors clad in purple tunics preceded the general; also a chorus of musicians and pipers, in imitation of an Etruscan procession, wearing belts and golden crowns, and they march evenly with song and dance. They call themselves Lydi because, as I think, the Etruscans were a Lydian colony. One of these, in the middle of the procession, wearing a purple cloak and golden bracelets and necklace, caused laughter by making various gesticulations, as though he were insulting the enemy.
|
|-
|[[Signifer]]s
|After these were carried four hundred crowns, all made of gold, sent from the cities by their respective deputations to Aemilius, in honour of his victory. 
|Next came incense bearers.
|
|-
|'''Canvas IX''': ''Julius Caesar''
|
|
|
|-
|Caesar in his chariot
|Then he himself came, seated on a chariot magnificently adorned (a man well worthy to be looked at, even without these ensigns of power), dressed in a robe of purple, interwoven with gold, and holding a laurel branch in his right hand. 
|... and after them the general himself on a chariot embellished with various designs, wearing a crown of gold and precious stones, and dressed, according to the fashion of the country, in a purple toga embroidered with golden stars. He bore a sceptre of ivory, and a laurel branch, which is always the Roman symbol of victory. Riding in the same chariot with him were boys and girls, and on horses on either side of him young men, his own relatives. Then followed those who had served him in the war as secretaries, aids, and armor-bearers.
|In his Pontic triumph he displayed among the show-pieces of the procession an inscription of but three words, "I came, I saw, I conquered" - ''[[Veni, vidi, vici]]''
|-
|'''Engraving''': ''Senators''
|
|
|
|-
|Senators
|All the army, in like manner, with boughs of laurel in their hands, divided into their hands and companies, followed the chariot of their commander; some singing verses, according to the usual custom, mingled with raillery; others, songs of triumph and the praise of Aemilius's deeds.
|After these came the army arranged in companies and cohorts, all of them crowned and carrying laurel branches, the bravest of them bearing their military prizes. They praised some of their captains, derided others, and reproached others; for in a triumph everybody is free, and is allowed to say what he pleases.

Websites devoted exclusively to pre-screened professional voice over talent are servicing international clients often faster and cheaper than the traditional casting process of voice talent physically being required to be in a studio.
